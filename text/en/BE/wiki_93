<text>Professor Bernard Quatermass is a fictional scientist originally created by writer Nigel Kneale for BBC Television. An intelligent and highly moral British scientist, Quatermass is a pioneer of the British space programme, heading the British Experimental Rocket Group. He continually finds himself confronting sinister alien forces that threaten to destroy humanity.

The role of Quatermass was featured in three influential BBC science fiction serials of the 1950s, and again in a final serial for Thames Television in 1979. A remake of the first serial appeared on BBC Four in 2005. The character also appeared in films, on the radio and in print over a fifty-year period. Kneale picked the character&#x27;s unusual surname from a London telephone directory, while the first name was in honour of the astronomer Bernard Lovell.

The character of Quatermass has been described by BBC News Online as Britain&#x27;s first television hero, and by &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper as &quot;a brilliantly conceived and finely crafted creation... [He] remained a modern &#x27;Mr Standfast&#x27;, the one fixed point in an increasingly dreadful and ever-shifting universe&quot;. In 2005, an article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that the character shares other elements from other British heroes such as Sherlock Holmes

==Character==
Little is revealed of Quatermass&#x27;s early life during the course of the films and television series in which he appears. In &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, he at one point despairs that he should have stuck to his original career as a surveyor.

In Nigel Kneale&#x27;s 1996 radio serial &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot;, it is revealed that the Professor was first involved in rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and that his wife died young. The unmade prequel serial &quot;Quatermass in the Third Reich&quot;, an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and becoming involved with Wernher von Braun and the German rocket programme, before helping a young Jewish refugee to escape from the country. According to &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot;, during World War II Quatermass conducted top secret work for the British war effort, which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.

By 1953 (in &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;), Quatermass is the head of the British Experimental Rocket Group, which has a programme to launch a crewed rocket into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in London. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains; it transpires that he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.

Despite this trauma, Quatermass continues with his space programme, now called the British Rocket Group, and by &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955) is actively planning the establishment of Moon bases. In this serial, his daughter, Paula Quatermass, works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, but there is no sign of a wife or other children. In the fourth episode of the serial he mentions that he never reached his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, tying in with &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; later assertion of his wife&#x27;s early death.

At the beginning of the third serial, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59), Quatermass&#x27;s funding is being cut and the Rocket Group is being handed over to military control, much to his disgust. Command is to be handed over to Colonel Breen, and Quatermass senses that he is being forced out: however, after the events of the serial, Breen is dead, Quatermass has helped to save the world and London is recovering from chaos.

It is not clear what happens to the Rocket Group immediately after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (&quot;Quatermass&quot;, also released internationally as &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; and &quot;Quatermass IV&quot;, 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world&#x27;s youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie&#x27;s help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.

==History==
Nigel Kneale conceived the character of Quatermass in 1953, when he was assigned in his capacity as a BBC television staff drama writer to create a new six-part serial to run on Saturday nights in July and August. Kneale initially named his leading character Professor Charlton, but during the writing process decided he wanted something more striking and memorable.

A native of the Isle of Man, Kneale was inspired by the fact that surnames beginning with &quot;Qu&quot; were common on the island. The eventual name was picked from a London telephone directory; there was a family by that name who traded as fruiterers in the city&#x27;s East End. The surname has its origins as a measurement of land assigned in the division of England by the Normans following their conquest of the country under William the Conqueror in 1066. The Professor&#x27;s first name, Bernard, was in honour of the astronomer Bernard Lovell, founder of the Jodrell Bank observatory.

===On television (1950s)===

The director assigned to the serial, which was eventually named &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, was Rudolph Cartier. A few months beforehand he had directed a play entitled &quot;It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer&quot; for the BBC, and he offered the role of Quatermass to one of the stars of that play, André Morell. Morell considered the offer but declined the part, which Cartier then offered to Reginald Tate, another actor who had appeared in the play, who accepted.

The serial was a success, with the British Film Institute later describing it as &quot;one of the most influential series of the 1950s&quot;. The following year the BBC&#x27;s Controller of Programmes, Cecil McGivern—who had initially feared that viewers would not accept such an unusual name for the leading character—noted in reference to the impending launch of the rival ITV network that: &quot;Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;] lasted. We are going to need &quot;many&quot; more &#x27;Quatermass Experiment&#x27; programmes&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, was accordingly commissioned in 1955, but Reginald Tate died of a heart attack only a month before production was due to begin. With very little time to find a replacement, John Robinson was picked as the only suitable actor available. Robinson was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate and with some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver, and his performance has been criticised as &quot;robotic&quot;, although others such as Andrew Pixley in &quot;Time Screen Magazine&quot; have praised Robinson for doing compelling work after the initial episode of the serial.

By the summer of 1957, Kneale was working on the scripts for a third and final BBC serial. Titled &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; and again produced and directed by Cartier, this was eventually broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. John Robinson was no longer available to play Quatermass, so the role was offered instead to Alec Clunes. Clunes turned down the part, and it was offered once more to André Morell, who this time accepted. Morell has been praised by several reviewers as having given the definitive portrayal of Quatermass. The serial itself has been praised by the BBC&#x27;s own website as &quot;simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made. It justifies licence fees to this day&quot;. Despite this success, Kneale was unsure about whether the character would ever return, later telling an interviewer: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed to me to be quite enough&quot;.

Of the TV serials, &quot;Quatermass II&quot; and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; have been preserved in full. Only the first two episodes of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; now exist.

===In films===
At roughly the same time as &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was being transmitted by the BBC, Hammer Film Productions released its film adaptation of the first serial in British cinemas. Directed by Val Guest, it was retitled &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; to capitalise on the British &quot;X&quot; classification and starred American actor Brian Donlevy as part of a deal to help the film find US distribution. Kneale, who had little involvement with the film, was unimpressed with this casting: &quot;I may have picked Quatermass&#x27;s surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind&quot;. Val Guest has praised Donlevy&#x27;s performance, saying that &quot;he gave it absolute reality&quot;.

Despite Kneale&#x27;s reservations about the casting, &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; was the highest-grossing film Hammer had made up to that point in its history, and has since been described by one academic as &quot;the key British science fiction film of the 1950s&quot;. Hammer was keen to make an immediate follow-up, and wanted to use Quatermass in its 1956 film &quot;X the Unknown&quot;, but Kneale refused Hammer the rights, and the company created its own substitute character, Doctor Adam Royston. Hammer did release an adaptation of &quot;Quatermass II&quot; in 1957, called &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; and this time with Kneale&#x27;s involvement in the script. To the writer&#x27;s displeasure, Donlevy returned as Quatermass.

Hammer also purchased the film rights to &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Five Million Years to Earth&quot;), as it had done with the previous two TV serials, although it did not release its version until 1967. This time the film was directed by Roy Ward Baker and starred Scottish actor Andrew Keir, after Morell had been offered and declined the chance to play the part again. Keir&#x27;s performance was well-received, particularly in contrast to Donlevy&#x27;s portrayal. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper wrote in 1997 that: &quot;Keir also made many films... most gratifyingly, perhaps, the movie version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967), when he finally replaced the absurdly miscast Brian Donlevy&quot;.

Soon after the release of the &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; film, Kneale was approached by Hammer about writing a fourth Quatermass story directly for them, but the idea came to nothing.

Possible remakes of one or more of the Hammer film adaptations were also mooted at various points during the 1990s, with Dan O&#x27;Bannon scripting a potential new version of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; in 1993, but again nothing was eventually filmed. In February 2012 Simon Oakes, president of the revived Hammer Films, announced a new Quatermass film, but nothing came of the project after his announcement.

===On television (1970s onwards)===

By the early 1970s Kneale was once again regularly writing for the BBC, which announced plans to produce a fourth &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial in 1972. This ultimately was not made by the BBC, but Kneale&#x27;s scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television, titled &quot;Quatermass&quot;. This time John Mills played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company Euston Films also released a 100-minute film version titled &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; or &quot;Quatermass IV&quot;, for distribution abroad. There was, however, little interest among film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.

Kneale was not keen to return to the character following this, telling one interviewer: &quot;I blew him up... and I don&#x27;t feel inclined to invent a &#x27;Son of Quatermass&#x27; either&quot;. However, in the late 1990s he conceived an idea for a prequel serial, entitled &quot;Quatermass in the Third Reich&quot;, set in Germany in the 1930s. The idea was submitted to the BBC, which turned it down.
In 2005, the digital television channel BBC Four produced a new version of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, transmitted live as the original had been. Jason Flemyng starred as Quatermass. &quot;The Times&quot;″s television reviewer, Sarah Vine, commented of this production: &quot;Jason Flemyng as Quatermass made a surprisingly good fist of things... the live performance lent the drama an edge that might have been lost in re-takes&quot;.

==In other media==
In addition to the character&#x27;s various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen in a variety of other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from 5 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.

A script book for &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, including some photographs from the production, was released by Penguin Books in 1959. This was followed by similar releases of &quot;Quatermass II&quot; and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, both published in 1960. All three of these releases were reprinted by Arrow Books in 1979 with new introductions by Kneale, to tie-in with the television transmission of the fourth and final serial.

Arrow Books also released a novelisation of the 1979 &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail not included in the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage it was too late for them to be incorporated.

In 1995, BBC Radio producer Paul Quinn approached Kneale with the idea of making a new radio series about Quatermass, and the resulting project was produced and aired as the five-part serial &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; on BBC Radio 3 in the spring of 1996. The serial had three strands: a monologue from Kneale recounting the historical environment in which he created and wrote the original 1950s serials; archive material from the original productions and contemporary news broadcasts; and a dramatised strand set shortly before the 1979 serial, with Quatermass being visited in retreat in Scotland by a reporter eager to write his life story. Of the actors who had previously played Quatermass, only Keir and Mills were still alive; Keir took the role, his final professional performance before his death the following year. &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; was repeated several times on digital radio station BBC7 from 2003, and the serial was released on CD in 2006.

A live theatrical production of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was staged, with the permission of Kneale, outdoors in a quarry at the village of Cropwell Bishop in Nottinghamshire in August 1997. The adaptation was written by Peter Thornhill and mounted by Creation Productions, with David Longford starring as Quatermass.

All the various film and surviving television productions featuring Quatermass have been released on DVD.

==Themes==
Nigel Kneale explained in a 1990s interview the background that had led him to formulate Quatermass and the other characters of the original serial in 1953: &quot;I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn&#x27;t want them to be like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not that I wanted to do something terribly &#x27;British&#x27;, but I didn&#x27;t like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour&quot;.

Writing in 2005, the television history lecturer Dr Catherine Johnson felt that in the original three 1950s serials, Quatermass as a character represented the championing of science and rationality over the supernatural and the fantastic: &quot;As a leading scientific innovator, Quatermass is invested with scientific and moral authority. Over the three serials, this authority is tested and undermined... Despite this, the narrative structure of all three serials works to reinforce the authority invested in Quatermass and in science. Although scientific enterprise is responsible for disastrous consequences in the first two &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, it is only through science that the alien invasions are overcome... He is invested with the narrative authority to understand and &quot;explain&quot; the fantastic events depicted&quot;.

The writer and critic Kim Newman went further, explaining in a 2003 television documentary on Nigel Kneale&#x27;s career that he believed Quatermass to be not only a representation of science but of humanity itself. Referring to the conclusion of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, he commented: &quot;It almost boils down to an editorial speech by Quatermass representing humanity, or the humane aspects of humanity. He talks to the monster, and so the monster is defeated by an intellectual argument or an emotional appeal&quot;. Like Kneale, he contrasted this to American science-fiction productions, where the alien adversary would be defeated by &quot;it being blown up or electrocuted, or having the entire firepower of the army turned against it&quot;. Hammer had altered their film version of the story so that the creature is in fact killed by being electrocuted.

In contrast to Newman&#x27;s idea of Quatermass as the embodiment of humanity, writer and lecturer Peter Hutchings in his essay &quot;We are the Martians&quot; sees Quatermass as an isolated character: &quot;In the 1950s Quatermass stories, Quatermass himself is someone who, while working to protect the nation, remains a curiously isolated figure, bereft of anything resembling a meaningful relationship. In the 1979 &quot;Quatermass&quot;, he has acquired a granddaughter; possibly connected with this is the fact that here he seems a much weaker figure who can only defeat the aliens through the sacrifice of the lives of both himself and his granddaughter&quot;. Hutchings also compared this to American productions of the era: &quot;The standard, if not clichéd, figures of the clean-cut square-jawed hero and his girl, which are present in some form or other in most US sf films of this period... are absent&quot;.

==Outside references==
===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
The BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has often been heavily influenced by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale&#x27;s dislike of it (&quot;It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was&quot;, he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass have appeared in the programme and its spin-offs.

Serials directly influenced include &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, &quot;The Invasion&quot;, &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot;, &quot;The Daemons&quot;, &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; and &quot;Image of the Fendahl&quot;, as well as the 2007 &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;, which echoes the first serial&#x27;s climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel. Neil Cross, the writer of the 2013 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Hide&quot;, has stated in interviews that when he was working on his initial ideas for the episode, he took inspiration from the Quatermass serials, and even intended for the character of Bernard Quatermass to appear in the story. However, it was not possible to gain copyright clearance to use the character.

In episode three of the 1988 serial &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, which is set in 1963, military scientific advisor Alison Williams remarks to her colleague Dr Rachel Jensen, &quot;I wish Bernard was here&quot;. Rachel replies, &quot;British Rocket Group&#x27;s got its own problems&quot;. The 2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; also featured a British Rocket Group, although the organisation was identifiable only by a logo not clearly seen on screen and never referred to in dialogue. It was, however, heavily referenced in a tie-in website for the episode created by the bbc.co.uk &quot;Doctor Who&quot; webteam. In 2009 television episode &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Bernard&quot; is used as the name for a unit of measurement, and it is explained that this is in reference to Quatermass—whether as a fictional or a real person is not stated.

The 1994 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;Nightshade&quot; is about an actor who starred in a thinly disguised version of Quatermass, discovering that the events of the serials are becoming reality. The fictional Professor Nightshade was also mentioned in subsequent novels. Author Mark Gatiss described the &quot;Nightshade&quot; serial in his notes accompanying the e-book release as &quot;a TV series that isn&#x27;t quite &quot;Quatermass&quot; and isn&#x27;t quite &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;, adding &quot;I was utterly obsessed by Quatermass at that time&quot;.

The 1997 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;The Dying Days&quot;, set in its year of release, features in one chapter an elderly character introduced halfway through a sentence as &quot;-ermass&quot;, and subsequently referred to as &quot;Professor&quot; and &quot;Bernard&quot; during his brief appearance. Author Lance Parkin confirmed in his notes accompanying the later e-book release that this was a deliberate cameo from Quatermass, specifically the John Mills version from the final serial. In the 2008 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;Beautiful Chaos&quot;, the Doctor briefly mentions being invited to the Royal Planetary Society by &quot;Bernard and Paula&quot;.

===Parodies and homages===
The 1956 British science fiction horror film, &quot;X the Unknown&quot;, made by Hammer Film Productions, was originally intended to be sequel to &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, but when Kneale refused permission for Quatermass to be used in the film, the character was changed to Atomic Energy scientist, Dr. Adam Royston (Dean Jagger).

In February 1959 the BBC radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot; broadcast a parody of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, entitled &quot;The Scarlet Capsule&quot;. Harry Secombe played his regular character in &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, Neddie Seagoon, in turn playing &quot;Professor Ned Cratermess, OBE&quot;. This was followed later in the same year by a spoof on another BBC radio comedy show, &quot;That Man Chester&quot;, which launched a regular strand entitled &quot;The Quite-a-Mess Three Saga&quot;, with Deryck Guyler as &quot;Professor Quite-a-Mess&quot;. However, the &quot;Quite-a-Mess&quot; name and references were dropped after only three of the episodes under pressure from Kneale, who felt a 13-week spoof would be to the detriment of the original character.

In the early 1970s, a British progressive rock group named both themselves and their first album &quot;Quatermass&quot;.

A television spoof appeared in a 1986 episode of the BBC sketch show &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, which featured a sketch entitled &quot;It Came From Outer Hendon&quot;, written by David Renwick. This spoof starred Ronnie Corbett as &quot;Professor Martin Cratermouse&quot;.

Quatermass also appears in a short segment of the 2007 graphic novel &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, in which he takes his niece and nephew to visit an interplanetary zoo. Here he is identified as Uncle Bernard.

Andrew Marshall and Rob Grant, produced, directed, and wrote the 2018→2020 BBC Radio 4 twelve-episode series &quot;The Quanderhorn Xperimentations&quot; starring James Fleet as Prof. Darius Quanderhorn — a brilliant, but ruthless scientist keeping the world locked in the year 1952 for 65 years, with almost no-one noticing — in an absurdist parody of and homage to the &quot;Quatermass&quot; films and television series. Also, they created a novel of the same name released by Gollancz Publishers.

Woody Allen&#x27;s spoof of the science fiction genre exemplified by the Quatermass works, &quot;The Kugelmass Episode&quot;, features as protagonist a &quot;Professor Kugelmass&quot;.

<doc id="292192" wikidata="Q15975192" url="?curid=292192" title="Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About">
<text>Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About is a novel by English writer Mil Millington. The work began as a website that Millington made about his arguments with his German girlfriend, Margret. Millington also adapted this theme to a column in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Plot==
Pel lives with his German girlfriend Ursula and their two children, and works in the IT department of a university library (or &quot;Learning Centre&quot;). The story begins with Pel receiving an odd call from his boss, TSR, who quizzes him about extradition treaties; within a week he has vanished without a trace, and Pel is promoted to TSR&#x27;s former position, &quot;Computer Team Administration, Software Acquisition and Training Manager&quot; (though, in addition to his own job).

The story follows both Pel&#x27;s home and work lives; at home, there are the arguments with Ursula over the search for a new home, after the latest burglary of their current home; defrosting the fridge during the moving preparations; Ursula terrifying the builders working on the repairs of the new house; a skiing accident, leaving Ursula with a torn ligament in her shoulder.

At work, Pel finds that taking on TSR&#x27;s job involves more than it seemed at first; he has to pay off student recruiters from the Pacific Ring, who happen to be members of The Triads; he has to take care of the details of the building of a new Learning Centre building, which involves hiding the fact that skeletons from an ancient burial ground have been illegally dumped from the site, and a dangerous neurotoxin to be buried under it.

These details lead him to become closely involved with the permanently hungover Vice Chancellor of the university, which leads to his receiving another promotion, to Learning Centre Manager; the previous holder of that position having left to pursue his fetish website.

== The website ==
The website began in 2001 as a section of the author&#x27;s home page, and quickly attracted a cult following for its humorous anecdotes, based on real arguments, chronicling arguments over such things as remote controls, the correct way to cut a kiwifruit, and even arguments over arguments.

Within two weeks the author had received offers from two publishers, and set about writing the book; in the meantime, however, he became embroiled in a legal argument when &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; printed, without permission, segments from the website.

=== Plagiarism ===
Millington received a call from an editor at the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, who offered him £800 for permission to run excerpts from the website as an article. Because he had recently accepted a book-publishing deal, he declined the offer. However, the article ran in the February 11, 2001 edition of the newspaper. Millington and Margret&#x27;s names were changed and Millington&#x27;s site was not mentioned.

Millington wrote about the incident on his website and was shocked by the amount of support he received from his readers. Several websites picked up the story, most notably &quot;The Register&quot;, who had themselves been plagiarised by &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, a sister newspaper of the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;.

The &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; wrote Millington a letter of apology and paid him £1600.

<doc id="292193" wikidata="Q230268" url="?curid=292193" title="Jane Krakowski">
<text>Jane Krakowski (; ; born October 11, 1968) is an American actress and singer. She starred as Jenna Maroney in the NBC satirical comedy series &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006–2013, 2020), for which she received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Krakowski&#x27;s other television roles have included Elaine Vassal in the Fox legal comedy-drama series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997–2002) and Jacqueline White in the Netflix comedy series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; (2015–2020). For the latter, she received another Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.

A trained singer, Krakowski has also worked on the stage. At age 18, she was chosen for the role of Dinah the Dining Car in the Broadway production of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; (1987). She has since won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for the revival of &quot;Nine&quot; (2003). Other Tony-nominated roles include &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1989) and &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (2016). She received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in the West End revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (2005). In film she has appeared in &quot;National Lampoon’s Vacation&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; (2000).

==Early life==
Jane Krakowski was born and raised in Parsippany, New Jersey, the daughter of Ed Krajkowski, a chemical engineer, and Barbara (), a college theater instructor and producing artistic director for the Women&#x27;s Theater Company. She has an older brother. Krakowski&#x27;s father&#x27;s family is Polish, and while she speaks very little Polish, her father and paternal grandparents are fluent.

Krakowski grew up immersed in the local theater scene as a result of her parents&#x27; involvement, saying in one interview: &quot;Instead of hiring baby sitters, they brought me along with them.&quot; She took ballet lessons at age four, but later stopped because she had the wrong body shape, instead moving more towards Broadway dancing. She attended Parsippany High School and then the Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York City and Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.

==Career==
=== 1983–2005: Early work and theater roles ===

Following a 1981 television commercial for the video game &quot;Solar Fox&quot;, Krakowski&#x27;s first major role and feature film debut came at the age of 14, when she played Cousin Vicki Johnson in the 1983 road comedy &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. Krakowski was originally cast in the 1983 horror film &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot;, but dropped out just before filming began because she felt her character Judy&#x27;s death scene with a curling iron was too violent. In 1984, she began appearing as Theresa Rebecca &quot;T.R.&quot; Kendall in the NBC soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, part of the NBC Daytime programming block; she continued the role until the show ended in 1986 and was nominated for Daytime Emmy Awards in 1986 and 1987. She also appeared in several episodes of the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; in 1989.

At age 18, Krakowski originated the role of Dinah the Dining Car in the 1987 Broadway production of &quot;Starlight Express&quot;. She appeared in the 1989 Broadway musical &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; as the typist and would-be film star Flaemmchen, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical at the 44th Tony Awards. Her solo number, &quot;I Want to Go to Hollywood,&quot; is included on the original cast recording. In 1995, she played the ditzy flight attendant April in the Roundabout Theater Company&#x27;s revival of &quot;Company&quot;, followed by a starring role alongside Sarah Jessica Parker in the 1996 Broadway revival of &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;.

From 1997 to 2002, Krakowski played office assistant Elaine Vassal in the Fox comedy-drama series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;; she received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 56th Golden Globe Awards in 1999. She portrayed Betty Rubble in the 2000 film &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;. She also appeared in the music video for The Chicks&#x27;s song &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; in 2000, and in a recurring role on the drama series &quot;Everwood&quot; in 2003.

At the 2000 American Comedy Awards, Krakowski won rave reviews when she performed a sexually charged musical tribute and love letter to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. The following year, Krakowski appeared on the album &quot;Broadway Cares: Home for the Holidays&quot;, singing the song &quot;Santa Baby&quot;. She also collaborated with Jim Brickman on the song &quot;You&quot; for Brickman&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Love Songs &amp; Lullabies&quot;; the song became a hit on adult contemporary radio stations. Brickman and Krakowski later recorded a Christmas-themed alternate version of the song.
In 2003, she starred as Carla Albanese in the Broadway revival of &quot;Nine&quot;, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical at the 57th Tony Awards. Krakowski&#x27;s performance was noted for a &quot;breathtaking&quot; aerial stunt she performed during the number &quot;A Call from the Vatican&quot;. In 2005, Krakowski performed her own cabaret show, &quot;Better When It&#x27;s Banned&quot;, at Lincoln Center, and starred as Miss Adelaide in Michael Grandage&#x27;s West End revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre, for which she received the 2006 2006 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Between 2007 and 2009, Krakowski performed in a workshop production of the musical &quot;Xanadu&quot;; a New York City Center production of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; alongside Sean Hayes and Cheyenne Jackson; and a staged reading at Playwrights Horizons of the musical &quot;Mrs. Sharp&quot;.

=== 2006–2013: Breakthrough with &quot;30 Rock&quot; ===
From 2006 to 2013, Krakowski played the role of Jenna Maroney, a clueless and narcissistic actress, on the Tina Fey-created NBC comedy series &quot;30 Rock&quot;. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013. Following &quot;30 Rock&quot;&#x27;s conclusion, Krakowski joined the cast of Fey&#x27;s follow-up series, the Netflix comedy series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;, in the role of the condescending socialite Jacqueline White. &quot;Schmidt&quot; ran from 2015-2019 and gave Krakowski her fifth Primetime Emmy Award nomination at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.

=== 2014–present ===
Krakowski starred as Ilona Ritter in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s 2016 Broadway revival of Jerry Bock&#x27;s and Sheldon Harnick&#x27;s &quot;She Loves Me&quot;. For her performance, Krakowski won the 2016 Fred and Adele Astaire Award as Outstanding Female Dancer in a Broadway Show; the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical; and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. She was also nominated for the Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Musical at the 70th Tony Awards.

Since 2021, Krakowski has hosted a Fox reboot of the 1950s game show &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, with former &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson as bandleader. Krakowski has said, &quot;One of the reasons I wanted to do &quot;Name That Tune&quot; was to perform again in front of a live audience.&quot; 

==Personal life==
Krakowski became engaged to Robert Godley in 2009. They have a son, born in April 2011. The couple separated in 2013.

In January 2021, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; alleged that Krakowski had a nine-month relationship with Mike Lindell, the inventor of My Pillow, between late 2019 and the summer of 2020. Both Krakowski and Lindell denied the allegation, and Lindell sued the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for libel. The case was dismissed on the grounds that a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would not view anything in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; article as defamatory.

In November 2021, Krakowski contracted a breakthrough case of COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from NBC&#x27;s &quot;Annie Live!&quot; where she was to play Lily St. Regis.

<doc id="292196" wikidata="Q1663517" url="?curid=292196" title="Inharmonicity">
<text>In music, inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones (also known as partials or partial tones) depart from whole multiples of the fundamental frequency (harmonic series).

Acoustically, a note perceived to have a single distinct pitch in fact contains a variety of additional overtones. Many percussion instruments, such as cymbals, tam-tams, and chimes, create complex and inharmonic sounds.

Music harmony and intonation depends strongly on the harmonicity of tones. An ideal, homogeneous, infinitesimally thin or infinitely flexible string or column of air has exact harmonic modes of vibration. In any real musical instrument, the resonant body that produces the music tone—typically a string, wire, or column of air—deviates from this ideal and has some small or large amount of inharmonicity. For instance, a very thick string behaves less as an ideal string and more like a cylinder (a tube of mass), which has natural resonances that are not whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency.

However, in stringed instruments such as the violin, and guitar, or in some Indian drums such as tabla, the overtones are close to—or in some cases, quite exactly—whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency. Any departure from this ideal harmonic series is known as inharmonicity. The less elastic the strings are (that is, the shorter, thicker, smaller tension or stiffer they are), the more inharmonicity they exhibit.

When a string is bowed or a tone in a wind instrument is initiated by vibrating the reed or lips, a phenomenon called mode-locking counteracts the natural inharmonicity of the string or air column and causes the overtones to lock precisely onto integer multiples of the fundamental pitch, even though these are slightly different from the natural resonance points of the instrument. For this reason, a single tone played by a bowed string instrument, brass instrument, or reed instrument does not necessarily exhibit inharmonicity.

However, when a string is struck or plucked, as with a piano string that is struck by its hammer, a violin string played pizzicato, or a guitar string that is plucked by a finger or plectrum, the string will exhibit inharmonicity. The inharmonicity of a string depends on its physical characteristics, such as tension, stiffness, and length. For instance, a stiff string under low tension (such as those found in the bass notes of small upright pianos) exhibits a high degree of inharmonicity, while a thinner string under higher tension (such as a treble string in a piano) or a more flexible string (such as a gut or nylon string used on a guitar or harp) will exhibit less inharmonicity. A wound string generally exhibits less inharmonicity than the equivalent solid string, and for that reason wound strings are often preferred.

The physical origin of this inharmonicity is the dispersion of waves in a stiff string. In an ideal flexible string, the wave speed is constant as a function of frequency. Looking at the resonant frequency of a string with two fixed ends, this means that the frequency of the harmonics increases linearly with the mode number. The added dispersion due to the stiffness, which is most prevalent in the thick bass strings, means that as the frequency increases, so too does the wave speed in the string. The result is that modes of the stiff string are no longer perfectly harmonic.

==Pianos==
===Sound quality of inharmonicity===
In 1943, Schuck and Young were the first scientists to measure the spectral inharmonicity in piano tones. They found that the spectral partials in piano tones run progressively sharp—that is to say, the lowest partials are sharpened the least and higher partials are progressively sharpened further.

Inharmonicity is not necessarily unpleasant. In 1962, research by Harvey Fletcher and his collaborators indicated that the spectral inharmonicity is important for tones to sound piano-like. They proposed that inharmonicity is responsible for the &quot;warmth&quot; property common to real piano tones. According to their research synthesized piano tones sounded more natural when some inharmonicity was introduced. In general, electronic instruments that duplicate acoustic instruments must duplicate both the inharmonicity and the resulting stretched tuning of the original instruments.

===Inharmonicity leads to stretched tuning===
When pianos are tuned by piano tuners, the technician sometimes listens for the sound of &quot;beating&quot; when two notes are played together, and tunes to the point that minimizes roughness between tones. Piano tuners must deal with the inharmonicity of piano strings, which is present in different amounts in all of the ranges of the instrument, but especially in the bass and high treble registers. The result is that octaves are tuned slightly wider than the harmonic 2:1 ratio. The exact amount octaves are stretched in a piano tuning varies from piano to piano and even from register to register within a single piano—depending on the exact inharmonicity of the strings involved.

Because of the problem of inharmonicity, electronic piano tuning devices used by piano technicians are not designed to tune according to a simple harmonic series. Rather, the devices use various means to duplicate the stretched octaves and other adjustments a technician makes by ear. The most sophisticated devices allow a technician to make custom inharmonicity measurements—simultaneously considering all partials for pitch and volume to determine the most appropriate stretch to employ for a given instrument. Some include an option to simply record a tuning that a technician has completed by ear; the technician can then duplicate that tuning on the same piano (or others of similar make and model) more easily and quickly.

The issues surrounding setting the stretch by ear vs machine have not been settled; machines are better at deriving the absolute placement of semitones within a given chromatic scale, whereas non-machine tuners prefer to adjust these locations preferentially due to their temptation to make intervals more sonorous. The result is that pianos tuned by ear and immediately checked with a machine tend to vary from one degree to another from the purely theoretical semitone (mathematically the 12th root of two) due to human error and perception. (If pleasing the ear is the goal of an aural tuning, then pleasing the math is the goal of a machine tuning.) This is thought to be because strings can vary somewhat from note to note and even from neighbors within a unison. This non-linearity is different from true falseness where a string creates false harmonics and is more akin to minor variations in string thickness, string sounding length or minor bridge inconsistencies.

Piano tuning is a compromise—both in terms of choosing a temperament to minimize out-of-tuneness in the intervals and chords that will be played, and in terms of dealing with inharmonicity. For more information, &quot;see Piano acoustics&quot; and &quot;Piano tuning&quot;.

Another factor that can cause problems is the presence of rust on the strings or dirt in the windings. These factors can slightly raise the frequency of the higher modes, resulting in more inharmonicity.

==Guitar==

While piano tuning is normally done by trained technicians, guitars such as acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and electric bass guitars are usually tuned by the guitarist themselves. When a guitarist tunes a guitar by ear, they have to take both temperament and string inharmonicity into account. The inharmonicity in guitar strings can &quot;cause stopped notes to stop sharp, meaning they will sound sharper both in terms of pitch and beating, than they &quot;should&quot;. This is distinct from any temperament issue.&quot; Even if a guitar is built so that there are no &quot;fret or neck angle errors, inharmonicity can make the simple approach of tuning open strings to notes stopped on the fifth or fourth frets&quot; unreliable. Inharmonicity also demands that 
some of the &quot;octaves may need to be compromised minutely.&quot; 
When strobe tuners became available in the 1970s, and then inexpensive electronic tuners in the 1980s reached the mass market, it did not spell the end of tuning problems for guitarists. Even if an electronic tuner indicates that the guitar is &quot;perfectly&quot; in tune, some chords may not sound in tune when they are strummed, either due to string inharmonicity from worn or dirty strings, a misplaced fret, a mis-adjusted bridge, or other problems. Due to the range of factors in play, getting a guitar to sound in tune is an exercise in compromise. &quot;Worn or dirty strings are also inharmonic and harder to tune&quot;, a problem that can be partially resolved by cleaning strings.

Some performers choose to focus the tuning towards the key of the piece, so that the tonic and dominant chords will have a clear, resonant sound. However, since this compromise may lead to muddy-sounding chords in sections of a piece that stray from the main key (e.g., a bridge section that modulates a semitone down), some performers choose to make a broader compromise, and &quot;split the difference&quot; so that all chords will sound acceptable.

==Mode-locking==

Other stringed instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass also exhibit inharmonicity when notes are plucked using the pizzicato technique. However, this inharmonicity disappears when the strings are bowed, because the bow&#x27;s stick-slip action is periodic, driving all of the resonances of the string at exactly harmonic ratios even if it has to drive them slightly off their natural frequency. As a result, the operating mode of a bowed string playing a steady note is a compromise among the tunings of all of the (slightly inharmonic) string resonances, which is due to the strong non-linearity of the stick-slip action. Mode locking also occurs in the human voice and in reed instruments such as the clarinet.

<doc id="292200" wikidata="Q1431822" url="?curid=292200" title="Missing fundamental">
<text>The pitch being perceived with the first harmonic being absent in the waveform is called the missing fundamental phenomenon.

It is established in psychoacoustics that the auditory system, with its natural tendency to distinguish a tone from another, will persistently assign a pitch to a complex tone given that a sufficient set of harmonics are present in the spectrum.

For example, when a note (that is not a pure tone) has a pitch of 100 Hz, it will consist of frequency components that are integer multiples of that value (e.g. 100, 200, 300, 400, 500... Hz). However, smaller loudspeakers may not produce low frequencies, so in our example, the 100 Hz component may be missing. Nevertheless, a pitch corresponding to the fundamental may still be heard.

== Explanation ==
A low pitch (also known as the pitch of the missing fundamental or virtual pitch) can sometimes be heard when there is no apparent source or component of that frequency. This perception is due to the brain interpreting repetition patterns that are present.

It was once thought that this effect was because the missing fundamental was replaced by distortions introduced by the physics of the ear. However, experiments subsequently showed that when a noise was added that would have masked these distortions had they been present, listeners still heard a pitch corresponding to the missing fundamental, as reported by J. C. R. Licklider in 1954. It is now widely accepted that the brain processes the information present in the overtones to calculate the fundamental frequency. The precise way in which it does so is still a matter of debate, but the processing seems to be based on an autocorrelation involving the timing of neural impulses in the auditory nerve. However, it has long been noted that any neural mechanisms which may accomplish a delay (a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation) have not been found. At least one model shows a temporal delay to be unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. Autocorrelation can thus be considered, at best, an incomplete model.

The pitch of the missing fundamental, usually at the greatest common divisor of the frequencies present, is not, however, always perceived. Research conducted at Heidelberg University shows that, under narrow stimulus conditions with a small number of harmonics, the general population can be divided into those who perceive missing fundamentals, and those who primarily hear the overtones instead. This was done by asking subjects to judge the direction of motion (up or down) of two complexes in succession. The authors used structural MRI and MEG to show that the preference for missing fundamental hearing correlated with left-hemisphere lateralization of pitch perception, where the preference for spectral hearing correlated with right-hemisphere lateralization, and those who exhibited the latter preference tended to be musicians.

In &quot;Parsing the Spectral Envelope: Toward a General Theory of Vocal Tone Color&quot; (2016) by Ian Howell, He wrote that although not everyone can hear the missing fundamentals, noticing them can be taught and learned. D. Robert Ladd et al. have a related study that claims that most people can switch from listening for the pitch from the harmonics that are evident to finding these pitches spectrally. 

==Examples==
Timpani produce inharmonic overtones, but are constructed and tuned to produce near-harmonic overtones to an implied missing fundamental. Hit in the usual way (half to three-quarters the distance from the center to the rim), the fundamental note of a timpani is very weak in relation to its second through fifth &quot;harmonic&quot; overtones. A timpani might be tuned to produce sound most strongly at 200, 302, 398, and 488 Hz, for instance, implying a missing fundamental at 100 Hz (though the actual dampened fundamental is 170 Hz).

A violin&#x27;s lowest air and body resonances generally fall between 250 Hz and 300 Hz. The fundamental frequency of the open G3 string is below 200 Hz in modern tunings as well as most historical tunings, so the lowest notes of a violin have an attenuated fundamental, although listeners seldom notice this.

Most common telephones cannot reproduce sounds lower than 300 Hz, but a male voice has a fundamental frequency of approximately 150 Hz. Because of the missing fundamental effect, the fundamental frequencies of male voices are still perceived as their pitches over the telephone.

The missing fundamental phenomenon is used electronically by some pro audio manufacturers to allow sound systems to seem to produce notes that are lower in pitch than they are capable of reproducing. In a hardware effects unit or a software plugin, a crossover filter is set at a low frequency above which the sound system is capable of safely reproducing tones. Musical signal content above the high-pass part of the crossover filter is sent to the main output which is amplified by the sound system. Low frequency content below the low-pass part of the crossover filter is sent to a circuit where harmonics are synthesized above the low notes. The newly created harmonics are mixed back into the main output to create a perception of the filtered-out low notes. Using a device with this synthetic process can reduce complaints from low frequency noise carrying through walls and it can be employed to reduce low frequency content in loud music that might otherwise vibrate and damage breakable valuables.

Some pipe organs make use of this phenomenon as a resultant tone, which allows relatively smaller bass pipes to produce very low-pitched sounds.

==Audio processing applications==

This very concept of &quot;missing fundamental&quot; being reproduced based on the overtones in the tone has been used to create the illusion of bass in sound systems that are not capable of such bass. In mid-1999, Meir Shashoua of Tel Aviv, co-founder of Waves Audio, patented an algorithm to create the sense of the missing fundamental by synthesizing higher harmonics. Waves Audio released the MaxxBass plug-in to allow computer users to apply the synthesized harmonics to their audio files. Later, Waves Audio produced small subwoofers that relied on the missing fundamental concept to give the illusion of low bass. Both products processed certain overtones selectively to help small loudspeakers, ones which could not reproduce low-frequency components, to sound as if they were capable of low bass. Both products included a high-pass filter which greatly attenuated all the low frequency tones that were expected to be beyond the capabilities of the target sound system. One example of a popular song that was recorded with MaxxBass processing is &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, the 2001 Grammy award-winning version sung by Christina Aguilera, Lil&#x27; Kim, Mýa, and Pink, produced by Missy Elliott.

Other software and hardware companies have developed their own versions of missing fundamental-based bass augmentation products. The poor bass reproduction of earbuds has been identified as a possible target for such processing. Many computer sound systems are not capable of low bass, and songs offered to consumers via computer have been identified as ones that may benefit from augmented bass harmonics processing.

<text>Linwood () is a town in Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland, west of Glasgow. It is about northeast of Johnstone and west of Paisley close to the Black Cart Water and the A737 road.

== Etymology ==
Linwood comes from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;worǒ&quot; &#x27;enclosure&#x27; (not wood) with an uncertain first element. Other source suggests the following; The village name is a hybrid meaning &#x27;wood by the pool&#x27; Llyn (Cumbric) &#x27;pool&#x27;; wudu (Anglo-Saxon) &#x27;wood&#x27;.

Originally known as &#x27;The Linwood&#x27;, the settlement dates back to the fourteenth century when Linwood consisted of a small collection of farms and dwellings concentrated on the banks of the Black Cart. It was given the collective name The Linwood, with early mails showing it as &#x27;Ye Lynwode&#x27;.

==History==
===Roman era===

Roman forts at Barochan Hill and Whitemoss in Bishopton, would have provided support to other forts along the Antonine Wall, on the opposite side of the River Clyde at Duntochar, ( linked by a causeway). This close proximity to Linwood has fueled anecdotal evidence that suggests a patrol of Romans were hindered from plundering the rural farms by the wet, boggy land of the Linwood Moss. There is a historical article, quoted below, that has a different version of events but which if either is true.&quot;&quot;In an attempt to prevent local tribespeople from cloaking themselves in the shadows of the trees and launching counterattacks, the Roman forces proceeded to cut down an area which is now known as Linwood Moss and serves as a crucial habitat for wildlife&quot;.&quot;

===21st century===
On 10 August 2006, a local community action group, Linwood Sucks, initiated what became a six-year campaign to expose various problems with contaminated land in the area and to highlight the decline of the original town centre. Despite the negative overtones of their name, the group along with qualified collaborators and community support, conducted a great deal of technical research which contributed to a variety of positive changes in the town. One of the initial objectives included research into the lack of playground facilities for the local children. This objective was carried on successfully by Linwood Active, another group, who would later attain charitable status and redevelop the playground facility at Kintyre Park.

Other problems highlighted by Linwood Sucks included highly toxic land in various public areas such as the Erskinefauld Road playground, Cowal Drive playground and in the ongoing building of new housing and a care home facility. The background to this contamination is well documented in what Tom Burke, editor and researcher, had named the Linwood Toxic Timeline. In summary old mine shafts scattered over the Erskinefauld and Brediland areas had been used as dumping grounds for chemical waste from the former Brediland Chemical Works. More recent contamination problems are credited to the Middleton Road incinerator (1974–1992) and the nearby landfill on the Moss Road. As the Linwood moss landfill prepared to close by November 2006, the Reilly quarry between Linwood and Bishopton was being prepped to be used as a landfill by May 2007. Also of concern whilst being of historical interest is the anecdotal evidence of &quot;Daisy Hill&quot; being a mass cholera grave on the site which would become the Golden Pheasant Hotel, later re-purposed as Mount Royal Homeless unit before being demolished, November 2010, and the Mosswood Care home facility being built. Adjacent to this site, an area known by the older generation as Dent&#x27;s Corner, is another piece of contaminated waste-ground, the former site of Dents &amp; Johstone Ltd who worked with substances such as polonium in the development of illuminated aircraft cockpit instrumentation.

In December 2011, Linwood received the annual &quot;Plook on the Plinth&quot; award for &quot;Scotland&#x27;s most dismal town&quot;, part of the &quot;Urban Realm&quot; magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Carbuncle Awards&#x27;. The magazine suggests that the award is intended to cause debate and inspire redevelopment.

The Linwood Community Development Trust was formed on 7 December 2011.

===Linwood Regeneration===

Linwood has undergone a major redevelopment which began in 2008:
* Four schools have been rebuilt or refurbished
* New housing stock – private and social -
* £24 million sports centre – home to several sports clubs
* Tesco town centre regeneration
* Community care home
* Kintyre Park playground facilities

==Economy==
===Cotton and other industries===
Linwood owes its existence to the building of cotton and flax mills there at the end of the 18th century. In the following century there were shale coal oil works, ironstone and cotton production businesses in the village. There was a bleachfield at Linwood connected to the spinning mill there. A paper mill was also established as can be seen on older maps.

===Car production===

The expansion and economy of Linwood from 1961 onwards relied heavily on the Rootes, later Chrysler then Peugeot Talbot car plant, and the associated Pressed Steel Company body parts pressing facility.

Construction at the car factory began in 1961 to produce the Hillman Imp, a revolutionary small car which went into production when the factory was opened on 2 May 1963, and was not discontinued until 1976. The factory, opened by the Duke of Edinburgh, had the advantage of a direct rail link, which allowed cars to be transported by rail to places all over Britain. The opening and production can be seen in the Rootes Group&#x27;s 20-minute film. It later produced the Hillman Avenger (later badged as a Chrysler and finally a Talbot) from 1970 and the Imp&#x27;s successor, the Sunbeam.

After Chrysler UK was bought by Peugeot Talbot, a review of the plant and associated models decided to close the Linwood plant in favour of retaining the Ryton plant near Coventry. Linwood was closed in 1981 with most of the factory demolished soon afterwards. The final remaining part was demolished in 1996.

The closure left mass unemployment. The state of the town was immortalised in the song &quot;Letter from America&quot; by The Proclaimers; the lyrics &quot;Linwood no more&quot; referred to the closure of the car factory.

The site of the former Linwood Car Plant has been redeveloped into a successful retail park, known by some as the Linwood Phoenix and as the Paisley Phoenix by others. It includes various fast food outlets and the very popular Showcase Cinema and a 24hr Asda.

===Shopping centre===

The 2001 S1 Jobs TV advert was perhaps the first red flag that Linwood was plummeting into decline. It featured a miserable character, who became known as &quot;Lavvy Heid&quot; and was filmed in the already dilapidated town centre, shopping area, not just any old shopping centre, but in fact one that had been promoted as &quot;Scotlands&#x27; first regional shopping centre. Ironically,&quot; the advert was banned as was seen to be promoting bullying behaviour in 2011, but the level of real life corporate bullying at the regional shopping centre had been ongoing since 2000 and would not be over until the former regional shopping centre had been demolished and Linwood crowned as a Tesco Town.&quot;Tesco has come under fire again, this time for using a property company to act as a front to buy a shopping centre which it then, allegedly, let run into disrepair so as to step in and buy it a few years later. Residents and MSPs in Renfrewshire were horrified to learn that the supermarket giant – already renowned for controversy – used local property developer Balmore Properties to buy Linwood town centre’s precinct in 2001 for £1.7 million.&quot; 

==Culture==
===Culture and media===

* In 1987, as mentioned above in relation to the demise of the ever name-changing &quot;Linwood Car Plant&quot;, The Proclaimers put Linwood on the map of a declining industrial Scotland, along with other towns with those words &quot;Linwood No More&quot; in the lyrics of &quot;Letter From America&quot;.
* Jeff Torrington (31 December 1935 – 11 May 2008) – former Linwood car plant employee and writer. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Carousel&quot; (1998) drew on the decline of a fictionalised version of the Rootes/Chrysler car plant at Linwood.
* In 2014, Paul Coulter&#x27;s play &quot;Linwood No More&quot; was performed at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow.
* Linwood, and the closure of the car factory, were also the inspiration for the title track of the 2015 Simon Kempston album, &quot;The Last Car&quot;.
* A book was published in late 2023 entitled &quot;Linwood Through The Ages&quot; by Dougie Ross, which extensively covers the whole history of Linwood and is available via Amazon at: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CNTYFPVM

=== Sport ===

<text>Briana Banks (born 21 May 1978) is a German pornographic actress and model. She was the &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Month for June 2001. She is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame and XRCO Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Banks was born in Munich, Germany to a German father and an American mother. They moved to Britain when she was four, then to the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley when she was seven.

==Career==

Banks modeled as a teenager, appearing on a cover of &quot;Teen&quot; magazine. She entered the industry under the name &quot;Mirage&quot;, but began calling herself &quot;Briana Banks&quot; in 1999, after having the first of two breast enlargement operations. Having had aspirations of being a supermodel, she chose the professional surname &quot;Banks&quot; after model Tyra Banks. Her first appearance using the new name was in the film &quot;Decadent Whores 9&quot;.

In June 2001, Banks was &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine&#x27;s Pet of the Month.

On October 13, 2006, Banks reportedly filed a federal lawsuit seeking more than US$75,000 in damages against Doc Johnson Enterprises, charging that they had created unauthorized products from molds of her genitals.

Starting in 2006, Banks went on hiatus from performing in videos and returned in 2008. That same year she was also nominated for five AVN Awards at the 25th annual Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas.

In 2009, she was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame.

In 2011, Banks starred in the porn parody version of the Fox animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;American Dad XXX: An Exquisite Films Parody&quot;. Banks portrayed the character of Francine Smith and was featured on the video&#x27;s box cover. The video was released in September 2011.

On December 28, 2015 Briana Banks announced that she was making a comeback in 2016 after a 5-year hiatus. The same year she was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame.

===Appearances===
Banks was featured in the thirteen episode cable television series &quot;Vivid Valley&quot; produced by World of Wonder that was broadcast in Europe in 2005 and later had a successful run on Playboy TV. The series featured stories about the real lives of then Vivid Girls Jenna Jameson, Savanna Samson, Mercedez, Tawny Roberts, Banks, and others.

===Other ventures===
In 2002 Banks was one of the first porn actresses to have an action figure made in her likeness, by Los Angeles-based Cyber F/X and Sota Toys.

<doc id="292203" wikidata="Q208392" url="?curid=292203" title="Atomic Kitten">
<text>Atomic Kitten were an English girl group formed in Liverpool in 1998, whose original lineup comprised Kerry Katona, Liz McClarnon, and Natasha Hamilton. The group was founded by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) members Andy McCluskey and Stuart Kershaw, who served as principal songwriters during Atomic Kitten&#x27;s early years. The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Right Now&quot; was released in October 2000 and charted at number 39 in the United Kingdom. After five top ten singles, original member Katona quit – four weeks before &quot;Whole Again&quot; reached number one in the UK Singles Chart – and was replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost. &quot;Whole Again&quot; became the group&#x27;s most successful single, staying at number one for four weeks in the UK and six weeks in Germany, and reaching number one in many other territories; in Britain, it was the 13th-best-selling single of the 2000s. The group re-released their debut album, with some tracks re-recorded with Frost&#x27;s vocals: it peaked at number one in the UK and was certified double platinum after selling over 600,000 copies.

Between 2002 and 2004, the group released a further two studio albums, &quot;Feels So Good&quot; (which also went double platinum in the UK) and &quot;Ladies Night&quot;, along with a greatest hits album, before announcing a break following their 2004 tour. To date the group have had three UK number-one singles: &quot;Whole Again&quot;, the fourth-best-selling song of all time by a girl group in the UK; &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, a song originally recorded by the Bangles; and &quot;The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)&quot;, a song originally recorded by the Paragons. They have sold over 10 million records worldwide.

After making sporadic appearances from 2005 to 2008, it was announced that McClarnon, Hamilton, and Katona would reunite for the ITV2 series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, alongside five other pop groups of their time: B*Witched, Five, Liberty X, Honeyz and 911. Frost was unable to take part in the comeback because of her pregnancy. Katona left the group for a second time in December 2017. Frost returned in 2021 for a brief stint before leaving again a few months later. Hamilton announced her departure from the group in October 2024 to concentrate on solo projects.

==History==

===1998–2001: Formation, &quot;Right Now&quot; and Katona&#x27;s first departure===

The idea of Atomic Kitten was first conceived in 1998 by English musician Andy McCluskey, best known as the frontman of new wave group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). Karl Bartos of Kraftwerk suggested he create a new band as a vehicle for his songs following the 1996 dissolution of OMD, who had been rendered unfashionable by the prevalence of grunge and indie rock. McCluskey founded Atomic Kitten alongside fellow OMD member Stuart Kershaw, and the pair would serve as principal songwriters on the group&#x27;s studio recordings in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The lineup initially featured Liz McClarnon, Kerry Katona, and Heidi Range, but did not have a name. In her autobiography &quot;Too Much, Too Young: My Story of Love, Survival and Celebrity&quot;, Katona mentions that they pondered names such as Exit and Honeyheads, before settling on Automatic Kitten, the name of a fashion label owned by designer Mary Lamb. When Katona went home to tell her mother about the band, her mother&#x27;s friend was unable to pronounce &quot;Automatic Kitten&quot; and kept saying &quot;Atomic Kitten&quot;. Katona liked the name and told her bandmates about it; they all felt the same way and the name stuck. After 8 months of being in the group, Range later quit after being offered a different record deal, and was replaced by Natasha Hamilton in May 1999. Range went on to have success with another girl group, the Sugababes.

The group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Right Now&quot;, was released in late November 1999 and reached number ten on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;See Ya&quot; followed in March 2000 and reached number six. Following this initial success, Atomic Kitten performed an Asian tour and achieved their first number-one hit in Asia with &quot;Cradle&quot;. In 2000 they recorded a cover of &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; for the movie &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;. The album, also titled &quot;Right Now&quot;, was first released in Japan on 16 March 2000 and released in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2000 following the release of two further singles, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; and &quot;Follow Me&quot;, with a slightly modified tracklist. The album&#x27;s Japanese edition included demo versions of &quot;Cradle&quot;, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; (titled &quot;All the Right Things&quot;), &quot;Whole Again&quot; (which has only Kerry Katona speaking all the verses in the song, while Natasha Hamilton and Liz McClarnon sing the chorus), and a rare remix of &quot;Right Now&quot;.

In Europe, the album was unsuccessful upon its first release, peaking at number 39 on the UK Albums Chart. There were no initial plans to focus on the global market and Atomic Kitten&#x27;s label, Innocent Records, was even considering dropping them because of their limited success. However, the record company was persuaded to let the group release one more single from the album. That single, &quot;Whole Again&quot;, became their first number-one hit in the United Kingdom and stayed at the top for four consecutive weeks. Due to this success, &quot;Whole Again&quot; was released globally, and reached number one in 18 other countries, including 6 weeks in Germany and New Zealand. The song and video for &quot;Whole Again&quot; originally featured Katona (her vocals were also in &quot;Hippy&quot; and &quot;Get Real&quot;), but several days before the single&#x27;s release, she left because of her pregnancy. Former Precious singer Jenny Frost replaced her in the line-up and the single&#x27;s music video was re-shot; a US video for &quot;Whole Again&quot; was also released. The Katona–Frost switch led to the decision to partially re-record and re-release the &quot;Right Now&quot; album which then went to number one in the UK in August 2001, and was certified double Platinum. The album also reached the Top 10 in several European countries, including Germany and Denmark. Atomic Kitten&#x27;s first album was repackaged with 3 brand-new tracks: &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow &amp; Tonight&quot;, and &quot;You Are&quot;, and includes vocals from Frost in &quot;Right Now&quot;, &quot;Whole Again&quot;, &quot;Hippy&quot;, and a re-recorded version of &quot;Bye Now&quot;.

Their next single, &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, a cover of the Bangles&#x27; 1989 hit, became their second number-one single in the UK and New Zealand and is featured in the film &quot;The Parole Officer&quot; and the &quot;So Far So Good&quot; DVD. It became their biggest single in France—peaking at number two—and eventually went Gold. In late 2001, the band announced they would be releasing a final single from the repackaged album, &quot;You Are&quot;. A video was recorded and promo singles were sent out to radio, but the single was ultimately shelved, never getting a full commercial release. That same year, &quot;Right Now&quot; was featured in Konami&#x27;s hit arcade videogame, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution 5th MIX&quot;.

===2002–2003: New lineup, &quot;Feels So Good&quot; and international breakthrough===
Following the success of &quot;Right Now&quot;, a new album, &quot;Feels So Good&quot;, was recorded. The songwriting and production agreement with Andy McCluskey and Stuart Kershaw was an increasing source of tension within the group, and the pair departed during the recording of the album, frustrated with the record company&#x27;s insistence on producing songs similar to &quot;Whole Again&quot;. Released tracks from &quot;Feels So Good&quot; were &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot;, &quot;The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)&quot;, &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Love Doesn&#x27;t Have to Hurt&quot;, and &quot;Be With You&quot;. The title track was written by Kylie Minogue. &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot; was the third single from their second studio album, &quot;Feels So Good&quot; and &quot;Be With You&quot; was from their third album, &quot;Ladies Night&quot;.

The first single, &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot;, peaked at number three in the United Kingdom. The next single was &quot;The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)&quot;, a remake of the 1967 song by the Paragons that Blondie covered in 1980, which gave the group their third number-one single in the UK and New Zealand. In April 2002 Hamilton announced that she was pregnant but opted to continue with the promotion before going on maternity leave, which included the scheduled 2002 tour, the &quot;Tide is High (Get the Feeling)&quot; video, and a &quot;Feels So Good&quot; medley at Party in the Park. The band sponsored a team in the British Touring Car Championship.

During January and February 2003, Atomic Kitten toured Southeast Asia, visiting Singapore, Thailand, and Korea. Hamilton, who had given birth to her son Josh on 24 August 2002, brought him on the tour.

===2003–2008: &quot;Ladies Night&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and hiatus===
In April 2003, the album &quot;Atomic Kitten&quot; was released in the United States, which consisted of tracks from their first two albums. The album was unsuccessful, although &quot;The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the feature film, &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;. Following this, the group opted to focus solely on the European, Oceanian, South African and Asian markets.

Before recording their third album, Kool &amp; the Gang approached the group about a collaboration for their album of duets, &quot;The Hits: Reloaded&quot;. Kool &amp; the Gang wanted to record an updated version of their hit &quot;Ladies Night&quot; and were looking for a girl group to sing the lyrics. Atomic Kitten liked the idea and inquired whether they could use it for their next album which was subsequently named &quot;Ladies Night&quot; in honour of this collaboration. After mainly relying on songwriters for their previous two albums, the group took significant creative control, co-writing eight of the fifteen songs. &quot;Ladies Night&quot; was released on 10 November 2003 and peaked at number five in the UK album chart. It was certified Platinum for sales in excess of 300,000 copies. The album included four UK top 10 singles; &quot;Be With You&quot;, &quot;Ladies Night&quot;, &quot;If You Come To Me&quot; and &quot;Someone like Me&quot;.

In March 2004, the group released the double A-side single &quot;Someone like Me&quot;/&quot;Right Now 2004&quot;, and embarked on their Greatest Hits Tour to support the &quot;Ladies Night&quot; album and the upcoming release of their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. Shortly before the tour began, the group announced they would be taking an extended break after the completion of the tour, which would serve as a &quot;goodbye&quot; to their fans. The tour&#x27;s final concert was released on DVD under the title &quot;The Greatest Hits Live at Wembley Arena&quot; on 19 April 2004. During the group&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, Hamilton revealed that she had decided to quit the group under the pressure of being a new mum and touring, having only been diagnosed with postnatal depression only nine months after she gave birth. This later led to the group&#x27;s hiatus because they did not want to replace Hamilton.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2005, a partially re-recorded version of &quot;Cradle&quot; from their debut album &quot;Right Now&quot; with new vocals from McClarnon and Frost, titled &quot;Cradle 2005&quot;, was released as a charity single, with proceeds going to World Vision. It was later included on a remix compilation titled &quot;Access All Areas: Remixed &amp; B-Sides&quot;, which was released in Asia in July that year packaged with the Greatest Hits Live DVD. Around the same time, the group were featured on the soundtrack of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mulan II&quot; with the song &quot;(I Wanna Be) Like Other Girls&quot;. They also performed together in Kraków on 28 August at the Coca-Cola SoundWave Festival. In 2006, they released a cover version of the Farm song &quot;All Together Now&quot;. It became a charity single for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and was released only in German-speaking countries. It peaked inside the German Top 20. The group performed at the Nokia New Year&#x27;s Eve Music Festival in Hong Kong on 31 December 2006.

They once again reunited to perform at the Number One Project at the Liverpool Echo Arena on 19 January 2008, which celebrated Liverpool&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture and the fact that Liverpudlian artists have had a collective 56 UK number-one singles. Also to mark the event, in the same month the group released a cover of &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;, which peaked at number 78 on the UK Singles Chart. The group also performed at the Kings Lynn Festival on 12 July 2008 and at Haydock Park in Liverpool on 19 July 2008.

===2012–2013: Return and &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;===

In March 2012, Hamilton confirmed that the group were reuniting for a summer tour and were in talks to star in their own reality television show regarding the comeback, following on the success of the 2011 Steps reunion and reality show. She also said that she hoped Katona would join her, McClarnon and Frost on stage for a performance, having quit the group 11 years earlier. The reunion was later dismissed by all members due to the tension between Katona and Frost. However, on 18 October 2012, it was announced that the 1999 line-up of Atomic Kitten (McClarnon, Katona, and Hamilton) would reunite for an ITV2 series, &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, along with five other pop groups of their time: 911, Honeyz, B*Witched, Five and Liberty X. Frost had been involved in the early meetings to reform the group, but declined to rejoin due to her pregnancy. In 2015, she expressed dissatisfaction with how the reunion was handled, which left her estranged from both Hamilton and McClarnon.

The groups in &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, including Atomic Kitten, were originally supposed to perform a one-off comeback concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Atomic Kitten&#x27;s setlist for the Hammersmith Apollo concert consisted of &quot;Right Now&quot;, &quot;The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)&quot;, and &quot;Whole Again&quot;. It was confirmed on 11 February that due to high ticket demands and the popularity of the series, a UK arena tour would take place from 3 to 14 May 2013. Two more dates were later added for 16 and 17 May, taking the tour total to 14 shows.

Due to the massive success of &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, it was announced that the reunited groups would also be going on a &quot;Christmas party tour&quot; in December 2013. In December 2013, Atomic Kitten recorded their first new material in ten years when, along with the other groups from the show, they recorded a Christmas charity single for &quot;Text Santa&quot;, a cover of Wizzard&#x27;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;. The song peaked at number 13 in the UK.

===2013–2019: Touring and Katona&#x27;s second departure===
On 17 February 2013, Atomic Kitten made an appearance on &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot; in which Katona announced that the group had signed a deal to release their own perfume fragrance. Hamilton later added that they would be releasing new material, saying: &quot;We&#x27;ve already been in the studio, we want to write some more music, so it&#x27;s all very exciting.&quot; On 14 March, Hamilton confirmed yet again that the group would release new material, saying &quot;There is definitely going to be a single and there will be an album, hopefully&quot;. Also speaking about their fragrance deal, she added: &#x27;We have got a perfume deal – we are going to be releasing our own Atomic Kitten fragrance. &quot;Right Now&quot;, &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; and &quot;Whole Again&quot; are taken from &quot;The Big Reunion Album&quot;. It&#x27;s going to be three different smells to represent the three of us. Fans will get the three in one packet. We went to the company&#x27;s offices and created our fragrances.&#x27; At the Health Lottery champagne tea at Claridge&#x27;s in London, Hamilton spoke of a potential comeback single: &quot;We actually recorded our new single last night. We&#x27;ve literally just done it. I got out of the studio at 11 pm and I couldn&#x27;t stop singing the song. I couldn&#x27;t get to sleep - I was in bed, singing! It&#x27;s modern so we&#x27;ve progressed. That&#x27;s all I can say right now. If there&#x27;s a single, there&#x27;s definitely going to be an album.&quot;

Following the announcement of Katona&#x27;s pregnancy, the group confirmed that they were unsure of the group&#x27;s future, or if any new material would be released. McClarnon announced on 6 April that Atomic Kitten would be touring with East 17 and All Saints and others in November 2014. The next week it was announced that unforeseen circumstances had cancelled the tour.

In November 2014, Katona said the group would release a new album in 2015, which would go back to their original &quot;cheesy pop sound&quot; and tour it &quot;around the world&quot;. The group&#x27;s planned &#x27;15: The Greatest Hits&#x27; tour was canceled in mid-May 2015 with no announcement as to why. In November 2015, the group released a compilation album entitled &quot;Whole Again – The Best of Atomic Kitten&quot;.

In late 2016, Liberty X&#x27;s Michelle Heaton filled in for McClarnon during the group&#x27;s international gigs as McClarnon has a debilitating fear of flying.

On 12 November 2016, Katona, Hamilton, and McClarnon performed at the Pigs Nose Inn, a small live music venue in South Devon known for attracting high-profile acts. Atomic Kitten chose to perform a prelude to their tour in 2017. Atomic Kitten toured Australia and New Zealand alongside B*Witched, S Club 3, East 17 and Liberty X in February 2017 with Heaton once again filling in for McClarnon.

In November 2017, Katona stated on her social media accounts that she was no longer a part of the group. Hamilton and McClarnon continued to perform as a duo.

===2020–2024: Other projects ===
In June 2020, Frost joined Hamilton and McClarnon for an online interview as part of &quot;Life Stories – The Interview Series&quot; hosted by therapist Lisa Johnson and Hamilton herself. The band discussed their time together and the impact being in a girl band had on their individual mental health.

On 6 July 2021, the group released a remake of &quot;Whole Again&quot; in support of England at UEFA Euro 2020, entitled &quot;Southgate You&#x27;re the One (Football&#x27;s Coming Home Again)&quot;. Frost returned to the band for the first time since 2008 for a single release. They said: &quot;It&#x27;s been a whirlwind couple of days, but we are super excited and grateful to be able to contribute to the awesome energy and patriotism that is filling the England streets with this version of Whole Again. Totally inspired by the England football fans in support of Gareth Southgate and the super talented England football team, we will be singing loud and proud &#x27;Football&#x27;s coming home&#x27;.&quot;

On 29 November 2021, the group said that Frost was returning to the group full-time. McClarnon and Hamilton continued performing as a duo.

On 7 May 2023, McClarnon and Hamilton performed at a concert celebrating Liverpool music for the Eurovision Song Contest.

On 11 October 2024, Hamilton announced via her Instagram account that she would be stepping down as a member of the group after a final performance two days later to concentrate on her solo career.

<doc id="292208" wikidata="Q1065098" url="?curid=292208" title="Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion">
<text>Since the 1990s, the Anglican Communion has struggled with controversy regarding homosexuality in the church. In 1998, the 13th Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops passed a resolution &quot;rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture&quot;. However, this is not legally binding, &quot;though it commends an essential and persuasive view of the attitude of the Communion.&quot; &quot;Anglican national churches in Brazil, South Africa, South India, New Zealand and Canada have taken steps toward approving and celebrating same-sex relationships amid strong resistance among other national churches within the 80 million-member global body. The Episcopal Church in the U.S. has allowed same-sex marriage since 2015, and the Scottish Episcopal Church has allowed same-sex marriage since 2017.&quot; In 2017, clergy within the Church of England indicated their inclination towards supporting same-sex marriage by dismissing a bishops&#x27; report that explicitly asserted the exclusivity of church weddings to unions between a man and a woman. At General Synod in 2019, the Church of England announced that same-gender couples may remain recognised as married after one spouse experiences a gender transition. In 2023, the Church of England announced that it would authorise &quot;prayers of thanksgiving, dedication and for God&#x27;s blessing for same-sex couples.&quot;

In 2002, the Diocese of New Westminster, in the Anglican Church of Canada, permitted the blessing of same-sex unions. In 2003, two openly gay men in England and the United States became candidates for bishop. In the Church of England, Jeffrey John eventually succumbed to pressure to withdraw his name from consideration to be the Bishop of Reading. In the Episcopal Church in the United States, Gene Robinson was elected and consecrated Bishop of New Hampshire, becoming the first openly gay bishop in the Anglican Communion and in apostolic Christianity. This was highly controversial and led several hundred bishops to boycott the 2008 Lambeth Conference. As an alternative to Lambeth, many of these bishops attended the Global Anglican Futures Conference in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brittain/McKinnon1-3&quot;&gt;Christopher Craig Brittain and Andrew McKinnon, &quot;Homosexuality and the Construction of &#x27;Anglican Orthodoxy&#x27;: The Symbolic Politics of the Anglican Communion ,&quot; &quot;Sociology of Religion&quot; (2011), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, other Anglican provinces, including the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and the Scottish Episcopal Church, permitted the ordination of gay clergy and others, such as the Episcopal Church in the USA, permitted blessing of same-sex unions as well. The BBC, in 2009, reported that many clergy in the Church of England unofficially bless same-sex marriage. In South Africa, the Diocese of Saldanha Bay voted to support blessings for same-sex civil unions. The Anglican Church of Australia&#x27;s highest court ruled that a diocese may authorise the blessing rites of same-sex unions. In Australia, two dioceses have done so. In 2019, the Southern African Provincial Synod voted to recommend allowing each diocese to choose to offer services of prayer for couples in same-sex civil unions.

Many provinces, primarily from the Global South and representing about half of the 80 million active Anglicans worldwide, have responded to these theological disputes by declaring a state of impaired communion with their Western counterparts. Minority groups in Western provinces have stated their opposition to what they consider un-scriptural actions by the churches in England, Canada, Australia, and the United States. Since 2000, some conservative Global South provinces have appointed missionary bishops to the United States and Canada to provide pastoral oversight to disaffected Anglicans. This process, known as Anglican realignment, is considered by the Episcopal Church USA and the Anglican Church of Canada to be an illegitimate incursion into their territories; however, conservative Anglicans argued that the incursions were necessary because of the failure of these churches to uphold traditional teaching with regard to human sexuality.

As of 2016, &quot;the more liberal provinces that are open to changing Church doctrine on marriage in order to allow same-sex unions include Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, South India, South Africa, the US and Wales&quot;. In England and Wales, civil partnerships are permitted for clergy. The Church of England has allowed priests to enter into same-sex civil partnerships since 2005. In February 2023, the General Synod of Church of England endorsed blessings for same-sex couples. As a result, archbishops from 10 conservative provinces of the Anglican Communion declared a state of &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the Church of England and announced that they no longer recognise the Archbishop of Canterbury as &quot;first among equals&quot; among the bishops of the Anglican Communion.
==Summary of issues==
There is a wide range of beliefs within the Anglican Communion regarding homosexuality. Some followers believe that heterosexuality or celibacy is required of Christians, but believe in tolerance towards others, whereas other followers believe that LGBT+ Anglicans should be able to marry a person of the same sex in church. 

Some Anglicans may choose to identify as &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot;, &quot;LGBT+&quot;, or &quot;same-sex attracted&quot;, or in other ways, depending on their personal beliefs and identity.

Some of the more specific issues under study within member churches and dioceses are:

* Gay, lesbian, bisexual, LGBT+, or same-sex attracted members of the church or communion
** If they may exist
*** If they must denounce their sexual orientation and strive to become heterosexual (see conversion therapy)
*** If they must renounce same-sex relationships in order to be considered members in good standing
** If they must be celibate
** If same-sex unions (such as civil partnerships or civil marriages) of LGBTQ members should be blessed
** If a church, or any church in the communion, should conduct same-sex marriages.
* Gay, lesbian, bisexual, LGBT+, or same-sex attracted clergy
** If they may be openly authentic regarding their sexual orientation
*** To what extent they may be &quot;out&quot; (e.g. only to their bishop, partner, spouse, or family, or to the wider public)
*** If they may openly have a partner or spouse
** If they must be celibate
** If any of these individuals (those who are celibate and those who are non-celibate) may be bishops

Anglican churches are diverse in their views, from churches which teach that homosexuality is a sin, to churches which do not see homosexuality as sinful, and accept same-sex marriage being open to all members, up to and including bishops. The nature of the Anglican Communion is such that not all churches or dioceses must agree on all issues in order to share a common faith and baptism.

* The bishops of the Anglican Communion in 1998 upheld the traditional Christian teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman and that those who are not called to marriage so defined should remain celibate. A resolution was passed stating that &quot;homosexual acts&quot; are &quot;incompatible with Scripture&quot; by a vote of 526–70; however, it also contained a statement which &quot;calls on all our people to minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals, violence within marriage and any trivialisation and commercialisation of sex,&quot; and noted importantly: &quot;We commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons and we wish to assure them that they are loved by God and that all baptised, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual orientation, are full members of the Body of Christ.&quot; The Lambeth Conference cannot impose doctrine but serves as a discussion forum on controversial issues. Over 100 bishops, including some who voted in favour of the resolution, immediately repudiated it and signed a letter of apology to gay and lesbian Anglicans. However, over 80% of the bishops did not do so.
* In 2002, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Diocese of New Westminster voted to allow the blessing and officiation of same-sex unions and marriages by those parishes who choose to do so.
* In 2003, two openly gay men in England and the United States were nominated to be bishops. Jeffrey John, an openly gay priest in a celibate same-sex relationship, was nominated to be Bishop of Reading, but withdrew his nomination under pressure from conservatives. Gene Robinson was consecrated the Bishop of the Diocese of New Hampshire and became the first openly gay and non-celibate bishop in the Anglican Communion, sparking controversy and causing some churches to impair communion with The Episcopal Church.
* The Church of England affirmed in 2005 that lay members who have entered into civil partnerships with persons of the same sex are still eligible for the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and communion.
* Also in 2005, the Church of England permitted priests to register a same-sex civil partnership provided they expect to be asked to follow the House of Bishops guidelines.
* The Church of Nigeria and the Church of Uganda criticised the Church of England for allowing same-sex civil partnerships.
* The Anglican Church of Nigeria issued a statement in 2006 affirming their rejection of homosexuality and asking the National Assembly to prohibit it.
* Sexual orientation, specifically the consecration of Gene Robinson, was a major issue at the 2008 Lambeth Conference. A group of conservative bishops opposed to the ordination and marriage of same-sex attracted people, including many from the &quot;global south&quot;, gathered in June 2008 at the Global Anglican Future Conference.
* In 2013, in the Church of England, &quot;The House [of Bishops] has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate.&quot;
* In 2016, it was made public that the Church of England had consecrated Nicholas Chamberlain, Bishop suffragan of Grantham, knowing he was gay and in a long-term same-sex relationship. Chamberlain, who is a suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Lincoln, is the first Anglican bishop in England to come out as gay.
* GAFCON, an association of conservative Anglican churches, called the appointment of the first openly gay bishop in England a &quot;major error&quot;.
* The Church of England rebuked GAFCON and &quot;pointed out clergy were allowed to enter civil partnerships and could offer prayers of support for same-sex couples&quot;.
* In April 2017, GAFCON announced that it is appointing a missionary bishop &quot;for conservative Christians in Europe, bypassing Anglican Churches in England and Scotland&quot;.
*In 2022 at the Lambeth Conference 175 bishops signed a statement affirming the holiness of committed love of same-gender couples.
*In February 2023, the Archbishop&#x27;s Council of Church of England allowed blessing ceremony for same-sex couples. As a consequence, archbishops from 10 of the 42 provinces of the global Anglican Communion (South Sudan, Chile, the Indian Ocean, Congo, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Uganda, Sudan, Alexandria and Melanesia) declared they no longer recognize the leadership of the archbishop of Canterbury.

==Bishops==

===1973 Archbishop of York&#x27;s statement===
While serving as Archbishop of York, Donald Coggan declared on BBC radio in 1973 that many Anglican clergymen were homosexuals and calling for them to be treated with understanding.

===1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops===
Regarding &quot;human sexuality&quot;, the 1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops said that it upholds &quot;faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage&quot;. Furthermore, it refused to &quot;advise the legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions&quot;.

===1999 Cambridge Accord===

In response to the division following the Lambeth Conference of the previous year, most Church of England bishops (although not including George Carey, then Archbishop of Canterbury), and many others elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, agreed in 1999 on a document that upheld the human rights of homosexual people, while recognising and not seeking to resolve division over the morality of homosexual acts.

===Gene Robinson consecrated bishop===
In August 2003 the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire elected an openly gay and partnered priest, Gene Robinson, as bishop. This came shortly after a similar controversy in England when an openly gay priest, Canon Jeffrey John, was appointed to become the Suffragan Bishop of Reading. Eventually, however, John agreed to withdraw in order to avoid division. In 2004, in the aftermath of Robinson&#x27;s election as bishop, John was installed as Dean of St Albans, the cathedral there being the site of England&#x27;s first Christian martyr.

===2003 Lambeth Palace meeting===
As a result of the controversy over the ordination of gay bishops and the blessing of same-sex unions, on 15 October 2003, Anglican leaders from around the world met in Lambeth Palace in an attempt to avoid a schism on the issue. The day after, they released a lengthy statement:

===Statements from Rowan Williams===

In 2004, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote a letter to Anglican churches worldwide in which he condemned comments by bishops outside the Western world for inciting violence against gay men and women.

===Subsequent division===
Bishops from two Anglican provinces, the Province of Rwanda and the Province of South East Asia, consecrated missionary bishops for the United States in January 2000 and formally established the Anglican Mission in America (now called the Anglican Mission in the Americas) later that year. In 2010, a similar jurisdiction created by the Reformed Episcopal Church and former members and congregations of the Episcopal Church in the USA was officially launched. Four dioceses which withdrew from the Episcopal Church account for the majority of the nearly 700 congregations affiliated with this church, the Anglican Church in North America. These two bodies—AMiA and ACNA—reject the creation of rites for same-sex unions as well as the ordination of openly gay people. Neither is a member of the Anglican Communion at present (see Anglican realignment).

Bishops in Uganda cut relations with the Diocese of New Hampshire following Robinson&#x27;s consecration on 2 November 2003. The Church of Nigeria declared itself in &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the Episcopal Church on 2 November 2003, and nine days later announced it was planning to establish a United States branch of its province to support Nigerian Anglicans living in the U.S., the Convocation of Anglicans in North America. The Province of South East Asia broke communion with the Episcopal Church on 20 November 2003, citing Robinson&#x27;s consecration as the reason for its action.

===Windsor Report and 2005 Primates Meeting===
In 2004, the Lambeth Commission on Communion issued a report on homosexuality in the Anglican Communion, which became known as the Windsor Report. This report recommended a moratorium on further consecrations of openly gay bishops and blessings of same-sex unions and marriages. It stopped short of recommending discipline against the Episcopal Church or Anglican Church of Canada.

===Apology by 184 bishops===
A &quot;Pastoral Statement to Lesbian and Gay Anglicans from Some Member Bishops of the Lambeth Conference,&quot; dated 5 August 1998, was sponsored by Ronald H. Haines, Bishop of Washington. The statement apologised to Lesbian and Gay Anglicans for the Windsor Report and for the fact that their voices were not heard by the Conference. By 30 October 1998, the statement had been co-signed by 183 bishops representing every continent except Antarctica.

===2005 Primates&#x27; Meeting===
In February 2005, the Primates of the Anglican Communion held a regular meeting at Dromantine in Northern Ireland at which sexual orientation was heavily discussed. Of the 38 Primates, 35 attended. The Primates issued a communiqué that reiterated most of the Windsor Report&#x27;s statements, but added a new twist. Both the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada were asked to voluntarily withdraw from the Anglican Consultative Council, the main formal international entity within the Anglican Communion until the next Lambeth Conference in 2008.

===2007 Primates&#x27; Meeting===
The &quot;Communiqué of the Primates&#x27; Meeting, February 2007&quot; (Sec 17, 4) asserted its &quot;belief that The Episcopal Church has departed from the standard of teaching on human sexuality accepted by the Communion in the 1998 Lambeth Resolution 1.10 by consenting to the episcopal election of a candidate living in a committed same-sex relationship, and by permitting Rites of Blessing for same-sex unions. The episcopal ministry of a person living in a same-sex relationship is not acceptable to the majority of the Communion.&quot;

=== Consecration of Mary Douglas Glasspool ===

In December 2009, the Diocese of Los Angeles elected Mary Douglas Glasspool, a lesbian priest with a female partner as a suffragan bishop. She was consecrated on 15 May 2010. Leaders from 20 Anglican provinces meeting in Singapore in April 2010 declared that the election and intended consecration of Glasspool represented &quot;a total disregard for the mind of the Communion&quot;.

===2016 Primates&#x27; Meeting===
A majority of the primates voted to punish the Episcopal Church for revising its canons and marriage rites allowing same-sex marriage.

The primates&#x27; communiqué included these words:

The communiqué condemned &quot;homophobic prejudice and violence and resolved to work together to offer pastoral care and loving service irrespective of sexual orientation&quot;.

====Archbishop of Canterbury apologises====
Shortly after the meeting of the Anglican primates, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, held a press conference in which he apologised &quot;to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people for the hurt and pain they have experienced by the Anglican Communion over the years&quot;.

=== Lambeth 2022 ===
In preparation of the Lambeth 2020 conference (the conference would be eventually delayed to 2022), Welby and Josiah Idowu-Fearon (Secretary General of the Anglican Consultative Council) announced that bishops in same-sex marriages and partnerships would be invited to Lambeth. This was the first time that bishops in same-sex partnerships were invited. At the time of the invitations, there were Anglican bishops in a same-sex marriage or partnership in Canada, England, and the United States. However, the spouses and partners of the bishops were not invited in an effort to compromise with bishops from more traditionalist or conservative provinces, and the organising archbishops explained that this was, in part, because the majority of Anglican provinces only recognise marriages between a man and a woman and do not recognise same-sex unions. In response, The Episcopal Church and bishops from Canada and the UK publicly disagreed with the decision. On the other side, bishops from more conservative Anglican provinces threatened to boycott Lambeth 2020 over the inclusion of married and partnered gay and lesbian bishops, and the bishops from Nigeria, Rwanda, and Uganda will not be in attendance. GAFCON argued that &quot;same-sex partnered bishops&quot; should not be included and that, instead, traditionalist bishops should be invited. Finally, at Lambeth 2022, 175 bishops and primates signed a statement affirming the holiness of the love of all same-sex couples.

=== February 2023: General Synod of Church of England ===
In February 2023, the General Synod of Church of England voted to approve of blessings for same-sex couples following a civil marriage or civil partnership.

==Differing stances==
Within the Anglican Communion there is diverse opinion over sexual orientation.

===Church of England===

The Church of England has been discussing human sexuality, same-sex unions, and marriage. In 2023, the House of Bishops and General Synod approved of blessings for same-sex couples following a civil partnership or civil marriage. The commended prayers to bless same-sex couples, &quot;Prayers of Love and Faith,&quot; may be used during regular church services while &quot;standalone&quot; services of blessing will require additional steps for approval. In December 2023, the first blessings approved for use during a regular church service took place. The canons of the Church of England currently state that &quot;marriage is in its nature a union permanent and lifelong... of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side&quot;, and consequently teaches that Holy Matrimony can only be between one man and one woman. The Church of England has also maintained the position that it supports celibate same-sex relationships including civil partnership. The House of Bishops and Archbishop&#x27;s Council communicated that &quot;The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality. Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework.&quot; A spokesperson for the Church of England, has reiterated that &quot;the church has no truck with homophobia and even supports clergy who are in civil partnerships...(But) the Church of England&#x27;s doctrine on marriage is [that it is between a man and a woman].&quot; The current position, stated in 2014, of the House of Bishops is that it is not &quot;willing for those who are in a same-sex marriage to be ordained to any of the three orders of ministry&quot;. At General Synod in July 2019, the church announced that same-gender couples may remain and be recognised as married when one spouse experiences gender transition provided that the spouses identified as opposite genders at the time of the marriage.

==== Before 2000 ====
In 1979, the church publication &quot;Homosexual Relationships: A contribution to discussion&quot; appeared, but was &quot;considered too liberal by many in the church&quot;.

In 1989, a report to the House of Bishops by June Osborne, member of the Board for Social Responsibility, summarized direct testimony from lesbian and gay Christians. In 1990, the report was leaked, creating pressure for an official response to its topic.

In December 1991, the House of Bishops issued &quot;Issues in Human Sexuality&quot;. The conclusion of the document listed questions for reflection. According to the document, same-sex monogamous relationships were acceptable for lay people but not clergy. On the tenth anniversary of the publication of &quot;Issues in Human Sexuality&quot;, Michael Bourke, Bishop suffragan of Wolverhampton, wrote that &quot;&quot;Issues&quot; aspired to help forward a debate on the subject&quot;, but rather than serving its stated purpose, &quot;&quot;Issues&quot; has been presented as a consensus to which all bishops are expected to subscribe. Instead of enabling open and charitable discussion, it has served as an instrument of management and control.&quot;

==== 2000–2009 ====
The issue of human sexuality erupted when Jeffrey John, an openly gay priest, was elected area Bishop of Reading in May 2003. Before he could take up his post there was strong opposition from a minority of bishops and he was persuaded to not proceed with the appointment. However, many senior bishops have voiced disappointment at his decision to resign. Later in 2004 he was installed as Dean of St Albans. Further controversy erupted when churches in the Diocese of St Albans decided that they would withhold contributions until further notice to protest this appointment. St. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Church in Cranfield, near Bedford, and Holy Trinity Church in New Barnet, north of Greater London, pledged to withhold money from diocesan funds in protest. St Andrew&#x27;s Church in the Hertfordshire town of Chorleywood also announced that it would withhold funds until further notice. Yet, in 2002, reporters confirmed that hundreds of same-sex blessings occur, although unofficially, every year.

In 2004, &quot;the majority of Bishops who voted during the whole passage of the Civil Partnerships Act through [the] Lordships&#x27; House were in favour of civil partnerships.&quot; Eight bishops voted in favour of civil unions and two voted against the passage of the Act.

On 25 July 2005, the House of Bishops issued a pastoral statement on the &quot;implications of the Civil Partnerships&quot; which came into force on 5 December 2005. The statement reaffirmed &quot;the Church&#x27;s teaching on both marriage and sexual intercourse&quot;. It also noted that &quot;the new legislation makes no change to the law in relation to marriage&quot;. The statement went on to say that &quot;clergy of the Church of England should not provide services of blessing for those who register a civil partnership&quot;. However, it said that if clergy are &quot;approached by people asking for prayer in relation to entering into a civil partnership,&quot; they should &quot;respond pastorally and sensitively&quot;. Regarding clergy themselves, &quot;entering into a civil partnership&quot; was not considered &quot;intrinsically incompatible with holy orders, provided the person concerned is willing to give assurances to his or her bishop that the relationship is consistent with the standards for the clergy set out in &quot;Issues in Human Sexuality&quot; (House of Bishops, December 1991).&quot; &quot;The House of Bishops considers it would be a matter of social injustice to exclude from ministry those who are faithful to the teaching of the Church, and who decide to register a civil partnership.&quot; However, the statement said that &quot;lay people who have registered civil partnerships ought not to be asked to give assurances about the nature of their relationship before being admitted to baptism, confirmation and communion.&quot;

On 21 December 2005, in another controversial act which was contrary to the House of Bishops&#x27; pastoral statement, David Jenkins, former Bishop of Durham, offered a blessing for a vicar who had entered into a same-sex partnership.

In February 2007, the General Synod of the Church of England adopted a motion. In part it read that nothing should be done &quot;that could be perceived as the Church of England qualifying its commitment to the entirety of the relevant Lambeth Conference Resolutions&quot;. At Lambeth Conference 1998, homosexuality was that the most hotly debated issue. Its Resolution 1.10 stated in an amendment passed by a vote of 389–190 that &quot;homosexual practice&quot; is &quot;incompatible with Scripture&quot;.

In 2008, in spite of the action by the General Synod, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in London offered a rite of blessing for two priests entering into a same-sex civil partnership. Nevertheless, other dioceses and parishes supported the inclusion of gay and lesbian priests. In 2008, the Diocese of London provided guidelines saying &quot;clergy[...] may use a form of service they consider suitable in respect of a civil partnership.&quot; In London, some churches have dedication services for civil partnerships.

==== 2010–2014 ====
In 2011, the General Synod voted to extend pensions and employee benefits to gay and lesbian priests living with their partners in civil unions.

In January 2012, the House of Bishops of the Church of England commissioned a Working Group on Human Sexuality. The working group included Joseph Pilling chairman, four bishops and three advisers. Also in 2012, John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, said he sees marriage as heterosexual, but that &quot;[civil partnerships] are in every respect in ethical terms an honourable contract of a committed relationship.&quot;

In 2012, David Ison, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, announced his support for same-sex marriage and said that he had officiated at blessings or prayer services for same-sex couples. Changing Attitude UK, an affirming group of clergy, laity, and churches within the Church of England, provides a list of prayer services allowed including a &quot;Service of Celebration following a Civil Partnership&quot;. Colin Fletcher, Acting Bishop of Oxford, gave permission for at least one same-sex celebration to be officiated by a Church of England priest who presided for the high-profile ceremony for Mpho Tutu and her partner. The Diocese of Southwark is another example of offering inclusive services. In 2017, the Southwark Cathedral hosted a celebration for a same-sex civil partnership. York Minster Cathedral also welcomes same-sex couples in civil partnerships for prayer.

In January 2013, the House of Bishops ruled that priests in same-sex civil partnerships could be consecrated as bishops.

In April 2013, the Church of England&#x27;s Faith and Order Commission, in a missive to clergy, also communicated that &quot;there was a need for committed same-sex couples to be given recognition and &#x27;compassionate attention&#x27; from the Church, including special prayers.&quot; In November 2013, the Report of the Working Group on Human Sexuality (nicknamed the Pilling Report) was published. It said that the Church should &quot;stand firmly&quot; against &quot;homophobic attitudes&quot; and should repent &quot;for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past, and to demonstrate the unconditional acceptance and love of God in Christ for all people&quot;. The report&#x27;s key recommendation was &quot;that the church&#x27;s internal dialogue on the subject of human sexuality might best be addressed through a process of conversations across the church and involving others in the Anglican Communion&quot;. This recommendation was endorsed and acted on by the church as recounted later in this section. Also, in 2013, some in the Church of England planned a liturgical blessing of gay couples.

In January 2014, the College of Bishops endorsed the Pilling Report recommendation about process of conversations on the issue of homosexuality.

After the legalisation of same-sex marriages, the Church of England communicated that &quot;the option of civil partnership should remain open for same-sex couples.&quot;

In February 2014, the House of Bishops decreed the following:
* No special services of blessing for married same-sex couples, but allowed &quot;more informal kinds of prayer, at the request of the couple [but this should] be accompanied by pastoral discussion of the Church&#x27;s teaching and [the couple&#x27;s] reasons for departing from it&quot;.
* Clergy will not be allowed to enter same-sex marriages.
* Clergy of the same sex are allowed by the Church to enter civil partnerships, but only on the understanding that they will remain celibate.

Still, &quot;gay couples who get married will be able to ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding, the bishops have agreed&quot;. As such, some congregations have offered &quot;Prayers for a Same Sex Commitment&quot;. Moreover, &quot;Bishops have little power to prevent gay clergy from marrying nor to sack them if they do. A panel of three senior bishops has been set up to advise other bishops on how to apply the guidance when clergy dissent. The usual format is an informal letter of rebuke and no further action, meaning more and more clergy are choosing to marry their same-sex partners.&quot; In April 2014, the Archbishop&#x27;s Council and House of Bishops asked that the government to continue to offer civil partnerships.

In September 2014, the College of Bishops met for three days. &quot;Two of the days were devoted to the first of a series of shared conversations in the Church of England on Sexuality, Scripture and Mission. As part of the conversations the college shared the different responses being expressed in the life of the church and the deeply held convictions and experiences that inform them.&quot; Also in September 2014, Tim Stevens, Bishop of Leicester, confirmed that a service of thanksgiving for a same-sex civil partnership contravened no rules.

Andrew Cain (now Andrew Foreshew-Cain), Vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Kilburn and St James&#x27; Church West, in North London planned to defy the House of Bishops&#x27; ban and bless same-sex marriages, as did a few others. Weighing in on the issue, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, avoided taking a position on blessing same-sex marriages but did endorse civil gay marriages and prayer ceremonies to mark the important occasion for same-sex couples. Some congregations and clergy, such as St John&#x27;s Church in Waterloo in South London, have begun to invite same-sex couples to receive thanksgiving services for civil marriages.
Same-sex attracted people who are ordained deacons, priests and bishops are forbidden to marry someone of the same sex and same-sex attracted people who are married to someone of the same sex are forbidden to be ordained. Ben Bradshaw MP wanted the position of the Church of England clarified. Specifically, he demanded to know if Church of England clergy who married a same-sex partner would be disciplined or defrocked. Gay people, including those in same-sex civil partnerships, are allowed to become clerics but are expected to remain celibate. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; wrote in a 2014 article that gay clergy who enter into same-sex marriage or bless same-sex marriages risk being defrocked and losing their jobs. Seven clerics planned to marry regardless, defying their bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown27/03/2014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some Church of England bishops, however, fully accept and embrace gay clergy with partners or spouses in their diocese while other bishops remove the licences of such clergy, making it extremely difficult for them to find a position in another diocese. On 12 April 2014, Jeremy Pemberton married Laurence Cunnington, thus becoming the first priest in the Church of England to defy the church&#x27;s ban on the marriage of gay clergy. Also in 2014, an openly lesbian and trans priest was appointed as a minor canon in Manchester Cathedral.

==== 2015–2019 ====
In 2015, John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, told a lay preacher, Jeremy Timm, that if he persisted with plans to marry his long-time partner, his licence to preach in Anglican churches would be revoked. As of August 2015, an agreement was reached: Timm would complete existing preaching commitments before revocation. Timm announced his plans to be married in September 2015 and to leave the Church of England and join &quot;Contemplative Fire&quot;, a dispersed, diverse and inclusive group that is primarily Anglican.

Other bishops and dioceses have supported same-gender marriage and have advocated for the right of gay priests to marry. For example, Nick Holtam, Bishop of Salisbury, endorsed same-sex marriage following its passage. In December 2015, Alan Wilson, area Bishop of Buckingham, announced his support for same-gender marriage within the church. In 2016, another priest, in the Diocese of Southwark, converted his civil partnership into marriage and remained a priest. The &quot;Church Times&quot; also reported that St. Agnes in North Riddish held a &quot;service of blessing&quot; and &quot;ceremony of commitment&quot; for a priest who had resigned to marry his partner. The Diocese in Europe also reported the marriage of a same-gender couple that took place in a Lutheran church in Denmark. The Diocese of Chichester featured Gay Pride in Brighton and encouraged participation. Also, the Diocese of Lichfield launched a congregation especially to reach out to LGBTI people. Paul Bayes, Bishop of Liverpool, has called for the church to be more inclusive of same-gender relationships. In 2018, the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich appointed Joe Hawes, who is in a civil partnership, as Dean of St Edmundsbury. Later, the Diocese of Lichfield communicated support for &quot;radical Christian inclusion&quot; and that churches should welcome and honour LGBTI people. Andrew Foreshew-Cain, who entered into a same-sex marriage, continued in his position at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Kilburn and St. James&#x27; Church West in North London, but was prohibited from any other diocesan positions within the Church of England; however, in 2018, and due to the unique status of Church of England university chaplaincies, Foreshew-Cain was appointed as the Chaplain for the University of Oxford&#x27;s Lady Margaret Hall, the first priest in a same-sex marriage appointed to the chaplaincy.

In 2016, the General Synod announced that, in response to the growing support for gay marriage, it will reconsider allowing blessing rites for same-gender couples entering into marriage. Additionally, an openly married gay priest was elected to the 2016 General Synod representing a historic moment for gay rights in the church.

From 10 to 12 July 2016, following the prorogation of the meeting of the General Synod, most &quot;members met in an informal setting in which they listened and were heard as they reflected together on scripture and a changing culture in relation to their understanding of human sexuality&quot;.

The Church of England&#x27;s official Statement after the synod&#x27;s members completed their informal reflections said that &quot;the Shared Conversations over the last two years now come to a conclusion with over 1300 members of the church directly involved. It is our hope that what has been learned through the relationships developed will inform the way the church conducts whatever further formal discussions may be necessary in the future.&quot;

In September 2016, Nicholas Chamberlain, Bishop of Grantham, announced that he is gay and in a celibate relationship with his male partner, becoming the first bishop to do so in the Anglican church. Following Chamberlain&#x27;s coming out, he &quot;received high-level support from the most senior official in the Anglican communion&quot; as the Secretary General, Dr Josiah Idowu-Fearon, said that &quot;the Anglican Communion has never made sexual orientation a condition of eligibility to hold office within the church and I reject the suggestion that it has&quot;.

In November, 2016, William Nye, the Secretary General of the Archbishop&#x27;s Council, confirmed the following:
* clergy in the Church of England may enter a civil partnership because this does not conflict with the doctrine on marriage
* clergy may offer &quot;prayers of support&quot; on behalf of same-sex couples following a civil partnership or civil marriage
* churches and congregations can publicly share that they are welcoming of LGBT people
* clergy and the laity alike are able to advocate for a change in doctrine

On 15 January 2017, Rachel Treweek, Bishop of Gloucester, presided over an &quot;LGBT Eucharist&quot; sponsored by Inclusive Church.

During the General Synod of February 2017, the House of Clergy voted against the motion to &#x27;take note&#x27; of a conservative position on marriage. As a result of needing a majority in all three houses, the General Synod rejected the motion. Following the rejection of the &#x27;take note&#x27; motion, the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York called for the need of a &quot;radical new Christian inclusion&quot; that is &quot;founded in Scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it; it must be based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual&quot;. In June 2017, the two Archbishops announced the appointment of a Pastoral Advisory Group and an Episcopal Teaching Document Group. The Pastoral Advisory Group aims to support and advise dioceses on the &quot;current pastoral approach of the Church to human sexuality&quot;, with a focus on same-sex couples; the chair is Christine Hardman, Bishop of Newcastle. The Episcopal Teaching Document Group aims to create a &quot;major teaching document on marriage and sexuality&quot; to be endorsed by the House of Bishops; the chair is Christopher Cocksworth, Bishop of Coventry. The group subsequently became the Living in Love and Faith (LLF) project. The enabling officer for the project is Dr Eeva John. It reported progress to General Synod in February 2019 and February 2020.

In October 2017, the Diocese of Hereford voted in favour of a motion supporting liturgies for same-sex couples to dedicate a civil partnership or civil marriage in church; the General Synod is set to discuss the motion. In 2022, &quot;The House [of Bishops] also agreed to the formation of a Pastoral Consultative Group to support and advise dioceses on pastoral responses to circumstances that arise concerning LGBTI+ clergy, ordinands, lay leaders and the lay people in their care.&quot;

On 12 February 2018, the Church of England&#x27;s Education Office published a policy supporting sex education which includes, among other things, education concerning one&#x27;s sexual desire. The policy stated that &quot;Sex education should include an understanding that all humans are sexual beings and that sexual desire is natural. Pupils should be taught that humans express their sexuality differently and that there is diversity in sexual desire.&quot;

==== Since 2020 ====
In November 2020, the Living in Love and Faith group published its resources. The resources include videos, podcasts, an online learning hub, a five-week course, and a 480-page book &quot;Living in Love and Faith: Christian teaching and learning about identity, sexuality, relationships and marriage&quot;. The book aims to describe all opinions on sexuality fairly and clearly, and to interrogate them in context of scripture, science, culture, and lived experience. Writing about the book, a Church Times editorial declared: &quot;it&#x27;s out, it&#x27;s long, it&#x27;s good&quot;. Responding to the publication of the resources, various pressure groups agreed that churches should welcome LGBTI people, but differed on how that should be accomplished.

In September 2022, the Church of England marked the beginning of a period of &quot;discernment and decision-making&quot; by publishing three documents that report the experiences of those in the process.

Also that month, the Diocese of Hereford refused a request to allow Mpho Tutu van Furth, an Anglican priest, to conduct a funeral in the diocese because she is married to a woman. Former Bishop of Liverpool Paul Bayes criticised the decision and said: &quot;We urgently need to make space for conscience, space for pastoral care, and space for love&quot;. Ben Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, described the refusal as &quot;cruelty&quot; and said the church was &quot;actively pursuing a campaign of discrimination&quot; against lesbian and gay people; he said the church must act quickly to allow same-sex marriage or face parliamentary questions about its position as the established church.

In October 2022, Canterbury Cathedral announced that David Monteith, who is gay and in a civil partnership, had been appointed to serve as the next Cathedral Dean; Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commented saying, “I’m delighted by David’s appointment as Dean of Canterbury.&quot;

In November 2022, Steven Croft (Bishop of Oxford) became the most senior Church of England figure to back same-sex marriage, saying clergy should be free to bless or marry same-sex partners and to enter into a same-sex marriage themselves, in contrast to the Church&#x27;s official position. His statement was supported by suffragan bishops of the Diocese of Oxford: Alan Wilson, Olivia Graham and Gavin Collins. The same month, John Inge (Bishop of Worcester) and Martin Gorick (Bishop of Dudley) sent an open letter to clergy in the Diocese of Worcester that stated that &quot;the time has come for the Church to celebrate and honour same sex relations&quot; and called &quot;for same sex couples to be able to be married in Church&quot;.

In January 2023, the House of Bishops of the Church of England announced it would be proposing the introduction of blessings for same-sex couples at the next meeting of the General Synod, known as &quot;Prayers of Love and Faith&quot;, but that the Church&#x27;s teachings in relation to marriage, i.e. one man and one women, would not change:

In February 2023 Anglican churches in a few developing countries, South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo among others, announced they no longer accept Justin Welby as leader of the worldwide church due to the issue.

On 1 November 2023, 44 Church of England bishops (15 diocesan bishops and 29 suffragan bishops) signed an open letter supporting the use of the Prayers of Love and Faith (i.e. blessings for same-sex couples) and called for &quot;Guidance being issued without delay that includes the removal of all restrictions on clergy entering same-sex civil marriages, and on bishops ordaining and licensing such clergy&quot;. On November 15, 2023, the General Synod accepted both the commended prayers of blessing for same-sex couples during regular church services, and also approved an amendment to authorise &quot;standalone&quot; blessings for same-sex couples on a trial basis with permanent adoption of the &quot;standalone&quot; blessings requiring additional steps. The House of Bishops voted on 12 December 2023 to authorise the Prayers of Love and Faith for use in regular services from 17 December 2023.

===Church of Ireland===

Within the Church of Ireland there is a wide spectrum of opinion. The Bishops&#x27; 2002 Pastoral Letter identified four viewpoints present in the Church, ranging from opposition to acceptance of same-gender relationships. Conservatives expressed great concern about the blessing of the relationship of a lesbian couple in St. Nicolas&#x27; Collegiate Church, Galway in September 2002. The Rector of the parish, Patrick Towers, told the press, &quot;I refuse to do weddings of same gender couples as they simply don&#x27;t exist. But I am always very happy to look favourably on anyone seeking a blessing, be it for divorced couples, animals or friendships. It was a standard blessing, one I wrote myself, based on the Claddagh ring theme.&quot;

There was also widespread concern within the Church of Ireland at the Bishop of Limerick&#x27;s attendance at Gene Robinson&#x27;s consecration. Views at parish level reflect this, with many evangelical parishes as well as those in the more populous (in terms of Church of Ireland membership) north being generally opposed to LGBT identities, while middle and high church parishes, especially in the south, have openly gay parishioners as a matter of routine. For example, at General Synod 2005, Dean Michael Burrows (now a bishop) stated that he regularly gives Holy Communion to same-sex attracted parishioners in long-standing relationships. Moreover, many of the church&#x27;s congregations, including seven cathedrals, are publicly and officially affirming of same-sex couples.

The bishops have announced a process of listening and reflection within the church. A preliminary response to the Windsor Report was produced by the Standing Committee of the General Synod in January 2005. Most of the northern dioceses passed motions favouring the Lambeth Conference&#x27;s Resolution I.10, although a similar motion failed to receive overall endorsement in the Diocese of Connor, covering most of County Antrim. Then, in 2010, the denomination recorded that a congregation within the church had received the &#x27;Straight-up&#x27; Rebel award, an LGBT award, for its special services for LGBTI people.

&quot;The Church of Ireland has not taken a formal stance on the issue&quot; of civil partnerships. In 2008, &quot;the Church of Ireland Pensions Board has confirmed that it will treat civil partners the same as spouses&quot;, 
in line with legal and financial requirements. In 2011, a senior priest in the Church of Ireland entered into a same-sex civil partnership and the relationship was celebrated by his community. Unlike the Church of England, clergy entered into a civil union &quot;without being asked for any assurances regarding lifestyle&quot;. Since then, other priests have been taking the time and opportunity to come out about their experiences. In 2012, the church&#x27;s Clergy Pension Fund recognised that &quot;the pension entitlement of a member’s registered civil partner will be the same as that of a surviving spouse.&quot;

The General Synod in 2012 made provision for a Working Group on Human Sexuality to be created, to encourage and monitor Conversations at parochial and diocesan level, and between dioceses of different perspectives. The same motion reaffirmed the existing teaching of the Church of Ireland in relation to marriage and sexuality: &quot;marriage is part of God&#x27;s creation and a holy mystery in which one man and one woman become one flesh... The Church of Ireland recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage&quot;.

In 2015, Paul Colton, Bishop of Cork, announced his support of same-sex marriage, becoming the first Church of Ireland bishop to do so, saying that &quot;The events in society are moving very rapidly and the church is not at all up to pace with the debate.&quot; Following Colton, two retired Archbishops of Dublin also voiced their &#x27;yes&#x27; vote in favour of same-sex marriages. Michael Burrows, Bishop of Cashel and Ossory, also endorsed same-sex marriage. While opposing gay marriage, Pat Storey, Bishop of Meath and Kildare and Ireland&#x27;s first woman bishop, did endorse and express support for same-sex civil unions. On 23 May 2015, the people of Republic of Ireland voted in favour of the legalisation of same-sex marriage, the first country to do such by popular vote. In 2016, the Church of Ireland released a pastoral letter offering guidelines on same-gender marriage. Although the Church of Ireland does not currently offer marriage or blessing rites, the guidelines allow priests to offer pastoral prayers on behalf of the newly married couples. Services of Thanksgiving for same-sex marriage have been hosted by congregations; for example, St. Audoen&#x27;s Church hosted &quot;a service of thanksgiving&quot; for same-sex marriage. REFORM Ireland, a conservative lobby within the Church of Ireland, has rejected the contents of the letter.

In 2016, some Church of Ireland clergy signed a letter supporting the U.S. Episcopal Church and its open stance towards blessing same-sex couples. In January 2016, the &quot;Church of Ireland Gazette&quot;, which is &quot;editorially independent of the denomination&quot;, endorsed and supported a blessing rite for same-sex marriages in the church. A church report has also said &quot;the moral logic underpinning the negative portrayal of same-sex eroticism in Scripture does not directly address committed, loving, consecrated same-sex relationships today.&quot; In 2017, the General Synod considered a motion to request public services of thanksgiving for same-sex relationships; the vote was 176 against the motion, 146 in favour, and 24 abstained. The General Synod also unanimously accepted a report from the church&#x27;s select committee on human sexuality recommending &quot;that the Bishops further examine the unresolved theological differences as represented in the select committee, with a view to making proposals to facilitate a way forward.&quot; Paul Colton, Bishop of Cork, announced his support for the introduction of same-sex marriage in the Church of Ireland.

A 2017 motion at General Synod calling upon &quot;the House of Bishops to investigate a means to develop sensitive, local pastoral arrangements for public prayer and thanksgiving with same-sex couples at these key moments in their lives, and to present their ideas to General Synod 2018, with a view to making proposals at General Synod 2019&quot; was defeated with 176 opposed, 146 in favour, and 24 abstentions. The Church of Ireland therefore is the only Anglican Church in the British Isles to have synodically reaffirmed traditional marriage and rejected proposals to bless same-sex relationships.

In 2018, the Irish bishops released a statement on the continuing conversations surrounding human sexuality. The Bishops stated that the church&#x27;s teaching remains that marriage is between a man and a woman, but acknowledged that they are divided on the subject themselves. The letter says that clergy cannot perform or bless a same-sex marriage, but that clergy can offer prayers for a couple who have married in a civil ceremony. The liberal wing wanting change noted that &quot;the statement allows for autonomy at a diocesan and parish level, for prayer and pastoral celebration with LGBT+ couples who have married, although this is not by means of solemnization, formal blessing or specifically sanctioned liturgy.&quot;

In 2023, three dioceses voted to support the blessing of same-sex couples and asked that General Synod consider a motion to that effect. The United Diocese of Tuam, Limerick, and Killaloe, the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough, and the Diocese of Cashel, Ferns, and Ossory have voted to ask that General Synod consider a motion to bless same-sex couples following a civil marriage or civil partnership.

===Church in Wales===
The Church in Wales currently has clergy and lay members with differing views regarding the subject of human sexuality. However, the trend has been for the church to move in a more liberal direction. The Church in Wales has taken steps towards allowing same-sex marriages and blessing rites for same-sex unions. After the Welsh bishops released a statement declaring it &quot;unjust&quot; to not provide formal provisions for same-sex marriages and civil partnerships, the General Synod voted in favour of requesting such formal rites for same-sex relationships.

In 2011, the Church in Wales allowed priests in civil partnerships to receive full employee benefits. In 2012, Barry Morgan, Archbishop of Wales, endorsed civil marriage for same-sex couples and encouraged other Anglicans to support the legislation. After Morgan offered his support for the civil policy, some bishops and dioceses developed legislation to alter the official position of the Church in Wales. The church has also endorsed an LGBT film meant to encourage support and affirmation for LGBT people.

Since 2005, the Church in Wales has permitted priests to enter into same-sex civil partnerships. &quot;The Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships who are in a sexual relationship can serve as clergy. If the issue arises, it is up to the relevant Bishop to decide.&quot; In 2020, the Church consecrated the province&#x27;s first openly lesbian bishop in a civil partnership.

In 2015, the governing body voted in favour of same-sex marriages, but a policy change requires further action. During the consultation and discussion, a majority of respondents voted in favour of same-gender marriage. Among the dioceses, the Diocese of St Asaph and the Diocese of Llandaff overwhelmingly supported same-sex marriage. Overall, 52% of the Governing Body voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages in church. In April 2016, the Bench of Bishops decided to fully affirm same-sex couples and offer prayers of celebration for same-sex marriages. Of the prayers provided for same-sex couples, Form One gives God thanks &quot;for [the two people], who have found such love and companionship in each other, that it has led them to dedicate their lives in support of one another&quot;. In September 2021, the Church in Wales voted to &quot;formally bless same-sex couples&quot; instead (by way of debate and compromise) - but still not legally recognising same-sex marriage within titles of the Church officially.

In November 2021, the Bishop of St Asaph Gregory Cameron blessed the civil partnership of Lee Taylor and Fabiano Da Silva Duarte at St Collen&#x27;s Church in Llangollen. Kieran Bohan coordinator of the Open Table Network said: &quot;It is heartwarming to see a bishop embrace a priest whose civil partnership he has just blessed.&quot;

===Scottish Episcopal Church===
The Scottish Episcopal Church (SEC) does not have a policy against ordaining non-celibate gay clergy, thus such ordinations are theoretically allowed. They announced this on 23 March 2005: &quot;[We] had never regarded the fact that someone was in a close relationship with a member of the same sex as in itself constituting a bar to the exercise of an ordained ministry&quot;.

Headlines in North America announced that the Scottish Episcopal Church had agreed to ordain gay and lesbian people in committed relationships. The Church thus released a statement pointing out that the policy was not news. Regarding the media release, the Church said:

&quot;In referring to the fact that there is no current bar to ordination for someone who might be in a close relationship with a member of the same sex, the Bishops were simply stating the present position as it applies in Scotland where, unlike some other provinces, no motion discouraging such ordinations has ever been passed by our General Synod. Consequently, the statement earlier this month does not represent any change in policy on the part of the Bishops.&quot;In 2005, clergy were able to enter into same-sex civil partnerships, and sexual abstinence is not a requirement in the Scottish Episcopal Church for such civil unions. Since 2008, St. Mary Cathedral in Glasgow has offered blessings for civil partnerships.

In 2015, the Scottish Episcopal Church voted in favour of same-sex marriage ceremonies. Following that vote, Dundee Cathedral hosted its first same-sex blessing service. In 2016, the General Synod voted in favour of amending the marriage canon to include same gender couples; the change required a second reading in 2017. The motion was approved by 97 votes to 33 with 3 abstentions.

After the Synod, David Chillingworth, Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, gave his assessment of the situation regarding the change in the marriage canon. In 2017, the General Synod approved the amendment to the marriage canon to include same-sex couples in the second reading.

===Church of South India===
The Church of South India, although divided in opinion like many Anglican provinces, has many outspoken clergy in favour of rights for same-sex couples. &quot;The Church of South India (CSI) [is] a relatively liberal Protestant church which has, since 1984, allowed women to become pastors. &#x27;CSI has been liberal on these issues. It has taken up issues of gender, dalits and landlessness. It has to address the issue of sexual minorities too&#x27;.&quot;

In 2008, CSI supported the faction of the Anglican Church—Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON)—on the debate over allowing gay clergy. Indian bishops sided with traditionalists on the issue of homosexuality. The church does not ordain clergy who are active in same-sex relationships. In 2009, the National Council of Churches in India, of which the CSI is a member, supported the legalization of consensual same-sex relationships in India. Christopher Rajkumar, a presbyter in the Church of South India, stated that opposition to the rights of same-sex couples is a violation of human rights. Also in 2009, V. Devasahayam, Bishop in Madras, supported legal rights for gay people saying &quot;it is wrong to condemn people for their sexual orientation&quot;. Devashayam also argued that sexual orientation is genetic and that Scripture should be re-read from a contemporary context.

In 2015, St Mark&#x27;s Cathedral in Bangalore, a congregation of the CSI, hosted a forum on preventing homophobia, and Vincent Rajkumar, a presbyter, advocated for the support of gay rights. CSI clergy, under the National Council of Churches in India, co-held a conference working against homophobia in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2014 featuring a rainbow flag and with speakers in favour of same-sex couples. Moreover, during the week of the Primates&#x27; meeting in Canterbury, the CSI was listed by the BBC as being among the Anglican provinces open to blessing same-sex couples.

In 2016, a seminary affiliated with the CSI has begun offering a seminary on LGBT issues. &quot;The Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary in Madurai held a two-hour seminar on gender and sexuality...&quot; In 2023, the Communion of Churches in India, of which the CSI is a part, opposed the legalization of same-sex marriages in India.

===Church of Ceylon===
The Church of Ceylon is the Anglican Church in Sri Lanka. It is an extraprovincial jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who serves as its Metropolitan.

In Sri Lanka, homosexuality is illegal by the constitution of the 1970s.

Keerthisiri Fernando, Bishop of the Diocese of Kurunegala, Church of Ceylon, said:
&quot;Sociologically we need to understand that differing human sexuality is a reality. While a small proportion may belong to one polar and another proportion to another side all the others remain at differing proportions on the scale of human sexuality. How can we then to promote &quot;diversity in unity&quot; rather than &quot;unity in diversity&quot;? We cannot expect or force everyone to belong to one category... People are born with a variety of sexual orientations. We can attribute this genetically, medically, ethically, secularly or in any other manner. But it remains a reality. We must now think how to accommodate them in the Church and in the human family. How can we make them feel wanted, welcomed, respected and indeed honoured.&quot;
===Church of the Province of South East Asia===

(Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam)

The Province of South East Asia criticised the confirmation of Gene Robinson as a bishop by the Episcopal Church (USA), stating:

&quot;The said confirmation therefore seriously raises the question of ECUSA&#x27;s genuine commitment to our corporate responsibility as members of the church catholic to uphold and promote only the Apostolic Faith and Order inherited. A natural, holistic and consistent reading of the Scriptures clearly show that it is against the practise of homosexuality. In the context of orthodox and classical Christianity, the canonical authority of the Scriptures is taken to be recognized and received by the community of faith and not subject to majority, culturally relevant or even theological voting.&quot;

On 24 November 2003, the province declared that it had entered into a state of impaired communion with the Episcopal Church, rejecting the consecration of Dr Robinson.

===Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (Hong Kong Anglican Church)===

The fourth General Synod of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, at its meeting on 15 October 2007, resolved that the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macau supports the recommendations contained in the Windsor Report so as to safeguard the unity of the Anglican Communion. However, Peter Kwong, a former primate, stated that he supported diversity in the Communion saying &quot;Anglicanism is inclusive ... so why shouldn&#x27;t we find a common ground on homosexuality?&quot;. In 2013, some leaders in the Hong Kong Anglican Church endorsed civil rights legislation that provided legal protection for the LGBT community from discrimination. Additionally, in 2015, Peter Douglas Koon, the Anglican province&#x27;s secretary general, objected to discrimination occurring in conservative schools and emphatically assured the LGBT community that Anglican schools would be accepting of LGBT faculty and students. The Hong Kong Anglican Church has maintained partnership and communion with The Episcopal Church.

=== Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia ===

There is no officially stated policy regarding homosexuality. Members are also divided regarding agreement with the Windsor Report and Lambeth Conference. There is no single national approach towards the ordination of openly gay or lesbian clergy, although individual dioceses have supported or opposed the inclusion of LGBT clergy. However, in 2016, it has been announced that the church will go forward in provincially proposing the option of same-gender blessing rites. In 2018, the Synod voted in favour of allowing blessing rites for same-sex marriages and civil unions. Prior to official blessings, the church said that &quot;clergy should be permitted &#x27;to recognise in public worship&#x27; a same-gender civil union or state marriage of members of their faith community.&quot;

Some Pākehā parishes are more open to gay and lesbian issues, including ordination and blessing of unions. The Dunedin and Auckland dioceses are notable for other such examples, including the ordination of a non-celibate gay clergy and the blessings of same-sex relationships performed by priests in an official capacity. In the Dunedin Diocese, &quot;Blessings of same-sex relationships are offered in line with Diocesan Policy and with the bishop&#x27;s permission.&quot; In 2006, an openly gay and partnered deacon was ordained in the Dunedin Diocese. Subsequently, the same deacon was ordained as a priest. The Diocese of Auckland has also established policies in favour of ordaining partnered gay and lesbian priests. One priest, in a same-sex relationship, is an assistant priest in Auckland after being denied a licence in the Waikato Diocese. Congregations may offer a &#x27;relationship blessing&#x27; for two partners in the Auckland Diocese. In 2005, a same-sex couple was joined in a civil union at St. Matthew in the City in the Auckland Diocese. In 2011, the Waiapu Diocese adopted a resolution affirming the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy and asking for an authorised liturgy for blessing same-sex relationships. The Bishop&#x27;s chaplain in the Waiapu Diocese has also performed a blessing for a same-sex couple. In 2017, Andrew Hedge, Bishop of Waiapu, installed an openly gay priest, who is married to his partner, as the Dean of Waiapu Cathedral.

New Zealand writer Liz Lightfoot has documented the experiences of individuals coming out in the Anglican Church as a contribution to the &#x27;listening process&#x27; in the Anglican Church.

In 2014, General Synod passes a resolution that would create a pathway towards the blessing of same-sex relationships, while upholding the traditional doctrine of marriage. The synod in 2016 voted to receive the report on blessings but left the proposal to &quot;[lie] on the table&quot; and the report will be reviewed again in 2018. &quot;However, Synod did pass a constitutional change allowing bishops the right to authorize a service for use in his or her diocese.&quot; In 2018, General Synod/Te Hinota voted in favour of the process to approve Motion 29 and the blessing of same-sex relationships.

===Anglican Church of Australia===

In the Seventeenth Session of the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Australia in 2017, the synod passed a motion recognising &quot;that the doctrine of our church, in line with traditional Christian teaching, is that marriage is an exclusive and lifelong union of a man and a woman, and further, recognises that this has been the subject of several General Synod resolutions over the past fifteen years&quot;. In 2018, Philip Freier, Primate of Australia and Archbishop of Melbourne, released an &quot;ad clerum&quot; reiterating the current position that clergy cannot perform a same-sex marriage. In 2020, the Appellate Tribunal, the highest church court, ruled that a diocese may authorise blessing rites for same-sex unions. At the same time, the church has &quot;no official stance on homosexuality&quot; itself.

At its 2004 general synod held in Perth, the church passed four resolutions on human sexuality. The key resolutions stated that, &quot;Recognising that this is a matter of ongoing debate and conversation in this church and that we all have an obligation to listen to each other with respect, this General Synod does not condone the liturgical blessing of same sex relationships&quot; and &quot;this General Synod does not condone the ordination of people in open committed same sex relationships.&quot; Nevertheless, the Diocese of Perth has &quot;a number of people in same-sex relationships amongst the clergy&quot;. Phillip Aspinall, a former Primate, has stated that the topic is not worth splitting the church over. Aspinall has also stated that he does not take an official position on the ordination of gay clergy, preferring instead to encourage respectful conversation. Another former primate, Peter Carnley, stated that he believed &quot;life-long gay relationships and commitments ... could receive church blessings.&quot; Roger Herft, as diocesan Bishop of Newcastle, &quot;support[ed] blessing gay unions&quot;. Peter Jensen, the former archbishop of the strongly conservative Evangelical Diocese of Sydney, has vigorously opposed homosexuality, stating that accepting non-heterosexual people would be &quot;calling holy what God called sin&quot;. St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in Subiaco, Perth, Western Australia, was the first Anglican church in Australia to publicly welcome gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Its Sunday evening services are affirming of LGBT people. Since then, other dioceses have taken affirming stances towards same-sex couples and LGBT clergy. In 2013, the Diocese of Perth voted in favour of recognising same-sex unions. While Roger Herft, Archbishop of Perth vetoed the measure, he did say that &quot;there are gay and lesbian clergy serving in the priesthood. They are licensed by me and are honoured and respected as priests ...&quot; The Diocese of Perth did vote to no longer prohibit clergy in relationships, including sexual relationships, outside of marriage. In 2011, the Diocese of Adelaide elected a new assistant bishop, Tim Harris, and he supported allowing LGBT clergy if they agreed to be celibate, but, at the same time, he expressed that he is open to conversation about change. Moreover, in 2012, the Diocese of Gippsland appointed an openly gay priest, and, in 2015, John Parkes, Bishop of Wangaratta, endorsed same-sex marriage joining an archdeacon who had already offered to perform gay marriages when allowed to do so. Additionally, Sarah Macneil, Bishop of Grafton, has been affirming and supportive of LGBT clergy and relationships. So far, two cathedrals, the cathedral of the Diocese of Grafton and St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in the Diocese of Brisbane have officially become supportive and affirming of LGBT people. Towards the end of 2015, Greg Thompson, Bishop of Newcastle, called for conversation and has said that he opposes discrimination against LGBT people. Also in 2015, the Social Responsibilities Committee of the Anglican Church in Southern Queensland endorsed civil unions for same-sex couples.

In 2015, Kay Goldsworthy, Bishop of Gippsland, appointed an openly gay and partnered priest to another post. Also, in 2016, Garry Weatherill, Bishop of Ballarat, announced his support for same-sex marriage. In April 2016, St Andrew&#x27;s Church in the Diocese of Perth publicly blessed a same-sex union. In 2018, Archdeacon Peter MacLeod-Miller &quot;conducted an unofficial hand-clasping ceremony&quot; for a same-sex couple. The Wangaratta and Ballarat dioceses have voted to bless same-sex civil unions. The dean of St John&#x27;s Cathedral in Brisbane, the Very Revd Peter Catt, wrote that he had been blessing same-sex unions. The Dioceses of Wangaratta and Newcastle have approved of blessing rites for same-sex marriages.

===Anglican Province of the Southern Cone of America===

Gregory Venables, Presiding Bishop of the Anglican Church of South America, has also been strongly critical of homosexuality. Bishops in his province criticised the Windsor Report for failing to call liberal churches to repentance. The province has declared itself in &quot;impaired communion&quot; with ECUSA, but continues to maintain full communion with opponents of the Robinson consecration. Venables has authorised dioceses within his province to provide episcopal oversight to United States churches that have left ECUSA.

In December 2007, the convention of the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin, an Episcopal Church diocese in central California, voted to leave the ECUSA and joined the Province of the Southern Cone as the Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin. A minority of the Episcopal Diocese remained in the ECUSA. In October 2008, a majority of the convention of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh voted to leave ECUSA and affiliate with the Southern Cone, resulting in one body affiliated with the Southern Cone and a second body remaining within ECUSA. The following month, the conventions of two more U.S. dioceses—the Anglican Diocese of Quincy in Illinois and the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth in Texas—voted to leave ECUSA and affiliate with the Southern Cone. All were subsequently absorbed into the new Anglican Church in North America.

However, some Anglican representatives from the Diocese of Uruguay expressed their support for the inclusion of same-sex couples.

===Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil===

The Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil is characterised by its progressive theological views on homosexuality. After the 1998 Lambeth Conference, the Anglican Church in Brazil decided to promote two national forums on human sexuality, both held in Rio de Janeiro. Its decisions guided the policy. According to the final document, the consensus of the Brazilian Church is that human sexuality is a gift from God, and it should be experienced in peace, freedom, love and respect. The Church has approved of the ordination of openly gay priests and has offered blessing services for same-sex marriages. It is understood that the Church should respect the privacy of its members and clergy. Any kind of public exposure of someone&#x27;s sexual orientation (as a pre-requisite to be a member or take part of any ministry) violates this privacy. Because of that progressive position, the Bishop of the Diocese of Recife, still strongly Evangelical, Robinson Cavalcanti, declared Recife to be independent of the Church of Brazil, an action that resulted in his being deposed as a bishop by the Ecclesiastical Tribunal. Among his main reasons, he pointed out that the Brazilian Church was sympathetic to the ordination of Gene Robinson, as well as the ordination of all LGBTQ people. This split the Diocese of Recife in two: one part loyal to Orlando Santos de Oliveira, Primate of the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil at the time, and currently coordinated by Bishop João Peixoto; and the other, under Cavalcanti&#x27;s leadership, tied to the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone.

In 2016, the Presiding Bishop convened an Extraordinary Synod to discuss adding same-sex marriage to the marriage canon; the proposal was not approved, but it was considered during General Synod in 2017. On 1 June 2018, the General Synod voted to change the marriage canon to include same-sex couples.

===Anglican Church of Canada===
Sexual orientation and the Anglican Church of Canada exist within a strictly Canadian context. In the secular context, Canadian law underwent a profound change in regards to homosexuality. The last same-sex attracted person to be sent to prison indefinitely as a &quot;dangerous sex offender&quot; was in 1967. In 1969, the Canadian parliament passed amendments of the Criminal Code, decriminalising homosexuality in Canada. On 20 July 1971, the last gay man criminally convicted because of his sexual orientation was released from prison. A series of judicial rulings beginning in 2003 legalised same-sex marriage in the majority of Canada&#x27;s provinces, and on 20 July 2005, the Canadian government extended the new definition nationwide by statute.

In 2013, ten Anglican dioceses (Edmonton, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Rupert&#x27;s Land, Ottawa, Vancouver-based New Westminster, Toronto, London-based Huron, Hamilton-based Niagara, Montreal, and Victoria-based British Columbia) allow the blessing and marriage of same-sex couples. The Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior (formerly the Diocese of Cariboo) also permit such marriage rites.

On 30 September 2012, David Irving, Bishop of Saskatoon, ordained as deacon a person civilly married to a person of the same sex.

At the General Synod on 6 July 2013, the Anglican Church of Canada made the decision to vote on the issue of same-sex marriage at the following synod in 2016. At the General Synod in 2016, a motion to change the marriage canon to include same-sex marriage received the necessary 2/3 majority and was approved; it received a second reading in 2019 and failed to receive a 2/3 majority in the Order of Bishops, though it did receive a 2/3 majority in the Orders of Clergy and Laity. Following the General Synod in 2016, the Dioceses of Niagara and Ottawa decided to allow legal same-sex marriages as a local option. Also in 2016, the Diocese of Toronto elected with Kevin Robertson, for the first time, an openly gay and partnered person to be a bishop. Although the amendment to the marriage canon failed to receive the 2/3 majority needed among the Order of Bishops, the General Synod did pass a resolution allowing each provincial synod and diocese to bless or perform same-sex marriages if they choose to do so.

The general assembly held the second reading of the motion to approve same-sex marriage on 12 July 2019. In spite of support by the laity and clergy, the motion did not pass because it was not supported by a full two-thirds of bishops. Director of Communications Meghan Kilty said that many dioceses have been performing same-sex marriages, such as that of now-bishop Kevin Robertson in 2018 at St. James Cathedral. Kilty added that many diocese would continue to perform such services since the Church had not specifically prohibited the practice. As of August 2019, 19 out of 30 dioceses had approved of same-sex marriages being performed in church.

===Episcopal Church in the United States of America===
In 2003, ECUSA became the first Anglican province to ordain an openly gay priest in a same-sex relationship as a bishop; however, the Episcopal Church&#x27;s stance on LGBTQ matters had been debated for decades. In 1976, the Church&#x27;s General Convention passed a resolution stating: &quot;It is the sense of this General Convention that homosexual persons are children of God who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church.&quot; In 1977, the first openly gay and lesbian priest was ordained by Paul Moore Jr., Bishop of New York.

Various interpretations were held within the Episcopal Church on this resolution, ranging from the majority of dioceses that now ordain non-celibate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender clergy to the minority group who founded the Anglican Communion Network which currently opposes such ordinations. On 23 June 2005, The Episcopal Church defined its meaning in a 130-page document entitled &quot;To Set Our Hope on Christ&quot;:
We believe that God has been opening our eyes to acts of God that we had not known how to see before ... the eligibility for ordination of those in covenanted same-sex unions ... a person living in a same-gendered union may be eligible to lead the flock of Christ ... members of the Episcopal Church have discerned holiness in same-sex relationships and have come to support the blessing of such unions and the ordination or consecration of persons in those unions ... Their holiness stands in stark contrast with many sinful patterns of sexuality in the world ... The idea that there is only one correct way to read or interpret scripture is a rather modern idea.

In July 2009, the General Convention voted to allow bishops to bless same-sex unions, and also called for bishops to &quot;collect and develop theological and liturgical resources&quot; for possibly creating an official rite for such ceremonies at the 2012 General Convention.

In January 2010, the Reverend Mally Lloyd and the Reverend Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, two prominent Episcopal priests, married in a ceremony at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston, Massachusetts.

In 2012, the General Convention approved an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions, called &quot;The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,&quot; while making it clear that it was not marriage. The action enabled priests to bestow the church&#x27;s blessing on gay couples even in states where same-sex marriage is illegal, subject to the approval of the bishops.

In 2015, the General Convention approved &quot;canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians&quot;. The canonical change eliminated &quot;language defining marriage as between a man and a woman&quot;. The liturgical change provided two marriage rites for use by same-sex or opposite-sex couples with consent of the priest and permission of the bishop.

=== Episcopal Church of Cuba ===

At least one bishop of the extraprovincial diocese, Nerva Cot Aguilera, stated that she supported the ordination of openly gay and lesbian priests. The Episcopal Church of Cuba is now a Diocese of The Episcopal Church, based in the USA.

===Church in the Province of the West Indies===

The church defines marriage as a union of one man with one woman and does not bless same-sex unions while supporting the legalization of homosexuality. Archbishop Gomez has said Gene Robinson&#x27;s ordination is incompatible with Scripture. In 2017, John Holder, Archbishop of the West Indies, stated that there is no biblical support for anti-sodomy laws and urged Jamaica to repeal its laws against gay and lesbian relationships. In 2019, the province elected Howard Gregory, Bishop of Jamaica, as archbishop; Gregory supports the decriminalization same-gender sexual relationships and supports the legalization of homosexuality.

===Church of the Province of Central Africa===

Archbishop Malango was quoted as stating Gene Robinson&#x27;s election &quot;brought darkness, disappointment, sadness and grief&quot; to his Church.

===Anglican Church of Kenya===

Archbishop Nzimbi has strongly spoken against admitting non-celibate same-sex attracted people into the Church.

In 2013, Eliud Wabukala, then the Primate of the church, &quot;denounced a decision by the Church of England&#x27;s House of Bishops to allow gay priests to become bishops&quot;. He also opposed priests being allowed to enter into same-sex civil partnerships saying the Church of England &quot;&#x27;seems to be advancing along the same path&#x27; as the US Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada which he accused of promoting &#x27;a false gospel&#x27;&quot;.

In 2016, the church was ordered to reinstate three priests who had been suspended in 2015 after allegations surfaced that they were gay. All three of these priests returned to their pastoral duties in June 2018. It was also agree in November 2018 that the three priests would settle a lawsuit they had filed against Joseph Kagûnda, Bishop of Mount Kenya West, through mediation. In December 2018, it was announced that the Church had given the three priests 6.8 million shillings each as compensation.

===Anglican Church of Korea===

The Anglican Church of Korea is among the more liberal provinces in the Anglican Communion. In 2015, a cleric, members, and congregations of the province participated in an LGBT Pride event and have been affirming of equal rights for gays and lesbians. The Anglican Church in Korea has openly had discussions about human sexuality.

===Church of Nigeria===

The Church remains sharply opposed to homosexuality, calling it &quot;a perversion of human dignity&quot;. In 2005, Peter Akinola, then Primate of All Nigeria, spoke out against the Church of England&#x27;s decision to allow priests to enter into same-sex civil partnerships. The Church of Nigeria amended its constitution to remove reference to Canterbury as the &#x27;mother&#x27; church of the Anglican Communion, and replaced that reference with a statement of being in communion with Anglican churches professing &quot;historic faith&quot;.

In March 2009, the Church declared itself in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, a denomination formed by American and Canadian Anglicans who opposed their national churches&#x27; actions with regard to homosexuality and equality.

In 2013, Nicholas Okoh, Primate of All Nigeria, opposed the Church of England&#x27;s decision to allow gay bishops, even if celibate, to enter into civil unions.

In March 2021, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said that Ndukuba&#x27;s call for &quot;the virus&quot; of homosexuality to be &quot;expunged&quot; was &quot;...unacceptable. It dehumanises those human beings of whom the statement speak&quot;.

=== Anglican Church in Central America ===
The Anglican Church in Central America consists of five churches representing different Central American countries. Each member church makes many of its own decisions. In 2013, priests and ministries in the Diocese of El Salvador began to advocate for the full inclusion of LGBT members. In 2014, the Episcopal Church of Costa Rica, a diocese of the province, took steps towards welcoming the LGBTQ community. The Diocese of Guatemala elected Silvestre Enrique Romero as bishop coadjutor in 2017. Prior to being elected bishop, Romero served in The Episcopal Church (US), and offered to bless same-sex unions as priest-in-charge.

===Anglican Church of Mexico===

In its general synod 2010 by initiative of its own primate Carlos Touché-Porter, synod delegates overwhelmingly approved stringent prohibition against blessings of same-gender couples.

The Anglican Church of Mexico only recognizes heterosexual marriage as the standard for canonical marriage in the church. Upon the approval of gay civil marriage in Mexico, then Primate Francisco Moreno expressed that the official stance of the Anglican Church of Mexico will continue in spite of secular legislation. However, the Anglican Church of Mexico, like the other North American provinces, has expressed in some particular instances more liberal views regarding gender and sexuality. Still, Francisco Moreno, Archbishop of Mexico, has opposed same-sex unions and the current canons do not provide for them. In 2007, Carlos Touché Porter, then-Presiding Bishop, became a patron of Inclusive Church (a charity based in England) advocating for &#x27;&quot;a liberal, open church which is inclusive of all,&#x27; regardless of race, gender or sexuality&quot;. Touché Porter also affirmed that Gene Robinson was not the first gay cleric, but that he was simply being honest. He also supported the ordination of openly gay clergy, and his diocese, the Diocese of Mexico, unofficially &quot;permits clergy in same-sex relationships to serve in the ministry&quot;. Furthermore, in 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI approached the Anglican Church with the possibility of joining the Catholic Church over issues of sexuality, Touché Porter, then-Presiding Bishop, reassured the Mexican province that he supported remaining within the Anglican Communion. Yet in 2010 Carlos Touché-Porter backtracked and promoted a stringent prohibition of any blessing of same-gender couples which was approved by the nation synod by a significant majority of delegates.

Also in 2008, Sergio Carranza, retired Bishop of (Central) Mexico, expressed support for the ordination of gay clergy. Among the affirming churches, St. Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church in Guadalajara, Jalisco is publicly supportive of gay, lesbian, and transgender members. Nevertheless, on the other side, Francisco Moreno, then-Presiding Bishop, has indicated that he supports marriage as defined &quot;between a man and a woman&quot;.

In 2015, at least one congregation &quot;opened its doors&quot; to bless same-gender couples. The church has discussed same-gender unions at its General Synod. In 2019, Ricardo Gomez Osnaya, Bishop of Western Mexico, licensed an openly gay and married priest to serve within the diocese. In 2021, Julio C. Martin and the Diocese of the Southeast officially participated in and supported LGBT Pride, calling for the legalization of civil same-sex marriage. Also in 2021, Martin proposed a draft version of a policy allowing the blessing of same-gender unions, and the proposed policy is not yet official and is under discussion and review.

As to gay marriage, the newest bishop in the Province has openly spoken in support of civil and ecclesiastical same-gender marriage, Canadian-educated Julio C. Martín, Bishop of the Southeast.

Although unofficially, in the diocese of Mexico bishops have allowed clergy to be in informal non-recognized same-sex relationships, while in the Diocese of Western Mexico a retired gay priest officially in a secular civil marriage has been allowed to teach at its seminary.

In 2016, the General Synod of the church published a pronouncement declaring itself to be against all forms of violence and discrimination against migrants, victims of violence, or the LGBTI community.

On 19 December 2020, three diocesan Bishops released a statement explaining that they are discussing issues related to the LGBT community and church teaching, and are working towards a common understanding.

In 2021 for the first time ever a Mexican Anglican Diocese participated in a Gay Pride Parade; on 19 June 2021, under the leadership of its bishop, Julio C. Martin, the Diocese of the Southeast joined demands for equal civil marriage and gay rights in the city of Xalapa, Veracruz. Later, Martin expressly called on secular authorities to respect the Federal Supreme Court&#x27;s decision and legalise gay civil marriage.

===Anglican Church of Southern Africa===
The canon law of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa states that &quot;marriage by divine institution is a lifelong and exclusive union partnership between one man and one woman&quot; and makes no provision for same-sex weddings or for blessing same-sex civil unions. The Diocese of Saldanha Bay has approved the blessing of same-sex civil unions as a provision on the diocesan level. At the same time, the church does not have an official stance on homosexuality itself. However, it has been reported of Thabo Makgoba, Archbishop of Cape Town, that &quot;The Anglican Primate, [is] one among few church leaders in Africa to support same-sex marriage.&quot; Makgoba and his working group on human sexuality have proposed a motion &quot;… to amend Canon 34 which will enable ministry to those in Same Sex Unions and the LGBTI Community in the context in which ACSA operates in Southern Africa&quot;. In 2023, the Synod of Bishops agreed to develop &quot;prayers of affirmation and acknowledgement for all faithful Anglicans who are in civil unions.&quot;

A previous archbishop, Desmond Tutu, said that: &quot;The Jesus I worship is not likely to collaborate with those who vilify and persecute an already oppressed minority [...]. I could not myself keep quiet whilst people were being penalised for something about which they could do nothing, their sexuality. For it is so improbable that any sane, normal person would deliberately choose a lifestyle exposing him or her to so much vilification, opprobrium and physical abuse, even death. To discriminate against our sisters and brothers who are lesbian or gay on grounds of their sexual orientation for me is as totally unacceptable and unjust as Apartheid ever was.&quot;

Another former archbishop, Njongonkulu Ndungane, has criticised other African churches regarding homosexuality and said that the church&#x27;s attention should be focused on other concerns such as AIDS and poverty. Nevertheless, Ndungane expressed publicly his disapproval of same-sex marriage when it was legalised in South Africa: &quot;As far as we are concerned as a church, our understanding of marriage is between a man and a woman. And as a church, and the Anglican Church in particular, we have said no to same-sex unions.&quot; However, in 2016, the bishops of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa voted to affirm members in same-gender marriages as fully equal members of the Church. Raphael Hess, Bishop of Saldanha Bay, has backed same-sex marriage and is proposing a way to allow gay priests to marry. Tutu also gave his daughter and her partner a blessing.

Additionally, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa does not have an official policy regarding the ordination of openly gay or lesbian clergy and, thus, some may identify as LGBT depending on their diocese. In 2003, for example, Rowan Smith, Dean of St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in Cape Town, was warmly celebrated by his congregation after coming out as gay. Douglas Torr, another priest, also came out to his congregation in Johannesburg. Moreover, Mervyn Castle, who is openly gay and celibate, was consecrated suffragan bishop in Cape Town. Still, while gay and lesbian clergy may be locally ordained, the national church has not yet developed liturgies to bless same-gender unions.

Nevertheless, the Diocese of Cape Town, in 2009, did vote in favour of recognising same-gender unions pastorally and the diocese committed itself to studying the issue further. The vote in 2009 &quot;[had] taken a small step towards accepting gay people in &#x27;faithful, committed relationships.&#x27;&quot; The resolution also said that it is &quot;Affirming a pastoral response to same-sex partnerships of faithful commitment in our parish families;&quot; Also in 2009, Makgoba said that &quot;[g]ays and lesbians can be leaders within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa as long as they remain celibate, its synod of bishops has declared.&quot;

In 2013, the Provincial Synod adopted a resolution that &quot;urged its bishops to provide guidelines for giving pastoral care to same-sex couples who have entered civil unions under South African law&quot;. The resolution also:
# Affirms:
## That God calls us to love and minister to all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, while at the same time upholding God&#x27;s standards of holiness;
## That this is a highly complex and emotive area which affects many people deeply and has a far reaching impact on the mission of the Church.
In 2016, Raphael Hess, Bishop of Sadanha Bay, gave permission for an Anglican priest to officiate at a service of celebration for Mpho Tutu and her partner. When Tutu surrendered her licence to avoid controversy, Hess stated that he &quot;hoped it would be short-lived&quot; and that he is proposing to change policy to welcome her back. Her father, Desmond Tutu, gave &quot;a father&#x27;s blessing&quot;.

Currently, priests may not enter into a same-sex marriage, but the church does allow &quot;same-sex relationships if they are celibate&quot;. Also in 2016, Makgoba said &quot;we also tried at the Synod of Bishops to draw up guidelines for clergy wanting to bless couples in same-sex unions, or who want to enter same-sex unions themselves ... On this issue, I had to report back to the Synod, the only agreement we reached is that we were not of one mind&quot;. Yet, the bishops did agree that LGBT people, including members in same-sex marriages, are affirmed as &quot;full members&quot; of the church.

The Diocese of Saldanha Bay proposed the blessing of same-gender unions and the licensing of LGBTI priests in civil marriages. During the provincial synod, the proposal did not receive enough votes and was not passed. Makgoba, however, declared that &quot;all is not lost&quot;. He said the issue might hopefully be taken up again at the next provincial synod in 2019. He also said the issue could be discussed at the local level in parishes and dioceses. Makgoba further noted how relatively liberal the province is saying &quot;As it was, the degree of support for the motion was quite substantial if you compare us to other African provinces of the Anglican Church, most of which are vigorously opposed to same-sex unions in any form.&quot; He also voiced his support for same-sex marriage.

The Diocese of False Bay has also been supportive of LGBTI clergy and members having celebrated the ministry of one of its openly gay priests. The Diocese of Pretoria joined the list of dioceses that support same-sex marriage in the Anglican Church. At least one priest, who is in a same-sex relationship with his partner, has spoken to the press acknowledging that the church ordained him knowing of his relationship.

In a pastoral letter published on 2 March 2017, the Bench of Bishops said that they continue to discuss &quot;the Pastoral Guidelines for ministry to those in same-sex relationships, which are still incomplete. We asked Archbishop Thabo to set up a small group of Bishops to work on completing them, together with others who could help the process.&quot; Makgoba is proposing a change to the canons following that process. In 2019, the Provincial Synod approved a motion to establish a permanent commission on human sexuality and to refer a report to dioceses that recommends allowing each diocese to choose to offer prayers for a couple following a same-sex civil union; on a third motion to request the Bishops provide guidelines for ministry to LGBTQI people, the synod was deadlocked, and did not pass, in a tied vote of 75 in favour to 75 against. In 2023, the Archbishop&#x27;s Commission on Human Sexuality proposed allowing clergy to bless same-sex civil unions; the Synod of Bishops rejected the proposal for blessings but did agree to allow prayers to be said to affirm and acknowledge same-sex couples in civil unions. On April 25, 2024, the church published draft prayers to be said with same-sex couples, asking members of the church to study the draft prayers. The drafted prayers include both blessings for same-sex couples and prayers acknowledging disagreement with same-sex relationships.

===Episcopal Church of the Sudan===
The Primate of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, Archbishop Daniel Deng Bul, on 22 July at a public press conference during the 2008 Lambeth Conference called for Bishop Gene Robinson to resign, and for all those who had participated in his consecration to confess their sins to the conference.

===Anglican Church of Tanzania===

In November 2003, responding to the consecration of Bishop Gene Robinson, Archbishop Donald Mtetemela stated his belief that homosexuality is against biblical teaching: &quot;The Anglican Church of Tanzania believes that homosexuality is contrary to the teaching of the Word of God. It is a sin.&quot; Mtetemela declared that the Church of Tanzania was no longer in communion with Episcopal Church bishops who participated in the consecration of Robinson, and those who permit the blessing of same-sex unions.

===Church of Uganda===

The Ugandan church cut ties with its North American counterparts over homosexuality. It declared itself in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, a denomination not recognised by the Anglican Communion that was formed by lay and clergy members who had left The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada over matters of LGBTQ inclusion.

In 2005, Henry Luke Orombi, then Archbishop of Uganda, criticised the Church of England for permitting priests to enter into same-sex civil partnerships. In 2013, Stanley Ntagali, Archbishop of Uganda, maintained opposition to clergy in civil unions opposing the Church of England&#x27;s decision to allow bishops to register a civil partnership. Ntagali stated that &quot;to allow clergy in civil partnerships to be eligible to become Bishops is really no different from allowing gay Bishops. This decision violates our Biblical faith and agreements within the Anglican Communion.&quot; Ntagali compared England&#x27;s decision to those made in other western Anglican provinces. &quot;Sadly we must also declare that if the Church of England continues in this contrary direction we must further separate ourselves from it and we are prepared to take the same actions as those prompted by the decisions of The Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada ten years ago.&quot;

=== Church of Melanesia ===
In 1998, the Council of Bishops requested that Terry Brown, Bishop of Malaita, &quot;draft a study paper on homosexuality for the Church of Melanesia ...&quot;. In 2007, Brown reflected on his experience &quot;as an &#x27;out&#x27; gay man serving as bishop&quot;.

=== Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church ===
On 22 March 2017, the Synod of the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church released a statement of support expressing its solidarity with the Spanish Evangelical Church after the latter had accepted same-sex relationships. In supporting the Spanish Evangelical Church, the Episcopal Synod joined LGBT advocacy groups by protesting its removal from the Evangelical Council of Madrid. GAFCON, a conservative association of Anglican churches, formed a rival alternative church structure in Spain in opposition to the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church.

=== Episcopal Church of South Sudan ===

As of 2023, South Sudan&#x27;s Episcopal Church is strongly opposed to homosexuality. Reverend Justin Badi Arama is the Primate of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan. He also has the role of Chairman of the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, a conservative group of Anglican provinces. Badi has affirmed that &quot;marriage is between man and a woman&quot;, and has urged the Anglican communion to impose sanctions on provinces that allow same sex marriages to be conducted.

=== Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church ===

In 2020, the Bishop of the Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church in Portugal, Jorge Pina Cabral, re-affirmed that the church recognized the Archbishop of Canterbury as the &quot;first among equals&quot; among the bishops of the Anglican Communion and that he supports allowing a diversity of views within the Anglican Communion on human sexuality, saying he favors reconciliation among the member churches of the Communion.

<text>Mud (probably , or Middle Dutch) is loam, silt or clay mixed with water. Mud is usually formed after rainfall or near water sources. Ancient mud deposits hardened over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as shale or mudstone (generally called lutites). When geological deposits of mud are formed in estuaries, the resultant layers are termed bay muds. Mud has also been used for centuries as a construction resource for mostly houses and also used as a binder. An Old English word for it was [[fen]], now in most dialects referring to a type of wetland.
== Building and construction ==

=== Adhesive ===
In the construction industry, mud is a semi-fluid material that can be used to coat, seal, or adhere materials. The term &quot;mud&quot; can be used for various semi-fluid materials used in construction including slurry, mortar, plaster, stucco, and concrete.

=== Material ===

Mud, cob, adobe, clay, and many other names are historically used synonymously to mean a mixture of subsoil and water possibly with the addition of stones, gravel, straw, lime, and/or bitumen. This material was used a variety of ways to build walls, floors and even roofs. For thousands of years it was common in most parts of the world to build walls using mudbricks or the wattle and daub, rammed earth or cob techniques and cover the surfaces with earthen plaster.

==== Mudbrick ====
Mud can be made into mud bricks, also called adobe, by mixing mud with water, placing the mixture into moulds and then allowing it to dry in open air. Straw is sometimes used as a binder within the bricks, as it makes them a composite. When the brick would otherwise break, the straw will redistribute the force throughout the brick, decreasing the chance of breakage. Such buildings must be protected from groundwater, usually by building upon a masonry, fired brick, rock or rubble foundation, and also from wind-driven rain in damp climates, usually by deep roof overhangs. In extremely dry climates a well-drained flat roof may be protected with a well-prepared (puddled) and properly maintained dried mud coating, viable as the mud will expand when moistened and so become more water resistant. Adobe mudbricks were commonly used by the Pueblo Indians to build their homes and other necessary structures. In some countries there are entire cities made of mud brick houses.
Cow dung and biomass are added to regulate indoor climate.

==== Fired brick ====

Mud that is mostly clay, or a mixture of clay and sand may be used for ceramics, of which one form is the common fired brick. Fired brick are more durable but consume much more energy to produce.

==== Stabilized mud ====

Stabilized mud (earth, soil) is mud which has had a binder such as cement or bitumen added. Examples are mudcrete, landcrete, and soil cement.

== Pottery ==
Pottery is made by forming a clay body into objects of a required shape and heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all the water from the clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum pug or manually by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.

In ceramics, the making of liquid mud (called slip) is a stage in the process of refinement of the materials, since larger particles will settle from the liquid.

== Habitat ==
=== Land ===
Mud can provide a home for numerous types of animals, including varieties of worms, frogs, snails, clams, and crayfish. Other animals, such as hippopotamuses, pigs, rhinoceroses, water buffalo and elephants, bathe in mud in order to cool off and protect themselves from the sun. Submerged mud can be home to larvae of various insects.

=== Marine life ===
Mud plays an important role in the marine ecosystem. The activities of burrowing animals and fish have a dramatic churning effect on muddy seabeds. This allows the exchange and cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and minerals between water and sediment.

Below the surface, the burrows of some species form intricate lattice-like networks and may penetrate a meter or more downwards. This means that the burrowed mud is a productive habitat, providing food and shelter for a wide range of mud-dwellers and other animals that forage in and over the mud.

== Problems ==

Mud can pose problems for motor traffic when moisture is present, because every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface, so a layer of mud on the surface of the road or tires can cause the vehicle to hydroplane. People and cars can also become stuck in mud, as in quicksand.

Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of groundwater may trigger a movement of soil or sediments, possibly causing mudslides, landslides, avalanches, or sinkholes. Mudslides in volcanic terrain (called lahars) occur after eruptions as rain remobilizes loose ash deposits. Mudslides are also common in the western United States during El Niño years due to prolonged rainfall.

== As food ==
Geophagia is the practice of eating earth or soil-like substances, also known as geophagy, and is practiced by some non-human primates and by humans in some cultures. In other human cultures it is considered an eating disorder and classed as Pica. 

===Foods named &quot;mud&quot; ===
Mississippi mud pie is a chocolate based dessert pie. Mud cookies (baked from literal dirt mixed with oil, water, etc.) are also eaten in the poorest parts of Haiti. Children&#x27;s recipes for &quot;mud&quot; also exist, which is generally a chocolate or cornstarch-based sludge used more for visual appeal than actual taste. However, it does not contain real mud. &quot;Mud&quot; is also a colloquial slang word for coffee, especially when thick, strong, and/or dark.

== Recreation ==


=== Mud bath ===

A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can combine with volcanic ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and can be found now in high-end spas.

=== Mud wallow ===
Mud wallows are a common source of entertainment for children. Mud wallows can be any shape, size, depth and some can have water as well as mud. Usually wallows are shallow dips in the ground that have been flooded and were full of dirt and those two have mixed to make a squishy mud wallow.

===Mud sports===

Mud sports are sports that take place in, or heavily incorporate, mud. Examples include:
*Mud bogging, an off-road motorsport popular in Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length.
*Mud runs, where contestants run and crawl through mud bogs and other obstacles.
*Dirt biking, biking through muddy tracks and courses.
*Mud wrestling, a form of wrestling that takes place in mud.

=== Other uses ===
* Mud can be used in a dunk tank.
* Baseball rubbing mud is used to remove the sheen from new baseballs.
* Children often like to make mud pies, throw mud at each other and play barefoot and cover their bare feet in mud and squish it between their toes. 
*Mud can be smeared across the skin as a repellent from mosquitoes.
*Many animals cover themselves in mud (wallowing) to cool off.

<text>Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) along the lengths of their bodies. It contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as many species in the genus &quot;Corydoras&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The family derives its name from the Greek words (, &#x27;beautiful&#x27;) and (, &#x27;fish&#x27;). Callichthyidae is one of six families in the superfamily Loricarioidea, and is sister to a clade formed by Scoloplacidae, Astroblepidae, and Loricariidae. Within the family Callichthyidae, the two subfamilies have eight genera and about 177 species, accounting for about 7% of all catfish. Most of these species are in the genus &quot;Corydoras&quot;, the largest catfish genus.

The subfamily Corydoradinae includes about 90% of the species in the family Callichthyidae and is one of the most diverse siluriform assemblages in the Neotropics, with about 170 valid species. It includes two tribes, Aspidoradini and Corydoradini. Aspidoradini contains &quot;Aspidoras&quot; and &quot;Scleromystax&quot;, while Corydoradini contains &quot;Corydoras&quot; and &quot;Brochis&quot;. Some believe the genus &quot;Brochis&quot; should be synonymized with &quot;Corydoras&quot;.

The subfamily Callichthyinae contains &quot;Callichthys&quot;, &quot;Dianema&quot;, &quot;Hoplosternum&quot;, &quot;Lepthoplosternum&quot;, and &quot;Megalechis&quot;. According to a 1997 paper, &quot;Callichthys&quot; is the most basal member of the subfamily. In a 2004 study, different relationships among the callichthyines were found: &quot;Dianema&quot; and &quot;Hoplosternum&quot; form the most basal clade, and &quot;Callichthys&quot; is sister to &quot;Lepthoplosternum&quot; and &quot;Megalechis&quot;. In a 2013 study, Dianema is the sister group of all the remaining genera.

==Fossil record==
The first known fossil species of callichthyid is &quot;Corydoras revelatus&quot; from Salta, Argentina, of the late Paleocene. This species is tentatively placed in &quot;Corydoras&quot;, but is unambiguously a member of the subfamily Corydoradinae. It indicates that the lineages leading to the two callichthyid subfamilies occurred at least by the late Paleocene. It also suggests an earlier differentiation of loricarioids in comparison to other catfishes, or a lack of older fossils of other Neotropical groups.

A fossil identified as a &quot;Hoplosternum&quot; species has also been identified from the middle Miocene in the La Venta formation, Magdalena River basin, Colombia.

==Distribution==
The Neotropical family Callichthyidae is found in most South American river drainages (Paraná-Paraguay, São Francisco, Atlantic Coastal basins in Brazil, Amazon, Orinoco, Maracaibo, Magdalena). &quot;Hoplosternum punctatum&quot; is the only species in Central America, as it occurs in a few rivers in Panama. Callichthyidae present the highest species richness in the headwaters of the Amazonas drainage and those rivers draining the Guiana Shield.

The subfamily Corydoradinae is found east of the Andes and north of the Rio de La Plata system. Representatives of the Corydoradinae are found in several freshwater environments, ranging from fast-flowing streams with sandy or rocky bottoms to lowland pools with muddy bottoms. A single species, &quot;Aspidoras mephisto&quot;, is a cavefish.

==Description==

Callichthyids are fairly small catfish, and range in size from some tiny &quot;Corydoras&quot; species that do not exceed to &quot;Hoplosternum littorale&quot;, which some sources list as growing to a length of up to TL. The mouth is small and ventral with one or two pairs of well-developed barbels. The dorsal and pectoral fins have strong spines, and a spine is found at the anterior border of the adipose fin. In many species of this family, these spines are also venomous as an added deterrent to predators.

The scutes that give these fish their name are one of their most prominent characteristics. The body has two rows of overlapping bony plates on each side. The plates are arranged so they overlap along the rows as well as between the rows, providing protection but also allowing some freedom of movement. These scutes connect with the solid bones of the head, and the head itself may be covered with bony plates. The upper row of lateral scutes may either meet on the back or a narrow bare area may be filled with small oval or roundish bony platelets.

Species of the Corydoradinae are of small size (maximum about in standard length) and are easily distinguished from other callichthyids by their deep bodies and short maxillary barbels.

==Ecology==
Living habits are varied; the family includes both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit a wide range of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy ones where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air, collecting and swallowing it at the water&#x27;s surface. The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.

Breeding habits are also variable. Corydoradines breed over the substrate (such as rocks, logs, or leaves) as most catfish. However, the members of the subfamily Callichthyinae are known for building and guarding floating foam bubble nests; &quot;Hoplosternum littorale&quot; is reported to have the most complex nest structure. These floating nests are made of foam and plant debris. Spawning and caring for the eggs and larvae takes place in these nests. Parental care in callichthyines is by the male. In &quot;Corydoras&quot; and &quot;Hoplosternum&quot;, fertilization of eggs involves &#x27;sperm drinking&#x27;; the female and male form the &quot;T-position&quot; with the female&#x27;s mouth over the male&#x27;s genital opening, and then the female drinks the sperm, releasing the sperm and eggs simultaneously.

==Relationship to humans==
Some species are quite common in South America and are fished commercially. They are usually cooked in their bony armor. Some callichthyids, especially species of &quot;Corydoras&quot;, are popular as ornamental fish in the fishkeeping hobby.

<text>Delia Ann Smith (born 18 June 1941) is an English cook and television presenter, known for teaching basic cookery skills in a direct style. One of the best-known celebrity chefs in British popular culture, Smith has influenced viewers to become more culinarily adventurous. She is also notable for her role as Honorary Life President (with her husband Michael Wynn-Jones)of Norwich City, where she was previously the Joint Majority Shareholder alongside Wynn-Jones from
1998 to 2024.

==Early life==
Born to Harold Bartlett Smith (1920–1999), an English RAF radio operator and tool salesman, and a Welsh mother, Etty Jones Lewis (1919–2020), in Woking, Surrey, her parents divorced when she was 15 years old and her brother was aged 7. Smith attended Bexleyheath School, leaving at the age of 16 without any qualifications. Her first job was as a hairdresser; she also worked as a shop assistant and in a travel agency.

==Cookery career==
In 1962 at age 21, she started work in a small restaurant in Paddington, washing dishes before moving on to waitressing, then helping with the cooking. She started reading English cookery books in the Reading Room at the British Museum, trying out the recipes on a Harley Street family with whom she was living. Her next job was at Carlton Studios in London, where she prepared food for studio photography.

In 1969 Smith was taken on as the cookery writer for the &quot;Daily Mirror&#x27;s&quot; newly launched magazine. Their deputy editor was Michael Wynn-Jones, whom she later married. Her first piece featured kipper pâté, beef in beer and cheesecake. She baked the cake that was used on the cover of The Rolling Stones&#x27; album &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, which she later recalled was in response to a request that was for &quot;a gaudy cake&quot; that had to look &quot;really horrible.&quot; In 1972 Smith started a column in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. She later defected to the rival &quot;Evening News&quot;, but she returned to &quot;the Standard&quot; when that newspaper bought out &quot;the News&quot;. She wrote for both for 12 years; later she wrote a column for the &quot;Radio Times&quot; until 1986.

Smith&#x27;s first television appearances came in the early 1970s, as resident cook on BBC East&#x27;s regional magazine programme &quot;Look East&quot;, shown on BBC One across East Anglia. Following this, she was offered her own cookery television show, &quot;Family Fare&quot; which ran between 1973 and 1975.

Smith became a recognisable figure amongst young people in the 1970s and early 1980s when she was an occasional guest on the BBC&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;Multicoloured Swap Shop&quot;, giving basic cooking demonstrations.

In Taiwan, Smith was compared to Taiwanese chef Fu Pei-mei, and she was called the &quot;Fu Pei-mei of England&quot;.

Her 1995 book &quot;Delia Smith&#x27;s The Winter Collection&quot; sold 2 million copies in hardback, becoming the fifth biggest-selling book of the 1990s.

In 2003 Smith announced her retirement from television. However, she returned for an eponymous six-part series airing on the BBC in Spring 2008. The accompanying book, an update of her 1971 best-seller &quot;How to Cheat at Cooking&quot;, was published in February 2008, again becoming a best-seller.

In 2010 she appeared in a five-episode series, &quot;Delia through the Decades&quot;, with each episode exploring a new decade of her cooking. Also in 2010, Smith and Heston Blumenthal were signed up to appear in a series of 40 commercials on British television for the supermarket chain Waitrose.

In February 2013 she announced that she had retired from television cookery programmes, and would concentrate on offering her recipes online.

Smith has twice been the guest for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;: first on 5 June 1982, when her choices included &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; by Paul Simon and &quot;Llef&quot; by Rhos Male Voice Choir, and again on Christmas Eve 2023, when her choices included &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; by Kate Bush and &quot;Happy&quot; by Pharrell Williams.

==The &quot;Delia effect&quot;==
It has been claimed that Smith&#x27;s television series &quot;Delia&#x27;s How to Cook&quot; led to a 10% rise in egg sales in Britain and her use of ingredients such as frozen mash and tinned minced beef and onions, or utensils such as an omelette pan, could cause sell-outs overnight. This phenomenon, dubbed the &quot;Delia effect&quot;, was most recently seen in 2008, after her book &quot;How to Cheat at Cooking&quot; was published. Her fame (and her relatively uncommon name) has meant that her first name has become sufficient to identify her to the public and the &quot;Delia effect&quot; has become a commonly used phrase to describe a run on a previously poor-selling product as a result of a high-profile recommendation.

==Business interests==
From 1993 to 1998 Smith worked as a consultant for Sainsbury&#x27;s. In May 1993 she and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones launched New Crane Publishing to publish Sainsbury&#x27;s Magazine; the company also published several of Smith&#x27;s books for BBC Worldwide. Although Smith and Wynn-Jones sold New Crane Publishing in 2005, Smith continues to be a consultant for Seven Publishing which now publishes the magazine.

===Football===
In the 2023 episode of Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Lavern, Smith said her husband Michael Wynn-Jones introduced her to the &quot;beautiful&quot; game of football. 

Smith has developed other business interests outside of her culinary ventures, notably a majority shareholding of 53% in the football team Norwich City, with her husband. Both Smith and Wynn-Jones were season ticket holders at Norwich and were invited to invest in the club, which had fallen on hard times. She has had a significant impact on improving matchday catering standards and food revenues, only stepping back from day to day responsibilities on reaching the age of 70.

In February 2005, Smith attracted attention during the half-time break of a home match against Manchester City. At the time Norwich were fighting an ultimately unsuccessful battle against relegation from the Premier League, and to rally the crowd, Smith grabbed the microphone from the club announcer on the pitch and said: &quot;A message for the best football supporters in the world: we need a 12th man here. Where are you? Where are you? Let&#x27;s be &#x27;avin&#x27; you! Come on!&quot; Norwich lost the match 3–2. Smith denied suggestions in the media that she had been drunk while delivering the speech though she did concede that &quot;maybe in the heat of the moment I didn&#x27;t choose the best words&quot;.

In 2008, it was reported that Smith had rejected an offer from Norfolk-born billionaire Peter Cullum, who wished to invest £20 million in the club, but wanted Smith and the other shareholders to relinquish their holdings. Both Smith and Cullum denied this offer had been made, with Smith telling the football club&#x27;s AGM that she and her husband would be &quot;very happy to stand aside&quot; as majority shareholders if someone came along with an offer to buy them out.

In August 2011, Smith announced that, anticipating her 70th birthday, she was stepping down from her catering role at Norwich City&#x27;s Carrow Road football ground: &quot;It is now time for a fresh approach and a younger team who, I am confident, will take the business even further.&quot;

Smith &amp; Wynn-Jones&#x27;s twenty-eight years of involvement with Norwich City came to an end on 23 October 2024, when the club&#x27;s other shareholders approved a deal that allowed Norfolk Holdings, a business group lead by the American businessman Mark Attanasio that previously purchased a 40.4% stake in the club in April 2024, to increase their stake in the club to 85% and take majority control, with Smith and Wynn-Jones&#x27;s shares decreasing to 10%. As part of the deal, Smith and Wynn-Jones also agreed to stand down from their roles as club directors and become honorary life presidents of the club.

==Honours and awards==
Already an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), Smith was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours, &quot;in recognition of ... [her] contribution to television cookery and recipe writing&quot;.

In 1996, Smith was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Nottingham, a fellowship from St Mary&#x27;s University College (a college of the University of Surrey) and a Fellowship from the Royal Television Society. In 1999 she received an honorary degree from the University of East Anglia and in 2000, a fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University.

In 2012 Smith was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of the last six decades.

She was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to cookery.

==Personal life==
Smith was baptised in the Church of England, and attended a Methodist Sunday School, a Congregationalist Brownie group and later a Church of England youth group. At the age of twenty-two, she converted to Catholicism. Her first two short religious books, &quot;A Feast for Lent&quot; (1983) and &quot;A Feast for Advent&quot; (1983), are readings and reflections for these seasons. In 1988 she wrote a longer book on prayer, &quot;A Journey into God&quot;.

Smith became friends with the Catholic art historian Sister Wendy Beckett, selecting Beckett&#x27;s book, &quot;100 Best-loved Paintings,&quot; in her second appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; broadcast in December 2023, four decades apart from her first invitation, in 1982.

In 2012 Smith criticised atheism, stating that &quot;militant neo-atheists and devout secularists are busting a gut to drive us [religious people] off the radar and try to convince us that we hardly exist.&quot;

<text>Yan Lift, incorporated as Lift Engineering &amp; Mfg. Co., was a major ski lift manufacturer in North America. Founded in 1965 and based in Carson City, Nevada, the company built at least 200 fixed-grip chairlifts, as well as 31 high-speed quads. The company&#x27;s lifts have been involved in the deaths of five people and the injury of at least 70, the worst total safety record of any ski-lift maker operating in North America.

The firm came under scrutiny by state safety officials after a fatal incident in 1985. After a series of equipment failures, Yan Lifts were outlawed in certain states including California and Colorado. The company later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996 after multiple other incidents resulting in 3 deaths. Eventually, Yan Lifts manufactured new track and cables for the Angels Flight funicular, but the company, now called YanTrak, went out of business in 2001 after a major accident.

The last detachable chairlift made fully designed and built by Yan, La Roca, located at Espot Esquí, closed in 2019 after failure leading to one of the chairs falling off the line occurred.

Only one Lift Engineering Detachable remains, found at the Nazhvan Forest Park in Iran. It uses the safer Pol-X-West grips which retrofit traditional coil springs instead of the rubber ones.

==History ==

===1965–85===
Lift Engineering was founded by Janek Kunczynski, a Polish immigrant and former ski racer who initially worked at Poma. He left Poma in 1965 and founded the company Lift Engineering to build his own ski lifts. One of his first customers was Squaw Valley. The name &quot;Yan&quot; is the English spelling of his first name, and the brand under which Kunczynski sold his lifts.

The company grew through the 1970s and 1980s. Kunczynski was known for dining with prospective clients (après-ski) instead of just simple negotiating, and would sketch plans out on paper napkins. Another attractive feature to buyers was the price. Kunczynski sold his lifts at prices well below those of larger manufacturers. Kunczynski is also credited with being the first manufacturer of ski lifts to incorporate aesthetics into the design of his equipment, creating sleek designs that were popular with ski resorts.

The company is most noted for designing fixed-grip chairlifts. Kunczynski created a standard system that was intended to be simple to operate and maintain. For example, Yan operator booths contain only two switches: a switch that stops and starts the lift, and one that selects its speed. The main controls were placed in a separate machine room. Lift Engineering was the first company to design and build its own low-voltage DC motor control tailored specifically to the ski lift industry (System 4200 and later Base 10). Yan&#x27;s tower designs were also overbuilt, meaning that it was possible to turn a triple chair into a fixed quad just by changing the chairs.

===1985–95===
Lift Engineering entered a new market of high-speed detachable chairlifts in the 1980s. Whereas other ski lift firms spent as much as four years developing these lifts, Yan installed its first after only one year of research and development, at June Mountain in California.

By the late 1980s, Lift Engineering was one of the largest suppliers of ski lifts based in North America.

Lift Engineering also was an important player in the funitel market in the late 1980s. The quad mono cable, or QMC, was invented by Kunczynski (US Patent 4,848,241). The lift consisted of four separate loops of cable, strung between the upper and lower stations. Two cables were run in the uphill direction, and two were run in the downhill direction. The cabins would be mounted between the cables. But, because the cables were looped, once the cabins reached the upper station, the cables would loop back downhill not carrying a load. Only one of these lifts was ever built, and first opened to the public in 1988 at June Mountain. The owners allegedly had difficulty getting the cables to run in synchronicity. The lift also developed the same grip problems that occurred on the Yan high-speed quads, and ceased operation in 1996.

==Controversies and accidents==
Despite questions about safety, Yan managed to sell a total of 31 high-speed quads in the United States and Canada. Many of the lifts have since been retrofitted by companies such as Poma and Doppelmayr. A controversial figure, Yanek Kunczynksi was a Polish immigrant and figurehead of the company. He brought experience from French chair lift making company, Poma to his American company: Lift Engineering. He was known for taking away what he deemed as unnecessary parts and substituting certain equipment for others, examples of this include replacing aluminum towers for steel ones and swapping rubber rings for steel coils. Many blame him for the accidents, though he claims that bad maintenance are the culprits for the lift failures.

Yan high speed lifts were notorious for their grip slippage and sometimes required hours of running in the morning to realign the chairs following slippage over night. This led to nicknames such as &quot;Yankee Slipper&quot; a play on the lifts actual name &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot; now known as the Grand Summit Express at Mount Snow, Vermont.

===Keystone, Colorado, accident (1985)===
Potential problems with Yan lifts began to surface as early as December 14, 1985, when the upper bullwheel on the Teller lift at Keystone Ski Resort in Colorado disconnected from the main gearbox shaft. The lift was unique in its design as there was no support underneath the bullwheel. Lift Engineering had explained when the lift first opened the year before that a support beam underneath was not necessary. They claimed the pressure of the system along with the welds would keep the bullwheel in place. Faulty welding would be blamed for the accident. Two people were killed and 47 injured. The Teller lift, and its twin lift, Santiago, were two triple chairlifts constructed in 1984 as part of Keystone&#x27;s North Peak expansion. Teller was rebuilt by Yan and renamed the Ruby lift, free of charge. Santiago was replaced by a Doppelmayr high speed quad in 1998 and relocated to Big Sky, Montana, while Ruby was replaced by a Poma high speed six pack in 2000.

During the late 1980s, the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board began to question the safety of Yan&#x27;s lifts. They learned that Kunczynski, in his drive to build affordable ski lifts, regularly sent steel parts to be welded together in ski area parking lots. The Board alleged that Kunczynski&#x27;s lifts were unsafe. The ski industry blasted the Board and continued to install Yan lifts.

=== Sierra Ski Ranch, (Currently Known As: Sierra-At-Tahoe) California, accident (1993) ===
On April 4, 1993, a 9-year old boy was killed and another child injured when loose bolts and a subsequent deraillment caused two chairs to stack up on Sierra Ski Ranch’s Slingshot lift.  The same lift had sent an empty chair to the ground two months prior when a grip failed.  Lift Engineering settled a wrongful-death suit after the accident for $1.9 million. Sierra Ski Ranch’s marketing director would later state, “we found they just didn’t withstand the test of time” when the company committed $6 million to replace its three Yan detachables in 1996.

===Whistler, British Columbia, accident (1995)===
Yan detachable lifts were subject to a series of accidents, most notably the Quicksilver lift at Whistler Mountain in British Columbia, Canada. The Quicksilver accident killed two and injured eight on December 23, 1995. The accident occurred when the emergency stop was used repeatedly. A chair started sliding downhill and struck the next chair which got stuck on a tower. This continued several times before a total of four chairs fell. The main problems with the Yan high-speed lifts were the chair grips. These were designed so that in order to stay connected to the cable, the chair had to be subject to gravity. The Yan grips, unlike most operating today, did not have high-tension coil springs, but rather rubber &quot;marshmallow&quot; springs that exerted much less force on the cable. The repeated emergency brake application was enough to shake the chairs free of the cable. The majority of government safety inspectors failed to detect these problems.

The Quicksilver chairlift, which served the Whistler Creekside base area, was replaced by the Creekside Gondola in 1997, built by Poma.

== Aftermath ==
Following the accident at Whistler, and reports of grip-slipping at a plethora of other mountains, 15 resorts spent millions of dollars either upgrading, or completely replacing their combined 31 detachable quads in the United States and Canada. June Mountain, the only mountain to use Yan&#x27;s type 7 grips in a funitel was forced to shut down the QMC Funitel leaving sole access to the mountain to the J1 lift (A 1960 Riblet double Chair). Doppelmayr, the company that took majority of the replacement contracts was so stretched in resources that 75% of their replacement grips came from Austria instead of their North American manufacturing plant.

POL-X West developed a new version of the YAN-7 detachable grip, the one that was used on the majority of the high-speed lifts, replacing the marshmallow springs with high-tension springs. The redesign was ordered by a group of British Columbia and Alberta ski resorts that included Silver Star and Lake Louise. This grip also proved unsatisfactory and the lifts were removed from 2002–2004.

Many resorts suffered greatly from the economic burden of having to replace their workhorse lifts, such as contributing one million dollars in retrofit costs to Schweitzer&#x27;s 1996 bankruptcy, and Sun Valley who had 7 Yan High Speed Quads. In 2019, the second last Yan high speed quad La Roca, located at Espot Esqui in Spain, suffered a catastrophic failure leading to one of the chairs falling off the line. This chairlift had Type 7 grips and the original terminals with replaced chairs. As a result of this, the lift was shut down. On December 6, 2019, Espot opened their new La Roca high-speed quad, built by Leitner. The last Yan detachable lift remaining with Yan grips is in Iran(Nazhvan Forest Park, Isfahan, Iran) and uses the POL-X West grips. There are still many fixed grip lifts around the U.S. and Canada that are made by Yan, with one more in Val D&#x27;Isere, France(The Mont Blanc triple). At one time(c. 1975 - 1984), Val D&#x27;Isere had an entire fleet of Yan chairlifts. All except the Mont Blanc triple were replaced.

<text>James Tenney (August 10, 1934 – August 24, 2006) was an American composer and music theorist. He made significant early musical contributions to plunderphonics, sound synthesis, algorithmic composition, process music, spectral music, microtonal music, and tuning systems including extended just intonation. His theoretical writings variously concern musical form, texture, timbre, consonance and dissonance, and harmonic perception.

==Biography==

James Tenney was born in Silver City, New Mexico, and grew up in Arizona and Colorado. He attended the University of Denver, the Juilliard School of Music, Bennington College (B.A., 1958) and the University of Illinois (M.A., 1961). He studied piano with Eduard Steuermann and composition with Chou Wen-chung, Lionel Nowak, Paul Boepple, Henry Brant, Carl Ruggles, Kenneth Gaburo, John Cage, Harry Partch, and Edgard Varèse. He also studied acoustics, information theory and tape music composition under Lejaren Hiller. In 1961, Tenney completed an influential master&#x27;s thesis entitled &quot;Meta (+) Hodos&quot; that made one of the earliest applications, if not the earliest application, of gestalt theory and cognitive science to music. His later writings include &quot;Temporal gestalt perception in music&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Music Theory&quot;, the chapter &quot;John Cage and the Theory of Harmony&quot; in &quot;Writings about John Cage&quot;, and the book &quot;A History of Consonance and Dissonance&quot;, among others.

Tenney&#x27;s earliest works show the influence of Webern, Ruggles and Varèse, while a gradual assimilation of the ideas of John Cage influenced the development of his music in the 1960s. In 1961 he composed the early plunderphonic composition &quot;Collage No.1 (Blue Suede)&quot; (for tape) by sampling and manipulating a recording of Elvis Presley. His music from 1961 to 1964 was largely computer music completed at Bell Labs in New Jersey with Max Mathews. As such it constitutes one of the earliest significant bodies of algorithmically composed and computer synthesized music. Examples include &quot;Analog #1 (Noise Study)&quot; (1961) for tape using computer synthesized noise, and &quot;Phases&quot; (1963).

Tenney lived in or near New York City throughout the 1960s, where he was actively involved with Fluxus, the Judson Dance Theater, and the ensemble Tone Roads, which he co-founded with Malcolm Goldstein and Philip Corner. He was exceptionally dedicated to the music of American composer Charles Ives, many of whose compositions he conducted; his interpretation of Ives&#x27; &quot;Concord Sonata&quot; for piano was much praised.

Tenney collaborated closely as both musician and actor with his then-partner, the artist Carolee Schneemann (who he met in New York in 1955) until their separation in 1968. With Schneemann he co-starred in &quot;Fuses,&quot; a 1965 silent film of collaged and painted sequences of lovemaking. Tenney created the sound collages for Schneemann&#x27;s &quot;Viet Flakes&quot;, 1965, and &quot;Snows&quot;, 1970, and performed in the New York City production of &quot;Meat Joy&quot;, 1964, Schneemann&#x27;s orgiastic celebration of the expressive body.

In 1967 Tenney gave an influential FORTRAN workshop for a group of composers and Fluxus artists that included Steve Reich, Nam June Paik, Dick Higgins, Jackson Mac Low, Joseph Byrd, Phil Corner, Alison Knowles and Max Neuhaus. Tenney was one of four performers of Steve Reich&#x27;s &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; (1967) on May 27, 1969, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, alongside Michael Snow, Richard Serra and Bruce Nauman. Tenney also performed with Harry Partch (in a production of Partch&#x27;s &quot;The Bewitched&quot; in 1959), John Cage (in the mid-1960s), Steve Reich, and Philip Glass (the latter two in the late 1960s).

All of Tenney&#x27;s compositions after 1970 are instrumental music (occasionally with tape-delay), and most since 1972 reflect an interest in harmonic perception and unconventional tuning systems. Significant works include &quot;Clang&quot; (1972) for orchestra, &quot;Quintext&quot; (1972) for string quintet, &quot;Spectral CANON for CONLON Nancarrow&quot; (1974) for player piano, &quot;Glissade&quot; (1982) for viola, cello, double bass and tape delay system, &quot;Bridge&quot; (1982–84) for two pianos eight hands in a microtonal tuning system, &quot;Changes&quot; (1985) for six harps tuned a sixth of a semitone apart, &quot;Critical Band&quot; (1988) for variable instrumentation and &quot;In a Large Open Space&quot; (1994) for variable instrumentation. His pieces are often tributes to other composers or colleagues and subtitled as such.

Tenney taught at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Yale University, the California Institute of the Arts, the University of California, Santa Cruz, and York University in Toronto. His students include John Luther Adams, John Bischoff, Michael Byron, Allison Cameron, Raven Chacon, Eric de Visscher, Miguel Frasconi, Peter Garland, Douglas Kahn, Carson Kievman, Ingram Marshall, Andra McCartney, Larry Polansky, Carl Stone, Charlemagne Palestine, Marc Sabat, Chiyoko Szlavnics, Catherine Lamb, Michael Winter, Julie King, and Daniel Corral. ()

Tenney died on 24 August 2006 of lung cancer in Santa Clarita, California.

<text>Stochastic (; ) is the property of being well-described by a random probability distribution. &quot;Stochasticity&quot; and &quot;randomness&quot; are technically distinct concepts: the former refers to a modeling approach, while the latter describes phenomena; in everyday conversation, however, these terms are often used interchangeably. In probability theory, the formal concept of a &quot;stochastic process&quot; is also referred to as a &quot;random process&quot;.

Stochasticity is used in many different fields, including image processing, signal processing, computer science, information theory, telecommunications, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics, and cryptography. It is also used in finance (e.g., stochastic oscillator), due to seemingly random changes in the different markets within the financial sector and in medicine, linguistics, music, media, colour theory, botany, manufacturing and geomorphology.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;stochastic&quot; in English was originally used as an adjective with the definition &quot;pertaining to conjecturing&quot;, and stemming from a Greek word meaning &quot;to aim at a mark, guess&quot;, and the Oxford English Dictionary gives the year 1662 as its earliest occurrence. In his work on probability &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot;, originally published in Latin in 1713, Jakob Bernoulli used the phrase &quot;Ars Conjectandi sive Stochastice&quot;, which has been translated to &quot;the art of conjecturing or stochastics&quot;. This phrase was used, with reference to Bernoulli, by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz, who in 1917 wrote in German the word &quot;Stochastik&quot; with a sense meaning random. The term &quot;stochastic process&quot; first appeared in English in a 1934 paper by Joseph L. Doob. For the term and a specific mathematical definition, Doob cited another 1934 paper, where the term &quot;stochastischer Prozeß&quot; was used in German by Aleksandr Khinchin, though the German term had been used earlier in 1931 by Andrey Kolmogorov.

==Mathematics==
In the early 1930s, Aleksandr Khinchin gave the first mathematical definition of a stochastic process as a family of random variables indexed by the real line. Further fundamental work on probability theory and stochastic processes was done by Khinchin as well as other mathematicians such as Andrey Kolmogorov, Joseph Doob, William Feller, Maurice Fréchet, Paul Lévy, Wolfgang Doeblin, and Harald Cramér. Decades later Cramér referred to the 1930s as the &quot;heroic period of mathematical probability theory&quot;.

In mathematics, the theory of stochastic processes is an important contribution to probability theory, and continues to be an active topic of research for both theory and applications.

The word &quot;stochastic&quot; is used to describe other terms and objects in mathematics. Examples include a stochastic matrix, which describes a stochastic process known as a Markov process, and stochastic calculus, which involves differential equations and integrals based on stochastic processes such as the Wiener process, also called the Brownian motion process.

==Natural science==
One of the simplest continuous-time stochastic processes is Brownian motion. This was first observed by botanist Robert Brown while looking through a microscope at pollen grains in water.

==Physics==
The Monte Carlo method is a stochastic method popularized by physics researchers Stanisław Ulam, Enrico Fermi, John von Neumann, and Nicholas Metropolis. The use of randomness and the repetitive nature of the process are analogous to the activities conducted at a casino.
Methods of simulation and statistical sampling generally did the opposite: using simulation to test a previously understood deterministic problem. Though examples of an &quot;inverted&quot; approach do exist historically, they were not considered a general method until the popularity of the Monte Carlo method spread.

Perhaps the most famous early use was by Enrico Fermi in 1930, when he used a random method to calculate the properties of the newly discovered neutron. Monte Carlo methods were central to the simulations required for the Manhattan Project, though they were severely limited by the computational tools of the time. Therefore, it was only after electronic computers were first built (from 1945 on) that Monte Carlo methods began to be studied in depth. In the 1950s they were used at Los Alamos for early work relating to the development of the hydrogen bomb, and became popularized in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, and operations research. The RAND Corporation and the U.S. Air Force were two of the major organizations responsible for funding and disseminating information on Monte Carlo methods during this time, and they began to find a wide application in many different fields.

Uses of Monte Carlo methods require large amounts of random numbers, and it was their use that spurred the development of pseudorandom number generators, which were far quicker to use than the tables of random numbers which had been previously used for statistical sampling.

==Biology==
In biological systems the technique of stochastic resonance - introducing stochastic &quot;noise&quot; - has been found to help improve the signal-strength of the internal feedback-loops for balance and other vestibular communication. The technique has helped diabetic and stroke patients with balance control.

Many biochemical events lend themselves to stochastic analysis. Gene expression, for example, has a stochastic component through the molecular collisions—as during binding and unbinding of RNA polymerase to a gene promoter—via the solution&#x27;s Brownian motion.

==Creativity==
Simonton (2003, &quot;Psych Bulletin&quot;) argues that creativity in science (of scientists) is a constrained stochastic behaviour such that new theories in all sciences are, at least in part, the product of a stochastic process.

==Computer science==
Stochastic ray tracing is the application of Monte Carlo simulation to the computer graphics ray tracing algorithm. &quot;Distributed ray tracing samples the integrand at many randomly chosen points and averages the results to obtain a better approximation. It is essentially an application of the Monte Carlo method to 3D computer graphics, and for this reason is also called &quot;Stochastic ray tracing&quot;.&quot;

Stochastic forensics analyzes computer crime by viewing computers as stochastic steps.

In artificial intelligence, stochastic programs work by using probabilistic methods to solve problems, as in simulated annealing, stochastic neural networks, stochastic optimization, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming. A problem itself may be stochastic as well, as in planning under uncertainty.

==Finance==
The financial markets use stochastic models to represent the seemingly random behaviour of various financial assets, including the random behavior of the price of one currency compared to that of another (such as the price of US Dollar compared to that of the Euro), and also to represent random behaviour of interest rates. These models are then used by financial analysts to value options on stock prices, bond prices, and on interest rates, see Markov models. Moreover, it is at the heart of the insurance industry.

==Geomorphology==

The formation of river meanders has been analyzed as a stochastic process.

== Language and linguistics ==
Non-deterministic approaches in language studies are largely inspired by the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, in functionalist linguistic theory, which argues that competence is based on performance. This distinction in functional theories of grammar should be carefully distinguished from the &quot;langue&quot; and &quot;parole&quot; distinction. To the extent that linguistic knowledge is constituted by experience with language, grammar is argued to be probabilistic and variable rather than fixed and absolute. This conception of grammar as probabilistic and variable follows from the idea that one&#x27;s competence changes in accordance with one&#x27;s experience with language. Though this conception has been contested, it has also provided the foundation for modern statistical natural language processing and for theories of language learning and change.

== Manufacturing ==
Manufacturing processes are assumed to be stochastic processes. This assumption is largely valid for either continuous or batch manufacturing processes. Testing and monitoring of the process is recorded using a process control chart which plots a given process control parameter over time. Typically a dozen or many more parameters will be tracked simultaneously. Statistical models are used to define limit lines which define when corrective actions must be taken to bring the process back to its intended operational window.

This same approach is used in the service industry where parameters are replaced by processes related to service level agreements.

==Media==
The marketing and the changing movement of audience tastes and preferences, as well as the solicitation of and the scientific appeal of certain film and television debuts (i.e., their opening weekends, word-of-mouth, top-of-mind knowledge among surveyed groups, star name recognition and other elements of social media outreach and advertising), are determined in part by stochastic modeling. A recent attempt at repeat business analysis was done by Japanese scholars and is part of the Cinematic Contagion Systems patented by Geneva Media Holdings, and such modeling has been used in data collection from the time of the original Nielsen ratings to modern studio and television test audiences.

== Medicine ==

Stochastic effect, or &quot;chance effect&quot; is one classification of radiation effects that refers to the random, statistical nature of the damage. In contrast to the deterministic effect, severity is independent of dose. Only the &quot;probability&quot; of an effect increases with dose.

==Music==

In music, mathematical processes based on probability can generate stochastic elements.

Stochastic processes may be used in music to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by Iannis Xenakis, who coined the term &quot;stochastic music&quot;. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in &quot;Pithoprakta&quot;, statistical distribution of points on a plane in &quot;Diamorphoses&quot;, minimal constraints in &quot;Achorripsis&quot;, the normal distribution in &quot;ST/10&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;, Markov chains in &quot;Analogiques&quot;, game theory in &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;Stratégie&quot;, group theory in &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in &quot;Herma&quot; and &quot;Eonta&quot;, and Brownian motion in &quot;N&#x27;Shima&quot;. Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the &quot;ST&quot; series including &quot;Morsima-Amorsima&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;, and founded CEMAMu. Earlier, John Cage and others had composed &quot;aleatoric&quot; or indeterminate music, which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage&#x27;s &quot;Music of Changes&quot;, for example, uses a system of charts based on the &quot;I-Ching&quot;). Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 &quot;Illiac Suite&quot;. Modern electronic music production techniques make these processes relatively simple to implement, and many hardware devices such as synthesizers and drum machines incorporate randomization features. Generative music techniques are therefore readily accessible to composers, performers, and producers.

==Social sciences==
Stochastic social science theory is similar to systems theory in that events are interactions of systems, although with a marked emphasis on unconscious processes. The event creates its own conditions of possibility, rendering it unpredictable if simply for the number of variables involved. Stochastic social science theory can be seen as an elaboration of a kind of &#x27;third axis&#x27; in which to situate human behavior alongside the traditional &#x27;nature vs. nurture&#x27; opposition. See Julia Kristeva on her usage of the &#x27;semiotic&#x27;, Luce Irigaray on reverse Heideggerian epistemology, and Pierre Bourdieu on polythetic space for examples of stochastic social science theory.

The term stochastic terrorism has come into frequent use with regard to lone wolf terrorism. The terms &quot;Scripted Violence&quot; and &quot;Stochastic Terrorism&quot; are linked in a &quot;cause &lt;&gt; effect&quot; relationship. &quot;Scripted violence&quot; rhetoric can result in an act of &quot;stochastic terrorism&quot;. The phrase &quot;scripted violence&quot; has been used in social science since at least 2002.

Author David Neiwert, who wrote the book &quot;Alt-America&quot;, told Salon interviewer Chauncey Devega:

== Subtractive color reproduction ==
When color reproductions are made, the image is separated into its component colors by taking multiple photographs filtered for each color. One resultant film or plate represents each of the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black data. Color printing is a binary system, where ink is either present or not present, so all color separations to be printed must be translated into dots at some stage of the work-flow. Traditional line screens which are amplitude modulated had problems with moiré but were used until stochastic screening became available. A stochastic (or frequency modulated) dot pattern creates a sharper image.

<text>In computing, WinG (pronounced &quot;Win Gee&quot;) is an application programming interface that was designed to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX.

==Background==
WinG fixed two problems. The first problem that WinG fixed was that Windows 3.x did not support creating Device Contexts (DCs) based on device independent bitmaps, only actual display devices. One major limitation of the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) DCs was that they were write-only. Data, once written, could not be retrieved. The second problem was that all GDI drawing was implemented in the Windows 3.x video drivers. This included the drawing of bitmaps. Obviously performance of such routines varied across drivers.

Alex St. John, one of the creators of DirectX, said in a 2000 interview that,
Microsoft announced WinG at the 1994 Game Developers Conference, demonstrating it with a port by id Software of &quot;Doom&quot;. WinG was shipped on September 21, 1994. WinG, while interesting, was still fundamentally based on drawing bitmaps in memory and outputting frames after the drawing was done. As a result, WinG was deprecated and DirectX was built. However, Windows NT 3.5 and Windows 95 introduced CreateDIBSection to provide support for creating DCs based on DIBs and video drivers also eventually improved.

==Implementation==
WinG introduced a new type of DC called a WinGDC, which allowed programmers to both read and write to it directly using device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) with the wingdib.drv driver. Effectively, it gave programmers the ability to do with Windows what they&#x27;d been doing without hardware access limitations in DOS for years. Programmers could write DIBs to the WinGDC, yet would still have access to the individual bits of the image data. This meant that fast graphics algorithms could be written to allow fast scrolling, overdraw, dirty rectangles, double buffering, and other animation techniques. WinG also provided much better performance when blitting graphics data to physical graphics device memory. Since WinG used the DIB format, it was possible to mix original GDI API calls and WinG calls.

WinG would also perform a graphics hardware/driver profiling test on the first execution of the program in order to determine the best way to draw DIBs. This test showed a window full of red curved lines, sections of which would wobble as performance was tested. Once WinG had determined the fastest calls that did not cause graphics corruption, a profile would be saved so that the test would not need to be performed again.

==Support==
WinG out-of-the-box support (i.e. as a separate API to Win32) was dropped in Windows 98 Second Edition (which integrated DirectX 6), as it did nothing but pass through to the Win32 APIs that it was wrapping (including CreateDIBSection). WinG DLLs were sometimes distributed with an application, at which point it merely became a matter of copying the files wing.dll, wing32.dll, wingde.dll, wingdib.drv and wingpal.wnd to the &quot;system32&quot; directory (for 32 bit Windows) or &quot;SysWOW64&quot; directory (for 64 bit Windows) to regain system-wide support.

<doc id="292224" wikidata="Q1148367" url="?curid=292224" title="Topologist's sine curve">
<text>In the branch of mathematics known as topology, the topologist&#x27;s sine curve or Warsaw sine curve is a topological space with several interesting properties that make it an important textbook example.

It can be defined as the graph of the function sin(1/&quot;x&quot;) on the half-open interval (0, 1], together with the origin, under the topology induced from the Euclidean plane:

:formula_1

==Properties==

The topologist&#x27;s sine curve is connected but neither locally connected nor path connected. This is because it includes the point but there is no way to link the function to the origin so as to make a path.

The space is the continuous image of a locally compact space (namely, let be the space formula_2 and use the map formula_3 defined by formula_4 and formula_5 for ), but is not locally compact itself.

The topological dimension of is 1.

==Variants==
Two variants of the topologist&#x27;s sine curve have other interesting properties.

The closed topologist&#x27;s sine curve can be defined by taking the topologist&#x27;s sine curve and adding its set of limit points, formula_6; some texts define the topologist&#x27;s sine curve itself as this closed version, as they prefer to use the term &#x27;closed topologist&#x27;s sine curve&#x27; to refer to another curve. This space is closed and bounded and so compact by the Heine–Borel theorem, but has similar properties to the topologist&#x27;s sine curve—it too is connected but neither locally connected nor path-connected.

The extended topologist&#x27;s sine curve can be defined by taking the closed topologist&#x27;s sine curve and adding to it the set formula_7. It is arc connected but not locally connected.

<doc id="292225" wikidata="Q312639" url="?curid=292225" title="Fred Perry">
<text>Frederick John Perry (18 May 1909 – 2 February 1995) was a British tennis and table tennis player and former world No. 1 from England who won 10 Majors, including eight Grand Slam tournaments and two Pro Slams single titles, as well as six Major doubles titles. Perry won three consecutive Wimbledon Championships from 1934 to 1936 and was World Amateur number one tennis player during those three years. Prior to Andy Murray in 2013, Perry was the last British player to win the men&#x27;s Wimbledon championship, in 1936, and the last British player to win a men&#x27;s singles Grand Slam title, until Andy Murray won the 2012 US Open.

Perry was the first player to win a &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot;, winning all four singles titles, which he completed at the age of 26 at the 1935 French Championships. He remains the only British player ever to achieve this. Perry&#x27;s first love was table tennis and he was World Champion in 1929. He began playing tennis aged 14 and his tennis career at 21, when in 1930 an LTA committee chose him to join a four-man team to tour the United States.

In 1933, Perry helped lead the Great Britain team to victory over France in the Davis Cup; the team&#x27;s first success since 1912, followed by wins over the United States in 1934, 1935, and a fourth consecutive title with victory over Australia in 1936. But due to his disillusionment with the class-conscious nature of the Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain, the working-class Perry turned professional at the end of the 1936 season and moved to the United States where he became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1939. In 1942, he was drafted into the US Army Air Force during the Second World War.

Despite his unprecedented contribution to British tennis, Perry was not accorded full recognition by tennis authorities until later in life, because between 1927 and 1967 the International Lawn Tennis Federation ignored amateur champions who later turned professional. In 1984, a statue of Perry was unveiled at Wimbledon, and in the same year he became the only tennis player listed in a survey of 2,000 Britons to find the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; British sportsmen of the 20th century.

==Early life==

Perry was born in 1909 in Stockport, where his father, Samuel Perry (1877–1954), was a cotton spinner. For the first decade of his life, he also lived in Bolton, Lancashire, and Wallasey, Cheshire, because his father was involved in local politics. When living in Wallasey he attended Liscard Primary School and, briefly, Wallasey Grammar School. Perry moved to Brentham Garden Suburb in Ealing, west London aged eleven years when his father became the national secretary of the Co-operative Party after World War I. His father became the Labour and Co-operative Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Kettering in 1929.

Perry first began to play tennis on the public courts near his family&#x27;s housing estate. He was educated at Ealing Grammar School for Boys.
==Table tennis career==
&quot;Perry took advantage of his athletic build and extraordinary physical capacity: he was highly mobile and fast, had a sound defence and placed his balls very well. Thanks to his very strong wrist he could hit a very hard forehand drive&quot;. Perry reached the quarter-finals of the men&#x27;s singles in the 1928 Stockholm World championships, where he lost to Laszlo Bellak. He was runner-up in the men&#x27;s doubles with Charlie Bull. In 1929 Perry lost to Bull in the Czechoslovak Open and lost to Anton Malacek in the English Open. At the Budapest World championships men&#x27;s singles event, Perry beat Miklós Szabados 3 games to 1 to win the title. He beat Szabados again in an exhibition in Paris. His final table tennis appearance was in 1932, in a team match in London against Hungary.

==Amateur tennis career==

During his amateur playing career Perry trained with Arsenal football club to focus on his fitness.

===1927===
Perry was an eighteen year old table tennis prodigy when he began his tennis career. He reached several quarter finals of tennis events in the London area at Herga club in Harrow, Blackheath, Fulham and Ealing. He also reached the semi-finals at New Malden.

===1928===
Perry reached the semi-finals at the Herga club tournament in Harrow in July. He also reached the semi-finals of the Sidmouth tournament in September.

===1929===
In 1929, a year when Perry won the World Table tennis championships, he continued his tennis career. He won the New Malden championships in August beating Wilfred Freeman in the final. He also won Queen&#x27;s Evening Tournament in December in Queen&#x27;s Club, London, beating Horace Lester in the final.

===1930===
Perry won the Middlesex championships in May beating Madan Mohan in the final and the same month won the Harrogate championships beating John Olliff in the final. In November, Perry beat Eric Peters in the final of the Argentine championships in Buenos Aires.

===1931===
In April, Perry beat Ryuki Miki in the final of the Paddington championships in London. In August, Perry won the Eastern grasscourt championships in Rye, New York beating Cliff Sutter in the semis and J. Gilbert Hall in the final. In November, Perry beat Olliff in the final of the Cromer covered court autumn championships.

===1932===
In January, Perry won the Coupe de Noel in Paris beating Marcel Bernard and Jean Borotra. The following week, Perry beat Bernard in the final of the Flanders club event in Roubaix. In February, Perry beat Pat Hughes in the final of the Kingston championships in Jamaica. Then Perry beat Harry Lee in the final of the Bermuda championships. Soon after returning to the UK in March, Perry beat Lee in the final of the Tally-Ho! Open Tennis Championships in Birmingham. In April, Perry came from two sets down to beat George Lyttleton Rogers in the final of the British hardcourt championships in Bournemouth. In May, Perry beat William Powell in the final of Harrogate championships. In July, Perry won the Herga Club tournament beating Takeo Kuwabara in the final. In September at the Pacific Southwest championships, Perry was 5–2 down in the final set and saved three match points before winning an epic quarter final 12–10 in the final set against Keith Gledhill. He went on to beat Satoh to take the title. Perry won the Pacific coast championships in October beating Bunny Austin in the final.

===1933===
In May, Perry won the British hard court championships in Bournemouth over Adrian Quist, Lee and Austin in the final three rounds. Perry denied Crawford the calendar Grand Slam and won his first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Championships. Crawford had a bad knee and &quot;the Australian had to play a limping game at times on any quick starts or hard gets. In spite of this the tennis Fred Perry played deserved the title. He had the heart and used his head. His forcing strokes kept Crawford worried all afternoon. At any rate, leading two sets to one, Crawford had nothing left for the last two sets&quot; according to &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot;. In September, Perry won the Pacific Southwest championships beating Satoh in four sets in the final. In November, whilst touring Australia, Perry played in the Victorian championships in Melbourne and beat Harry Hopman and Jack Crawford to take the title.

===1934===
 Perry beat Crawford in the final of the Australian championships in January and the British hardcourt championships in Bournemouth in May. Perry won his first Wimbledon title beating defending champion Crawford in the final. Perry&#x27;s success attracted the adoration of the crowds at Wimbledon particularly as he contrasted sharply with the privileged background of most patrons and players associated with the All England Club at the time. The upper echelons of the British tennis establishment greeted his success more coolly, regarding him as an &quot;upstart&quot;. After winning his maiden Wimbledon title, Perry recalled overhearing a Wimbledon committee member remark that &quot;the best man didn&#x27;t win.&quot; His All-England Club member&#x27;s tie, awarded to all winners of the Championships, was left for him on a chair in his dressing room. Perry faced Wilmer Allison in the final of the U.S. Championships and when Perry led 5–2 in the fifth set &quot;the crowd sighed in unison and looked toward the exits, but the Texan still wasn&#x27;t through. He ripped to the net after his service balls to win one at love, and then he broke through Perry in the ninth. Allison held his own service in the 10th game and the count was five-all&quot;. However, Perry took the set and match 8–6. Perry beat Stoefen in the final of the Pacific Southwest championships in September. Perry beat Don Budge in five sets in the final of the Pacific Coast championships in October. Perry won &quot;without going to the net more than a half dozen times in 50 games and when it was all over Budge had scored more points than his adversary, made fewer errors and many more placements&quot;. Perry was ranked World No. 1 amateur by A. Wallis Myers, Pierre Gillou, Bernard Brown, John R. Tunis, Bill Tilden, Ned Potter, G.H. McElhone (&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;), Harry Hopman, R.O. Cummings (The Courier Mail), and J. Brookes Fenno, Jr. (&quot;The Literary Digest&quot;)

===1935===
Perry beat Abel Kay in the final of the New Zealand championships in January. Perry beat Austin in five sets in the final of the British hardcourt championships in May. Perry won the French championships in June to become the first man to win all four Grand Slam singles titles. In the final he beat Gottfried von Cramm in four sets. &quot;The two hours final was conducted in perfect composure. It was essentially a sporting match, exhibiting beautiful tennis but lacking drama, because, after the second set. it was obvious that von Cramm could not pierce Perry&#x27;s armour&quot; according to a newspaper article. Perry beat Hermann Artens in the final of the Belgian championships in Brussels in June. Perry retained his Wimbledon title beating von Cramm in the final. &quot;The German didn&#x27;t like Perry&#x27;s speed today. Nor did he care for the Englishman&#x27;s eternal hustle which forced him to hurry his shots. Perry stayed close to the baseline save in the second set, for he saw that he could triumph without going to the net, thus exposing his wings to the German&#x27;s favorite shot a razor-like drive down the sidelines.&quot; Perry was ranked World No. 1 amateur by A. Wallis Myers,
S. Wallis Merrihew,
Pierre Gillou,
Harry Hopman,
Ned Potter,
G. H. McElhone,
&quot;The Times&quot; and
&quot;Forehand&quot; (&quot;Ashburton Guardian&quot;).

===1936===
Perry beat Max Ellmer in the final of two Cannes championship titles (the Beau site event in March and the Cannes handicap tournament in April). Perry beat Ladislav Hecht in the final of the Czech championships in Prague in April. Perry beat Austin in straight sets in the final of the British hardcourt championships in Bournemouth in May to win his fifth consecutive British hardcourt title. His Wimbledon final triumph was a 6–1, 6–1, 6–0 victory over the German Baron Gottfried von Cramm which lasted less than 45 minutes. It became the quickest final in the 20th century and the second shortest of all time. Perry had learned from the Wimbledon masseur that von Cramm had suffered a groin strain which limited his ability to move wide on the forehand. Perry faced Budge in the final of the U.S. Championships. At 5-4 and 8–7 in the fifth set, Budge came within two points of victory at Deuce on Perry&#x27;s serve. &quot;Verging on victory, the pressure weighed heavily on the slightly built, elongated American, while Perry, an experienced campaigner, remained cool&quot;, according to Chicago Tribune. Perry won the fifth set 10-8 and with it his eighth and last Grand Slam singles title.

In the Davis Cup, Perry led the Great Britain team to four consecutive victories from 1933 to 1936, with wins over France in 1933, the United States in 1934 and 1935, and Australia in 1936. Perry competed in a total of 20 Davis Cup matches, winning 34 of his 38 rubbers in singles, and 11 out of 14 in doubles.

Perry was ranked World No. 1 amateur by A. Wallis Myers, Pierre Gillou, Ned Potter, &quot;The Times&quot;, Harry Hopman, &quot;Austral&quot; (R.M. Kidston), G.H. McElhone, Mervyn Weston (&quot;The Australasian&quot;) and Bill Tilden.

==Professional tennis career==
===1937===
After three years as the world No. 1 tennis amateur player, Perry turned professional in late 1936. This led to his being virtually ostracised by the British tennis establishment. He made his professional debut on 6 January 1937 at the Madison Square Garden against the best professional player, Ellsworth Vines, winning in four sets. For the next two years he played lengthy tours against Vines. In 1937, they played 61 matches in the United States on their big tour, with Vines winning 32 and Perry 29. They then sailed to Britain, where they played a brief tour in UK and Ireland. Perry won the King George VI Coronation Cup over Vines. Perry won six matches out of nine in UK and Ireland, so Vines and Perry finished the year tied at 35 victories each. Ray Bowers ranked Perry and Vines joint no. 1 pros for 1937.

===1938===
The following year, 1938, the big tour was even longer, and this time Vines beat Perry 49 matches to 35, while a short tour of the Caribbean and Central and South America ended at four victories a piece. Perry won the U.S. Pro at Chicago beating Bruce Barnes in the final.

===1939===
Don Budge won the Grand Slam in 1938 as an amateur and then turned professional and played a series of matches against both Vines and Perry in 1939, beating Vines 22 times to 17, and beating Perry by 28 victories to 8. In October, Perry lost in the final of U.S. Pro to Vines in four sets. Then Perry won a four-man round robin at Long Beach (he, Gorchakoff and Stoefen finished level on 2 wins each). He also won a four-man round robin in San Diego in November (where he and Stoefen finished on two wins each). In December he won four man round robins at Phoenix and Pasadena.

===1940===
Perry won the Finnish relief event in New York in March, beating Vines and Budge. Perry won West Coast Pro round robin in Los Angeles in April. This was the last time Perry and Vines played each other before Vines embarked full time on a golf career. Perry won their final match. Perry lost in the final of the U.S. Pro in Chicago to Budge.

===1941===
In April Perry won tournaments at Pinehurst (over Dick Skeen) and White Sulphur Springs (over Skeen). Perry beat Skeen again in the final of the U.S. Pro at Chicago in June and also in June, Perry won a four-man round robin at Forest Hills over Budge, Skeen and Tilden and won an event at Rye (beating Skeen in the final). In August Perry won a four-man round robin at St. Louis. Perry was ranked World No. 1 pro by Ray Bowers.

===1942-1945===
After breaking his elbow in a match against Bobby Riggs on the opening night of the Round robin World Series, Perry had to miss several matches of the tour. Perry finished fourth in the standings. Soon after the pro circuit petered out in mid-1942, Perry was involved in World War 2, where he served in the U.S. Air force, having already gained American citizenship in 1939.

===1946===
In 1946, Perry won events at Tucson in January (beating Bobby Riggs in the final), Omaha in February (beating Wayne Sabin in the final), Palm Springs in April (over Carl Earn) and El Paso in May (over Frank Kovacs). Perry also played a series of matches against Tilden.

===1947===
In June, Perry lost in the quarter-finals of the U.S. Pro to Van Horn. In August Perry won the White Mountains Pro at Jefferson beating Sabin in the final.

===1948===
Perry won the Slazenger Pro at Scarborough in July. In the final he won in four sets against Yvon Petra, who had won the Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles two years earlier. &quot;Perry, noted one observer, had lost none of his zest, sting—or shrewdness. Perry assessed Petra&#x27;s game while losing the first set of the final and won the next three for the loss of seven games. &#x27;I knew a little bit more about the game than he did&#x27;, said Perry afterwards.&quot;

===1949===
Perry turned 40 in May. By now, Perry was playing on the pro circuit sporadically. Defending his title at Scarborough in July, Perry lost in the quarter-finals to Dinny Pails in five sets.

===1950-1959===
Perry won the Slazenger Pro at Scarborough in August 1950, beating Salem Khaled in the final. In August 1951, aged 42, Perry won his final title at Scarborough beating Francesco Romanoni. Perry won a tournament at Hagen in September 1953 beating fellow veteran Hans Nusslein in the final. He continued playing until he was 50 in 1959, when he lost in the first round of the U.S. Pro at Cleveland.

==Post playing career==

===Broadcasting career===
After retiring as a player, Fred Perry had a long career as a tennis broadcaster. He worked as a summariser and reporter for BBC Radio from 1959 to 1994 and for many years was a familiar voice during BBC radio&#x27;s coverage of Wimbledon. He also commentated on TV on the BBC from 1951 to 1952 and ITV&#x27;s coverage of Wimbledon from 1956 to 1968, after which ITV stopped broadcasting the championships. ITV &quot;employed me as a would-be counter-attraction to my old friend Dan Maskell on BBC Television. We were simply not able to compete and I wasn&#x27;t unhappy when ITV gave it up as a bad job. The BBC had two channels to ITV&#x27;s one, and were not inhibited by commercial breaks every fifteen minutes and the imposition of a strict time limit on the coverage, as ITV was&quot;, explained Perry in his autobiography. In later years, Perry was sometimes interviewed by BBC Television during their Wimbledon coverage. In 1979 Perry spoke to Des Lynam at Wimbledon about his life in an episode of the TV series &quot;Maestro&quot;. The programme was shown again as a tribute after his death.

===Death===
On 2 February 1995, Perry died at Epworth Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, after breaking his ribs following a fall in a hotel bathroom. He had been in Melbourne attending the Australian Open.

==Personal life==
Perry was one of the leading bachelors of the 1930s and his off-court romances were reported in the world press. Perry had a romantic relationship with actress Marlene Dietrich and in 1934 he announced his engagement to British actress Mary Lawson, but the relationship fell apart after Perry moved to the US. In 1935 he married American film star Helen Vinson, but their marriage ended in divorce in 1940. In 1941 he was briefly married to model Sandra Breaux. Then, in 1945, he married Lorraine Walsh, but that marriage also ended quickly. Perry&#x27;s final marriage to Barbara Riese (the sister of actress Patricia Roc) in 1952 lasted over forty years, until his death. They had two children, Penny and David. David led his father&#x27;s clothing line prior to a buyout.

In July 1937, an England vs America pro-celebrity tennis doubles match was organized, featuring Perry and Charlie Chaplin playing against Groucho Marx and Ellsworth Vines, to open the new clubhouse at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club.

Perry had an older sister, Edith; they were both born in Stockport, Cheshire. Edith greatly supported her younger brother throughout his sporting achievements. Perry had a half sister, Sylvia.

==Clothing label==
In the late 1940s, Perry was approached by Tibby Wegner, an Austrian footballer who had invented an anti-perspirant device worn around the wrist. Perry made a few changes to Wegner&#x27;s design to create the first sweatband. Wegner&#x27;s next idea was to produce a sports shirt, which was to be made from white knitted cotton pique with short sleeves and a buttoned placket like René Lacoste&#x27;s shirts. Launched at Wimbledon in 1952, the Fred Perry tennis shirt was an immediate success.

The Fred Perry logo is a laurel wreath, based on the original symbol for Wimbledon. The logo, which appears on the left breast of Fred Perry garments, is stitched into the fabric of the shirt. The brand was initially run by the Perry family, namely his son David, until it was bought by Japanese company Hit Union in 1995. However, the Perry family continued to work closely with the brand. Fred Perry was the clothing sponsor of British tennis player Andy Murray from the start of his career until 2009.

==Sporting legacy==

Perry is considered by some to have been one of the greatest players ever to have played the game. In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, called Perry one of the six greatest players of all time. In 1975, Don Budge ranked his top five players of all time and rated Perry number three behind Vines and Kramer.

&quot;Kings of the Court&quot;, a video-tape documentary made in 1997 in conjunction with the International Tennis Hall of Fame, named Perry one of the ten greatest players of all time. But this documentary only considered those players who played before the Open era of tennis that began in 1968, with the exception of Rod Laver, who spanned both eras, so that all of the more recent great players are missing.

In &quot;100 Greatest of All Time&quot;, a 2012 television series broadcast by the Tennis Channel, Perry was ranked the 15th-greatest male player, just behind Boris Becker at 14th, and just ahead of Stefan Edberg at 16th. Perry&#x27;s great rivals Vines (37th) and Crawford (32nd) were ranked well below him.
Kramer, however, had several caveats about Perry. He says that Bill Tilden once called Perry &quot;the world&#x27;s worst good player&quot;. Kramer says that Perry was &quot;extremely fast; he had a hard body with sharp reflexes, and he could hit a forehand with a snap, slamming it on the rise—and even on the fastest grass. That shot was nearly as good as Segura&#x27;s two-handed forehand.&quot; His only real weakness, says Kramer, &quot;was his backhand. Perry hit underslice off that wing about 90% of the time, and eventually at the very top levels—against Vines and Budge—that was what did him in. Whenever an opponent would make an especially good shot, Perry would cry out &#x27;Very clevah.&#x27; I never played Fred competitively, but I heard enough from other guys that &#x27;Very clevah&#x27; drove a lot of opponents crazy.&quot;

Perry, however, recalled his days on the professional tour differently. He maintained that &quot;there was never any easing up in his tour matches with Ellsworth Vines and Bill Tilden since there was the title of World Pro Champion at stake.&quot; He said &quot;I must have played Vines in something like 350 matches, yet there was never any fixing as most people thought. There were always people willing to believe that our pro matches weren&#x27;t strictly on the level, that they were just exhibitions. But as far as we were concerned, we always gave everything we had.&quot;

Another comment from Kramer is that Perry unwittingly &quot;screwed up men&#x27;s tennis in England, although this wasn&#x27;t his fault. The way he could hit a forehand—snap it off like a ping-pong shot—Perry was a physical freak. Nobody else could be taught to hit a shot that way. But the kids over there copied Perry&#x27;s style, and it ruined them. Even after Perry faded out of the picture, the coaches there must have kept using him as a model.&quot;

==Honours and memorials==
===United Kingdom===

A bronze statue of Fred Perry was erected at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, London, in 1984 to mark the 50th anniversary of his first singles championship. It is located at the Church Road gate. After Perry&#x27;s accidental death in 1995, he was cremated and his ashes buried in an urn near the statue.
Perry&#x27;s home town of Stockport has numerous memorials to the former tennis champion. For instance there is a blue plaque commemorating the house where he was born.
In September 2002, a designated walking route called the Fred Perry Way was opened through the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. The route from Woodford in the south to Reddish in the north, combines rural footpaths, quiet lanes and river valleys with urban landscapes and parklands. Features along the route include Houldsworth Mill and Square, the start of the River Mersey at the confluence of the River Tame and River Goyt, Stockport Town Centre, Vernon and Woodbank Parks and the Happy Valley. The route also passes through Woodbank Park, where Perry played some exhibition tennis matches.

In 2009, Perry was selected by the Royal Mail for their &quot;Eminent Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue. In November 2010, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and John Perry, Fred Perry&#x27;s grandson, opened Fred Perry House in Stockport.
The building, which is the borough&#x27;s new civic headquarters, will be used by various local government agencies. In June 2012, an English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled on the house at 223 Pitshanger Lane, Ealing, London, where Perry lived between 1919 and 1935.

===World===
Perry was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1975.

Perry received a Doctor of Laws degree, &quot;honoris causa&quot;, from Washington and Lee University on 4 June 1987. He had coached the W&amp;L tennis team in 1941 and again in 1947.

In the United States, two drives in El Paso, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a street in Springfield, Tennessee, are named after Fred Perry.

<doc id="292226" wikidata="Q3404917" url="?curid=292226" title="Julie Burchill">
<text>Julie Burchill (born 3 July 1959) is an English writer. Beginning as a staff writer at the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; at the age of 17, she has since contributed to newspapers such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Her writing, which was described by John Arlidge in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2002 as &quot;outrageously outspoken&quot; and &quot;usually offensive,&quot; has been the subject of legal action. Burchill is also a novelist, and her 2004 novel &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; was adapted for television.

==Early life and education==
Julie Burchill was born in Bristol and educated at Brislington Comprehensive School. Her father was a Communist union activist who worked in a distillery. Her mother had a job in a cardboard box factory. In 2010, Burchill wrote of her parents: &quot;I don&#x27;t care much for families. I adored my mum and dad, but to be honest I don&#x27;t miss them much now they&#x27;re dead&quot;; three years later she contradicted this when she said she could not return to Bristol, as every time she heard someone speaking with her parents&#x27; Bristol accent it would remind her how much she missed them. She did not attend university, leaving the A-levels she had started a few weeks earlier to begin writing for the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME).

==Writing and broadcasting career==
===At the &quot;NME&quot;===
She began her writing career at the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) in 1976, aged 17, after responding (coincidentally with her future husband Tony Parsons) to an advert in that paper seeking &quot;hip young gunslingers&quot; to write about the then emerging punk movement. She gained the job by submitting a &quot;eulogy&quot; of Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses&quot;. She later wrote that at the time she only liked black music, and said: &quot;When I actually heard a punk record, I thought, &#x27;Oh my Lord! This is not music, this is just shouting&#x27;.&quot; Indeed, she managed to decry the first self-released punk album in the UK, The Outsiders&#x27; &quot;Calling on Youth&quot; featuring Adrian Borland: &quot;Apple-cheeked Ade has a complexion that would turn a Devon milkmaid green with envy.&quot; Fortunately for her, as she later said, &quot;Punk was over in two years. That was the only damn good thing about it.&quot; She left her position at the &quot;NME&quot; at the age of 20, and started freelancing to be able to write about other subjects, although she has never completely given up writing about pop music.

===1980s===
Her main employers after the &quot;NME&quot; were &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, where she wrote about politics, pop, fashion and society, and was their film critic from 1984 to 1986. She admitted in 2008 to making up film reviews and having &quot;skived&quot; from screenings, and her ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, has admitted to attending screenings on her behalf.

During the Falklands War in 1982, Burchill argued that the military dictatorship of General Galtieri represented a greater evil. She wrote articles favourable to Margaret Thatcher. Her sympathy for Thatcher helped in gaining a column for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, where in 1987 she went against the paper&#x27;s usual political line by urging its readers to vote Labour. Though she claims to like the &quot;MoS&quot;, she said of journalists on the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 2008: &quot;Everybody knows that hacks are the biggest bunch of adulterers, the most misbehaving profession in the world – and you have people writing for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; writing as though they are vicars ... moralising on single mothers and whatnot.&quot;

===Into the 1990s===
Burchill has spoken repeatedly and frankly of her relationship with drugs, writing that she had &quot;put enough toot up my admittedly sizeable snout to stun the entire Colombian armed forces&quot;. She declared that &quot;As one who suffered from chronic shyness and a low boredom threshold ... I simply can&#x27;t imagine that I could have ever had any kind of social life without [cocaine], let alone have reigned as Queen of the Groucho Club for a good part of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s.&quot; While Burchill has frequently drawn on her personal life for her writing, her personal life has been a subject of public comment, especially during this period, when &quot;everything about her – her marriages, her debauchery, her children – seemed to be news.&quot;

In 1991, Burchill, Landesman and Toby Young established a short-lived magazine &quot;Modern Review&quot; through which she met Charlotte Raven, with whom she had a much publicised affair. &quot;[I] was only a lesbian for about six weeks in 1995,&quot; she said in an interview with Lynn Barber in 2004, or &quot;my very enjoyable six months of lesbianism&quot; in a 2000 article. Launched under the slogan &quot;Low culture for high brows&quot;, the magazine lasted until 1995, when Burchill and her colleagues fell out. It was briefly revived by Burchill, with Raven editing, in 1997. The &quot;Fax war&quot; in 1993 between Burchill and author Camille Paglia, published in the &quot;Modern Review&quot;, gained much attention.

In 1995, Burchill wrote a column for &quot;The Times&quot;, titled &quot;I&#x27;m a bitch, and I&#x27;m proud&quot;, in which she argued that women should reclaim the word &#x27;bitch,&#x27; used as a slur. She wrote: &quot;it is the nature of these things that, in recent years, the slighted have taken steps to repossess the slight; thus, we have blacks who call each other &#x27;nigger&#x27;, pansies who call each other &#x27;queer&#x27; and upper-class cretins who quite happily call each other &#x27;Henry&#x27;.&quot;

In 1996, the actor, author, playwright and theatre director Steven Berkoff won a libel action against Burchill in respect of one of her articles, published in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspaper, which included comments suggesting that he was &quot;hideously ugly&quot;. The judge ruled that Burchill&#x27;s actions &quot;held him to ridicule and contempt.&quot; The late 1990s were a turbulent period for Burchill as she has recalled:
===From 2000 to 2004===
A user of cocaine, sharing in the activity in the company of Will Self among others, she was positive about her use in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2000 when defending actress Danniella Westbrook for Westbrook&#x27;s loss of her nasal septum because of cocaine use. Journalist Deborah Orr, who was then married to Self, was scathing in &quot;The Independent&quot; of Burchill and her article: &quot;She does not identify herself as a cocaine addict, so she has no pity for Ms Westbrook.&quot; In revenge for Deborah Orr&#x27;s article, Burchill invented a supposedly long-standing crush on Will Self with the intention of upsetting Orr. A letter in &quot;The Independent&quot; in June 2000 from the head waitress at the Groucho Club at the time, Deborah Bosley, caused a minor stir. Responding to an article by Yvonne Roberts, Bosley, at the time the partner of Richard Ingrams, a long standing critic of Burchill, stated that Burchill was merely &quot;a fat bird in a blue mac sitting in the corner&quot; when ensconced at the Groucho. 

The following year&#x27;s &quot;Burchill on Beckham&quot; (2001), a short book about Burchill&#x27;s opinions concerning David Beckham&#x27;s life, career, and relationship with Victoria Beckham, attracted &quot;some of the worst notices since Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s heyday. &#x27;Burchill is to football writing what Jimmy Hill is to feminist polemics&#x27;,&quot; wrote one reviewer. According to Robert Winder in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;: &quot;The book fits in with Burchill&#x27;s theme of praising the working class; Burchill presents Beckham as an anti-laddish symbol of old working-class values – he reminds her of those proud men of her childhood, &#x27;paragons of generosity, industry and chastity&#x27;.&quot;

For five years until 2003, Burchill wrote a weekly column in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Appointed in 1998 by Orr, while editor of the &quot;Guardian Weekend&quot; supplement, Burchill&#x27;s career was in trouble; she had been sacked by the revived &quot;Punch&quot; magazine. Burchill frequently thanked Deborah Orr for rescuing her. One of the pieces she wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; was in reaction to the murder of BBC TV presenter Jill Dando in 1999. She compared the shock of Dando&#x27;s murder to finding a &quot;tarantula in a punnet full of strawberries&quot;. In 2002 she narrowly escaped prosecution for incitement to racial hatred, &quot;following a &quot;Guardian&quot; column where she described Ireland as being synonymous with child molestation, Nazi-sympathising, and the oppression of women&quot;. Burchill had expressed anti-Irish sentiment several times throughout her career, announcing in the London journal &quot;Time Out&quot; that &quot;I hate the Irish, I think they&#x27;re appalling&quot;.

She supported the Iraq War, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003 that she was &quot;in favour of a smaller war now rather than a far worse war later&quot;, and criticised those opposed to the war as &quot;pro-Saddam apologists&quot;. She justified her stance by stating that &quot;this war is about freedom, justice – and oil&quot; and that because Britain and the United States sold weapons to Iraq that, &quot;it is our responsibility to redress our greed and ignorance by doing the lion&#x27;s share in getting rid of him&quot;.

Burchill left &quot;The Guardian&quot; acrimoniously, saying in an interview that they had offered her a sofa in lieu of a pay rise. She stated that she left the newspaper in protest at what she saw as its &quot;vile anti-Semitism&quot;.

===From 2005 to 2009===
Burchill was an early critic of the fashion for denigrating lower social classes as &quot;chavs&quot;. In 2005, she presented the Sky One documentary &quot;In Defence of Chavs&quot;. &quot;Picking on people worse off than you are isn&#x27;t humour. It&#x27;s pathetic, it&#x27;s cowardly and it&#x27;s bullying,&quot; she commented in an interview for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; at the time. &quot;It&#x27;s all to do with self-loathing. ... The middle classes can&#x27;t bear to see people having more fun, so they attack Chavs for things like their cheap jewellery. It&#x27;s jealousy, because they secretly know Chavs are better than them. They&#x27;re even better looking.&quot;

Following her departure from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in early 2005 she moved to &quot;The Times&quot;, who were more willing to meet her demands, doubling her previous salary. Shortly after starting her weekly column, she referred to George Galloway, but appeared to confuse him with former MP Ron Brown, reporting the misdeeds of Brown as those of Galloway, &quot;he incited Arabs to fight British troops in Iraq.&quot; She apologised in her column and &quot;The Times&quot; paid damages thought to have been £50,000.

In 2006, &quot;The Times&quot; dropped her Saturday column, and arranged a more flexible arrangement with Burchill writing for the daily paper. Later it emerged, during a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview published on 4 August 2008, that eventually she &quot;was given the jolly old heave ho&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;, and paid off for the last year of her three-year contract, still receiving the £300,000 she would have earned if she had been obliged to provide copy. She later described her columns for her abbreviated &quot;Times&quot; contract, which ended abruptly in 2007, thus: &quot;I was totally taking the piss. I didn&#x27;t spend much time on them and they were such arrant crap.&quot;

In February 2006, she announced plans for a year&#x27;s sabbatical from journalism, planning, among other things, to study theology. In June 2007, she announced that she would not be returning to journalism, but instead concentrate on writing books and TV scripts and finally undertake a theology degree, but she returned to writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

Burchill&#x27;s co-written book with Chas Newkey-Burden, &quot;Not in My Name: A Compendium of Modern Hypocrisy&quot;, appeared in August 2008, and is dedicated &quot;to Arik and Bibi&quot; (Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu). According to Gerald Jacobs, writing for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in 2008, &quot;this book does not merely stand up for Israel, it jumps up and down, cheers and waves its arms&quot;. The newspaper described her as &quot;Israel&#x27;s staunchest supporter in the UK media&quot;. When asked if Israel has any flaws, she responded: &quot;Yes. They are much too tolerant of their freaking neighbours, much too reasonable&quot;.

She declared in 2005, after Ariel Sharon&#x27;s withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip, that &quot;Israel is the only country I would fucking die for. He&#x27;s the enemy of the Jews. Chucking his own people off the Gaza; to me that&#x27;s disgusting&quot;. Besides writing occasional pieces for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she wrote four articles for the centre-right politics and culture magazine &quot;Standpoint&quot; between July and October 2008.

===2010s===
At the end of June 2010 it was announced Burchill would be writing exclusively for &quot;The Independent&quot;, contributing a weekly full-page column for the paper. The connection lasted less than 18 months. Burchill wrote her last column for &quot;The Independent&quot; at the end of October 2011. Admitting he had tried to recruit Burchill for &quot;The Sun&quot; in the 1980s, Roy Greenslade commented: &quot;my admittedly occasional reading of her columns in recent years has left [me] feeling that she realises her old schtick is no longer working. She has run out of steam – and sympathetic newspaper editors&quot;.

Commenting on the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Burchill wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;It would be wonderful to think that what replaces Mubarak will be better. But here&#x27;s the thing about Middle Eastern regimes: they&#x27;re all vile. The ones that are &#x27;friendly&#x27; are vile and the ones that hate us are vile. Revolutions in the region have a habit of going horribly wrong, and this may well have something to do with the fact that Islam and democracy appear to find it difficult to co-exist for long.&quot;

On 13 January 2013, Burchill wrote an article for &quot;The Observer&quot; defending Suzanne Moore after a reference by Moore to transsexuals had been greeted with a great deal of criticism. In Burchill&#x27;s view, it showed the &quot;chutzpah&quot; of transsexuals to have their &quot;cock cut off and then plead special privileges as women&quot;. There were a number of objections to her writing from members of the transgender community and non-transgender community alike. The editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, John Mulholland, responded on the comments page to what he described as &quot;many emails protesting about this piece&quot; and stated that he would be looking into the issue. Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, formerly a junior Minister for Women and Equalities, called for the dismissal of Burchill and Mulholland in response to the piece. The article was withdrawn from the website the following day and replaced with a message from Mulholland, but reappeared on the &quot;Telegraph&quot; website. On 18 January, &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Readers Editor Stephen Pritchard defended the decision to remove the article from the newspaper&#x27;s website, quoting the editor who took that decision as saying &quot;This clearly fell outside what we might consider reasonable. The piece should not have been published in that form. I don&#x27;t want the &quot;Observer&quot; to be conducting debates on those terms or with that language. It was offensive, needlessly. We made a misjudgment and we apologise for that&quot;.

===Religion and philo-semitism===
In her 1987 essay collection &quot;Damaged Gods: Cults and Heroes Reappraised&quot;, Burchill criticised what she called &quot;the anti-Semitism of politicized American blacks&quot; such as Jesse Jackson, who had referred to New York City as &quot;Hymietown.&quot; Burchill wrote, &quot;imagine how the blacks would have gnashed their diamond-studded teeth if a Jewish leader had publicly referred to Harlem as &#x27;Nigger-town&#x27;!&quot;

In 1999, Burchill said she &quot;found God&quot;, and became a Lutheran and later a &quot;self-confessed Christian Zionist&quot;. In June 2007, she announced that she would undertake a theology degree, although she subsequently decided to do voluntary work instead as a way to learn more about Christianity.

In June 2009, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; reported that Burchill had become a Friend of Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue and was again considering a conversion to Judaism. According to &quot;TheJC&quot;, she had attended Shabbat services for a month, and studying Hebrew, she described herself as an &quot;ex-Christian&quot;, pointing out that she had been pondering on her conversion since the age of 25. Burchill said that &quot;At a time of rising and increasingly vicious anti-semitism from both left and right, becoming Jewish especially appeals to me. ... Added to the fact that I admire Israel so much, it does seem to make sense – assuming of course that the Jews will have me&quot;. She wrote in November 2012: &quot;The things I love about the Jews are: their religion, their language and their ancient country&quot;.

Burchill clashed with Rabbi Elli Tikvah Sarah of the Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue, and the Rabbi&#x27;s lesbian partner, Jess Woods. Among the reasons for their differences was Rabbi Sarah&#x27;s defence of Muslims and her advocacy of the Palestinian cause. In Burchill&#x27;s words, the rabbi &quot;respects PIG ISLAM&quot;. Rabbi Sarah told &quot;The Independent&quot; in September 2014: &quot;The problem is [Burchill] doesn’t have any in-depth knowledge. I can imagine her endlessly watching the film &quot;Exodus&quot; with Paul Newman. She’s got a kind of Hollywood view of Jews. You know, ‘Jews are so clever, we’ve survived ...&#x27;.&quot;

In 2014, Burchill&#x27;s crowdfunded book &quot;Unchosen: The Memoirs of a Philo-Semite&quot; was published. Tel Aviv-based writer Akin Ajayi in &quot;Haaretz&quot; thought &quot;the reactionary solipsism of &quot;Unchosen&quot; is far removed from the affectionate warmness that a love of the Jewish people can be&quot;. Burchill&#x27;s ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, considered it to be an &quot;exhilarating and exasperating mix of the utterly brilliant and the totally bonkers&quot;. He observes that &quot;there are plenty of Jews Julie doesn&#x27;t love&quot; including the &quot;millions of Jews around the world who have ever criticised Israel. Her love is blind, deaf and dumb to such an obvious contradiction&quot;. &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist Hadley Freeman wrote: &quot;Burchill divides up the chosen people into Good Jews (hardliners, Israelites) and Bad Jews (liberal Jews) with the enthusiasm of an antisemite. Hilariously, she sets herself up as the Jewishness Police, railing against Jews who are not Jewish enough&quot;. In his review in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Keith Kahn-Harris described &quot;Unchosen&quot; as &quot;occasionally touching, sometimes bigoted and sporadically hilarious&quot; but that it &quot;often degenerates into EDL-style abuse that lacks any redeeming wit.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot; Will Self wrote, &quot;I’m afraid I can’t really dignify her latest offering with the ascription &#x27;book&#x27;, nor the contents therein as &#x27;writing&#x27; – rather they are sophomoric, hammy effusions, wrongheaded, rancorous, and pathetically self-aggrandising.&quot;

===Other books and television programmes===
Burchill has written novels and made television documentaries. Her lesbian-themed novel for teenagers &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; (2004) was adapted into a television drama series produced by Shine Limited for Channel 4. Lenora Crichlow&#x27;s portrayal of the central character Maria Sweet inspired the 2007 sequel novel &quot;Sweet&quot;. Burchill has made television documentaries about the death of her father from asbestosis in 2002 (BBC Four) and &quot;Heat&quot; magazine broadcast on Sky One in 2006.

====&quot;Welcome to the Woke Trials&quot;====
&quot;Welcome To The Woke Trials: How #Identity Killed Progressive Politics&quot; was planned to be issued by Tabatha Stirling of Stirling Publishing in summer 2021 after being dropped by its original publisher following Burchill&#x27;s defamatory tweets to Ash Sarkar. On 14 March 2021, when referencing her new publisher Burchill announced that, with Stirling, &quot;I&#x27;ve found someone who&#x27;s JUST LIKE ME.&quot; Stirling is alleged to have written a series of articles for Patriotic Alternative as &quot;Miss Britannia&quot;, describing her son&#x27;s school as &quot;a hellhole for sensible, secure White boys&quot; and claimed &quot;there is one member of staff who is openly gay, and I mean RuPaul extra gay&quot;. On 16 March 2021, Burchill announced she would not publish her book with Stirling Publishing, the same day she issued a public apology for libel and harassment of Sarkar. The book was subsequently published by Academica Press.

==Responses==
Burchill has described her own style as the writing equivalent of screaming and throwing things. For her novel &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; her publicist described her as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most famous and controversial journalist&quot;. One of her most consistent themes is the championing of the working class against the middle class in most cases, and she has been particularly vocal in defending &#x27;chavs&#x27;. According to Will Self, &quot;Burchill&#x27;s great talent as a journalist is to beautifully articulate the inarticulate sentiments and prejudices of her readers&quot;. For Michael Bywater, Burchill&#x27;s &quot;insights were, and remain, negligible, on the level of a toddler having a tantrum&quot;. John Arlidge wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2002: &quot;If Burchill is famous for anything it is for being Julie Burchill, the brilliant, unpredictable, outrageously outspoken writer who has an iconoclastic, usually offensive, view on everything.

In November 1980, former Sex Pistols front man John Lydon gave an interview to Ann Louise Bardach in which he referred to Burchill and Tony Parsons as &quot;toss-bag journalists, desperately trying to get in on something&quot; in response to their book, &quot;The Boy Looked at Johnny&quot;, and described its chapter on amphetamines as &quot;stupidity&quot;. Lydon was incensed by Burchill and Parsons attributing his talent to his alleged use of the drug in their book.

In October 1999, in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she wrote: &quot;That young men succeed in suicide more often than girls isn&#x27;t really the point. Indeed, the more callous among us would say that it was quite nice for young men finally to find something that they&#x27;re better at than girls&quot;. After a previous occasion when Burchill wrote &quot;suicides should be left to get on with it&quot;, she &quot;received a small number of letters from people whose sons had killed themselves&quot;.

In 2002, her life was the subject of a one-woman West End play, &quot;Julie Burchill is Away&quot;, by Tim Fountain, with Burchill played by her friend Jackie Clune. A sequel by Fountain, &quot;Julie Burchill: Absolute Cult&quot;, followed in 2014, with Lizzie Roper in the central role.

In 2003, Burchill was ranked number 85 in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of &quot;100 Worst Britons&quot;. The poll was inspired by the BBC series &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;, though it was less serious in nature. The aim was to discover the &quot;100 worst Britons we love to hate&quot;. The poll specified that the nominees had to be British, alive and not currently in prison or pending trial. In 2005, on the 25th anniversary of the murder of John Lennon, she told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember where I was but I was really pleased he was dead, as he was a wife-beater, gay-basher, anti-Semite and all-round bully-boy.&quot; In the essay &quot;Born Again Cows&quot; published in &quot;Damaged Gods&quot; (1987), she wrote: &quot;When the sex war is won prostitutes should be shot as collaborators for their terrible betrayal of all women.&quot;

On 6 June 2021, and shortly after the announcement of the birth of Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Burchill tweeted: &quot;What a missed opportunity. They could have called it Georgina Floydina!”, a reference to George Floyd. Her comments were widely condemned, with racial equality activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu stating: &quot;She’s (Lilibet) referred to as &#x27;IT&#x27;. The utter disrespect &amp; dehumanisation of #HarryandMeghan children because of their proximity to ‘Blackness’ is Racist&quot;; actress Kelechi Okafor wrote: &quot;Likening baby Lilibet to George Floyd is to hone[sic] in on the fact she isn&#x27;t fully white...She refers to Lilbet as &#x27;it&#x27; even though it has been announced that the baby is a girl and she could&#x27;ve addressed her as such...Disgusting scenes.&quot; On 8 June, via her Facebook account, Burchill announced that she had been sacked by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a result of her online comments.

===Libel===
In 2020, Burchill posted a series of defamatory tweets of Ash Sarkar, which included claims that she condones paedophilia and is supportive of Islamist terrorism. Burchill called on her Facebook followers to &quot;wade in on Twitter&quot; against &quot;the Islamists&quot; and the &quot;nonces&quot;. As a result of the comments, her publisher, Little, Brown Book Group, cancelled the scheduled publication of &quot;Welcome to the Woke Trials&quot;, stating that her comments about Islam were “not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint”.

In March 2021, after being sued for libel and harassment, Burchill retracted her comments, issued a full apology and paid substantial damages to Sarkar, including her legal costs. 

Burchill stated: &quot;I should not have sent these tweets, some of which included racist and misogynist comments regarding Ms Sarkar&#x27;s appearance and her sex life.&quot; She further apologised for &quot;liking&quot; posts calling on Sarkar to kill herself and promised to refrain from any further harassment of Sarkar.

==Personal life==
Burchill married Tony Parsons (whom she met at &quot;NME&quot;) in 1979 at the age of 20. She left Parsons three years later, leaving behind a son, which was followed by years of rancour in the media, described in 2002 as &quot;a steady stream of vitriol in both directions&quot;; she had claimed to have persevered with the &quot;sexual side&quot; of their marriage &quot;by pretending that my husband was my friend Peter York&quot;. Her relationships, particularly with Parsons, have featured in her work; Parsons later wrote that &quot;It&#x27;s like having a stalker. I don&#x27;t understand her fascination with someone whom she split up with 15 years ago&quot;.

Immediately after her relationship with Parsons, Burchill married Cosmo Landesman, the son of Fran and Jay Landesman, with whom she also had a son. The sons from her marriages with Parsons and Landesman lived with their fathers after the separations. After splitting from Landesman in 1992, she married for a third time in 2004, to Daniel Raven, around 13 years her junior, and the brother of her former lover Charlotte Raven. She wrote of the joys of having a &quot;toyboy&quot; in her &quot;Times&quot; column in 2010. Fellow NME journalist/author Paul Wellings wrote about their friendship in his book &quot;I&#x27;m A Journalist...Get Me Out of Here&quot;. She has written about her lesbian relationships, and declared that &quot;I would never describe myself as &#x27;heterosexual&#x27;, &#x27;straight&#x27; or anything else. Especially not &#x27;bisexual&#x27; (it sounds like a sort of communal vehicle missing a mudguard). I like &#x27;spontaneous&#x27; as a sexual description&quot;. In 2009 she said that she was only attracted to girls in their 20s, and since she was now nearly 50, &quot;I really don&#x27;t want to be an old perv. So best leave it&quot;.

She has lived in Brighton and Hove since 1995 and a book on her adopted home town titled &quot;Made in Brighton&quot; (Virgin Books) was published in April 2007. Her house in Hove was sold (and demolished for redevelopment as high-density flats) around 2005 for £1.5 million, of which she has given away £300,000, citing Andrew Carnegie: &quot;A man who dies rich, dies shamed.&quot;

Burchill&#x27;s second son, Jack Landesman, died by suicide in late June 2015, aged 29. In an article for &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot;, she wrote of his inability over many years to experience pleasure and the serious mental health issues from which he suffered.

In January 2025 Burchill announced that she may never walk again due to a spinal abscess.

<text>Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP) are anti-racist skinheads who oppose white power skinheads, neo-fascists and other political racists, particularly if they identify themselves as skinheads. SHARPs claim to reclaim the original multicultural identity of the original skinheads, hijacked by white power skinheads, who they sometimes deride as &quot;boneheads&quot;.

SHARP professes no political ideology or affiliation beyond the common opposition to racism. The group stresses the importance of the black Jamaican influence in the original late-1960s skinhead movement, much akin to Trojan skinheads.

==History==

=== Background ===
The original skinhead subculture started in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, and had heavy British mod and Jamaican rude boy influences, including a love for ska and soul music. Although some skinheads (including black skinheads) had engaged in &quot;Paki bashing&quot; (random violence against Pakistanis and other South Asian immigrants), skinheads were not associated with an organized racist political movement in the 1960s. However, in the late 1970s, a skinhead revival in the UK included a sizable white nationalist faction, involving organizations such as the National Front, British Movement, Rock Against Communism and in the late eighties Blood and Honour. Because of this, the mainstream media began to label the whole skinhead identity as neo-fascist. This new white power skinhead movement then spread to other countries, including the United States.

=== Emergence ===

Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice was founded in 1987 by Marcus, a skinhead from New York City. It emerged as a response by suburban adolescents to the bigotry of the growing white power movement in 1982. Traditional skinheads (trads) formed as a way to show that the skinhead subculture was not based on racism and political extremism. NYC Oi! band The Press and Jason O&#x27;Toole (vocalist of the hardcore punk group Life&#x27;s Blood) were among SHARP&#x27;s early supporters. In 1989, Roddy Moreno of the Welsh Oi! band The Oppressed visited New York City and met a few SHARP members. On his return to the United Kingdom, he designed a new SHARP logo based on the Trojan Reggae labels design and started promoting SHARP ideals to British skinheads.

SHARP then spread throughout Europe and in other continents. In the UK and other European countries, the SHARP attitude was more based on the individual than on organized groups. In the 2000s, SHARP is thought to have become more of an individual designation than an official organization.

Skinheads, especially in the United States and ASEAN countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia align themselves with groups and organizations to this day. Most of these would designate themselves as &quot;crews&quot;. Many strive for an individualist presentation with collectivist goals. As well they are generally imposed into community service, protesting, activism both violent and peaceful. SHARPs often take part of local mutual aid or activist groups such as Black Lives Matter or Anti-Racist Action, in which the latter was even in part founded by skinheads, the most well known of which being Mic Crenshaw.
The United States SHARPs scene has been entirely agitated by the racist overture and have resorted to all forms of anti-racism and anti-fascism to redeem their style and culture.

Violence has been rampant within either of the skinhead factions for decades now. Between fighting in clubs and venues as well as the streets, from mosh pit shuffles to murder. The American scene has been alive and vibrant since the 1980s. Some of the most well known anti-racist skinhead crews include The Baldies Syndicate and American S.H.A.R.P (colloquially known as A.M.S). Additional groups maintain active membership globally.


Many people may confuse SHARP members with racists, since their appearance is superficially similar: shaved heads, denim, lace up boots, button-down shirts and suspenders (called &quot;braces&quot;). One glib differentiation that might be imagined to separate the two would be music interests. SHARPs may listen to culturally influenced music such as soul, reggae and ska, but also punk, hardcore and Oi!. Racist skinheads would disagree with some or all of these musical choices, but may listen to punk, hardcore, Oi!, as well as Nazi punk and National Socialist black metal.

In a deliberate attempt to reject the growing racist subculture, since the early 1980s SHARPs promulgated an anti-racist identity through small amateur fanzine publications like &quot;Hard As Nails&quot;. During the pre-Internet era, these publication established a network of like-minded individuals with similar musical and stylistic attitudes, who considered anti-racism an indispensable part of a living skinhead scene.
Another strand of the same trad revival sought to affirm explicit links with the foundation of mod subculture and its apolitical, black-positive standards of fashion. The scooter scene, with its runs and Northern Soul dances, had never gone entirely away; and in the post-punk rediscovery of the past, under the influence of The Jam and Quadrophenia, it seemed a fresh and self-renewing direction for skinhead itself to go in.

By 1989, this trad scene was ripe for the injection of a cultural influence like SHARP, much as its own appearance had been symptomatic of an American internal revolution in US skinheads&#x27; attitudes to race and their own subculture.

An outgrowth of SHARP, Red and Anarchist Skinheads (RASH), formed in the United States in 1993 against anti-gay sentiment in the non-racist skinhead community.

== Image ==
The original logo was an American flag surrounded by the SHARP lettering. The second SHARP logo is based on the logo of Trojan Records, which originally mainly released black Jamaican ska, rocksteady, and reggae artists. Some variants of this design also incorporate the checkerboard motif of 2 Tone Records, known for its multiracial roster of ska- and reggae-influenced bands.

The way in which SHARPs dress is to project an image that looks hard and smart, in an evolving continuity with style ideals established in the middle-to-late 1960s. This style and demeanour originated from the UK, growing out of the pre-existing mod movement, taking cues and influences from Jamaican ska and rude boy culture. They remain true to the style&#x27;s original purpose of enjoying life, clothes, attitude and music.

<doc id="292231" wikidata="Q1320931" url="?curid=292231" title="Combinatorial game theory">
<text>Combinatorial game theory is a branch of mathematics and theoretical computer science that typically studies sequential games with perfect information. Study has been largely confined to two-player games that have a &quot;position&quot; that the players take turns changing in defined ways or &quot;moves&quot; to achieve a defined winning condition. Combinatorial game theory has not traditionally studied games of chance or those that use imperfect or incomplete information, favoring games that offer perfect information in which the state of the game and the set of available moves is always known by both players. However, as mathematical techniques advance, the types of game that can be mathematically analyzed expands, thus the boundaries of the field are ever changing. Scholars will generally define what they mean by a &quot;game&quot; at the beginning of a paper, and these definitions often vary as they are specific to the game being analyzed and are not meant to represent the entire scope of the field.

Combinatorial games include well-known games such as chess, checkers, and Go, which are regarded as non-trivial, and tic-tac-toe, which is considered trivial, in the sense of being &quot;easy to solve&quot;. Some combinatorial games may also have an unbounded playing area, such as infinite chess. In combinatorial game theory, the moves in these and other games are represented as a game tree.

Combinatorial games also include one-player combinatorial puzzles such as Sudoku, and no-player automata, such as Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, (although in the strictest definition, &quot;games&quot; can be said to require more than one participant, thus the designations of &quot;puzzle&quot; and &quot;automata&quot;.)

Game theory in general includes games of chance, games of imperfect knowledge, and games in which players can move simultaneously, and they tend to represent real-life decision making situations.

Combinatorial game theory has a different emphasis than &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;economic&quot; game theory, which was initially developed to study games with simple combinatorial structure, but with elements of chance (although it also considers sequential moves, see extensive-form game). Essentially, combinatorial game theory has contributed new methods for analyzing game trees, for example using surreal numbers, which are a subclass of all two-player perfect-information games. The type of games studied by combinatorial game theory is also of interest in artificial intelligence, particularly for automated planning and scheduling. In combinatorial game theory there has been less emphasis on refining practical search algorithms (such as the alpha–beta pruning heuristic included in most artificial intelligence textbooks), but more emphasis on descriptive theoretical results (such as measures of game complexity or proofs of optimal solution existence without necessarily specifying an algorithm, such as the strategy-stealing argument).

An important notion in combinatorial game theory is that of the solved game. For example, tic-tac-toe is considered a solved game, as it can be proven that any game will result in a draw if both players play optimally. Deriving similar results for games with rich combinatorial structures is difficult. For instance, in 2007 it was announced that checkers has been weakly solved—optimal play by both sides also leads to a draw—but this result was a computer-assisted proof. Other real world games are mostly too complicated to allow complete analysis today, although the theory has had some recent successes in analyzing Go endgames. Applying combinatorial game theory to a &quot;position&quot; attempts to determine the optimum sequence of moves for both players until the game ends, and by doing so discover the optimum move in any position. In practice, this process is torturously difficult unless the game is very simple.

It can be helpful to distinguish between combinatorial &quot;mathgames&quot; of interest primarily to mathematicians and scientists to ponder and solve, and combinatorial &quot;playgames&quot; of interest to the general population as a form of entertainment and competition. However, a number of games fall into both categories. Nim, for instance, is a playgame instrumental in the foundation of combinatorial game theory, and one of the first computerized games. Tic-tac-toe is still used to teach basic principles of game AI design to computer science students.

==History==
Combinatorial game theory arose in relation to the theory of impartial games, in which any play available to one player must be available to the other as well. One such game is Nim, which can be solved completely. Nim is an impartial game for two players, and subject to the &quot;normal play condition&quot;, which means that a player who cannot move loses. In the 1930s, the Sprague–Grundy theorem showed that all impartial games are equivalent to heaps in Nim, thus showing that major unifications are possible in games considered at a combinatorial level, in which detailed strategies matter, not just pay-offs.

In the 1960s, Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy jointly introduced the theory of a partisan game, in which the requirement that a play available to one player be available to both is relaxed. Their results were published in their book &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot; in 1982. However, the first work published on the subject was Conway&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;On Numbers and Games&quot;, also known as ONAG, which introduced the concept of surreal numbers and the generalization to games. &quot;On Numbers and Games&quot; was also a fruit of the collaboration between Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy.

Combinatorial games are generally, by convention, put into a form where one player wins when the other has no moves remaining. It is easy to convert any finite game with only two possible results into an equivalent one where this convention applies. One of the most important concepts in the theory of combinatorial games is that of the sum of two games, which is a game where each player may choose to move either in one game or the other at any point in the game, and a player wins when his opponent has no move in either game. This way of combining games leads to a rich and powerful mathematical structure.

Conway stated in &quot;On Numbers and Games&quot; that the inspiration for the theory of partisan games was based on his observation of the play in Go endgames, which can often be decomposed into sums of simpler endgames isolated from each other in different parts of the board.

==Examples==
The introductory text &quot;Winning Ways&quot; introduced a large number of games, but the following were used as motivating examples for the introductory theory:
* Blue–Red Hackenbush - At the finite level, this partisan combinatorial game allows constructions of games whose values are dyadic rational numbers. At the infinite level, it allows one to construct all real values, as well as many infinite ones that fall within the class of surreal numbers.
* Blue–Red–Green Hackenbush - Allows for additional game values that are not numbers in the traditional sense, for example, star.
* Toads and Frogs - Allows various game values. Unlike most other games, a position is easily represented by a short string of characters.
* Domineering - Various interesting games, such as hot games, appear as positions in Domineering, because there is sometimes an incentive to move, and sometimes not. This allows discussion of a game&#x27;s temperature.
* Nim - An impartial game. This allows for the construction of the nimbers. (It can also be seen as a green-only special case of Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush.)

The classic game Go was influential on the early combinatorial game theory, and Berlekamp and Wolfe subsequently developed an endgame and &quot;temperature&quot; theory for it (see references). Armed with this they were able to construct plausible Go endgame positions from which they could give expert Go players a choice of sides and then defeat them either way.

Another game studied in the context of combinatorial game theory is chess. In 1953 Alan Turing wrote of the game, &quot;If one can explain quite unambiguously in English, with the aid of mathematical symbols if required, how a calculation is to be done, then it is always possible to programme any digital computer to do that calculation, provided the storage capacity is adequate.&quot; In a 1950 paper, Claude Shannon estimated the lower bound of the game-tree complexity of chess to be 10120, and today this is referred to as the Shannon number. Chess remains unsolved, although extensive study, including work involving the use of supercomputers has created chess endgame tablebases, which shows the result of perfect play for all end-games with seven pieces or less. Infinite chess has an even greater combinatorial complexity than chess (unless only limited end-games, or composed positions with a small number of pieces are being studied).

==Overview==
A game, in its simplest terms, is a list of possible &quot;moves&quot; that two players, called &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, can make. The game position resulting from any move can be considered to be another game. This idea of viewing games in terms of their possible moves to other games leads to a recursive mathematical definition of games that is standard in combinatorial game theory. In this definition, each game has the notation {L|R}. L is the set of game positions that the left player can move to, and R is the set of game positions that the right player can move to; each position in L and R is defined as a game using the same notation.

Using Domineering as an example, label each of the sixteen boxes of the four-by-four board by A1 for the upper leftmost square, C2 for the third box from the left on the second row from the top, and so on. We use e.g. (D3, D4) to stand for the game position in which a vertical domino has been placed in the bottom right corner. Then, the initial position can be described in combinatorial game theory notation as

:formula_1

In standard Cross-Cram play, the players alternate turns, but this alternation is handled implicitly by the definitions of combinatorial game theory rather than being encoded within the game states.
:::

:&lt;math&gt;\{(\mathrm{A}1,\mathrm{A}2) | (\mathrm{A}1,\mathrm{B}1)\} = \{ \, 3 = {2|}
: −1 = {|0}, −2 = {|−1}, −3 = {|−2}

The zero game is a loss for the first player.

The sum of number games behaves like the integers, for example 3 + −2 = 1.

Any game number is in the class of the surreal numbers.

===Star===
&quot;Star&quot;, written as ∗ or {0|0}, is a first-player win since either player must (if first to move in the game) move to a zero game, and therefore win.

: ∗ + ∗ = 0, because the first player must turn one copy of ∗ to a 0, and then the other player will have to turn the other copy of ∗ to a 0 as well; at this point, the first player would lose, since 0 + 0 admits no moves.

The game ∗ is neither positive nor negative; it and all other games in which the first player wins (regardless of which side the player is on) are said to be &quot;fuzzy with&quot; or &quot;confused with&quot; 0; symbolically, we write ∗ || 0.

The game n* is notation for {n-1|n-1}, which is also representative of normal-play Nim with n objects.

===Up===
&quot;Up&quot;, written as ↑, is a position in combinatorial game theory. In standard notation, ↑ = {0|∗}.

: −↑ = ↓ (&quot;down&quot;)

Up is strictly positive (↑ &gt; 0), but is infinitesimal. Up is defined in &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;.

===Down===
&quot;Down&quot;, written as ↓, is a position in combinatorial game theory. In standard notation, ↓ = {∗|0}.

: −↓ = ↑ (&quot;up&quot;)

Down is strictly negative (↓ &lt; 0), but is infinitesimal. Down is defined in &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;.

===&quot;Hot&quot; games===
Consider the game {1|−1}. Both moves in this game are an advantage for the player who makes them; so the game is said to be &quot;hot;&quot; it is greater than any number less than −1, less than any number greater than 1, and fuzzy with any number in between. It is written as ±1. Note that a subclass of hot games, referred to as ±n for some numerical game n is a switch game. Switch games can be added to numbers, or multiplied by positive ones, in the expected fashion; for example, 4 ± 1 = {5|3}.

==Nimbers==
An impartial game is one where, at every position of the game, the same moves are available to both players. For instance, Nim is impartial, as any set of objects that can be removed by one player can be removed by the other. However, domineering is not impartial, because one player places horizontal dominoes and the other places vertical ones. Likewise Checkers is not impartial, since the players own different colored pieces. For any ordinal number, one can define an impartial game generalizing Nim in which, on each move, either player may replace the number with any smaller ordinal number; the games defined in this way are known as nimbers. The Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a nimber.

The &quot;smallest&quot; nimbers – the simplest and least under the usual ordering of the ordinals – are 0 and ∗.

<text>In mathematics, the transitive closure of a homogeneous binary relation on a set is the smallest relation on that contains and is transitive. For finite sets, &quot;smallest&quot; can be taken in its usual sense, of having the fewest related pairs; for infinite sets is the unique minimal transitive superset of .

For example, if is a set of airports and means &quot;there is a direct flight from airport to airport &quot; (for and in ), then the transitive closure of on is the relation such that means &quot;it is possible to fly from to in one or more flights&quot;.

More formally, the transitive closure of a binary relation on a set is the smallest (w.r.t. ⊆) transitive relation on such that ⊆ ; see . We have = if, and only if, itself is transitive.

Conversely, transitive reduction adduces a minimal relation from a given relation such that they have the same closure, that is, ; however, many different with this property may exist.

Both transitive closure and transitive reduction are also used in the closely related area of graph theory.

== Transitive relations and examples ==

A relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is transitive if, for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, whenever and then . Examples of transitive relations include the equality relation on any set, the &quot;less than or equal&quot; relation on any linearly ordered set, and the relation &quot;&quot;x&quot; was born before &quot;y&quot;&quot; on the set of all people. Symbolically, this can be denoted as: if and then .

One example of a non-transitive relation is &quot;city &quot;x&quot; can be reached via a direct flight from city &quot;y&quot;&quot; on the set of all cities. Simply because there is a direct flight from one city to a second city, and a direct flight from the second city to the third, does not imply there is a direct flight from the first city to the third. The transitive closure of this relation is a different relation, namely &quot;there is a sequence of direct flights that begins at city &quot;x&quot; and ends at city &quot;y&quot;. Every relation can be extended in a similar way to a transitive relation.

An example of a non-transitive relation with a less meaningful transitive closure is &quot;x&quot; is the day of the week after &quot;y&quot;&quot;. The transitive closure of this relation is &quot;some day &quot;x&quot; comes after a day &quot;y&quot; on the calendar&quot;, which is trivially true for all days of the week &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (and thus equivalent to the Cartesian square, which is &quot;&quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both days of the week&quot;).

== Existence and description ==
For any relation &quot;R&quot;, the transitive closure of &quot;R&quot; always exists. To see this, note that the intersection of any family of transitive relations is again transitive. Furthermore, there exists at least one transitive relation containing &quot;R&quot;, namely the trivial one: &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot;. The transitive closure of &quot;R&quot; is then given by the intersection of all transitive relations containing &quot;R&quot;.

For finite sets, we can construct the transitive closure step by step, starting from &quot;R&quot; and adding transitive edges.
This gives the intuition for a general construction. For any set &quot;X&quot;, we
can prove that transitive closure is given by the following expression
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the &quot;i&quot;-th power of &quot;R&quot;, defined inductively by
:formula_3
and, for formula_4,
:formula_5
where formula_6 denotes composition of relations.

To show that the above definition of &quot;R&quot;+ is the least transitive relation containing &quot;R&quot;, we show that it contains &quot;R&quot;, that it is transitive, and that it is the smallest set with both of those characteristics.

* formula_7: formula_8 contains all of the formula_9, so in particular formula_8 contains formula_11.
* formula_12 is transitive: If formula_13, then formula_14 and formula_15 for some formula_16 by definition of formula_17. Since composition is associative, formula_18; hence formula_19 by definition of formula_6 and formula_17.
* formula_22 is minimal, that is, if formula_23 is any transitive relation containing formula_24, then formula_25: Given any such formula_23, induction on formula_27 can be used to show formula_28 for all formula_27 as follows: &quot;Base:&quot; formula_30 by assumption. &quot;Step:&quot; If formula_28 holds, and formula_32, then formula_33 and formula_34 for some formula_35, by definition of formula_6. Hence, formula_37 by assumption and by induction hypothesis. Hence formula_38 by transitivity of formula_23; this completes the induction. Finally, formula_28 for all formula_27 implies formula_25 by definition of formula_22.

== Properties ==
The intersection of two transitive relations is transitive.

The union of two transitive relations need not be transitive. To preserve transitivity, one must take the transitive closure. This occurs, for example, when taking the union of two equivalence relations or two preorders. To obtain a new equivalence relation or preorder one must take the transitive closure (reflexivity and symmetry—in the case of equivalence relations—are automatic).

== In graph theory ==

In computer science, the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions. That is, can one get from node &quot;a&quot; to node &quot;d&quot; in one or more hops? A binary relation tells you only that node a is connected to node &quot;b&quot;, and that node &quot;b&quot; is connected to node &quot;c&quot;, etc. After the transitive closure is constructed, as depicted in the following figure, in an O(1) operation one may determine that node &quot;d&quot; is reachable from node &quot;a&quot;. The data structure is typically stored as a Boolean matrix, so if matrix[1][4] = true, then it is the case that node 1 can reach node 4 through one or more hops.

The transitive closure of the adjacency relation of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the reachability relation of the DAG and a strict partial order.
The transitive closure of an undirected graph produces a cluster graph, a disjoint union of cliques. Constructing the transitive closure is an equivalent formulation of the problem of finding the components of the graph.

== In logic and computational complexity ==
The transitive closure of a binary relation cannot, in general, be expressed in first-order logic (FO).
This means that one cannot write a formula using predicate symbols &quot;R&quot; and &quot;T&quot; that will be satisfied in
any model if and only if &quot;T&quot; is the transitive closure of &quot;R&quot;.
In finite model theory, first-order logic (FO) extended with a transitive closure operator is usually called transitive closure logic, and abbreviated FO(TC) or just TC. TC is a sub-type of fixpoint logics. The fact that FO(TC) is strictly more expressive than FO was discovered by Ronald Fagin in 1974; the result was then rediscovered by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman in 1979, who proposed to use fixpoint logic as a database query language. With more recent concepts of finite model theory, proof that FO(TC) is strictly more expressive than FO follows immediately from the fact that FO(TC) is not Gaifman-local.

In computational complexity theory, the complexity class NL corresponds precisely to the set of logical sentences expressible in TC. This is because the transitive closure property has a close relationship with the NL-complete problem STCON for finding directed paths in a graph. Similarly, the class L is first-order logic with the commutative, transitive closure. When transitive closure is added to second-order logic instead, we obtain PSPACE.

== In database query languages ==

Since the 1980s Oracle Database has implemented a proprietary SQL extension codice_1 that allows the computation of a transitive closure as part of a declarative query. The SQL 3 (1999) standard added a more general codice_2 construct also allowing transitive closures to be computed inside the query processor; as of 2011 the latter is implemented in IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (v8.0+). SQLite released support for this in 2014.

Datalog also implements transitive closure computations.

MariaDB implements Recursive Common Table Expressions, which can be used to compute transitive closures. This feature was introduced in release 10.2.2 of April 2016.

== Algorithms ==
Efficient algorithms for computing the transitive closure of the adjacency relation of a graph can be found in . Reducing the problem to multiplications of adjacency matrices achieves the time complexity of matrix multiplication, formula_44. However, this approach is not practical since both the constant factors and the memory consumption for sparse graphs are high . The problem can also be solved by the Floyd–Warshall algorithm in formula_45, or by repeated breadth-first search or depth-first search starting from each node of the graph.

For directed graphs, Purdom&#x27;s algorithm solves the problem by first computing its condensation DAG and its transitive closure, then lifting it to the original graph. Its runtime is formula_46, where formula_47 is the number of edges between its strongly connected components.

More recent research has explored efficient ways of computing transitive closure on distributed systems based on the MapReduce paradigm.

<text>The Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC/CCR; ), also referred to as the Canadian Radio Commission (CRC), was Canada&#x27;s first public broadcaster and the immediate precursor to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Origins==
The CRBC was established in 1932 by the government of R.B. Bennett based on the recommendations of the 1929 Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting and as a result of the lobbying efforts of the Canadian Radio League. The network was created on May 26, 1932 and existed until November 2, 1936 when it was reorganized as a Crown corporation becoming the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Daily national broadcasting began in May 1933 with an hour&#x27;s programming a day which was increased over time.

At its creation, Prime Minister Bennett spoke of the need for public control of radio saying:
: &quot;This country must be assured of complete Canadian control of broadcasting from Canadian sources. Without such control, broadcasting can never be the agency by which national consciousness may be fostered and sustained and national unity still further strengthened.&quot;

The three-man commission had a mandate to regulate, control all broadcasting in Canada as well as to create and transmit its own programming and to lease, purchase or construct stations for its dissemination. Its ability to carry out its mandate was severely restricted by the financial constraints of the Great Depression and it was forced to rely on private stations to carry its programs to much of the country.

Bennett named Hector Charlesworth, editor of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine, as chairman of the CRBC. The other members of the Commission were Thomas Maher, an unsuccessful Quebec Conservative candidate in 1930 federal election and director of a private radio station in Quebec City and Lieutenant Colonel William Arthur Steel (1890–1968) former Chief Radio Officer with the Canadian Corps during World War I.

==Regulator==
In addition to being a creator of programming and a broadcaster, the CRBC was responsible under the &quot;Canadian Radio Broadcasting Act&quot; for regulating and controlling all broadcasting in Canada, including privately owned radio stations that did not carry CRBC programming. The CRBC&#x27;s regulatory responsibilities included determining the number, location and transmitting power of radio stations as well as the amount of time spent carrying local and national programming.

==Operations==
The CRBC acquired radio stations in Ottawa, Vancouver and Moncton from the CNR Radio network for $50,000 as well as CNR Radio studios in various other cities and leased or established additional stations in Montreal, Chicoutimi, Quebec City, Toronto and Windsor. The stations had been created in the 1920s by Canadian National Railways to provide broadcasting for railway passengers but were also heard by the general public and functioned, along with up two dozen stations across the country on which CNR Radio leased time, as an early national radio network. The CRBC also hired private stations across the country to carry at least three hours a day of CRBC programming. These affiliates were known as &quot;basic stations&quot;. CRBC-owned or leased stations had the prefix &quot;CRC&quot; in their call-letters.

E. Austin Weir, formerly of the CNR radio network, became the CRBC&#x27;s program director. He was terminated, however, for not providing enough programming. Weir was replaced by Ernie Bushnell who became director of CRBC programming in Ontario and Western Canada and Arthur Dupont who was responsible for Quebec and the Maritimes.

==Programming==
Network programming included orchestral music, live Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts from NBC and New York Philharmonic Orchestra broadcasts from CBS, dramatized informational programs such as &quot;The Youngbloods of Beaver Bend&quot; which serialized life on a western Canadian farm. One of the best known national drama series was &quot;Radio Theatre Guild&quot; produced in Montreal by Rupert Caplan. Under program director Ernie Bushnell, CRBC increased the number of weekly English language series being broadcast over the network to 17 by the time of the network&#x27;s demise.

Another CRBC program, one which originated on the CNR&#x27;s network in 1931, was &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; under the names &quot;Saturday Night Hockey&quot;, &quot;General Motors Hockey Broadcast&quot; and then, starting in 1934, &quot;The Imperial Oil Hockey Broadcast&quot;. Other programming including fare such as &quot;Bible Dramas&quot; from CRCM Montreal, &quot;Canadian Press News&quot; - a 15-minute nightly newscast from CRCT Toronto presented by Charles Jennings (the father of Peter Jennings), &quot;Western Radio Players&quot; a weekly dramatic half-hour from CKY. Winnipeg

&quot;The Northern Messenger&quot;, a weekly program originating from Toronto late Saturday nights but aimed at Canadians living in the far north including personal messages to RCMP officers, missionaries, trappers and others from family and friends, began in December 1933. The show was made up of listener letters, important messages from family and friends in other parts of the country, news and recorded music, and would run from November to May on CRBC&#x27;s stations as well as several Canadian shortwave stations. During its first season, the program relayed 1,745 messages; a figure that increased sixfold within four years. The program would be continued by the CBC into the 1970s.

CRBC&#x27;s national radio coverage of the 1935 federal election was the first time Canadian election results were broadcast nationwide.

All programs were live as there were no recording facilities. The network had six stations of its own and relied largely on private affiliates to provide studios, equipment and staff.

In April 1936, CRBC provided round the clock coverage of the Moose River Mine Disaster in Nova Scotia with announcer J. Frank Willis broadcasting live reports from the mine head every half hour for five days as rescue crews attempted to recover the lost miners. The reports were broadcast throughout Canada as well as to 650 stations in the United States and the BBC.

In July 1936, the network broadcast live coverage from France of the unveiling by King Edward VIII of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, which was relayed across the ocean by shortwave radio.

The CRBC turned to radio advertising in order to make up a shortfall between government grants and the amount of money needed to run the network.

==Demise==
The network was criticized by the Canadian Radio League for having poor programming while the Liberal Party opposition accused the network of being biased towards the governing Conservatives.

During the election campaign, the CRBC broadcast a series of 15 minutes soap operas called &quot;Mr. Sage&quot; which were critical of Opposition leader William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Liberal Party. Decried as political propaganda, the incident was one factor in King&#x27;s decision to replace the CRBC with a new entity when the Liberals took office following the election.

New legislation was introduced creating the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a crown corporation with an arm&#x27;s length relationship with the government. The management of the CRBC, including Charlesworth, were dismissed and the new CBC was launched on November 2, 1936 with a new management team.

At its demise, the CRBC was made up of eight network owned-and-operated stations and 14 privately owned network affiliates.

The CRBC&#x27;s regulatory powers were largely transferred to the CBC while the role of licensing stations and allocating wavelengths was assumed by the newly created Department of Transport. In 1958, the Board of Broadcast Governors assumed responsibilities for regulating public and private broadcasters from the CBC and the Department of Transport and in 1968, with the adoption of the Broadcasting Act, regulation became the responsibility of the Canadian Radio-television Commission (CRTC).

==CRBC owned or leased basic stations==
*CRCA Moncton (closed October 31, 1933 due to plans to build more powerful transmitters at Sackville, New Brunswick. The new station was eventually opened by the CBC as CBA.)
*CRCK Quebec City AM 1050 - now CBV-FM
*CRCS Chicoutimi AM 950 - now CBJ-FM
*CRCM Montreal AM 910 - now CBME-FM
*CRCO Ottawa AM 880 - now CBO-FM
*CRCT Toronto AM 840 - (leased) - now CBLA-FM
*CRCY Toronto AM 1030 and AM 1420 (leased) - now CJBC AM 860
*CRCW Windsor AM 600 - now CBEW-FM
*CRCV Vancouver AM 1100 - now CBU AM 690

All but the Moncton station later became CBC Radio or Radio Canada stations.

The CRBC also leased and operated shortwave radio station CRCX (formerly VE9GW) in Bowmanville, Ontario, broadcasting on 6095 kHz. The station was leased from Gooderham &amp; Worts with Toronto station CRCT (formerly CKGW), which transmitted from the same Bowmanville site. CBC bought CRCX and CRCT from Gooderham &amp; Worts in 1937, after leasing them for a year, but would close the shortwave station in 1938.

==CRBC affiliates==
*CHNS Halifax
*CHSJ Saint John
*CHNC New Carlisle, Quebec
*CKCH Hull (now defunct)
*CFRC Kingston
*CFPL London

*CKCK Regina
*CFQC Saskatoon
*CKBI Prince Albert
*CHAB Moose Jaw
*CJCA Edmonton
*CFAC Calgary
*CHWK Chilliwack
*CFCJ Kamloops

<text>Indiana University Bloomington (IU Bloomington, Indiana University, IU, IUB, or Indiana) is a public research university in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. It is the flagship campus of Indiana University and its largest campus, with over 48,000 students. Established as the state&#x27;s seminary in 1820, the name was changed to &quot;Indiana College&quot; in 1829 and to &quot;Indiana University&quot; in 1838.

Indiana University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Its schools and programs include the Jacobs School of Music, Kelley School of Business, School of Education, Luddy School of Informatics, O&#x27;Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, Hutton Honors College, The Media School, and Maurer School of Law. The campus also features the Lilly Library, Eskenazi Museum of Art, and the Indiana Memorial Union.

Indiana athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I and are known as the Indiana Hoosiers. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Since it does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. The Indiana Hoosiers have won 24 NCAA national championships and one Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national championship, in addition to 145 NCAA individual national championships. Titles won by teams include eight by the Hoosiers men&#x27;s soccer team, a record-setting six straight in men&#x27;s swimming and diving, five by the Hoosiers men&#x27;s basketball team, three in men&#x27;s cross country, one in men&#x27;s track and field, and one in wrestling.

==History==
===Early years===
Indiana&#x27;s state government in Corydon established Indiana University on January 20, 1820, as the &quot;State Seminary.&quot; Construction began in 1822 at what is now called Seminary Square Park near the intersection of Second Street and College Avenue. Classes began on April 4, 1825. The first professor was Baynard Rush Hall, a Presbyterian minister who taught all of the classes in 1825–27. In the first year, he taught twelve students and was paid $250. Hall was a classicist who focused on Greek and Latin and believed that the study of classical philosophy and languages formed the basis of the best education. The first class graduated in 1830. From 1820 to 1889 a legal-political battle was fought between IU and Vincennes University as to which was the legitimate state university.

In 1829, Andrew Wylie became the first president, serving until his death in 1851. The school&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Indiana College&quot; in 1829, and to &quot;Indiana University&quot; in 1838. Wylie and David Maxwell, president of the board of trustees, were devout Presbyterians. They spoke of the nonsectarian status of the school but generally hired fellow Presbyterians. Presidents and professors were expected to set a moral example for their charges. After six ministers in a row, the first non-clergyman to become president was the young biology professor David Starr Jordan, in 1885. Jordan followed Baptist theologian Lemuel Moss, who resigned after a scandal broke regarding his involvement with a female professor.

Jordan (president 1884–1891) improved the university&#x27;s finances and public image, doubled its enrollment, and instituted an elective system along the lines of his alma mater, Cornell University. Jordan became president of Stanford University in June 1891.

The growth of the institution was slow. In 1851, IU had nearly a hundred students and seven professors. IU admitted its first woman student, Sarah Parke Morrison, in 1867, making IU the fourth public university to admit women on an equal basis with men. Morrison went on to become the first female professor at IU in 1873. 

Mathematician Joseph Swain was IU&#x27;s first Hoosier-born president, 1893 to 1902. He established Kirkwood Hall in 1894; a gymnasium for men in 1896, which later was named Assembly Hall; and Kirkwood Observatory in 1900. He began construction for Science Hall in 1901. During his presidency, student enrollment increased from 524 to 1,285.

In 1883, IU awarded its first PhD and played its first intercollegiate sport (baseball), prefiguring the school&#x27;s future status as a major research institution and a power in collegiate athletics. But another incident that year was of more immediate concern: the original campus in Seminary Square burned to the ground. The college was rebuilt between 1884 and 1908 at the far eastern edge of Bloomington. (Today, the city has expanded eastward, and the &quot;new&quot; campus is once again in the midst of the city.) One challenge was that Bloomington&#x27;s limited water supply was inadequate for its population of 12,000 and could not handle university expansion. The university commissioned a study that led to building a reservoir for its use.

===20th century===
In 1902, IU enrolled 1203 undergraduates; all but 65 were Hoosiers. There were 82 graduate students including ten from out-of-state. The curriculum emphasized the classics, as befitted a gentleman, and stood in contrast to the service-oriented curriculum at Purdue University, which presented itself as of direct benefit to farmers, industrialists, and businessmen.

The first extension office of IU was opened in Indianapolis in 1916. In 1920/1921 the School of Music and the School of Commerce and Finance (what later became the Kelley School of Business) were opened. In the 1940s Indiana University opened extension campuses in Kokomo and Fort Wayne. The Kinsey Institute for sexual research was established in 1945.

During the Great Depression, Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship of its young president Herman Wells. He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde, the president of Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of the finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature and opened a full-scale fund-raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that &quot;The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed.

In 1960, the IU student body elected Thomas Atkins, an African-American from Elkhart, Indiana, to the position of president of the student body. A throng of white students protested the result by parading around campus waving Confederate flags and allegedly blamed Atkins&#x27; victory on a &quot;bunch of beatniks.&quot; When the protesters approached the female dormitory on campus, they were met with &quot;a barrage of cosmetic bottles, old shoes, and other objects.&quot;

===21st century===
In April 2002, thousands of IU students and staff, along with Bloomington residents, rioted across the university campus before merging into adjacent city blocks after the IU men&#x27;s basketball team lost the NCAA Basketball championship game to the University of Maryland Terrapins. Rioters caused extensive damage to university buildings and city businesses, and at least 45 people were arrested during the riot.

In March 2014, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights initiated a federal investigation of Indiana University&#x27;s Title IX compliance, encompassing more than 450 sexual harassment and violence complaints filed with the university between 2011 and 2015. The complaints involved both students and university staff or faculty. The investigation revealed concerns with timeliness of response, lack of documentation, not preventing retaliation, and the creation of sexually hostile environments at the campus. The investigation further criticized the lack of mandatory sexual harassment, misconduct, and awareness training for staff, as well as the lack of institutional support for its Title IX Coordinator to oversee compliance by the university.

In February 2016, the university&#x27;s Associate Dean of Students, Director of Student Ethics, and Title IX Deputy Director, Jason Casares, abruptly resigned his position after sexual assault allegations were made against him by Association for Student Conduct Administration president-elect, and New York University Assistant Director of Global Community Standards, Jill Creighton, during a conference in Fort Worth, Texas in December 2015. The Fort Worth Police Department declined to press charges.

In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights initiated another Title IX investigation into Indiana University for failing to hold a university student accountable for an off-campus rape of another student and failing to follow proper Title IX procedures subsequent to the reporting of the incident. The university also charged the victim a dorm-relocation fee after the suspected rapist continued to harass the victim around her dormitory, which also went without intervention by the university. The victim&#x27;s case was also handled by former Title IX Director, Jason Casares prior to his resignation amidst sexual harassment and misconduct allegations as the university&#x27;s student ethics director and Title IX deputy director.

In November 2023, Indiana University Student Government treasurer Alex Kaswan and co-director of DEI Makiah Pickett resigned after accusing other student government leadership members of antisemitism and failure to represent the cultural whole of the student body. After learning of the accusations and resignations, U.S. Representative Jim Banks sent a letter to university president Pamela Whitten denouncing such conduct, identifying it as a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and threatened the continued federal funding for the university if the conduct was tolerated by the university administration. Accused student body president Aaliyah Raji responded by denouncing both Islamophobia and antisemitism and stating that the student government combats against those issues.

Also in November 2023, the university attracted national attention when the university barred a faculty member from teaching after alleging that he improperly assisted the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a student group, in reserving a space on campus. Shortly thereafter, the university&#x27;s administrators also cancelled a planned art exhibition by Samia Halaby, a Palestinian-American artist. Both of these events occurred after the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel and in the wake of national attention on alleged antisemitism on college and university campuses. They also occurred in the midst of changes to Indiana laws that some perceived as attacking academic freedom. In the spring of 2024, the university&#x27;s faculty voted no confidence in the Indiana University system president, the Bloomington campus&#x27;s provost and executive vice president, and the Bloomington campus&#x27;s vice provost for faculty and academic affairs.

In February 2024, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights again initiated a federal investigation of the university in response to a complaint of the violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The complaint was filed by Dr. Zachary Marschall and alleged lack of response and complacency by the university administration to an increasing number of anti-Semitic incidents at the campus. The complaint also led to additional federal investigations at the University of Wisconsin, Northwestern University, and the office is also conducting parallel investigations of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and others.

==Campus==
The Indiana University Bloomington campus of includes abundant green space and historic buildings dating to the university&#x27;s reconstruction in the late nineteenth century. The campus rests on a bed of Indiana Limestone, specifically Salem Limestone and Harrodsburg Limestone, with outcroppings of St. Louis Limestone.

The &quot;Campus River&quot; is a stream flowing through the center of campus. A section of Bloomington&#x27;s Clear Creek, it was formerly named the &quot;Jordan River&quot; after David Starr Jordan, Darwinist, ichthyologist, president of IU, and later, of Stanford University. The name was changed, along with several campus buildings, in 2020 by the IU trustees due to Jordan&#x27;s support of eugenics becoming widely known.

Bloomington was ranked 5th best city for educated millennials by Business Insider. &quot;College Ranker&quot; listed Bloomington as #6 Best College Town to Live in Forever.

===Architecture===
Many of the campus&#x27;s buildings, especially the older central buildings, are made from Indiana Limestone quarried locally. The Works Progress Administration built much of the campus&#x27;s core during the Great Depression. Many of the campus&#x27;s buildings were built and most of its land acquired during the 1950s and 1960s when first soldiers attending under the GI Bill and then the baby boom swelled the university&#x27;s enrollment from 5,403 in 1940 to 30,368 in 1970. Some buildings on campus underwent similar expansion. As additions were constructed by building onto the outside of existing buildings, exterior surfaces were incorporated into their new interiors, making this expansion visible in the affected buildings&#x27; architecture. The Chemistry and Biology buildings serve as examples, where two of the interior walls of the latter&#x27;s library were clearly constructed as limestone exteriors. The Bryan House is the traditional on-campus home of the university president.

Nine of the oldest buildings are included in a national historic district known as The Old Crescent. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. They are the Collegiate Gothic style Student Service Building (1906–1908); Indiana University Museum (1905); Richardsonian Romanesque style Maxwell Building (1890, 1907–1908); Owen Hall (1885); Wylie Hall (1885); Kirkwood Hall (1895); Lindley Hall (1903); Gothic Revival style Rose Well House (1908); and Kirkwood Observatory (1900).

The Sample Gates serve as the entryway to Indiana University&#x27;s campus and the Old Crescent. It is positioned between Franklin Hall and Bryan Hall. After several failed attempts to create an arched entrance to campus, in 1987, Edson Sample provided funding to build the archway based on the 1961 design proposed by Eggers &amp; Higgins.

The Indiana University Cinema opened in January 2011 in the former University Theatre building, which was built in the 1930s.

The Bloomington campus also has a biology research greenhouse in the Biology Building that is open to the public, one of the highlights of which is a corpse flower (&quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot;) named Wally. Also on campus, the Kirkwood Observatory is open to the public one day a week.

The 1979 movie &quot;Breaking Away&quot; was filmed on location in Bloomington and the IU campus. It also featured a reenactment of the annual Little 500 bicycle race. The IU campus also has trails that many utilize for biking and running. The trails in Bloomington and nearby areas total nearly .

===Indiana Memorial Union===

The over Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) is the second-largest student union in the world. It was built in 1932. In addition to stores and restaurants, it features an eight-story student activities tower (home to the Indiana University Student Association, Indiana Memorial Union Board, and a variety of other student organizations), a 189-room hotel, a 400-seat theatre, a Alumni Hall, of meeting space, and a bowling alley. The IMU houses a collection of Indiana art including artists from Brown County, the Hoosier Group, Richmond Group and others. This collection is the largest public collection of art outside of a museum.

The Biddle Hotel and Conference Center was added in 1960. The wing contains 189 guest rooms and over 50,000 square feet of meeting space. The IMU hosts more than 17,000 events every year.

===Indiana University Auditorium===

Indiana University Auditorium is a 3,200 seat performing arts venue situated in IU&#x27;s Fine Arts Plaza alongside the Lilly Library and the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design.

Construction on IU Auditorium began in 1939 as a part of the Federal Works Agency Projects. IU Auditorium officially opened its doors March 22, 1941.

Today, IU Auditorium presents Broadway touring acts, popular musical artists, comedians, classical musicians and more. IU Auditorium&#x27;s Hall of Murals is the home of the &quot;Indiana Murals&quot;, created by American artist Thomas Hart Benton. 16 of the 22 total panels created are housed at the auditorium.

===Museums===

The Eskenazi Museum of Art, formerly known as the Indiana University Art Museum, was established in 1941 and has occupied a building designed by the world-renowned architecture firm I.M. Pei and Partners since 1982. The museum houses a collection of over 40,000 objects and includes works by Claude Monet, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Jackson Pollock. The museum has particular strengths in the art of Africa, Oceania, the Americas, Ancient Greece and Rome, and European Modernism. It also holds a substantial collection of works on paper.

The IU Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology consists of an estimated 5 million archaeological artifacts, 30,000 ethnographic objects, 20,000 photographs, and a supporting library and archive. The collections represent cultures from each of the world&#x27;s inhabited continents. These materials have been collected and curated to serve the museum&#x27;s primary mission as a teaching museum within a university setting. The ethnology collections&#x27; strengths include traditional musical instruments, photographs of Native Americans and the Bloomington community, Inupiaq and Yupik Eskimo materials, and Pawnee material culture, among others. The archaeology collections piece together the material remains of cultures from the earliest occupations of North America through to the modern period.

The Grunwald Gallery of Art, a contemporary art museum hosted by the university. The gallery was established in 1983 as the School of Fina Arts Gallery (SoFA Gallery) in what was formerly University&#x27;s art museum space when that museum relocated to a new building. The museum exhibits experimental works by emerging and established artists as well as works by faculty and students within the Department of Studio Art. It is located at 1201 East 7th Street. It was named in honor of Indiana University alumnus John A. Grunwald in 2011. He was born in Hungary in 1935, survived the Holocaust, emigrated to the United States in 1950, and graduated with a degree in economics in 1956 from Indiana University where he met his wife Rita. In 2017, the art museum hosted an exhibition on the history of tattoo artistry in Indiana.

===Sustainability===
IU Bloomington&#x27;s Von Lee Theatre building is LEED Certified. The &quot;More Art, Less Trash&quot; recycling initiative included a design contest for recycling bin artwork and promotes both recycling and outdoor art. The university employs a group of student sustainability interns each summer, and students can get involved in campus and community-based sustainability initiatives through the Volunteers in Sustainability coordination group or the Student Sustainability Council. IU launched its Environmental Resiliency Institute in 2017 to enable more efficient collaboration between the university, local communities, and businesses on greenhouse gas reduction and sustainability projects. Cities that have participated in the program include Bloomington, Fort Wayne, Gary, West Lafayette, and Zionsville among others.

===Transportation===
A campus bus system operates several routes on a regular schedule around the IUB campus throughout the semesters. The campus buses are free to all IU affiliates and are handicap accessible. IU students and employees also gain free access to Bloomington transit buses around the city.

==Academics==

The Office of the Provost oversees the academic programs, research, and policies of 16 schools on the Indiana University Bloomington campus.
Together, these units offer more than 550 individual degree programs and majors.

===College of Arts and Sciences===
The College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University is the largest academic division, housing over 40 percent of the university&#x27;s undergraduates and offering a wide range of disciplines, from traditional fields like biology, history, and philosophy to specialized areas such as Jewish studies, gender studies, and climate science. It provides instruction in over 50 foreign languages, including unique programs like Hungarian and the first doctoral program in Gender Studies.

It also features IU&#x27;s Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, the nation&#x27;s only degree-granting Department of Central Eurasian Studies, and a world-class cyclotron in physics. The Department of Political Science made history in 2009 when professor Elinor Ostrom became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics.

Within the College of Arts and Sciences, the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design houses fourteen different areas in art, architecture, design, and merchandising. The Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies is an international affairs school composed of over 500 students from four academic departments and twenty-one institutes and centers. It also runs the Indiana University Summer Language Workshop (SWSEEL).

====The Media School====
The Media School was established on July 1, 2014, bringing together journalism, communications, and film studies programs under the College of Arts and Sciences. Led by Dean David Tolchinsky as of September 2023, the school offers undergraduate degrees in journalism, media, cinematic arts, and game design, along with graduate degrees in media and media arts and sciences. It also provides various minors and certificates. Located primarily in Franklin Hall with additional facilities in the Radio-Television Building, the school hosts the Michael I. Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism, the Black Film Center &amp; Archive, and the Center for Documentary Research and Practice. Student media include the Indiana Daily Student, the Student Cinema Guild, WIUX Pure Student Radio, IU Student Television, and the Public Relations Student Society of America.

===Kelley School of Business===

The Kelley School of Business was founded in 1920 as the university&#x27;s School of Commerce and Finance. Approximately 6,100 students are enrolled in undergraduate, graduate Accountancy and Information Systems degrees, MBA and PhD programs, and in its online degree program, &quot;Kelley Direct&quot;. Kelley partners with the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company to offer Bloomington Brands, a unique work-study program for undergraduates and MBA students. Participating students obtain real-world brand management experience by managing the Osmocote Plant Food brand under contract to Scotts. Kelley also partners with Coca-Cola for a program called Global Business Institute that is available in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia. This is a program that was designed to let select groups of students in participating countries learn about business from the context of American culture.

===School of Education===
The School of Education, formerly a part of the College of Arts and Science, has been independent since 1923. One of the largest schools of education in the United States, It offers a range of degrees in professional education: a BS in teacher education leading to a teaching license, MS., education specialist (EdS) and doctoral (EdD, PhD) degrees.

===Hutton Honors College===
===Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering===

The Indiana University School of Informatics was established in 1999 as the first of its kind in the U.S. In 2005, the Department of Computer Science moved into the school, prompting a name change to the &quot;School of Informatics and Computing.&quot; In 2016, the school expanded further with the creation of the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering and was renamed to the &quot;School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering&quot; (SICE). In 2013, it merged with the School of Library and Information Science, further expanding its academic reach. The school&#x27;s new home, Luddy Hall, opened in 2018. The school is one of a handful that offers degrees in human–computer interaction. It also offers programs in various informatics fields, including bioinformatics, computer science, high-performance computing, and complex systems.

===Maurer School of Law===

The Maurer School of Law, founded in 1842, is one of the oldest schools on the Bloomington campus. On December 4, 2008, the school of law was renamed the Michael Maurer School of Law. In 2000, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided over a mock trial of King Henry VIII in the school&#x27;s moot courtroom. Notable alumni from the School of Law include songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, and vice-chairman of the 9/11 Commission and former congressman Lee H. Hamilton.

===School of Medicine–Bloomington===
The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) was founded in 1903 in Bloomington, initially offering only the first two years of medical education, with the remaining years completed at a separate school in Indianapolis. In 1908, the main campus moved to Indianapolis, and over time, Bloomington continued to host the first two years of medical education. The Bloomington medical science building was thus renamed as Myers Hall, in honor of medical school dean Burton D. Myers. A statewide medical school system was established in 1971, expanding IUSM&#x27;s regional campuses. By 2014, all regional campuses offered full four-year programs. In 2021, IUSM-Bloomington moved into the new Health Sciences Building as part of the Regional Academic Health Center, alongside other health-related IU programs.

===Jacobs School of Music===

Founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Charles Campbell, the Jacobs School of Music focuses on voice, opera, orchestral conducting, and jazz studies. With more than 1,600 students, the school is one of the largest of its kind in the US and among the largest in the world. The school&#x27;s facilities, including five buildings in the heart of campus, comprise recital halls, more than 170 practice rooms, choral and instrumental rehearsal rooms, and more than 100 offices and studios. Its faculty has included such notable people as Eileen Farrell, David Effron, János Starker, André Watts, Menahem Pressler, Carol Ann Weaver, Linda Strommen, Abbey Simon, Jorge Bolet, Ray Cramer, David Baker, William Bell, Harvey Phillips, Carol Vaness, Sylvia McNair, Howard Klug, violinist Joshua Bell, conductor Leonard Slatkin, and composer Sven-David Sandström. Notable alumni include Edgar Meyer and soprano Angela Brown.

===School of Nursing===
The Indiana University Training School for Nurses was established in Indianapolis in 1914 in conjunction with the establishment of the Robert W. Long Hospital and in association with the IU School of Medicine to offer training leading to a nursing diploma. It was renamed the IU School of Nursing in 1956.
In the 1930s a Division of Nursing Education under the IU School of Education was created on the Bloomington campus to offer additional training to nursing students seeking BS; an MS degree program was added in 1945. Today, the School of Nursing is located at several of the IU campuses, with Indianapolis and Bloomington being the main locations. its degree programs include a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, and two doctoral degrees: Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy in nursing (PhD).

The National League for Nursing has recognized the School as a Center of Excellence in two categories simultaneously for creating environments that: Promote the Pedagogical Expertise of Faculty and Creating Environments (effective 2006–22) and Advance the Science of Nursing Education (effective 2012–21).

===School of Optometry===

==Libraries==

The Indiana University Bloomington Library System supports over twenty libraries and provides access to more than 9.9 million books, 800 databases, 60,000 electronic journal titles, and 815,000 ebooks. The system is the 14th largest library in North America by volumes held.

===Herman B Wells Library===
IU&#x27;s Herman B Wells Library holds more than 4.6 million volumes. Before a ceremony in June 2005, when it was renamed for IU&#x27;s former president and chancellor, this building was simply called the Main Library. The architectural firm Eggers &amp; Higgins designed the largely windowless, limestone paneled library, whose construction began in 1966 and was completed in 1969. The building contains eleven floors in the East Tower (research collection) and five floors in the West Tower (the undergraduate core collection). In 2014 the first floors of both towers were renovated and reintroduced as the Learning Commons and Scholars&#x27; Commons. The library is also home to Indiana University Press and the University Graduate School. It is the former home of the Information and Library Science Department, which is now hosted by Luddy Hall.

An oft-repeated urban legend holds that the library is sinking because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. An article in the &quot;Indiana Daily Student&quot; newspaper debunks this myth, stating, among other things, that the building rests on a 94 ft (28.6 m) thick limestone bedrock.

<text>Martine Kimberley Sherrie McCutcheon (formerly Ponting, born 14 May 1976) is an English actress and singer. She began appearing in television commercials at an early age and made her television debut in the children&#x27;s television drama &quot;Bluebirds&quot; in 1989. In the early 1990s, she had minor success as one third of the pop group Milan, but it was her role as Tiffany Mitchell in the BBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and her role in the 2003 romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot; that brought her stardom. For the former she won the National Television Award, while the latter earned her the Empire and MTV Movie awards. She was written out of &quot;EastEnders&quot; at the end of 1998 and then embarked on a pop career, this time as a solo artist.

McCutcheon&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;You Me &amp; Us&quot; (1999), peaked at number two in the UK, and spawned the UK number one single &quot;Perfect Moment&quot; and two further UK top 10 entries, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You&quot; and the double-sided &quot;Talking in Your Sleep/&quot;Love Me&quot;. Its follow-up, &quot;Wishing&quot; (2000), was less commercially successful but produced two UK top 10 singles: &quot;I&#x27;m Over You&quot; and &quot;On the Radio&quot;. Her pop career stalled due to the poor reception of her 2002 third album, &quot;Musicality&quot; (2002). She returned to music in 2017 with the album &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. Outside of music, McCutcheon continued to appear in television programmes, films and stage productions; her portrayal of Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; won her a Laurence Olivier Award in 2002. She released her autobiography &quot;Who Does She Think She Is?&quot; in 2000.

==Early life==
Martine Kimberley Sherrie Ponting was born on 14 May 1976 at the Salvation Army Mothers&#x27; Hospital in the London Borough of Hackney to Jenny Ponting and Thomas &quot;Keith&quot; Hemmings. While in a relationship with Keith, Jenny experienced domestic violence, which continued for many years after their split. After one of many incidents in which he attempted to kill both Jenny and Martine, he was arrested and later charged and remanded in custody for six months. Jenny then met John McCutcheon, whom she later married. When Martine was nine, Keith contacted Jenny and asked for access to her. Jenny refused, prompting him to seek sole custody of Martine through the courts. He eventually lost the case, was denied any access to Martine until she was 18 and told that he could not apply for it again due to his past behaviour. Shortly after, her surname was changed to her stepfather&#x27;s, McCutcheon. When Martine was sixteen, her mother gave birth to her half-brother, Laurence &quot;LJ&quot;. Jenny and John eventually divorced and she married Alan Tomlin in 2000.

McCutcheon attended a nursery school in Colchester, Essex, and later the Shacklewell Infants&#x27; School in Hackney, where she performed in her first play &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; before progressing to the Shacklewell Juniors&#x27; School at the age of six, where she appeared in more plays, including &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. At the age of five, she began attending extra dance classes and later enrolled in a dance school in Stoke Newington. Shortly before her tenth birthday, she successfully auditioned for a place at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. However, because of the changing policy of the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), she was no longer eligible for the grant she was supposed to receive for coming second in the audition and, with no financial support, she was forced to withdraw. Instead, she began to attend Italia Conti&#x27;s Saturday lessons. Later, the Reeves Foundation, a Church of England charity based in Moorgate, offered McCutcheon a grant and she was able to enrol at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. She finished school with nine GCSEs.

==Career==
===Early career===
At the age of 12, McCutcheon obtained her first acting role and was paid £350 to appear in an American television commercial for the drink Kool-Aid, which was followed by modelling assignments and bit parts in television shows. She was given the part of Mandy in the television series &quot;Bluebirds&quot; (1989) alongside Barbara Windsor and played Susan, Jane&#x27;s sister (played by Denise van Outen), in the Anthony Newley-directed production of &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot;, at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley, London, which was later transferred to the West End Lyric Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue. This was followed by two guest appearances on the ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; in 1991 and 1992. McCutcheon also appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; by Irish singer Enya. By the time she was 15, she was part of an all-girl group, Milan, with two fellow pupils, and landed a record contract with Polydor and a gig touring as the warm-up act for the British boyband, East 17. Milan were reasonably successful. Three of their singles: &quot;Is It Love You&#x27;re After&quot;, &quot;Affectionately Mine&quot; and &quot;Lead Me On&quot;, charted in the top ten of the dance charts, with the latter also making it to the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart. However, they were not successful enough to make a living and disbanded.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
In 1994, McCutcheon was offered the small part of Tiffany Raymond on the popular BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The role of Tiffany grew as did McCutcheon&#x27;s popularity and 22 million viewers tuned in to see her final scenes in Albert Square in 1998 when her character was killed off in a special episode screened on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In reality, McCutcheon had decided to leave the soap in order to embark on a pop career and the death of her character was not viewed favourably by the actress as she had intended to return. Since leaving the show, McCutcheon has publicly slammed the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Controller of Continuing Drama Series&quot;, Mal Young, who made the decision to kill her character. She accused him of treating her unfairly and bringing her role in the soap to an end so irrevocably, merely as punishment for leaving. In turn, Young has hit back at McCutcheon, saying her anger only arose because she wanted him to keep her role in &quot;EastEnders&quot; open as a &quot;safety net&quot;, in case her pop career failed, and he was not prepared to do this.

For her portrayal of the character, she received the 1997 National Television Award for Most Popular Actress, and the 1998 &quot;TV Quick&quot; Award for Best Actress.

===Pop career===
McCutcheon&#x27;s first appearance on the charts occurred in 1995 on a minor dance song &quot;Are You Man Enough&quot; with the dance producers Uno Clio. A promotional video was also produced. In 1999, she debuted as a solo pop artist with Virgin Records and scored a number one on the UK Singles Chart with the ballad &quot;Perfect Moment&quot; (originally recorded by Edyta Górniak in 1997). Her debut album, &quot;You Me &amp; Us&quot;, was released that September. It peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album spawned two more top 10 entries, reaching number six with two singles: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You&quot; and later with &quot;Talking in Your Sleep&quot;, which featured the double A-side &quot;Love Me&quot;, an album track that was re-recorded for the &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal with all proceeds being donated to that cause. She was nominated for the Brit Award for Best Pop Act in 2000.

In 2000, McCutcheon released her second album, &quot;Wishing&quot;, which was less successful, charting at number 25 in the UK. The album spawned two singles – the number two hit &quot;I&#x27;m Over You&quot; and the follow-up song, a cover of the Donna Summer classic &quot;On the Radio&quot; which peaked at number seven. Despite peaking at only number 25, the album still managed to sell around 250,000 copies, and received a gold certification from BPI. McCutcheon released her third album, &quot;Musicality&quot;, a Broadway-influenced cover album, in 2002. It reached number 55 in the UK and was certified silver by BPI. Due to poor sales, her recording contract was cancelled and her pop career stalled. Her two-CD best-of-album called &quot;The Collection&quot; was released in September 2012.

McCutcheon returned to music in 2017 with her fourth studio album, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, released in August by BMG. Its lead single, &quot;Say I&#x27;m Not Alone&quot; was released on 30 May 2017. The album peaked at number 17 in the UK, becoming McCutcheon&#x27;s highest-charting record since &quot;You Me &amp; Us&quot;.

===Film, stage and television===
McCutcheon regularly appears in pantomimes. She appeared in ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Knock&quot; as well as the British film &quot;Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)&quot; in 2000. She went on to play Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the National Theatre in London. Despite missing many performances (citing health problems) and withdrawing nearly five months early from the production&#x27;s transfer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical at the 2002 ceremony.

In 2002, McCutcheon presented the National Music Awards for ITV1 and in 2003 she featured in her only major film role. She appeared as tea-lady Natalie in the Richard Curtis romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot;, where the British Prime Minister played by Hugh Grant, falls in love with McCutcheon&#x27;s character. The film received positive reviews and was a box office success. McCutcheon went to America in the wake of the film&#x27;s success, but a Hollywood career did not materialise. Nevertheless, she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Trans-Atlantic Breakthrough Performer and the Empire Award for Best Newcomer at the 9th Empire Awards for her performance.

In September 2005, she appeared in two episodes of BBC drama series &quot;Spooks&quot;. Screened on the UK television network ITV1 in December 2005, McCutcheon appeared in &quot;The English Harem&quot;, playing a woman in love with a Muslim man (Art Malik), who marries him, despite knowing he already has two wives. That same year, she presented and performed on ITV&#x27;s entertainment programme, &quot;Moviemusic Mania&quot;. In 2007, McCutcheon was seen in two independent films, &quot;Withdrawal&quot; and &quot;Jump!&quot;, as well as the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; television series episode &quot;At Bertram&#x27;s Hotel&quot;. She was also a judge for the second series of ITV1&#x27;s &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;. Her appearance on the show drew criticism, with reports alleging that she was becoming a hate figure for the contestants, who were said to have found her comments relentlessly critical and at times patronising. On 8 March 2007, she performed in an &quot;Art Plus&quot; fundraising event at the Whitechapel Art Gallery opposite Natalie Press, Samantha Morton and Rhys Ifans, and in January 2008, she featured in the ITV soap &quot;Echo Beach&quot; as the character Susan Penwarden.

In September 2016, McCutcheon was announced as a panelist on the ITV daytime show &quot;Loose Women&quot;, after making a few guest appearances on the show earlier in the year. 

In 2021, she competed on the second series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as Swan, and was the third contestant to be unmasked.

===Other work===
McCutcheon released her autobiography, &quot;Who Does She Think She Is?&quot; in 2000, and in 2003 &quot;Martine McCutcheon: Behind the Scenes – A Personal Diary&quot;, was published by HarperCollins. McCutcheon was one of many celebrities who featured in a 2004 promotional film for London&#x27;s successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. A fitness DVD, &quot;Martine McCutcheon: Dance Body&quot;, was released in December 2005.

In 2006, the supermarket chain Tesco announced that they would be using McCutcheon in a series of adverts to promote a new green scheme for recycling used plastic carrier bags. In 2009, her first novel, &quot;The Mistress&quot;, was published by Pan MacMillan. From 2010 to 2011, she was the face on Danone&#x27;s UK advertising campaign for its Activia yogurt brand.

==Awards and honours==
In July 2014, she was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Bolton for her services to entertainment.

==Personal life==
McCutcheon was engaged to DJ Gareth Cooke, but broke off the relationship in 1996. She was later in a relationship with Jonathan Barnham, by whom she became pregnant in 1999, but suffered a miscarriage in the second month. McCutcheon married singer Jack McManus at Lake Como in September 2012; the couple had been dating since 2009. On 4 February 2015, she gave birth to a son, Rafferty Jack McManus. In August 2024, McCutcheon announced that she and her husband had separated.

In 2011, McCutcheon was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and six years later also with Lyme disease. On social media, she shares her experiences with flare-ups of fibromyalgia and how this impacts her, such as slowing down her journey with weight loss.

In 2013, she was declared bankrupt by the Kingston upon Thames County Court with creditors including HM Revenue and Customs.

<doc id="292254" wikidata="Q7334770" url="?curid=292254" title="Ring for Jeeves">
<text>Ring for Jeeves is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 22 April 1953 by Herbert Jenkins, London and in the United States on 15 April 1954 by Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, under the title The Return of Jeeves.

The novel features one of Wodehouse&#x27;s best-known characters, Jeeves. It is the only Jeeves novel in which his employer, Bertie Wooster, does not appear (though he is mentioned), and the only Jeeves story narrated in the third person. Wodehouse adapted the story from a play, &quot;Come On, Jeeves&quot;, that he had written with his lifelong friend and collaborator Guy Bolton.

Set in the early 1950s, the story concerns Bill Belfry, Lord Rowcester, an English aristocrat who is in financial trouble. His future relies on the problem-solving abilities of Jeeves, who is temporarily serving as Bill&#x27;s butler.

==Plot==

The novel is set in the early 1950s, when much of the English aristocracy has lost its wealth. Bertie has gone to a school that teaches the aristocracy to fend for itself, in case he meets the same fate. He is not allowed to bring Jeeves, so Jeeves goes to work temporarily for one of Bertie&#x27;s friends from the Drones Club, the young gentleman Lord William &quot;Bill&quot; Rowcester (or Towcester), a now impoverished aristocrat who lives at Rowcester Abbey, a large house in poor repair.

The wealthy American widow Mrs. Rosalinda Spottsworth wants a new home in England. Bill&#x27;s sister, Lady Monica &quot;Moke&quot; Carmoyle, has persuaded her to look at Rowcester Abbey. On her way, Mrs. Spottsworth meets her old friend Captain Biggar. Captain Biggar loves Mrs. Spottsworth but feels a man of modest means should not propose to a wealthy woman. Captain Biggar is also looking for a bookie named Honest Patch Perkins, who wears a check suit and eyepatch and has a large moustache. This bookmaker owes Captain Biggar over three thousand pounds after Captain Biggar won a lucky double.

Monica arrives, with her aristocratic husband Sir Roderick &quot;Rory&quot; Carmoyle, who now works at a department store. Jill Wyvern, a veterinary physician and Bill&#x27;s fiancée, greets Monica and Rory, telling them that Bill has hired a cook, a housemaid, and a butler named Jeeves. Bill told Jill that he has secured a lucrative position with the Agricultural Board. Later, Bill returns to the house, wearing an eyepatch and false moustache. Following advice from Jeeves, Bill actually made his money as the Silver Ring bookmaker Honest Patch Perkins. (On a racecourse, the silver ring is the cheapest area where the bookmakers deal in the lowest stakes.) Jeeves was Bill&#x27;s clerk, though he ignored Jeeves&#x27;s advice against accepting Captain Biggar&#x27;s wager. Bill hides his costume in an oak dower chest. He is hopeful after learning from Jeeves that Mrs. Spottsworth may buy the house.

Mrs. Spottsworth returns Captain Biggar&#x27;s obvious feelings for her, but wonders why he remains silent. At Rowcester Abbey, she approaches Bill, who is her old friend. After Mrs. Spottsworth mentions her interest in the supernatural, Monica tells her that a ghost named Lady Agatha haunts the ruined chapel. Captain Biggar, who got the license plate number of the bookie&#x27;s car, comes to the house and questions Bill. Jeeves maintains that it was a false plate. Hoping to show off the costumes inside the dower chest to Mrs. Spottsworth, Monica opens the chest and finds Bill&#x27;s bookie costume. Captain Biggar recognizes it.

Jeeves explains to Captain Biggar that Bill does not have the money yet. However, Captain Biggar needs the money quickly to back a horse named Ballymore at The Derby the next day, so that he will be wealthy enough to propose to Mrs. Spottsworth. Captain Biggar tells Bill to steal Mrs. Spottsworth&#x27;s diamond pendant; Captain Biggar will pawn it and then buy it back after Barrymore wins. Jeeves advises Bill to pretend to remove a spider from Mrs. Spottsworth&#x27;s hair while actually taking the pendant. After Jeeves and Bill rehearse the sequence, Bill tries it, but the pendant falls down the front of Mrs. Spottsworth&#x27;s dress. At Captain Biggar&#x27;s suggestion, Bill dances with Mrs. Spottsworth so that the necklace will fall to the ground. The sight of them makes Jill jealous. Rory spots the fallen pendant and returns it to Mrs. Spottsworth.

In the middle of the night, Jeeves tells Bill his new plan: Jeeves will tell Mrs. Spottsworth that Bill saw the ghost in the chapel, and while she goes there with Jeeves, Bill will take the pendant from her room. Following the plan, Bill steals the pendant, and Captain Biggar pawns it. Jill, who saw Bill leaving Mrs. Spottsworth&#x27;s room, ends their engagement, and tells her father Colonel Wyvern, the chief constable. She reconciles with Bill after Jeeves tells her what happened. Colonel Wyvern confronts Bill, but sees the couple has reconciled, and instead investigates the stolen pendant, reported by the housemaid Ellen. Over the radio, it is announced that Barrymore lost the Derby.

Captain Biggar returns, with Mrs. Spottsworth&#x27;s pendant, which he could not bring himself to pawn. He returns it to her and confesses his feelings. They become engaged. Though she loves the house, Mrs. Spottsworth dislikes the English climate; Jeeves suggests she buy the house, take it down, and rebuild it in California. She agrees to buy the house. Bill and Jill are thrilled, though dismayed that Jeeves is leaving, as Jeeves states that he is needed at Bertie Wooster&#x27;s side. Bertie has been expelled from his school for cheating.

==Characters==

* William &#x27;Bill&#x27; Belfry (pseudonym Honest Patch Perkins), 9th Earl of Rowcester.
* Jeeves, temporarily employed as the Earl&#x27;s butler.
* Sir Roderick &#x27;Rory&#x27; Carmoyle, brother-in-law to Bill.
* Lady Monica &#x27;Moke&#x27; Carmoyle, sister of Bill and wife of Rory.
* Jill Wyvern, betrothed to Bill.
* Chief Constable Wyvern, Jill&#x27;s father.
* Cuthbert Gervase &#x27;Bwana&#x27; Brabazon-Biggar, who has been cheated of £3000 by bookie Honest Patch Perkins.
* Rosalinda &#x27;Rosie&#x27; Spottsworth, who is an old friend of Bill and is planning to buy his house.
* Pomona, Rosie&#x27;s dog.
* Bulstrode, Chief Constable Wyvern&#x27;s incompetent sixteen year old butler.
* Evangeline Trelawny, Chief Constable Wyvern&#x27;s pigtailed, fifteen year old cook.
* Bertie Wooster (mentioned only) Jeeves&#x27; former employer.

==Differences between editions==

Although the story remains the same, there are some differences between the UK and US editions. Structurally, the sequence of early chapters is different: what is the opening chapter of the UK edition becomes chapter 5 in the US edition, with other chapters being re-arranged accordingly. And while the US edition retains the name Towcester (pronounced &quot;toaster&quot;) from the play which preceded the novel, this becomes Rowcester (pronounced &quot;roaster&quot;) in the UK edition. Additionally, Sir Roderick Carmoyle&#x27;s employer, Harrods, is replaced in the UK edition with the fictional department store Harrige&#x27;s, a portmanteau of Harrods and Selfridges.

==Style==

Jeeves&#x27;s learning and intelligence are sometimes exaggerated for comic effect in the stories, for instance when he recites unnecessary quotations. This is most apparent in &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, where Bertie is not present to supply comedic narration. Jeeves&#x27;s verbosity and tendency to quote provide more of the story&#x27;s humour than in other Jeeves novels.

Throughout the stories, Jeeves is sometimes compared to Sherlock Holmes and behaves like him, as when Jeeves remarks to Bill, &quot;The problem is undoubtedly one that presents certain points of interest, m&#x27;lord&quot; (chapter 13).

In the story, Captain Biggar resists proposing to Mrs. Spottsworth because of his idea of a Far Eastern Code, which is based on clichéd and outdated Kipling imagery. He ultimately realizes his Code is inadequate after talking with Mrs. Spottsworth near the end of the novel.

The names of Wodehouse&#x27;s characters and locations often serve as a source of humour. In &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, the name of Captain Biggar leads to a series of jokes, such as &quot;Which is bigger, Captain Biggar or Mrs. Biggar?–Mrs. Biggar, because she became bigger.&quot; Captain Biggar is also given a humorously aristocratic full name, Cuthbert Gervase Brabazon Biggar.

In chapter 11 of the novel, Jeeves offers to remain with Bill even if Bill cannot pay his salary, implying that he would make the same offer to Bertie if Bertie&#x27;s finances were threatened. As stated by writer Kristin Thompson, &quot;In an indirect way, Jeeves&#x27;s offer, along with Bertie&#x27;s refusal to allow himself to be taught how to get along without Jeeves, adds up to a reaffirmation of their marriagelike relationship comparable to that of the end of &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;.&quot;

==Publication history==
In addition to being published as a novel, &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot; was printed in the &quot;Long Island Sunday Press&quot; on 4 October 1953. Under the title &quot;The Return of Jeeves&quot;, the story was published in the magazine &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in April 1954, illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, and later appeared in &quot;Pocket Books Weekly&quot; in January 1955. &quot;The Return of Jeeves&quot; was included in the Wodehouse collection &quot;Five Complete Novels&quot; published by the American publisher Avenel Books in 1983.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
This story was not adapted for any &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; episode.

<doc id="292257" wikidata="Q1009253" url="?curid=292257" title="Ipswich, Queensland">
<text>Ipswich () is an urban centre within the City of Ipswich in South East Queensland, Australia. Situated on the Bremer River, it is approximately 40 km (25 mi) west of the Brisbane central business district. Ipswich is renowned for its architectural, natural and cultural heritage, and the city preserves and operates from many of its historical buildings, with more than 6000 heritage-listed sites and over 500 parks. Ipswich was founded in 1827 as a mining settlement, and soon developed into a major commercial and population centre. The suburb of the same name serves as the city’s central business district. In the , the population of the urban area of Ipswich was 115,913 people.

==History==
===Early history===
Ipswich was tribally known as &quot;Coodjirar&quot; in the Yugararpul language.

Known as the Ugarapul and Yuggerabul people are Australian Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland.Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. The languages of Greater Brisbane are related – there is uncertainty over which dialects belong to which language. The Yugarabul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Brisbane City Council, Ipswich City Council and the Scenic Rim Regional Council.

Prior to the arrival of European settlers, what is now called Ipswich was home to many indigenous language groups, including the Warpai tribe, Yuggera and Ugarapul Indigenous Australian groups. The area was first explored by European colonists in 1826, when Captain Patrick Logan, Commandant of the Moreton Bay penal colony, sailed up the Brisbane River and discovered large deposits of limestone and other minerals.

===Settlement===

The town began in 1827 as a limestone mining settlement and grew rapidly as a major inland port. Ipswich was initially named &quot;The Limestone Hills&quot; and later shortened to &quot;Limestone&quot;, however in 1843 it was renamed after the town of Ipswich in England. The population was 932 in 1851 and had risen to 2459 by 1856. It became a municipality in 1858. Ipswich had been a prime candidate for becoming the capital of Queensland from about 1847 when the Rev. John Dunmore Lang had toured both Ipswich and Brisbane, and noted the strength of Ipswich as a port town with access to the wool suppliers of the Darling Downs, but Brisbane was instead chosen due to its mercantile and colonial interests. Brisbane was declared the capital of the new Crown Colony of Queensland in 1859. It was proclaimed a city in 1904.

The city became a major coal-mining area in the early 19th Century, contributing to the development of railways in the region as a means of transport. The first recorded coal mines in the central Ipswich area started at Woodend in 1848. Triassic aged dinosaur footprints were found in underground coal mines in the vicinity of the suburbs of Ebbw Vale and New Chum while large numbers of Jurassic aged dinosaur footprints have been reported from the suburb of Rosewood.

From the 1840s onward, Ipswich was becoming an important river port for growing local industries such as coal and wool from the Darling Downs and a regular paddlesteamer service from Brisbane Town, &quot;The Experiment&quot;, was established in 1846. This, and other steamer services, remained the primary form of mass/bulk transport between the two cities until 1876, when the construction of the original Albert Bridge, spanning the Brisbane River at Indooroopilly, completed the railway line begun between Ipswich and Brisbane in 1873.

Ipswich was proclaimed a municipality on 3 March 1860 and became a city in 1904.

On 26 May 1872, a Primitive Methodist Church opened in East Street.

By April 1873 there were numerous churches in Ipswich: Anglican, Roman Catholic, Baptist, Primitive Methodist, German Lutheran, and Wesleyan Methodist.

A United Methodist Free Church opened in Brisbane Street in July 1873, having relocated from the &quot;comparative obscurity&quot; of North Ipswich.

In March 1888, 239 allotments of the &quot;Liverpool Estate&quot; were advertised to be auctioned by E. Bostock in conjunction with Arthur Martin &amp; Co. A map advertising the auction shows the proximity of the estate to the railway workshops and the Bremer River.In June 1911, 26 building sites of &quot;East Ipswich Station Estate&quot; were advertised to be auctioned by E. Bostock &amp; Sons. A map advertising the auction shows the location of the estate in proximity to the railway line.

In 1914, 65 garden allotments were advertised to be auctioned by E. Bostock &amp; Sons. The area was called the &quot;Orangefield Estate&quot;. It was formerly an orchard of James Alexander Jackes, and the real estate map advertised that the estate was well stocked with fruit trees. It was reported in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; that 20 allotments were sold. This article also listed the buyers. Unsold allotments were advertised in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot;.

In 1922, 12 allotments were advertised in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; to be auctioned by Bacon &amp; Co. Auctioneers in conjunction with H. J. Hargreaves &amp; Co. The area was called the &quot;Whitehill Road Estate&quot;. A map advertising the auction shows the estate is across the road from the intersection of Whitehill Road and Griffith Road. Both street names are still in use. By July 1922 the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; advertised that only six allotments were left.

In October 1925, several allotments in the &quot;Fiveways Estate&quot; at East Ipswich were advertised to be auctioned by Jackson &amp; Meyers in conjunction with Bacon &amp; Co. A map advertising the auction states that the lots were ideal for residential sites, convenient to the East Ipswich Railway Station and water, gas and electric light was available.

In 1928, 211 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by E. Bostock &amp; Sons and W. B. Parkinson. The area was called the &quot;Cribb Estate&quot; and on the estate map it was noted that it was on the eastern slopes of Limestone Hill. The auction was advertised in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; and it was also noted in the notes of the Council Meeting published in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; that approval had been granted to gravel new roads in the estate before it was sold. It was reported in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; that 40 allotments sold on the day of auction and some of the buyers were listed. By the end of 1928 it was reported in the &quot;Queensland Times&quot; that another 20 allotments had been sold.

In 1930, the Abermain Estate, Tivoli, was advertised to be auctioned by E. Bostock &amp; Sons. The estate map noted that the area comprised the Abermain Colliery containing 1295 acres and farms. It was reported in the &quot;Toowoomba Chronicle and Darling Downs Gazette&quot;, and &quot;The Brisbane Courier&quot;, that there was no bid for the coal mine but some farms had sold on the day of auction and some of the buyers were listed. It was also reported later in the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; of further items sold.

<text> (; &quot;German Wave&quot;), commonly shortened to DW (), is a German public, state-owned international broadcaster funded by the German federal tax budget. The service is available in 32 languages. DW&#x27;s satellite television service consists of channels in English, Spanish, and Arabic. The work of DW is regulated by the Act, stating that content is intended to be independent of government influence. DW is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

DW offers regularly updated articles on its news website and runs its own centre for international media development, DW Akademie. The broadcaster&#x27;s stated goals are to produce reliable news coverage, provide access to the German language, and promote understanding between peoples.

In total, over 4,000 distinct people of over 140 nationalities work in DW&#x27;s offices in Bonn and Berlin, as well as at other locations worldwide.

== History ==

=== Precursor ===
A predecessor with a similar name was &quot;Deutsche Welle GmbH&quot;, founded in August 1924 by German diplomat and radio pioneer Ernst Ludwig Voss in Berlin and broadcast regularly from 7 January 1926. The station was initially owned by 70% by Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft and 30% by the Free State of Prussia. From 1931 onwards, Deutsche Welle broadcast from the Berlin Broadcasting House. On 1 January 1933 Deutsche Welle GmbH was officially transferred to Deutschlandsender GmbH.

The station sees itself in the tradition of the first German foreign broadcaster, the Weltrundfunksender (world broadcaster) of the Weimar Republic. The Weltrundfunksender was renamed to deutscher Kurzwellensender (German Shortwave Broadcaster) by the Nazis in 1933.

=== Beginnings ===
DW&#x27;s first shortwave broadcast took place on 3 May 1953 with an address by the then-West German President, Theodor Heuss. On 11 June 1953, ARD public broadcasters signed an agreement to share responsibility for . At first, it was controlled by Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR). In 1955, NWDR split into Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), WDR assumed responsibility for programming. 

Politically the creation of a German International broadcasting station was supported by CDU chancellor Konrad Adenauer. To prevent governmental indoctrination in Germany, broadcasting is a matter of the federal states. In a years-long dispute between the Adenauer and the federal states of Germany, the federal government was allowed to create &quot;Deutschlandfunk&quot; aiming GDR citizens and &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; for an international audience. In 1959, Adenauer presented a bill to establish three federal broadcasting companies: &quot;Deutschlandfunk&quot;, &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; and &quot;Deutschland-Fernsehen (Germany-TV)&quot;. The Federal Constitutional Court stopped Adenauer&#x27;s television plans. Radio, on the other hand, was permitted as a federal institution. 

In 1960, became an independent public body after a court ruled that while broadcasting &quot;to&quot; Germany was a state matter, broadcasting &quot;from&quot; Germany was part of the federal government&#x27;s foreign affairs function. 

On 7 June 1962, DW joined ARD as a national broadcasting station. was originally headquartered in the West German city of Cologne. After reunification, when much of the government relocated to Berlin, the station&#x27;s headquarters moved to Bonn.

=== German reunification ===
With the German reunification in 1990, Radio Berlin International (RBI), East Germany&#x27;s international broadcaster ceased to exist. Some of the RBI staff joined and DW inherited some broadcasting facilities, including transmitting facilities at Nauen, as well as RBI&#x27;s frequencies.

DW (TV) began as RIAS-TV, a television station launched by the West Berlin broadcaster RIAS (Radio in the American Sector / Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor) in August 1988; they also acquired the German Educational Television Network in the United States. The fall of the Berlin Wall the following year and German reunification in 1990 meant that RIAS-TV was to be closed down. On 1 April 1992, inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German- and English-language television channel broadcast via satellite, DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours German, 10 hours English, 2 hours Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo.

 took some of the former independent radio broadcasting service Deutschlandfunk&#x27;s foreign-language programming in 1993, when Deutschlandfunk was absorbed into the new Deutschlandradio.

In addition to radio and television programming, DW sponsored some published material. For example, the South-Asia Department published &quot;German Heritage: A Series Written for the South Asia Programme&quot; in 1967, and in 1984 published &quot;African Writers on the Air&quot;. Both publications were transcripts of DW programming.

=== Internet presence ===
In September 1994, was the first public broadcaster in Germany with an internet presence, initially &quot;www-dw.gmd.de,&quot; hosted by the GMD Information Technology Research Center. For its first two years, the site listed little more than contact addresses, although DW&#x27;s &quot;News Journal&quot; was broadcast in RealAudio from Real&#x27;s server beginning in 1995, and &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;″s initial web presence, which included news articles from the newspaper, shared the site. In 1996, it evolved into a news website using the URL &quot;dwelle.de&quot;; in 2001, the URL changed to &quot;www.dw-world.de,&quot; and was changed again in 2012, to www.dw.de. purchased the domain &quot;dw.com&quot;, which previously belonged to DiamondWare, in 2013; DW had attempted to claim ownership of the address in 2000, without success. DW eventually moved to the &quot;www.dw.com&quot; domain on 22 June 2015. According to DW, their website delivers information by topic with an intuitive navigation organized to meet users&#x27; expectations. The layout offers more flexibility to feature pictures, videos, and in-depth reporting on the day&#x27;s events in a multimedia and multilingual fashion. They also integrated their Media Center into the dw.de website making it easier for users to access videos, audio, and picture galleries from DW&#x27;s multimedia archive of reports, programs, and coverage of special issues.

DW&#x27;s news site is in seven core languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese for Brazil, and Russian), as well as a mixture of news and information in 23 other languages in which broadcasts. Persian became the site&#x27;s eighth focus language in 2007.

German and European news is DW&#x27;s central focus, but the site also offers background information about German and German language courses. Deutsch, Warum Nicht? (literally: &quot;German, Why Not?&quot;) is a personal course for learning the German language, created by and the .

In 2003, the German government passed a new &quot; Act&quot;, which defined DW as a tri-media organization, making the website an equal partner with DW-TV and DW Radio. The website is available in 30 languages but focuses on German, English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Arabic. Persian became the eighth focus language in 2007.

In March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels, namely DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+. DW-TV Asia (DW-TV Asien in German) contains 16 hours of German programming and 8 hours in English, whilst DW-TV Asia+ contains 18 hours of English programmes plus 6 hours of German programmes.

In August 2009, DW-TV&#x27;s carriage in the United Kingdom on Sky channel 794 ceased, although the channel continues to be available via other European satellites receivable in the UK.

In 2011, DW announced a significant reduction of service including the closure of most of its FM services in the Balkans (except for Romani), but that it would expand its network of FM partners in Africa. The radio production for Hausa, Kiswahili, French, and Portuguese for Africa was optimized for FM broadcasts. DW also produces a regional radio magazine in English daily, which is to be rebroadcast by African partners.

Audio content in Arabic is distributed online, via mobile, or rebroadcast by partners.

DW announced it would focus on FM partnerships for Bengali, Urdu, Dari/Pashtu, and Indonesian for South Asia, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

On 1 November 2011, DW discontinued shortwave broadcasts in German, Russian, Persian, and Indonesian and ended its English service outside Africa. Chinese programming was reduced from 120 minutes to 60 minutes a week. As of November 2011, DW only broadcast radio programming via shortwave in Amharic, Chinese, Dari, English, and French for Africa, Hausa, Kiswahili, Pashtu, Portuguese for Africa and Urdu.

=== Rebranding television news ===
On 22 June 2015, DW TV launched a 24-hour English-language news channel with a new design and a new studio as part of a rebrand to DW News. Previously, DW&#x27;s news programmes were called &quot;Journal&quot; and broadcast in English in 3-, 15- and 30-minute blocks. The new channel offers 30-minute updates every hour and 60-minute programmes twice a day on weekdays. DW News broadcasts from Berlin but frequently has live social media segments hosted from a specially designed studio in Bonn. The German, Spanish, and Arabic channels also received a new design.

At the same time, DW&#x27;s news website moved from a .de URL to .com and added a social media stream to its front page. The refreshed DW services were launched under the tagline &#x27;Made for Minds&#x27;.

=== Plans for the future ===
 has developed a two-tier approach that they are using for the future growth of their company which consists of a global approach and a regional approach. Within their global approach, DW has now made plans to boost its competitiveness market throughout the world with news and television coverage. The plan implements covering almost all regions of the world with two television channels in each region. With some exclusions, the entire world will be covered. Hours covered range throughout regions and the coverage will be in German, English, Spanish, and Arabic.

The regional approach looks at marketing over the Internet to offer news coverage in languages other than the 4 being offered. With updates on DW&#x27;s website news will be better tailored to each region. Over time, they plan to diversify their online coverage with more regional content being covered.

The budget of the for 2016 was 301.8 million euros.

On 25 February 2018, DW-TV published &quot;The Climate Cover Up – Big Oil&#x27;s Campaign of Deception&quot; (2018) after documents confirmed big oil companies have known the burning of fossil fuels impacts climate since 1957.

== Funding ==
 is funded from federal grants taken from the federal tax revenue.

Since the reorganisation of broadcasting as a result of German reunification, has been the only remaining broadcasting corporation under federal law. In contrast to the national public broadcasters, which are financed by the license fee the ARD state broadcasters, Deutschlandradio and ZDF, it is not financed through the broadcasting fee, but from federal taxes. The Ministry for Culture and Media is responsible for the financing, which in turn allows the DW to offer a broadcast with low to nonexistent advertising time.

== Editorial independence ==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated Deutsche Welle to be &quot;Independent State Funded Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== Censorship ==
On 10 April 2019, DW announced that Venezuela&#x27;s state telecoms regulator Conatel had halted its Spanish-language channel. By 15 April, the broadcasting service was restored.

In 2019, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused DW of calling on Russians to take part in recent anti-government protests and threatened it would take action against the outlet under domestic law if it made such calls again. Shortly after, Russia&#x27;s parliament accused DW of breaking election legislation and asked the foreign ministry to consider revoking the German broadcaster&#x27;s right to work in the country. By November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared he did not support banning foreign media outlets.

On 3 February 2022, in retaliation to Germany&#x27;s broadcasting regulator&#x27;s decision to ban the transmission of the Russian state-run RT Deutsch channel over a lack of a broadcasting license, the Russian foreign ministry said that it would shut down DW&#x27;s Moscow bureau, strip all DW staff of their accreditation and terminate broadcasting of DW in Russia. It also stated that it would begin the procedure of designating DW as a &quot;foreign agent&quot;.

The Moscow office of was informed that it would be shut at 9:00 on Friday, 4 February 2022. DW made plans to relocate Moscow operations to the Latvian capital, Riga.

In March 2022, a Belarusian court recognized the Telegram channel “DW Belarus” and the Deutsche Welle logo as extremist materials. In April 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus labeled DW Belarus as an extremist group.

On 30 June 2022, DW was banned in Turkey upon the request of Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK). RTÜK ordered DW in February 2022 to pay the license fee or to terminate their service in Turkey.

In October 2022, Iran sanctioned DW Farsi for coverage of 2022 Iranian protests. Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry announced the sanctions in a statement, accusing those listed of &quot;supporting terrorism.&quot;

== Broadcasting ==
The main distribution of DW programs is by Satellite transmissions, Internet Stream and re-broadcasting by local FM-radio stations. Historically shortwave broadcastswere the main distribution chanel of international broadcsters. so Deutsche Welle.

For parts of Africa, where DW believes many people can still be reached via radio, DW broadcasts programs via shortwave. 

The TV program is distributed via various satellite channels and fed into cable networks. It is also available as a live stream on the DW website and in the ARD media library. Since 2019, DW has been providing its websites as an onion service via the Tor network in order to circumvent censorship measures by non-democratic states. 

Deutsche Welle was heavily involved in technological research initiatives in order to adapt shortwave transmission to today&#x27;s standards through the use of digital technology. DW favored the technology of the Digital Radio Mondiale consortium. In 2008 she started the BBC &amp; DW project with the British BBC. However, this was soon discontinued due to a lack of success on the listener side.

=== Shortwave relay stations ===
In the so called &quot;Golden area&quot; of shortwave radio at the time of the cold war, DW had a number of shortwave relay stations in South-East Asia, Africa and Europe.
* Trincomalee, Sri Lanka (1984 to 2013) sold to Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation
** 3 × 250 kW shortwave transmitters
** 1 × 400 kW mediumwave transmitter
** 20 antennas (to be verified)
* Kigali, Rwanda: A relay station in Kigali, Rwanda, was inaugurated on 30 August 1963, and provided coverage for Africa. This relay station closed 28 March 2015.

* Sines, Portugal closed on 30 October 2011 and was due to be dismantled after a few months.
** 3 × 250 kW shortwave transmitters
* Radio Antilles, Montserrat

DW used a relay station in Malta that had three SW and one 600 kW-MW transmitter and gave partial coverage of the Americas, Southern Asia and the Far East. It was inaugurated on 29 July 1974 in exchange for a grant of almost 1 million GBP. The station closed in January 1996.

Formerly, DW shared a transmitting station on Antigua in the Caribbean with the BBC. It was inaugurated on 1 November 1976 and closed on 31 March 2005. It had a relay-exchange with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that allowed DW to use two 250 kW transmitters in Sackville, New Brunswick until that facility closed down in 2012.

In July 2011 began implementing a major reform. The main changes have been a radical reduction of shortwave radio broadcasting—from a daily total of 260 to 55 hours—and an expansion of television broadcasting.

== Antisemitism controversies ==

Reporting from &quot;The Guardian&quot; in January 2020 raised allegations of &quot;sexual harassment, racism, antisemitism, and severe bullying&quot; within the organization.

On 5 December 2021, announced that it would suspend its partnership with a Jordanian partner, Roya TV, on account of antisemitic content published on Roya&#x27;s social media. Guido Baumhauer, a senior executive with DW, apologized, saying: &quot;We are truly sorry that we did not notice these disgusting images.&quot; Roya TV rejected the accusation and said it was the target of &quot;hostile campaign&quot; by unnamed parties.

In November 2021, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; published an investigation into social media comments allegedly made by members of DW&#x27;s Arabic service, including posts that appeared to downplay the Holocaust or perpetuate anti-Jewish stereotypes. On 3 December 2021, DW announced that it was suspending four employees and one freelancer during an external investigation, to be led by former German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and psychologist Ahmad Mansour, into the allegations. On 7 February, this investigation concluded that DW was correct to suspend these five employees, and recommended further action against eight other employees; it also recommended ending cooperation agreements with some Middle East-based news outlets, but concluded that there was no &quot;structural antisemitism&quot; at DW. Following the report, DW terminated the contracts of several other employees, including the former bureau chief in Beirut, who advocated the execution of &quot;[a]nyone who has to do with the Israelis&quot;; an employee who claimed that Israel controls people&#x27;s brains &quot;through art, media and music&quot;; and a third journalist had posted &quot;the Holocaust is a lie.&quot; Several of those fired stated that they had not been given a chance to defend their case, criticized DW&#x27;s lack of clarity regarding guidelines for what constituted antisemitism, and said they felt they were being censored in what they could write about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In September 2022, Farah Maraqa, one of seven Arab employees of DW fired in February, subsequently sued DW and won her case. The court ruled that her dismissal on charges of anti-Semitism was &quot;legally unjustified&quot;. A former colleague, Maram Salem, won her case in July against DW for unlawful termination, ruling that her Facebook posts were not anti-Semitic.

Also in September 2022, updated its Code of Conduct to include &quot;Germany&#x27;s historical responsibility for the Holocaust is also a reason for which we support the right of Israel to exist&quot; among their values and noted antisemitism is grounds for dismissal. The updated code of conduct is thought to improve &#x27;s chances of successfully terminating antisemitic employees in the future.

In August 2023, &quot;The New Arab&quot; published the results of a year long internal investigation by the pro-Palestinian activist publication &quot;Arab48&quot; which opined that Arab employees were unfairly dismissed over largely spurious antisemitism charges.

<doc id="292265" wikidata="Q1205637" url="?curid=292265" title="Behavioral ecology">
<text>Behavioral ecology, also spelled behavioural ecology, is the study of the evolutionary basis for animal behavior due to ecological pressures. Behavioral ecology emerged from ethology after Niko Tinbergen outlined four questions to address when studying animal behaviors: What are the proximate causes, ontogeny, survival value, and phylogeny of a behavior?

If an organism has a trait that provides a selective advantage (i.e., has adaptive significance) in its environment, then natural selection favors it. Adaptive significance refers to the expression of a trait that affects fitness, measured by an individual&#x27;s reproductive success. Adaptive traits are those that produce more copies of the individual&#x27;s genes in future generations. Maladaptive traits are those that leave fewer. For example, if a bird that can call more loudly attracts more mates, then a loud call is an adaptive trait for that species because a louder bird mates more frequently than less loud birds—thus sending more loud-calling genes into future generations. Conversely, loud calling birds may attract the attention of predators more often, decreasing their presence in the gene pool.

Individuals are always in competition with others for limited resources, including food, territories, and mates. Conflict occurs between predators and prey, between rivals for mates, between siblings, mates, and even between parents and offspring.

==Competing for resources==
The value of a social behavior depends in part on the social behavior of an animal&#x27;s neighbors. For example, the more likely a rival male is to back down from a threat, the more value a male gets out of making the threat. The more likely, however, that a rival will attack if threatened, the less useful it is to threaten other males. When a population exhibits a number of interacting social behaviors such as this, it can evolve a stable pattern of behaviors known as an evolutionarily stable strategy (or ESS). This term, derived from economic game theory, became prominent after John Maynard Smith (1982) recognized the possible application of the concept of a Nash equilibrium to model the evolution of behavioral strategies.

===Evolutionarily stable strategy===
In short, evolutionary game theory asserts that only strategies that, when common in the population, cannot be &quot;invaded&quot; by any alternative (mutant) strategy is an ESS, and thus maintained in the population. In other words, at equilibrium every player should play the best strategic response to each other. When the game is two player and symmetric, each player should play the strategy that provides the response best for it.

Therefore, the ESS is considered the evolutionary end point subsequent to the interactions. As the fitness conveyed by a strategy is influenced by what other individuals are doing (the relative frequency of each strategy in the population), behavior can be governed not only by optimality but the frequencies of strategies adopted by others and are therefore frequency dependent (frequency dependence).

Behavioral evolution is therefore influenced by both the physical environment and interactions between other individuals.

An example of how changes in geography can make a strategy susceptible to alternative strategies is the parasitization of the African honey bee, &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot;.

===Resource defense===
The term economic defendability was first introduced by Jerram Brown in 1964. Economic defendability states that defense of a resource have costs, such as energy expenditure or risk of injury, as well as benefits of priority access to the resource. Territorial behavior arises when benefits are greater than the costs.

Studies of the golden-winged sunbird have validated the concept of economic defendability. Comparing the energetic costs a sunbird expends in a day to the extra nectar gained by defending a territory, researchers showed that birds only became territorial when they were making a net energetic profit. When resources are at low density, the gains from excluding others may not be sufficient to pay for the cost of territorial defense. In contrast, when resource availability is high, there may be so many intruders that the defender would have no time to make use of the resources made available by defense.

Sometimes the economics of resource competition favors shared defense. An example is the feeding territories of the white wagtail. The white wagtails feed on insects washed up by the river onto the bank, which acts as a renewing food supply. If any intruders harvested their territory then the prey would quickly become depleted, but sometimes territory owners tolerate a second bird, known as a satellite. The two sharers would then move out of phase with one another, resulting in decreased feeding rate but also increased defense, illustrating advantages of group living.

===Ideal free distribution===
One of the major models used to predict the distribution of competing individuals amongst resource patches is the ideal free distribution model. Within this model, resource patches can be of variable quality, and there is no limit to the number of individuals that can occupy and extract resources from a particular patch. Competition within a particular patch means that the benefit each individual receives from exploiting a patch decreases logarithmically with increasing number of competitors sharing that resource patch. The model predicts that individuals will initially flock to higher-quality patches until the costs of crowding bring the benefits of exploiting them in line with the benefits of being the only individual on the lesser-quality resource patch. After this point has been reached, individuals will alternate between exploiting the higher-quality patches and the lower-quality patches in such a way that the average benefit for all individuals in both patches is the same. This model is &quot;ideal&quot; in that individuals have complete information about the quality of a resource patch and the number of individuals currently exploiting it, and &quot;free&quot; in that individuals are freely able to choose which resource patch to exploit.

An experiment by Manfred Malinski in 1979 demonstrated that feeding behavior in three-spined sticklebacks follows an ideal free distribution. Six fish were placed in a tank, and food items were dropped into opposite ends of the tank at different rates. The rate of food deposition at one end was set at twice that of the other end, and the fish distributed themselves with four individuals at the faster-depositing end and two individuals at the slower-depositing end. In this way, the average feeding rate was the same for all of the fish in the tank.

===Mating strategies and tactics===
As with any competition of resources, species across the animal kingdom may also engage in competitions for mating. If one considers mates or potentials mates as a resource, these sexual partners can be randomly distributed amongst resource pools within a given environment. Following the ideal free distribution model, suitors distribute themselves amongst the potential mates in an effort to maximize their chances or the number of potential matings. For all competitors, males of a species in most cases, there are variations in both the strategies and tactics used to obtain matings. Strategies generally refer to the genetically determined behaviors that can be described as conditional. Tactics refer to the subset of behaviors within a given genetic strategy. Thus it is not difficult for a great many variations in mating strategies to exist in a given environment or species.

An experiment conducted by Anthony Arak, where playback of synthetic calls from male natterjack toads was used to manipulate behavior of the males in a chorus, the difference between strategies and tactics is clear. While small and immature, male natterjack toads adopted a satellite tactic to parasitize larger males. Though large males on average still retained greater reproductive success, smaller males were able to intercept matings. When the large males of the chorus were removed, smaller males adopted a calling behavior, no longer competing against the loud calls of larger males. When smaller males got larger, and their calls more competitive, then they started calling and competing directly for mates.

==Sexual selection==

===Mate choice by resources===
In many sexually reproducing species, such as mammals, birds, and amphibians, females are able to bear offspring for a certain time period, during which the males are free to mate with other available females, and therefore can father many more offspring to pass on their genes. The fundamental difference between male and female reproduction mechanisms determines the different strategies each sex employs to maximize their reproductive success. For males, their reproductive success is limited by access to females, while females are limited by their access to resources. In this sense, females can be much choosier than males because they have to bet on the resources provided by the males to ensure reproductive success.

Resources usually include nest sites, food and protection. In some cases, the males provide all of them (e.g. sedge warblers). The females dwell in their chosen males&#x27; territories for access to these resources. The males gain ownership to the territories through male–male competition that often involves physical aggression. Only the largest and strongest males manage to defend the best quality nest sites. Females choose males by inspecting the quality of different territories or by looking at some male traits that can indicate the quality of resources. One example of this is with the grayling butterfly (&quot;Hipparchia semele&quot;), where males engage in complex flight patterns to decide who defends a particular territory. The female grayling butterfly chooses a male based on the most optimal location for oviposition. Sometimes, males leave after mating. The only resource that a male provides is a nuptial gift, such as protection or food, as seen in &quot;Drosophila subobscura.&quot; The female can evaluate the quality of the protection or food provided by the male so as to decide whether to mate or not or how long she is willing to copulate.

===Mate choice by genes===
When males&#x27; only contribution to offspring is their sperm, females are particularly choosy. With this high level of female choice, sexual ornaments are seen in males, where the ornaments reflect the male&#x27;s social status. Two hypotheses have been proposed to conceptualize the genetic benefits from female mate choice.

First, the good genes hypothesis suggests that female choice is for higher genetic quality and that this preference is favored because it increases fitness of the offspring. This includes Zahavi&#x27;s handicap hypothesis and Hamilton and Zuk&#x27;s host and parasite arms race. Zahavi&#x27;s handicap hypothesis was proposed within the context of looking at elaborate male sexual displays. He suggested that females favor ornamented traits because they are handicaps and are indicators of the male&#x27;s genetic quality. Since these ornamented traits are hazards, the male&#x27;s survival must be indicative of his high genetic quality in other areas. In this way, the degree that a male expresses his sexual display indicates to the female his genetic quality. Zuk and Hamilton proposed a hypothesis after observing disease as a powerful selective pressure on a rabbit population. They suggested that sexual displays were indicators of resistance of disease on a genetic level.

Such &#x27;choosiness&#x27; from the female individuals can be seen in wasp species too, especially among &quot;Polistes dominula&quot; wasps. The females tend to prefer males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots than those with larger and more irregularly shaped spots. Those males would have reproductive superiority over males with irregular spots.

In marbled newts, females show preference to mates with larger crests. This however, is not considered a handicap as it does not negatively affect males&#x27; chances of survival. It is simply a trait females show preference for when choosing their mate as it is an indication of health and fitness.

Fisher&#x27;s hypothesis of runaway sexual selection suggests that female preference is genetically correlated with male traits and that the preference co-evolves with the evolution of that trait, thus the preference is under indirect selection. Fisher suggests that female preference began because the trait indicated the male&#x27;s quality. The female preference spread, so that the females&#x27; offspring now benefited from the higher quality from specific trait but also greater attractiveness to mates. Eventually, the trait only represents attractiveness to mates, and no longer represents increased survival.

An example of mate choice by genes is seen in the cichlid fish &quot;Tropheus moorii&quot; where males provide no parental care. An experiment found that a female &quot;T. moorii&quot; is more likely to choose a mate with the same color morph as her own. In another experiment, females have been shown to share preferences for the same males when given two to choose from, meaning some males get to reproduce more often than others. 

===Sensory bias===
The sensory bias hypothesis states that the preference for a trait evolves in a non-mating context, and is then exploited by one sex to obtain more mating opportunities. The competitive sex evolves traits that exploit a pre-existing bias that the choosy sex already possesses. This mechanism is thought to explain remarkable trait differences in closely related species because it produces a divergence in signaling systems, which leads to reproductive isolation.

Sensory bias has been demonstrated in guppies, freshwater fish from Trinidad and Tobago. In this mating system, female guppies prefer to mate with males with more orange body coloration. However, outside of a mating context, both sexes prefer animate orange objects, which suggests that preference originally evolved in another context, like foraging. Orange fruits are a rare treat that fall into streams where the guppies live. The ability to find these fruits quickly is an adaptive quality that has evolved outside of a mating context. Sometime after the affinity for orange objects arose, male guppies exploited this preference by incorporating large orange spots to attract females.

Another example of sensory exploitation is in the water mite &quot;Neumania papillator&quot;, an ambush predator that hunts copepods (small crustaceans) passing by in the water column. When hunting, &quot;N. papillator&quot; adopts a characteristic stance termed the &#x27;net stance&#x27; - their first four legs are held out into the water column, with their four hind legs resting on aquatic vegetation; this allows them to detect vibrational stimuli produced by swimming prey and use this to orient towards and clutch at prey. During courtship, males actively search for females - if a male finds a female, he slowly circles around the female whilst trembling his first and second leg near her. Male leg trembling causes females (who were in the &#x27;net stance&#x27;) to orient towards often clutch the male. This did not damage the male or deter further courtship; the male then deposited spermatophores and began to vigorously fan and jerk his fourth pair of legs over the spermatophore, generating a current of water that passed over the spermatophores and towards the female. Sperm packet uptake by the female would sometimes follow. Heather Proctor hypothesised that the vibrations trembling male legs made were done to mimic the vibrations that females detect from swimming prey - this would trigger the female prey-detection responses causing females to orient and then clutch at males, mediating courtship. If this was true and males were exploiting female predation responses, then hungry females should be more receptive to male trembling – Proctor found that unfed captive females did orient and clutch at males significantly more than fed captive females did, consistent with the sensory exploitation hypothesis.

Other examples for the sensory bias mechanism include traits in auklets, wolf spiders, and manakins. Further experimental work is required to reach a fuller understanding of the prevalence and mechanisms of sensory bias.

==Sexual conflict==
Sexual conflict, in some form or another, may very well be inherent in the ways most animals reproduce. Females invest more in offspring prior to mating, due to the differences in gametes in species that exhibit anisogamy, and often invest more in offspring after mating. This unequal investment leads, on one hand, to intense competition between males for mates and, on the other hand, to females choosing among males for better access to resources and good genes. Because of differences in mating goals, males and females may have very different preferred outcomes to mating.

Sexual conflict occurs whenever the preferred outcome of mating is different for the male and female. This difference, in theory, should lead to each sex evolving adaptations that bias the outcome of reproduction towards its own interests. This sexual competition leads to sexually antagonistic coevolution between males and females, resulting in what has been described as an evolutionary arms race between males and females.

===Conflict over mating===

Males&#x27; reproductive successes are often limited by access to mates, whereas females&#x27; reproductive successes are more often limited by access to resources. Thus, for a given sexual encounter, it benefits the male to mate, but benefits the female to be choosy and resist. For example, male small tortoiseshell butterfly compete to gain the best territory to mate. Another example of this conflict can be found in the Eastern carpenter bee, &quot;Xylocopa virginica&quot;. Males of this species are limited in reproduction primarily by access to mates, so they claim a territory and wait for a female to pass through. Big males are, therefore, more successful in mating because they claim territories near the female nesting sites that are more sought after. Smaller males, on the other hand, monopolize less competitive sites in foraging areas so that they may mate with reduced conflict. Another example of this is &quot;Sepsis cynipsea,&quot; where males of the species mount females to guard them from other males and remain on the female, attempting to copulate, until the female either shakes them off or consents to mating. Similarly the neriid fly &quot;Derocephalus angusticollis&quot; demonstrates mate guarding by using their long limbs to hold onto the female as well as push other males away during copulation. Extreme manifestations of this conflict are seen throughout nature. For example, the male &quot;Panorpa&quot; scorpionflies attempt to force copulation. Male scorpionflies usually acquire mates by presenting them with edible nuptial gifts in the forms of salivary secretions or dead insects. However, some males attempt to force copulation by grabbing females with a specialized abdominal organ without offering a gift. Forced copulation is costly to the female as she does not receive the food from the male and has to search for food herself (costing time and energy), while it is beneficial for the male as he does not need to find a nuptial gift.

In other cases, however, it pays for the female to gain more matings and her social mate to prevent these so as to guard paternity. For example, in many socially monogamous birds, males follow females closely during their fertile periods and attempt to chase away any other males to prevent extra-pair matings. The female may attempt to sneak off to achieve these extra matings. In species where males are incapable of constant guarding, the social male may frequently copulate with the female so as to swamp rival males&#x27; sperm.

Sexual conflict after mating has also been shown to occur in both males and females. Males employ a diverse array of tactics to increase their success in sperm competition. These can include removing other male&#x27;s sperm from females, displacing other male&#x27;s sperm by flushing out prior inseminations with large amounts of their own sperm, creating copulatory plugs in females&#x27; reproductive tracts to prevent future matings with other males, spraying females with anti-aphrodisiacs to discourage other males from mating with the female, and producing sterile parasperm to protect fertile eusperm in the female&#x27;s reproductive tract. For example, the male spruce bud moth (&quot;Zeiraphera canadensis)&quot; secretes an accessory gland protein during mating that makes them unattractive to other males and thus prevents females from future copulation. The Rocky Mountain parnassian also exhibits this type of sexual conflict when the male butterflies deposit a waxy genital plug onto the tip of the female&#x27;s abdomen that physically prevents the female from mating again. Males can also prevent future mating by transferring an anti-Aphrodiasic to the female during mating. This behavior is seen in butterfly species such as &quot;Heliconius melpomene&quot;, where males transfer a compound that causes the female to smell like a male butterfly and thus deter any future potential mates. Furthermore, males may control the strategic allocation of sperm, producing more sperm when females are more promiscuous. All these methods are meant to ensure that females are more likely to produce offspring belonging to the males who uses the method.

Females also control the outcomes of matings, and there exists the possibility that females choose sperm (cryptic female choice). A dramatic example of this is the feral fowl &quot;Gallus gallus&quot;. In this species, females prefer to copulate with dominant males, but subordinate males can force matings. In these cases, the female is able to eject the subordinate male&#x27;s sperm using cloacal contractions.

==Parental care and family conflicts==
Parental care is the investment a parent puts into their offspring—which includes protecting and feeding the young, preparing burrows or nests, and providing eggs with yolk. There is great variation in parental care in the animal kingdom. In some species, the parents may not care for their offspring at all, while in others the parents exhibit single-parental or even bi-parental care. As with other topics in behavioral ecology, interactions within a family involve conflicts. These conflicts can be broken down into three general types: sexual (male–female) conflict, parent–offspring conflict, and sibling conflict.

===Types of parental care===
There are many different patterns of parental care in the animal kingdom. The patterns can be explained by physiological constraints or ecological conditions, such as mating opportunities. In invertebrates, there is no parental care in most species because it is more favorable for parents to produce a large number of eggs whose fate is left to chance than to protect a few individual young. In other cases, parental care is indirect, manifested via actions taken before the offspring is produced, but nonetheless essential for their survival; for example, female &quot;Lasioglossum figueresi&quot; sweat bees excavate a nest, construct brood cells, and stock the cells with pollen and nectar before they lay their eggs, so when the larvae hatch they are sheltered and fed, but the females die without ever interacting with their brood. In birds, biparental care is the most common, because reproductive success directly depends on the parents&#x27; ability to feed their chicks. Two parents can feed twice as many young, so it is more favorable for birds to have both parents delivering food. In mammals, female-only care is the most common. This is most likely because females are internally fertilized and so are holding the young inside for a prolonged period of gestation, which provides males with the opportunity to desert. Females also feed the young through lactation after birth, so males are not required for feeding. Male parental care is only observed in species where they contribute to feeding or carrying of the young, such as in marmosets. In fish there is no parental care in 79% of bony fish. In fish with parental care, it usually limited to selecting, preparing, and defending a nest, as seen in sockeye salmon, for example. Also, parental care in fish, if any, is primarily done by males, as seen in gobies and redlip blennies. The cichlid fish &quot;V. moorii&quot; exhibits biparental care. In species with internal fertilization, the female is usually the one to take care of the young. In cases where fertilization is external the male becomes the main caretaker.

===Familial conflict===
Familial conflict is a result of trade-offs as a function of lifetime parental investment. Parental investment was defined by Robert Trivers in 1972 as &quot;any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring&#x27;s chance of surviving at the cost of the parent&#x27;s ability to invest in other offspring&quot;. Parental investment includes behaviors like guarding and feeding. Each parent has a limited amount of parental investment over the course of their lifetime. Investment trade-offs in offspring quality and quantity within a brood and trade offs between current and future broods leads to conflict over how much parental investment to provide and to whom parents should invest in. There are three major types of familial conflict: sexual, parent–offspring, and sibling–sibling conflict.

====Sexual conflict====
There is conflict among parents as to who should provide the care as well as how much care to provide. Each parent must decide whether or not to stay and care for their offspring, or to desert their offspring. This decision is best modeled by game theoretic approaches to evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) where the best strategy for one parent depends on the strategy adopted by the other parent. Recent research has found response matching in parents who determine how much care to invest in their offspring. Studies found that parent great tits match their partner&#x27;s increased care-giving efforts with increased provisioning rates of their own. This cued parental response is a type of behavioral negotiation between parents that leads to stabilized compensation. Sexual conflicts can give rise to antagonistic co-evolution between the sexes to try to get the other sex to care more for offspring. For example, in the waltzing fly &quot;Prochyliza xanthostoma&quot;, ejaculate feeding maximizes female reproductive success and minimizes the female&#x27;s chance of mating multiply. Evidence suggests that the sperm evolved to prevent female waltzing flies from mating multiply in order to ensure the male&#x27;s paternity.

====Parent–offspring conflict====

According to Robert Trivers&#x27;s theory on relatedness, each offspring is related to itself by 1, but is only 0.5 related to their parents and siblings. Genetically, offspring are predisposed to behave in their own self-interest while parents are predisposed to behave equally to all their offspring, including both current and future ones. Offspring selfishly try to take more than their fair shares of parental investment, while parents try to spread out their parental investment equally amongst their present young and future young.
There are many examples of parent–offspring conflict in nature. One manifestation of this is asynchronous hatching in birds. A behavioral ecology hypothesis is known as Lack&#x27;s brood reduction hypothesis (named after David Lack). Lack&#x27;s hypothesis posits an evolutionary and ecological explanation as to why birds lay a series of eggs with an asynchronous delay leading to nestlings of mixed age and weights. According to Lack, this brood behavior is an ecological insurance that allows the larger birds to survive in poor years and all birds to survive when food is plentiful. We also see sex-ratio conflict between the queen and her workers in social hymenoptera. Because of haplodiploidy, the workers (offspring) prefer a 3:1 female to male sex allocation while the queen prefers a 1:1 sex ratio. Both the queen and the workers try to bias the sex ratio in their favor. In some species, the workers gain control of the sex ratio, while in other species, like &quot;B. terrestris&quot;, the queen has a considerable amount of control over the colony sex ratio. Lastly, there has been recent evidence regarding genomic imprinting that is a result of parent–offspring conflict. Paternal genes in offspring demand more maternal resources than maternal genes in the same offspring and vice versa. This has been shown in imprinted genes like insulin-like growth factor-II.

====Parent–offspring conflict resolution====
Parents need an honest signal from their offspring that indicates their level of hunger or need, so that the parents can distribute resources accordingly. Offspring want more than their fair share of resources, so they exaggerate their signals to wheedle more parental investment. However, this conflict is countered by the cost of excessive begging. Not only does excessive begging attract predators, but it also retards chick growth if begging goes unrewarded. Thus, the cost of increased begging enforces offspring honesty.

Another resolution for parent–offspring conflict is that parental provisioning and offspring demand have actually coevolved, so that there is no obvious underlying conflict. Cross-fostering experiments in great tits (&quot;Parus major&quot;) have shown that offspring beg more when their biological mothers are more generous. Therefore, it seems that the willingness to invest in offspring is co-adapted to offspring demand.

====Sibling–sibling conflict====

The lifetime parental investment is the fixed amount of parental resources available for all of a parent&#x27;s young, and an offspring wants as much of it as possible. Siblings in a brood often compete for parental resources by trying to gain more than their fair share of what their parents can offer. Nature provides numerous examples in which sibling rivalry escalates to such an extreme that one sibling tries to kill off broodmates to maximize parental investment (&quot;See Siblicide&quot;). In the Galápagos fur seal, the second pup of a female is usually born when the first pup is still suckling. This competition for the mother&#x27;s milk is especially fierce during periods of food shortage such as an El Niño year, and this usually results in the older pup directly attacking and killing the younger one.

In some bird species, sibling rivalry is also abetted by the hatching of eggs. In the blue-footed booby, for example, the first egg in a nest is hatched four days before the second one, resulting in the elder chick having a four-day head start in growth. When the elder chick falls 20-25% below its expected weight threshold, it attacks its younger sibling and drives it from the nest.

Sibling relatedness in a brood also influences the level of sibling–sibling conflict. In a study on passerine birds, it was found that chicks begged more loudly in species with higher levels of extra-pair paternity.

===Brood parasitism===
Some animals deceive other species into providing all parental care. These brood parasites selfishly exploit their hosts&#x27; parents and host offspring. The common cuckoo is a well known example of a brood parasite. Female cuckoos lay a single egg in the nest of the host species and when the cuckoo chick hatches, it ejects all the host eggs and young. Other examples of brood parasites include honeyguides, cowbirds, and the large blue butterfly.
Brood parasite offspring have many strategies to induce their host parents to invest parental care. Studies show that the common cuckoo uses vocal mimicry to reproduce the sound of multiple hungry host young to solicit more food. Other cuckoos use visual deception with their wings to exaggerate the begging display. False gapes from brood parasite offspring cause host parents to collect more food. Another example of a brood parasite is &quot;Phengaris&quot; butterflies such as &quot;Phengaris rebeli&quot; and &quot;Phengaris arion&quot;, which differ from the cuckoo in that the butterflies do not oviposit directly in the nest of the host, an ant species &quot;Myrmica schencki&quot;. Rather, the butterfly larvae release chemicals that deceive the ants into believing that they are ant larvae, causing the ants to bring the butterfly larvae back to their own nests to feed them. Other examples of brood parasites are &quot;Polistes sulcifer&quot;, a paper wasp that has lost the ability to build its own nests so females lay their eggs in the nest of a host species, &quot;Polistes dominula&quot;, and rely on the host workers to take care of their brood, as well as &quot;Bombus bohemicus,&quot; a bumblebee that relies on host workers of various other &quot;Bombus&quot; species. Similarly, in &quot;Eulaema meriana&quot;, some Leucospidae wasps exploit the brood cells and nest for shelter and food from the bees. &quot;Vespula austriaca&quot; is another wasp in which the females force the host workers to feed and take care of the brood. In particular, &quot;Bombus hyperboreus&quot;, an Arctic bee species, is also classified as a brood parasite in that it attacks and enslaves other species within their subgenus, &quot;Alpinobombus&quot; to propagate their population.

==Mating systems==
Various types of mating systems include monogamy, polygyny, polyandry, and promiscuity. Each is differentiated by the sexual behavior between mates, such as which males mate with certain females. An influential paper by Stephen Emlen and Lewis Oring (1977) argued that two main factors of animal behavior influence the diversity of mating systems: the relative accessibility that each sex has to mates, and the parental desertion by either sex.

===Mating systems with no male parental care===
In a system that does not have male parental care, resource dispersion, predation, and the effects of social living primarily influence female dispersion, which in turn influences male dispersion. Since males&#x27; primary concern is female acquisition, the males either indirectly or directly compete for the females. In direct competition, the males are directly focused on the females. Blue-headed wrasse demonstrate the behavior in which females follow resources—such as good nest sites—and males follow the females. Conversely, species with males that exemplify indirectly competitive behavior tend towards the males&#x27; anticipation of the resources desired by females and their subsequent effort to control or acquire these resources, which helps them to achieve success with females. Grey-sided voles demonstrate indirect male competition for females. The males were experimentally observed to home in on the sites with the best food in anticipation of females settling in these areas. Males of &quot;Euglossa imperialis&quot;, a non-social bee species, also demonstrate indirect competitive behavior by forming aggregations of territories, which can be considered leks, to defend fragrant-rich primary territories. The purpose of these aggregations is largely only facultative, since the more suitable fragrant-rich sites there are, the more habitable territories there are to inhabit, giving females of this species a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate. Leks and choruses have also been deemed another behavior among the phenomena of male competition for females. Due to the resource-poor nature of the territories that lekking males often defend, it is difficult to categorize them as indirect competitors. For example, the ghost moth males display in leks to attract a female mate. Additionally, it is difficult to classify them as direct competitors seeing as they put a great deal of effort into their defense of their territories before females arrive, and upon female arrival they put for the great mating displays to attract the females to their individual sites. These observations make it difficult to determine whether female or resource dispersion primarily influences male aggregation, especially in lieu of the apparent difficulty that males may have defending resources and females in such densely populated areas. Because the reason for male aggregation into leks is unclear, five hypotheses have been proposed. These postulates propose the following as reasons for male lekking: hotspot, predation reduction, increased female attraction, hotshot males, facilitation of female choice. With all of the mating behaviors discussed, the primary factors influencing differences within and between species are ecology, social conflicts, and life history differences.

In some other instances, neither direct nor indirect competition is seen. Instead, in species like the Edith&#x27;s checkerspot butterfly, males&#x27; efforts are directed at acquisition of females and they exhibit indiscriminate mate location behavior, where, given the low cost of mistakes, they blindly attempt to mate both correctly with females and incorrectly with other objects.

===Mating systems with male parental care===

====Monogamy====
Monogamy is the mating system in 90% of birds, possibly because each male and female has a greater number of offspring if they share in raising a brood. In obligate monogamy, males feed females on the nest, or share in incubation and chick-feeding. In some species, males and females form lifelong pair bonds. Monogamy may also arise from limited opportunities for polygamy, due to strong competition among males for mates, females suffering from loss of male help, and female–female aggression.

====Polygyny====
In birds, polygyny occurs when males indirectly monopolize females by controlling resources. In species where males normally do not contribute much to parental care, females suffer relatively little or not at all. In other species, however, females suffer through the loss of male contribution, and the cost of having to share resources that the male controls, such as nest sites or food. In some cases, a polygynous male may control a high-quality territory so for the female, the benefits of polygyny may outweigh the costs.

====Polyandry threshold====
There also seems to be a &quot;polyandry threshold&quot; where males may do better by agreeing to share a female instead of maintaining a monogamous mating system. Situations that may lead to cooperation among males include when food is scarce, and when there is intense competition for territories or females. For example, male lions sometimes form coalitions to gain control of a pride of females. In some populations of Galapagos hawks, groups of males would cooperate to defend one breeding territory. The males would share matings with the female and share paternity with the offspring.

====Female desertion and sex role reversal====
In birds, desertion often happens when food is abundant, so the remaining partner is better able to raise the young unaided. Desertion also occurs if there is a great chance of a parent to gain another mate, which depends on environmental and populational factors. Some birds, such as the phalaropes, have reversed sex roles where the female is larger and more brightly colored, and compete for males to incubate their clutches. In jacanas, the female is larger than the male and her territory could overlap the multiple territories of up to four males. In the frog species &quot;P. bibronii,&quot; the female is fertilizes multiple nests, and the male is left to tend to each nest while the female moves on.

==Social behaviors==
Animals cooperate with each other to increase their own fitness. These altruistic, and sometimes spiteful behaviors can be explained by Hamilton&#x27;s rule, which states that &quot;rB-C &gt; 0&quot; where &quot;r&quot;= relatedness, &quot;B&quot;= benefits, and &quot;C&quot;= costs.

===Kin selection===
Kin selection refers to evolutionary strategies where an individual acts to favor the reproductive success of relatives, or kin, even if the action incurs some cost to the organism&#x27;s own survival and ability to procreate. John Maynard Smith coined the term in 1964, although the concept was referred to by Charles Darwin who cited that helping relatives would be favored by group selection. Mathematical descriptions of kin selection were initially offered by R. A. Fisher in 1930 and J. B. S. Haldane in 1932. and 1955. W. D. Hamilton popularized the concept later, including the mathematical treatment by George Price in 1963 and 1964.

Kin selection predicts that individuals will harbor personal costs in favor of one or multiple individuals because this can maximize their genetic contribution to future generations. For example, an organism may be inclined to expend great time and energy in parental investment to rear offspring since this future generation may be better suited for propagating genes that are highly shared between the parent and offspring. Ultimately, the initial actor performs apparent altruistic actions for kin to enhance its own reproductive fitness. In particular, organisms are hypothesized to act in favor of kin depending on their genetic relatedness. So, individuals are inclined to act altruistically for siblings, grandparents, cousins, and other relatives, but to differing degrees.

====Inclusive fitness====
Inclusive fitness describes the component of reproductive success in both a focal individual and their relatives. Importantly, the measure embodies the sum of direct and indirect fitness and the change in their reproductive success based on the actor&#x27;s behavior. That is, the effect an individual&#x27;s behaviors have on: being personally better-suited to reproduce offspring, and aiding descendant and non-descendant relatives in their reproductive efforts. Natural selection is predicted to push individuals to behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. Studying inclusive fitness is often done using predictions from Hamilton&#x27;s rule.

===Kin recognition===
====Genetic cues====
One possible method of kin selection is based on genetic cues that can be recognized phenotypically.Genetic recognition has been exemplified in a species that is usually not thought of as a social creature: amoebae. Social amoebae form fruiting bodies when starved for food. These amoebae preferentially formed slugs and fruiting bodies with members of their own lineage, which is clonally related. The genetic cue comes from variable lag genes, which are involved in signaling and adhesion between cells.

Kin can also be recognized a genetically determined odor, as studied in the primitively social sweat bee, &quot;Lasioglossum zephyrus&quot;. These bees can even recognize relatives they have never met and roughly determine relatedness. The Brazilian stingless bee &quot;Schwarziana quadripunctata&quot; uses a distinct combination of chemical hydrocarbons to recognize and locate kin. Each chemical odor, emitted from the organism&#x27;s epicuticles, is unique and varies according to age, sex, location, and hierarchical position. Similarly, individuals of the stingless bee species &quot;Trigona fulviventris&quot; can distinguish kin from non-kin through recognition of a number of compounds, including hydrocarbons and fatty acids that are present in their wax and floral oils from plants used to construct their nests. In the species, &quot;Osmia rufa,&quot; kin selection has also been associated with mating selection. Females, specifically, select males for mating with whom they are genetically more related to.

Some animals recognize kin by &quot;self-referencing:&quot; comparing the phenotypes of others to themselves. For example, Belding&#x27;s ground squirrels recognize relatives by comparing their own odor and those of littermates with odors of squirrels they encounter. These phenotypes come in the form of scent from dorsal and anal glands, and each animal has its own repertoire of odors. If another individual&#x27;s odor phenotype matches itself closely enough, it is likely a relative. Laboratory tests indicate that females can discriminate between kin and nonkin, close and distant relatives and, within-litters, between full-siblings and maternal half-siblings. Field observations confirm that females cooperate with their closest kin more than with distant kin, and behave aggressively toward nonrelatives. Golden hamsters and bluegill sunfish also can use themselves as
referents to discriminate close relatives from distant kin and nonkin.

====Environmental cues====
There are two simple rules that many animals follow to determine who is kin. These rules can be exploited, but exist because they are generally successful.

The first rule is &#x27;treat anyone in my home as kin.&#x27; This rule is readily seen in the reed warbler, a bird species that only focuses on chicks in their own nest. If its own kin is placed outside of the nest, a parent bird ignores that chick. This rule can sometimes lead to odd results, especially if there is a parasitic bird that lays eggs in the reed warbler nest. For example, an adult cuckoo may sneak its egg into the nest. Once the cuckoo hatches, the reed warbler parent feeds the invading bird like its own child. Even with the risk for exploitation, the rule generally proves successful.

The second rule, named by Konrad Lorenz as &#x27;imprinting,&#x27; states that those who you grow up with are kin. Several species exhibit this behavior, including, but not limited to the Belding&#x27;s ground squirrel. Experimentation with these squirrels showed that regardless of true genetic relatedness, those that were reared together rarely fought. Further research suggests that there is partially some genetic recognition going on as well, as siblings that were raised apart were less aggressive toward one another compared to non-relatives reared apart.

Another way animals may recognize their kin include the interchange of unique signals. While song singing is often considered a sexual trait between males and females, male–male song singing also occurs. For example, male vinegar flies &quot;Zaprionus tuberculatus&quot; can recognize each other by song.

===Cooperation===
Cooperation is broadly defined as behavior that provides a benefit to another individual that specifically evolved for that benefit. This excludes behavior that has not been expressly selected for to provide a benefit for another individual, because there are many commensal and parasitic relationships where the behavior one individual (which has evolved to benefit that individual and no others) is taken advantage of by other organisms. Stable cooperative behavior requires that it provide a benefit to both the actor and recipient, though the benefit to the actor can take many different forms.

====Within species====
Within species cooperation occurs among members of the same species. Examples of intraspecific cooperation include cooperative breeding (such as in weeper capuchins) and cooperative foraging (such as in wolves). There are also forms of cooperative defense mechanisms, such as the &quot;fighting swarm&quot; behavior used by the stingless bee &quot;Tetragonula carbonaria&quot;. Much of this behavior occurs due to kin selection. Kin selection allows cooperative behavior to evolve where the actor receives no direct benefits from the cooperation.

Cooperation (without kin selection) must evolve to provide benefits to both the actor and recipient of the behavior. This includes reciprocity, where the recipient of the cooperative behavior repays the actor at a later time. This may occur in vampire bats but it is uncommon in non-human animals. Cooperation can occur willingly between individuals when both benefit directly as well. Cooperative breeding, where one individual cares for the offspring of another, occurs in several species, including wedge-capped capuchin monkeys.

Cooperative behavior may also be enforced, where their failure to cooperate results in negative consequences. One of the best examples of this is worker policing, which occurs in social insect colonies.

The cooperative pulling paradigm is a popular experimental design used to assess if and under which conditions animals cooperate. It involves two or more animals pulling rewards towards themselves via an apparatus they can not successfully operate alone.

====Between species====
Cooperation can occur between members of different species. For interspecific cooperation to be evolutionarily stable, it must benefit individuals in both species. Examples include pistol shrimp and goby fish, nitrogen fixing microbes and legumes, ants and aphids. In ants and aphids, aphids secrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, which ants eat. The ants provide protection to the aphids against predators, and, in some instances, raise the aphid eggs and larvae inside the ant colony. This behavior is analogous to human domestication. The genus of goby fish, &quot;Elacatinus&quot; also demonstrate cooperation by removing and feeding on ectoparasites of their clients. The species of wasp &quot;Polybia rejecta&quot; and ants &quot;Azteca chartifex&quot; show a cooperative behavior protecting one another&#x27;s nests from predators.

Market economics often govern the details of the cooperation: e.g. the amount exchanged between individual animals follow the rules of supply and demand.

===Spite===
Hamilton&#x27;s rule can also predict spiteful behaviors between non-relatives. A spiteful behavior is one that is harmful to both the actor and to the recipient. Spiteful behavior is favored if the actor is less related to the recipient than to the average member of the population making r negative and if rB-C is still greater than zero. Spite can also be thought of as a type of altruism because harming a non-relative, by taking his resources for example, could also benefit a relative, by allowing him access to those resources. Furthermore, certain spiteful behaviors may provide harmful short term consequences to the actor but also give long term reproductive benefits. Many behaviors that are commonly thought of as spiteful are actually better explained as being selfish, that is benefiting the actor and harming the recipient, and true spiteful behaviors are rare in the animal kingdom.

An example of spite is the sterile soldiers of the polyembryonic parasitoid wasp. A female wasp lays a male and a female egg in a caterpillar. The eggs divide asexually, creating many genetically identical male and female larvae. Sterile soldier wasps also develop and attack the relatively unrelated brother larvae so that the genetically identical sisters have more access to food.

Another example is bacteria that release bacteriocins. The bacteria that releases the bacteriocin may have to die to do so, but most of the harm is to unrelated individuals who are killed by the bacteriocin. This is because the ability to produce and release the bacteriocin is linked to an immunity to it. Therefore, close relatives to the releasing cell are less likely to die than non-relatives.

==Altruism and conflict in social insects==

Many insect species of the order Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps) are eusocial. Within the nests or hives of social insects, individuals engage in specialized tasks to ensure the survival of the colony. Dramatic examples of these specializations include changes in body morphology or unique behaviors, such as the engorged bodies of the honeypot ant &quot;Myrmecocystus mexicanus&quot; or the waggle dance of honey bees and a wasp species, &quot;Vespula vulgaris&quot;.

In many, but not all social insects, reproduction is monopolized by the queen of the colony. Due to the effects of a haplodiploid mating system, in which unfertilized eggs become male drones and fertilized eggs become worker females, average relatedness values between sister workers can be higher than those seen in humans or other eutherian mammals. This has led to the suggestion that kin selection may be a driving force in the evolution of eusociality, as individuals could provide cooperative care that establishes a favorable benefit to cost ratio (rB-c &gt; 0). However, not all social insects follow this rule. In the social wasp &quot;Polistes dominula&quot;, 35% of the nest mates are unrelated. In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some vertebrate systems. It is thought that this unrelated assistance is evidence of altruism in &quot;P. dominula&quot;.
Cooperation in social organisms has numerous ecological factors that can determine the benefits and costs associated with this form of organization. One suggested benefit is a type of &quot;life insurance&quot; for individuals who participate in the care of the young. In this instance, individuals may have a greater likelihood of transmitting genes to the next generation when helping in a group compared to individual reproduction. Another suggested benefit is the possibility of &quot;fortress defense&quot;, where soldier castes threaten or attack intruders, thus protecting related individuals inside the territory. Such behaviors are seen in the snapping shrimp &quot;Synalpheus regalis&quot;, a gall-forming aphid &quot;Pemphigus spyrothecae&quot;., and naked mole-rats. A third ecological factor that is posited to promote eusociality is the distribution of resources: when food is sparse and concentrated in patches, eusociality is favored. Evidence supporting this third factor comes from studies of naked mole-rats and Damaraland mole-rats, which have communities containing a single pair of reproductive individuals.

===Conflicts in social insects===
Although eusociality has been shown to offer many benefits to the colony, there is also potential for conflict. Examples include the sex-ratio conflict and worker policing seen in certain species of social Hymenoptera such as &quot;Dolichovespula media&quot;, &quot;Dolichovespula sylvestris,&quot; &quot;Dolichovespula norwegica&quot; and &quot;Vespula vulgaris.&quot; The queen and the worker wasps either indirectly kill the laying-workers&#x27; offspring by neglecting them or directly condemn them by cannibalizing and scavenging.

The sex-ratio conflict arises from a relatedness asymmetry, which is caused by the haplodiploidy nature of Hymenoptera. For instance, workers are most related to each other because they share half of the genes from the queen and inherit all of the father&#x27;s genes. Their total relatedness to each other would be 0.5+ (0.5 x 0.5) = 0.75. Thus, sisters are three-fourths related to each other. On the other hand, males arise from unfertilized larva, meaning they only inherit half of the queen&#x27;s genes and none from the father. As a result, a female is related to her brother by 0.25, because 50% of her genes that come from her father have no chance of being shared with a brother. Her relatedness to her brother would therefore be 0.5 x 0.5=0.25.

According to Trivers and Hare&#x27;s population-level sex-investment ratio theory, the ratio of relatedness between sexes determines the sex investment ratios. As a result, it has been observed that there is a tug-of-war between the queen and the workers, where the queen would prefer a 1:1 female to male ratio because she is equally related to her sons and daughters (r=0.5 in each case). However, the workers would prefer a 3:1 female to male ratio because they are 0.75 related to each other and only 0.25 related to their brothers. Allozyme data of a colony may indicate who wins this conflict.

Conflict can also arise between workers in colonies of social insects. In some species, worker females retain their ability to mate and lay eggs. The colony&#x27;s queen is related to her sons by half of her genes and a quarter to the sons of her worker daughters. Workers, however, are related to their sons by half of their genes and to their brothers by a quarter. Thus, the queen and her worker daughters would compete for reproduction to maximize their own reproductive fitness. Worker reproduction is limited by other workers who are more related to the queen than their sisters, a situation occurring in many polyandrous hymenopteran species. Workers police the egg-laying females by engaging in oophagy or directed acts of aggression.

===The monogamy hypothesis===
The monogamy hypothesis states that the presence of monogamy in insects is crucial for eusociality to occur. This is thought to be true because of Hamilton&#x27;s rule that states that rB-C&gt;0. By having a monogamous mating system, all of the offspring have high relatedness to each other. This means that it is equally beneficial to help out a sibling, as it is to help out an offspring. If there were many fathers the relatedness of the colony would be lowered.

This monogamous mating system has been observed in insects such as termites, ants, bees and wasps. In termites the queen commits to a single male when founding a nest. In ants, bees and wasps the queens have a functional equivalent to lifetime monogamy. The male can even die before the founding of the colony. The queen can store and use the sperm from a single male throughout their lifetime, sometimes up to 30 years.

In an experiment looking at the mating of 267 hymenopteran species, the results were mapped onto a phylogeny. It was found that monogamy was the ancestral state in all the independent transitions to eusociality. This indicates that monogamy is the ancestral, likely to be crucial state for the development of eusociality. In species where queens mated with multiple mates, it was found that these were developed from lineages where sterile castes already evolved, so the multiple mating was secondary. In these cases, multiple mating is likely to be advantageous for reasons other than those important at the origin of eusociality. Most likely reasons are that a diverse worker pool attained by multiple mating by the queen increases disease resistance and may facilitate a division of labor among workers

==Communication and signaling==
Communication is varied at all scales of life, from interactions between microscopic organisms to those of large groups of people. Nevertheless, the signals used in communication abide by a fundamental property: they must be a quality of the receiver that can transfer information to a receiver that is capable of interpreting the signal and modifying its behavior accordingly. Signals are distinct from cues in that evolution has selected for signalling between both parties, whereas cues are merely informative to the observer and may not have originally been used for the intended purpose. The natural world is replete with examples of signals, from the luminescent flashes of light from fireflies, to chemical signaling in red harvester ants to prominent mating displays of birds such as the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, which gather in leks, the pheromones released by the corn earworm moth, the dancing patterns of the blue-footed booby, or the alarm sound &quot;Synoeca cyanea&quot; make by rubbing their mandibles against their nest. Yet other examples are the cases of the grizzled skipper and &quot;Spodoptera littoralis&quot; where pheromones are released as a sexual recognition mechanism that drives evolution. In a type of mating signal, male orb-weaving spiders of the species &quot;Zygiella x-notata&quot; pluck the signal thread of a female&#x27;s web with their forelegs. This performance conveys vibratory signals informing the female spider of the male&#x27;s presence.

The nature of communication poses evolutionary concerns, such as the potential for deceit or manipulation on the part of the sender. In this situation, the receiver must be able to anticipate the interests of the sender and act appropriately to a given signal. Should any side gain advantage in the short term, evolution would select against the signal or the response. The conflict of interests between the sender and the receiver results in an evolutionarily stable state only if both sides can derive an overall benefit.

Although the potential benefits of deceit could be great in terms of mating success, there are several possibilities for how dishonesty is controlled, which include indices, handicaps, and common interests. Indices are reliable indicators of a desirable quality, such as overall health, fertility, or fighting ability of the organism. Handicaps, as the term suggests, place a restrictive cost on the organisms that own them, and thus lower quality competitors experience a greater relative cost compared to their higher quality counterparts. In the common interest situation, it is beneficial to both sender and receiver to communicate honestly such that the benefit of the interaction is maximized.

Signals are often honest, but there are exceptions. Prime examples of dishonest signals include the luminescent lure of the anglerfish, which is used to attract prey, or the mimicry of non-poisonous butterfly species, like the Batesian mimic &quot;Papilio polyxenes&quot; of the poisonous model &quot;Battus philenor&quot;. Although evolution should normally favor selection against the dishonest signal, in these cases it appears that the receiver would benefit more on average by accepting the signal.

<doc id="292266" wikidata="Q1660170" url="?curid=292266" title="Edwina Currie">
<text>Edwina Currie (; born 13 October 1946) is a British writer, broadcaster and former politician, serving as Conservative Party Member of Parliament for South Derbyshire from 1983 until 1997. She was a Junior Health Minister for two years, resigning in 1988 during the salmonella-in-eggs controversy.

By the time Currie lost her seat as an MP in 1997, she had begun a new career as a novelist and broadcaster. She is the author of six novels, and has also written four works of non-fiction. In September 2002, the publication of Currie&#x27;s &quot;Diaries (1987–92)&quot; caused a sensation, as they revealed a four-year affair with colleague (and later Prime Minister) John Major between 1984 and 1988. Currie&#x27;s record as Junior Health Minister was heavily scrutinised in the 2010s, and to a lesser extent at the time, for her decision to hire Jimmy Savile as chairman of Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital, where it is now known he molested and raped mentally unstable patients. Currie previously expressed her &quot;full confidence&quot; in him.

Currie remains an outspoken public figure, with a reputation for being &quot;highly opinionated,&quot; and currently earns her living as an author and media personality.

==Early life==
Currie was born in south Liverpool to an Orthodox Jewish family, who &quot;disowned her when she married a non-Jewish accountant&quot;. She herself is not particularly religious, stating in a February 2000 interview that she found &quot;religious mumbo jumbo hard to swallow in any faith&quot;. She went to the Liverpool Institute High School for Girls in Blackburne House, in the Canning area of Liverpool, where she was Deputy Head Girl.

Currie studied philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she was taught by Gabriele Taylor. Subsequently, she gained an MA in economic history from the London School of Economics.

==Political career==
From 1975 until 1986, she was a Birmingham City Councillor for Northfield. In 1983, she stood for parliament as a Conservative Party candidate, and was elected as the member for South Derbyshire. Frequently outspoken, she was described as &quot;a virtually permanent fixture on the nation&#x27;s TV screen saying something outrageous about just about anything&quot; and &quot;the most outspoken and sexually interested woman of her political generation.&quot;

In September 1986, she became a Junior Health Minister. Among her comments over the next two years were that &quot;Good Christian people who would not dream of misbehaving will not catch AIDS&quot;, that elderly people should wrap up warm in winter and that northerners die of &quot;ignorance and chips&quot;.

In 1988, she appointed Jimmy Savile to head up a task force to run the Broadmoor psychiatric hospital. Savile was given extraordinary power and a set of keys with complete access to every part of the hospital. He mingled repeatedly with the 800 or so patients, many teenage girls, some severely disturbed and medicated. In 2012, after Savile&#x27;s death, a police investigation concluded that he had possibly been one of Britain&#x27;s most prolific sex offenders.

===Salmonella-in-eggs controversy===
Currie was forced to resign as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health in December 1988, after she issued a warning about salmonella in British eggs. The statement that &quot;most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now affected with salmonella&quot; sparked outrage among farmers and egg producers, and caused egg sales in the country to decline rapidly, by 60 percent. The controversy gained her the nickname &quot;Eggwina&quot;.

The loss of revenue led to the slaughter of four million hens. Although the statement was widely interpreted as referring to &quot;most eggs produced&quot;, in fact it related to the egg production &quot;flock&quot;; there was indeed evidence that a mid-1980s regulation change had allowed salmonella to get a hold in flocks.

Long after the furore died down, in 2001, it was revealed that a covered-up Whitehall report produced months after Currie&#x27;s resignation found that there had been a &quot;salmonella epidemic of considerable proportions&quot;.

===Post-ministerial career as an MP===
In 1991, Currie became the first Conservative MP to appear on the BBC topical panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. She appeared again two years later, in a special episode commemorating the release of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s memoirs, opposite fellow Liverpudlian (and Liverpool Institute alumnus) Derek Hatton.

During the 1992 general election campaign, Currie poured a glass of orange juice over Labour&#x27;s Peter Snape shortly after an edition of the Midlands-based television debate show &quot;Central Weekend&quot; had finished airing. Speaking about the incident later, Currie said: &quot;I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought &#x27;I know how to shut you up.&#x27;&quot;

After the 1992 general election, she declined a request from Prime Minister John Major to take up a position as Minister of State for the Home Office.

In February 1994 Currie, a member of the Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality (TORCHE), tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill to lower the age of consent for male homosexual sexual acts from 21 to 16, which would mean an equal age of consent with opposite-sex couples if it passed. This amendment was defeated by 307 votes to 280, although a subsequent amendment resulted in the reduction of the age of consent for male homosexual acts from 21 to 18; final equalisation with an age of consent at 16 was voted through parliament in late 2000, becoming law in January 2001. In a speech in the House of Commons Currie said, &quot;it is time to seize our homophobic instincts and chuck them on the scrapheap of history, where they belong&quot;. 

In February 1994, Currie voted against the death penalty for murder, having previously voted and spoken in favour of it in July 1983; she had also supported it in June 1988 and December 1990.

In June 1994, she contested the European Parliament seat of Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes, but lost the seat to Labour&#x27;s Eryl McNally by 94,837 votes to 61,628 votes. Currie was MP for South Derbyshire for 14 years; however, along with many other Conservative MPs, she lost her parliamentary seat in the 1997 general election.

=== After Parliament ===

Currie attempted to be selected as a Conservative candidate for the European Parliament election of 1999, but was unsuccessful.

After nearly a quarter of a century away from politics, it was announced in February 2021 that Currie would contest her home ward of Whaley Bridge on Derbyshire County Council at that year&#x27;s local elections. She was challenging the incumbent, Ruth George of the Labour Party. The race was notable for pitting two former MPs against one another in an election for a council seat. On 7 May, it was announced that Currie had failed in her bid to win the marginal seat, receiving 1,878 votes to George&#x27;s 2,544.

In October 2022, Currie described the prime minister, Liz Truss, as &quot;charmless, graceless, brainless, and useless&quot;.

==Other work==

===Novels===
Currie has written six novels: &quot;A Parliamentary Affair&quot; (1994), &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Place&quot; (1996), &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; (1997), &quot;The Ambassador&quot; (1999), &quot;Chasing Men&quot; (2000) and &quot;This Honourable House&quot; (2001). She has also written four works of non-fiction: &quot;Life Lines&quot; (1989), &quot;What Women Want&quot; (1990), &quot;Three Line Quips&quot; (1992) and &quot;Diaries 1987–92&quot; (2002).

===Media===
From the time she lost her seat in 1997, Currie has maintained a presence in the media. From 1998 to 2003, she hosted a late evening talk show on BBC Radio 5 Live, &quot;Late Night Currie&quot;. In 2002, she moved to HTV, presenting the television programme &quot;Currie Night&quot; until 2003. Since then, she has appeared in a string of reality television programmes, such as &quot;Wife Swap&quot; in which she and her second husband John swapped places with John McCririck and his wife, Jenny. Currie appeared on a charity edition of the television quiz show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; on 17 September 2005, partnering Conservative speech-writer and lobbyist Derek Laud. She has also appeared in the reality cooking show &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay in 2004, and &quot;Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes&quot; in 2006.

Currie was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot; She was the first woman to win &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; on 23 June 2004, specialising in the life of Marie Curie. She also won &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot; on 3 January 2009. She appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; in February 2009 where she finished third. She made a second appearance on the show during Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Election Night&quot; coverage, with Rod Liddle, Brian Paddick and Derek Hatton as her competitors. She also appeared in James May&#x27;s Show &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot; where she helped him build a bridge made entirely out of Meccano in Liverpool.

In September 2011, Currie took part in the ninth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. She was paired with professional dancer Vincent Simone. On 9 October, she and Simone were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition.

In November 2014, Currie took part in the fourteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; entering the jungle on Day 5 of the competition, and finishing in fourth place.
In 2020, she trekked the Sultans Trail for BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage: Road to Istanbul&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 1 July 1972, Edwina married accountant Ray Currie in Barnstaple, Devon. They had two children, Debbie and Susie. Currie and her husband separated in 1997, but did not finalise their divorce until 2001. During that marriage, between 1984 and 1988, Currie had a four-year affair with John Major, later Prime Minister, which she revealed in September 2002. Edwina and Ray were the subject of an edition of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Other Half&quot; documentary series, broadcast in December 1984.

While she was MP for South Derbyshire, Currie lived in the house-converted windmill in Findern, built in 1715 and the oldest surviving windmill structure in the East Midlands.

On 24 May 2001, in Southwark, Currie married retired detective John Jones, whom she had met when he was a guest on her radio programme in 1999. Jones died on 1 November 2020. 

Currie lives in Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire.

===Affair with John Major===
Currie&#x27;s &quot;Diaries (1987–92)&quot;, published in 2002, caused a sensation, as they revealed a four-year affair with John Major between 1984 and 1988, while both were married to other people. The affair started while she was a backbencher and Major was the government whip in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government. After Major&#x27;s promotion to Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the relationship ended, but the two remained friends. Currie apparently ceased the affair when it became dangerous and impractical owing to the presence of bodyguards who had to be avoided.

After publication, Major made a statement saying that he was ashamed of the affair and had privately revealed the matter to his wife. Currie said she had been in love with him for years after the end of the affair, and that he had been &quot;the love of her life&quot;. However, only weeks after revealing the affair, she publicly criticised Major, accusing him of sidelining female and black politicians and of being &quot;one of the less competent prime ministers&quot;.

The admission came after years of denial of any affair while in office and a successful libel action against playwright David Hare, who had said a sexually voracious murderer played by Charlotte Rampling in his film &quot;Paris by Night&quot; (1988) was an &quot;Edwina Currie-like&quot; figure. Currie had also produced several novels with explicitly erotic content – and political background – such as &quot;A Parliamentary Affair&quot;. Following publication of her diaries, Express Newspapers lawyers re-examined documents in a libel case to see if there was anything in the diaries which would allow them to reopen the case and recoup damages. In March 2000, Currie had been awarded £30,000 against them following a 1997 article entitled &quot;How Edwina is now the vilest lady in Britain.&quot;

===Charity and other interests===
In September 2004, Currie took part in a sponsored cycle ride across Poland, near to the area where ancestors of hers lived, for Marie Curie Cancer Care.

In June 2005, in her role as a patron of the British Heart Foundation, Currie championed a campaign to raise awareness of the effect of heart disease on women. In May 2007, the patient charity MRSA Action UK announced Currie as their patron.
Edwina Currie was quoted by the media championing the campaign against hospital superbugs.

In October 2011, Currie took part in EuroVoice, an event supported by the European Youth Parliament. In November 2011, Currie accepted the position of President of the Tideswell Male Voice Choir.

In February 2013, Currie participated in an Oxford Union debate, saying she opposed feminism.

==Discography==
As part of the 2009 TV Show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, Currie teamed up with Declan Donnelly and two other celebrities to release a cover version of the Wham! hit song &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go Go&quot;. Her daughter, Debbie, had previously released a single.
