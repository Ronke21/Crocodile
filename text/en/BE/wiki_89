<text>Stiff Little Fingers are a Northern Irish punk rock band from Belfast. They formed in 1977 at the height of the Troubles, which informed much of their songwriting. They started out as a schoolboy band called Highway Star (named after the Deep Purple song), doing rock covers, until they discovered punk. They were the first punk band in Belfast to release a record – the &quot;Suspect Device&quot; single came out on their own independent label, Rigid Digits. Their album &quot;Inflammable Material&quot;, released in partnership with Rough Trade, became the first independent LP to enter the UK top 20.

After six years and four albums, they split up. They re-formed five years later, in 1987. Despite major personnel changes, they are still touring and recording. In 2014, the band released their tenth studio album and a world tour followed its release. Jake Burns, the lead singer, is the only member to have been with the band during all its incarnations, but in March 2006, original bass guitarist Ali McMordie rejoined them following the departure of bass player Bruce Foxton after fifteen years.

==History==
===Early years===
Prior to becoming Stiff Little Fingers, Jake Burns, vocals and guitar, Henry Cluney, guitar, Gordon Blair, bass, and Brian Faloon, drums, were playing in a rock music cover band, Highway Star, in Belfast. Upon the departure of Blair (who went on to play with another Belfast group, Rudi), Ali McMordie took over on bass. Cluney had by this time discovered punk, and introduced the rest of the band to it. They decided that Highway Star was not a punk enough name, and after a brief flirtation with the name &quot;The Fast&quot;, decided to call themselves Stiff Little Fingers, after The Vibrators&#x27; song, which appears on the album &quot;Pure Mania&quot;.

Stiff Little Fingers, especially the frontman and main songwriter Jake Burns, were heavily influenced by The Clash and Elvis Costello. According to Burns, &quot;what [&quot;The Clash&quot;] did more than anything else was give me the confidence, through its lyrical subject matter, to realise it was OK to write about my own life and experiences.&quot; The group started to write songs about growing up in the Troubles in late 1970s Northern Ireland. Among the first Stiff Little Fingers songs were &quot;State of Emergency&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot;.

It was while doing a gig at the Glenmachan Hotel, Belfast, that they first met Gordon Ogilvie, who had been invited along for the evening by Colin McClelland, a journalist whom Burns had been corresponding with.

==== &quot;Suspect Device&quot; ====
Ogilvie further encouraged SLF to play material based upon their experience of the Troubles. He asked the group to look at some lyrics he had drafted. They liked the lyrics and &quot;Suspect Device&quot; became a fixture in their live set. Around the same time as putting a tune to the &quot;Suspect Device&quot; lyrics, Burns wrote &quot;Wasted Life&quot;.

McClelland arranged to get the band some recording time at a local radio station, and in the studio normally used to recording jingles, they recorded &quot;Suspect Device&quot;. The single was packaged in the form of a cassette, with a cover depicting a cassette incendiary bomb, apparently causing great hilarity in the group, when one record company phoned them and asked for another copy, as they had thrown the first one in a bucket of water for fear that it was a real bomb.

&quot;Suspect Device&quot; was released in February 1978. A copy of the single was sent to John Peel. He played it repeatedly leading to a distribution deal through Rough Trade Records. The single was released on the band&#x27;s own Rigid Digits label, re-released a month later with the support of Rough Trade and sold over 30,000 copies.

Live footage of SLF performing &quot;Suspect Device&quot; at Belfast&#x27;s Pound Club on 17 January 1978 – the first time the group played the song live – appeared as part of an Ulster TV Revue programme &quot;&#x27;It Makes You Want to Spit&quot;&#x27; about punk in Belfast.  The programme was broadcast on 6 March 1978.

SLF&#x27;s decision to write songs about the experiences of young people growing up in The Troubles proved controversial. Some Northern Ireland punk bands felt songs about the Troubles were exploiting the sectarian conflict. There was also criticism and suspicion over the involvement and influence the management team, especially Gordon Ogilivie, was having on the band. The political differences were reinforced by musical differences as SLF&#x27;s rockier punk sound contrasted with the more melodic pop punk of The Undertones and Rudi. Some of the criticism was simply down to band rivalries and jealousy.

There were a number of well-publicised arguments; The Undertones accused Stiff Little Fingers of sensationalising the Northern Ireland conflict, while they retorted that The Undertones ignored it. Michael Bradley, The Undertones bassist, tells of a confrontation in 1979 between The Undertones’ John O’Neill and SLF&#x27;s Jake Burns: &quot;He launched into Jake, not physically but verbally. Slagging his records, slagging the journalist writing the songs and slagging the band.&quot; Michael Bradley now describes ‘Suspect Device’ as &quot;a great record, although at the time we weren&#x27;t impressed, probably because they&#x27;d made a record before us&quot;.

Terri Hooley, of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Good Vibrations records, also says that &quot;SLF were really starting to make waves beyond Northern Ireland, and I always see them as the ones that got away. I know I have always said I never rated them, but that was probably jealousy on my part. I actually think they are a great band and deserve their success&quot;.

SLF built up a big following among young people in Belfast: &quot;As a 14 or 15-year-old schoolboy back in the late Seventies, I wasn&#x27;t at all concerned with who had written (or contributed to) the lyrics of their songs. To me, it was crystal clear that the band meant what they were singing and even better, they were singing about my life and offering me alternative points of view. Their initial burst of raw energy on the Ulster Punk scene was captivating and as soon as they transferred that energy to vinyl they were truly off and running.&quot; (Sean O’Neill, co-author of &quot;It Makes You Want To Spit - The Definitive Guide to Punk in N.Ireland&quot;) 

==== &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot; ====
John Peel arranged for the group to record a session for his Radio One show. The songs broadcast on 13 April 1978 were &quot;Wasted Life&quot;, &quot;Johnny Was&quot;, &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot; and &quot;State of Emergency&quot;.  Another John Peel session was recorded in September – &quot;Law And Order&quot;, &quot;Barbed Wire Love&quot;, &quot;Suspect Device&quot; and a new longer version of &quot;Johnny Was&quot; were broadcast on 18 September 1978.

In the second half of 1978, SLF toured as the support band to the Tom Robinson Band.

Their second single, &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot;, was released on Rough Trade in October 1978. It was originally intended to be given away free with the fanzine of the same name. SLF performing &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot; at a gig in Belfast at the end of October 1978 can be seen in &quot;Shellshock Rock&quot;, an independent documentary on punk in Northern Ireland, released in 1979.

By the end of 1978, SLF&#x27;s growing popularity was reflected in &quot;Suspect Device&quot; reaching No. 4 and &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot; being voted No. 11 in the annual Festive Fifty broadcast on the John Peel show.

====&quot;Inflammable Material&quot;====
In February 1979, SLF released their first album on the Rough Trade label, &quot;Inflammable Material&quot;. The band had signed a contract with Island Records, but it fell through, leaving the group to release the album on Rough Trade, their existing label. Despite the album&#x27;s independent release, it reached number 14 in the UK Albums Chart and reached Silver status, selling over 100,000 copies. &quot;Inflammable Material&quot; was the first album distributed by Rough Trade, and the first independent album to chart in the UK.

The Inflammable Material album was heavily influenced by the band&#x27;s experience of growing up in Belfast during the Troubles. However, of the 13 tracks, only 6 were directly about Northern Ireland and the political situation - &quot;Suspect Device&quot;, &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, &quot;Wasted Life&quot;, &quot;No More Of That&quot;, &quot;Barbed Wire Love&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot;. Even &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot;, which has references to &quot;You got the Army on the street, and the RUC dog of repression is barking at your feet&quot;, is mainly about being a bored teenager in the late 1970s. Another track on the album &quot;Johnny Was&quot; is a cover of a Bob Marley and the Wailers song with the words adapted to place the song in Belfast.

&quot;Everybody refers to it as &quot;the Irish record&quot; but I always say to go and look at the tracks and there&#x27;s probably 4 out of 13 that refer specifically to Northern Ireland. The rest of it is ... just disaffected teenagers kicking against the world&quot;. (Jake Burns, SLF)

The album received critical acclaim in the music press. Paul Morley, in a contemporary review for NME, stated that &quot;Inflammable Material is the classic punk rock record. A crushing contemporary commentary, brutally inspired by blatant bitter rebellion and frustration&quot;. Morley would go on to state that &quot;Stiff Little Fingers are the best rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band in my world... By the end of 1978 [they] were the most popular new group in Britain.&quot;

==== &quot;Gotta Gettaway&quot; ====
The new interest in the band inspired their move to London, which led to the departure of Brian Faloon and Colin McClelland (who along with Gordon Ogilvie had been joint manager of the band up until that point). Jim Reilly became their drummer in time for the &quot;Gotta Gettaway&quot; single, and played in the Rock Against Racism tour.

To coincide with the release of &quot;Gotta Gettaway&quot;, SLF headlined their first tour with 21 dates across Britain and Ireland.  The highlight of the tour was the gig at Belfast&#x27;s Ulster Hall on 21 May 1979. For anyone doubting SLF&#x27;s popularity in Northern Ireland, this was the first time a local punk band had headlined what was at the time the biggest music venue in Belfast. The group were welcomed home with a sell-out crowd.

&quot;Of all the shows, one of the best, without doubt, was the first time we headlined Belfast&#x27;s Ulster Hall, on the ‘Gotta Gettaway’ tour. At the height of the Troubles we packed the place and then some, and staring out at that seething mass of young people just enjoying themselves and having a great time to the music, was something that has remained a treasured memory for me all these years. That night I realised we were doing something that none of the politicians were able to do. In that hall, in the midst of a city gripped by sectarian violence, killing and hatred, we brought together the people of our hometown, regardless of religion&quot;. (Jim Reilly, Stiff Little Fingers drummer) 

====&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Heroes&quot; and &quot;Go for It&quot;====
In mid-1979, Stiff Little Fingers signed their Rigid Digits label to Chrysalis Records, and in 1980 released their second album, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

The &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Heroes&quot; era brought some success in media terms, with the single &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; narrowly missing the cut for &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;; they eventually got on the show twice, with &quot;At the Edge&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Hero&quot;. However, after their appearance with &quot;At The Edge&quot; the band were told they would never be invited on again as they did not take it seriously as they were not playing live; it was to be one of the most infamous &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;″&#x27;s performances. They subsequently appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Hero&quot;, &quot;Just Fade Away&quot; and &quot;Listen&quot;.

In 1981 the band released their third studio album &quot;Go for It&quot; which was to be Jim Reilly&#x27;s last involvement with the band. &quot;Go for It&quot; signified the change in Burns&#x27; writing style, with much darker and taboo subjects, such as domestic abuse in the song &quot;Hits and Misses&quot; and football hooliganism in the song &quot;Back to Front&quot; (not on the original LP but a bonus track on CD reissue) but the band also still told the story of being a teenager growing up with the song &quot;Kicking Up a Racket&quot;.

===Breakup===
====&quot;Now Then...&quot;====
In 1982 came a 4-song EP called &quot;£1.10 or Less&quot; and their fourth studio album, &quot;Now Then...&quot; (actually their fifth album, as they had released a live LP, &quot;Hanx&quot;, as their official third album between &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Heroes&quot; and &quot;Go for It&quot;). &quot;Now Then&quot; was the first album for former Tom Robinson band&#x27;s drummer Dolphin Taylor. In the face of low sales and concert attendances, they broke up in 1983, when Burns said: &quot;Our last LP &quot;Now Then&quot; was to my mind the best album we have made. But it is also unfortunately the best I think we will ever make. So I have decided to call it a day&quot;. The band later revealed the original split had been somewhat acrimonious, with band members apparently having fistfights rather than talking through their differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLF.com/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
After Burns had moved on from Stiff Little Fingers, he had a short stint at a band with former The Jam bassist Bruce Foxton. They made a couple of demos, but Foxton received an invitation to make a solo album which ended their collaboration.

In 1987 the band reformed. Despite some critics who had said &quot;Nobody would be interested in coming to see you&quot; the band had a successful tour including Germany with shows selling out night after night. The band changed their plan of it just being a temporary re-union and decided it was to be permanent.

====&quot;Flags and Emblems&quot;====
Ali McMordie decided he could not commit the time to tour full-time or record and so left, being replaced by Bruce Foxton in time to record 1991&#x27;s &quot;Flags and Emblems&quot;. In Britain, the single from this album, &quot;Beirut Moon&quot;, was withdrawn from sale on the first day of release, allegedly because it criticised the government for not acting to free hostage John McCarthy, who had been held in Lebanon.

In 1993, Henry Cluney was asked to leave the band, and the trio of Jake Burns, Bruce Foxton and Dolphin Taylor continued for the next four years, joined on live shows by either Dave Sharp or Ian McCallum.

====&quot;Get a Life&quot;====
In 1994, they released &quot;Get a Life&quot; in the UK, releasing it in the US in 1996. By the end of 1996 Taylor left due to family commitments. Burns called in Steve Grantley who had played drums for Jake Burns and the Big Wheel in the late 1980s.

====&quot;Tinderbox&quot; and &quot;Guitar and Drum&quot;====
The trio of Burns, Foxton and Grantley recorded 1997&#x27;s &quot;Tinderbox&quot; album, with help from Ian McCallum who joined as a full-time member for 1999&#x27;s &quot;Hope Street&quot;. This same line-up recorded 2003&#x27;s &quot;Guitar and Drum&quot;.

===Lineup change===
On 18 January 2006, Foxton left the band.

On 23 January 2006, it was announced that original bass guitarist Ali McMordie was to rejoin the band for the duration of their upcoming March tour. The tour was a success, with many fans writing into SLF&#x27;s message board saying how much they enjoyed it, and how fired up the band seemed to be. After much discussion regarding the status of McMordie within the band after the tour, on 21 April 2006, Burns posted on the message board &quot;For the time being Mr. McMordie is happy to continue as long as his busy schedule allows. It may be that occasionally we have to bring on a &quot;substitute&quot;, if he is up to his eyes and we need to do something, but hopefully we can avoid that.&quot; Mr. McMordie has occasionally been unable to tour due to other commitments and on those occasions, his place has been taken by Mark DeRosa of Chicago band, Dummy.

On 25 May 2006, SLF announced Ian McCallum would not be able to join the band on its Spring US tour due to health reasons. John Haggerty of Pegboy and Naked Raygun fame would fill in on guitar. McCallum has since rejoined the band and has toured with them ever since.

====&quot;No Going Back&quot;====
On 9 March 2007, Burns announced that Stiff Little Fingers would record a new album, to be released later that year. A new song, &quot;Liars Club&quot;, was added to their set lists that year. The track was named after a bar Burns drove past while listening to a press report about Tony Blair, George W. Bush and the Iraq War. At the Glasgow Barrowlands gig on 17 March 2011 Burns announced that the new album was being recorded – hopefully for a 2011 release – before launching into a new song, &quot;Full Steam Backwards&quot;, about the banking crisis in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;glasswerk.co.uk/reviews/national/9652/Stiff+Little+Fingers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On 16 October 2013, the band launched a project on Pledgemusic to raise funds for the album to be released in March 2014. The project reached its funding goal within 5 hours. Recording was completed in January 2014 and the album, titled &quot;No Going Back&quot; was released through PledgeMusic on 15 March 2014 and to the general public on 11 August 2014. A tour in support of the album kicked off in early 2014 and included dates in the US on the Summer Nationals tour with The Offspring, Bad Religion, The Vandals, Pennywise and Naked Raygun. The album was the band&#x27;s first UK chart success since 1983&#x27;s &quot;All The Best&quot; and their first number 1 record on the BBC Rock Album Chart.

<text>The National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) is an American non-profit organization for those involved in the hobby or business of model railroading. It was founded in the United States in 1935, and is also active in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. It was previously headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and was based in Chattanooga, Tennessee next to the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum (TVRM) from 1982 to 2013 and has since relocated to Soddy Daisy.

==General==
The classifications listed below are from the A.A.R. Individual roads may use other designations. Illustrations show a typical member of the class detailed underneath the following a class description indicates a rare or obsolete type.

==Industry involvement==
The best-known activity of the NMRA is the defining of standards, and advisory documents known as Recommended Practices (RP), for model railroad equipment in North America. Many standards defined by the NMRA are widely followed by the industry and modellers, including their H0 scale track and wheel standards (S-3, S-4) and related RPs (RP2, 8, 10-15, and 25) and their Digital Command Control (DCC) standard set (S-9.1, S-9.2, and RP9.1.1 through RP9.3.2).

The RP25 wheel design in particular has been critical in ensuring the reliability and interoperability of US-prototype model railroad equipment, since practically every manufacturer of such equipment uses wheels conforming to the RP. This is in marked contrast to the British market, in which there is no accepted standard among manufacturers. 

In Europe, the &quot;Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen&quot; (NEM) has the same role, and although there is fairly close cooperation between the two organisations the standards differ in some aspects. At times this results in some models not working as intended on layouts that mix European and American rolling stock and trackwork.

==Education and acknowledgement==
The NMRA considers the education of model railroaders and the encouraging of learning and improving modelers&#x27; skills to be part of its mission. The NMRA runs an achievement program to encourage these skills, and runs modeling contests. Most notably these include the Master Model Railroader certification program and the Golden Spike award. Both programs involve the demonstration and/or judging of proficiency in one or more model railroading skill areas. These areas include Railroad Equipment, Railroad Setting, Railroad Construction &amp; Operation and also Service to the Hobby &amp; NMRA Member. A full explanation of each program along with applications can be found on the NMRA website.

==Community involvement==
Promotion of the model railroading hobby is also part of the NMRA&#x27;s purpose. Of note, the organization provides indirect assistance to the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Railroading Merit badge program by encouraging members (through a hierarchy of National and Regional volunteer Boy Scout Coordinators) to become Railroading Merit Badge Counselors.

==Archives==
The NMRA is home of the A.C. Kalmbach Memorial Library, which houses model and prototype railroad books, periodicals, photos, videos, and reference materials, and was designated as the official railroad library of the state of Tennessee in 2004. In 2013 the NMRA started the process of moving the library to the California State Railroad Museum. The library was adjacent to the Norfolk Southern Railway Georgia Division and the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum. It is named for Al C. Kalmbach, founder of Kalmbach Publishing, whose original magazines are &quot;Model Railroader&quot; and &quot;Trains.&quot;

<doc id="291677" wikidata="Q489981" url="?curid=291677" title="Andamooka, South Australia">
<text>Andamooka is a town approximately 600 km north of Adelaide in the Far North of South Australia on the lands of the Kokatha people. Andamooka is the largest town administered by the Outback Communities Authority instead of a local government area. It is in the state electoral district of Giles and the federal Division of Grey.

==History==
===Establishment of pastoral activity===
Andamooka lies on Kokatha traditional land. The name is derived from a salt lake, named from the Aboriginal &quot;Andemorka&quot;, by which the locality was known to Europeans as early as 1866, well before opal was discovered. The meaning is uncertain. At that time (1866) it was also known as &#x27;Swinden&#x27;s Country&#x27;, after Charles Swinden of Riverton, the leader of the small horseback party which discovered it in 1857. They described it as a tract of &#x27;generally sterile country, but having some patches of good pastoral land&#x27;. It was those meagre prospects which attracted pastoralists, resulting in the foundation of Andamooka Station, which for the next half century was the only industry. Since the granting of Native Title and pastoral leases in 2014, the Indigenous-owned Kokotha Pastoral Company now operates Andamooka Station, together with the adjacent Purple Downs and Roxby Downs Stations.

===Discovery of opal===
Opal was discovered there in 1930, and the town developed out of the scattered miners&#x27; camps which established in the area. An &quot;Andamooka Opal Fields&quot; Post Office was not opened until 13 January 1947, and was renamed &quot;Andamooka&quot; in 1990. The road into Andamooka was sealed in the 1990s, some remaining roads in the town are still unsealed.

===Heritage listed buildings===
A number of historic buildings in the town are heritage-listed: the Andamooka Historic Precinct (containing Frank Albertoni&#x27;s House, Bob Cutzow&#x27;s Dugout, Tom Brady&#x27;s Dugout, Mrs Perry&#x27;s Kitchen and Andy Absalom&#x27;s House) and Dick Clark&#x27;s Residence are both listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

==Opal Mining==

There are numerous opal fields in Andamooka district, one of the principal outliers being White Dam. The original pick and shovel shaft miners, many of whom were the bush characters and social outcasts who gave the settlement a &#x27;Wild West&#x27; reputation, were gradually displaced from the 1960s and 70s by the arrival of miners using bulldozers which made deep cuts to reach the respective opal levels, from where horizontal drives could easily be made to fully exploit the level. The several opal levels at Andamooka are not as deep as other fields such as Coober Pedy and Lightning Ridge. However, while the opal may be easier to reach, it is generally scarcer and poorer in quality. Those factors always made this gem field attractive to smaller prospectors with limited capital. Nevertheless, some remarkable gems have been mined, including the Andamooka Opal which was discovered in and named after Andamooka.

==Housing==
The earliest miners occupied rough dugouts driven into the side of a hill. The underground portions provided excellent insulation against the extremes of outside temperature. Being unsurveyed, occupancy was determined by tenuous Miners&#x27; Right. That situation deterred capital investment and so in the 1970s Andamooka was essentially a declining shanty town. Civic affairs, such as they were, were organised by a citizens&#x27; progress association. Their limited activities mainly related to electricity generation and supply, and maintaining the dirt airstrip in case the Flying Doctor was needed. All roads were unsealed tracks, while the main street was a dry rocky creek bed (unless there was a rare thunderstorm). There were few government agencies. Until a police station was opened in 1966, the police made routine weekly visits from Woomera, a mostly military town that supported the Woomera Test Range and Joint Defense Facility Nurrungar. Unless there was an emergency in between these visits, the isolated settlement was self-policing. An establishment named the Tucker Box, which was a licensed restaurant, was the social hub. The Andamooka Co-Op Ltd supplied groceries and fuel.

In the 1980s, with an influx of work through the advent and development of the nearby mine at Olympic Dam, more houses were built and transported in. Many of the town&#x27;s houses came from the demobilisation of Woomera. A transformation then took place. Not many people still live in the traditional dugout style houses of old, although remnants of the town&#x27;s past remain in the main street, with the cottages of old miners dug into the side of the hill in the main street still standing.

==Population==
In the , the town had a population of 262 people. There was a surplus of males (54.1%) over females (45.9%). Their median age was 57 years, nineteen years older than the national median of 38. Children under 15 made up 10.8% of the population, and people aged 65 years and over made up 31.3%. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.6% of the population. Most (75.2%) were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth were England 6.1%, Austria 1.5%, Germany 1.5%, Croatia 1.5% and Italy 1.1%. The most common religious affiliation was &quot;No Religion&quot; 52.3%, followed by Catholic 17.6%, and non-denominational Christian 4.6%.

Its main industry was mining. Since the establishment of the nearby Olympic Dam copper-uranium mine and the town of Roxby Downs in the 1980s, some residents of Andamooka are now employed in the mine or in Roxby Downs, and many others are retired.

Until recently, Andamooka townsfolk had to rely on water supplies trucked in from Roxby Downs, or above ground cisterns for the limited rainfall of the region. A pipeline to the township has since been built, although water still has to be trucked to the town&#x27;s water tanks.

==Pop culture==
The 1979 film &quot;The Last of the Knucklemen&quot; filmed its exterior shots in and around Andamooka. The &quot;Andamooka Opal&quot; was presented to Queen Elizabeth II on the occasion of her first visit to Australia in 1954. This opal, once cut, weighed in at .

Andamooka was also referenced in the Max Brooks novel, &quot;World War Z&quot;.

==Famous opals from Andamooka==

* The Andamooka Opal, presented to Queen Elizabeth II in 1954, also known as the Queen&#x27;s Opal.
* The Addyman Plesiosaur, &quot;the finest known opalised skeleton on Earth&quot;.

==Climate==
Annual rainfall is extremely low, even by Australian standards, with the average in the region just 160 mm per year. The climate is very arid, with daytime temperatures in summer regularly topping 40 °C (104 °F) and night temperatures in winter often dropping close to zero (32 °F).

<doc id="291680" wikidata="Q34001" url="?curid=291680" title="Roubaix">
<text>Roubaix ( , ; ; ; ) is a city in northern France, located in the Lille metropolitan area on the Belgian border. It is a historically mono-industrial commune in the Nord department, which grew rapidly in the 19th century from its textile industries, with most of the same characteristic features as those of English and American boom towns. This former new town has faced many challenges linked to deindustrialisation such as urban decay, with their related economic and social implications, since its major industries fell into decline by the middle of the 1970s. Located to the northeast of Lille, adjacent to Tourcoing, Roubaix is the of two cantons and the third largest city in the French region of Hauts-de-France ranked by population with nearly 99,000 inhabitants.

Together with the nearby cities of Lille, Tourcoing, Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq and eighty-six other communes, Roubaix gives structure to a four-centred metropolitan area inhabited by more than 1.1 million people: the European Metropolis of Lille. To a greater extent, Roubaix is in the center of a vast conurbation formed with the Belgian cities of Mouscron, Kortrijk and Tournai, which gave birth to the first European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation in January 2008, &quot;Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai&quot; with an aggregate population of over 2 million inhabitants.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Roubaix occupies a central position on the north-east slope of the Métropole Européenne de Lille: it is set on the eastern side of Lille and the southern side of Tourcoing, close to the Belgian border. As regards towns&#x27; boundaries, Roubaix is encompassed by seven cities which constitute its immediate neighbouring environment. These municipalities are namely: Tourcoing to the north and the northwest, Wattrelos to the northeast, Leers to the east, Lys-lez-Lannoy to the southeast, Hem to the south and Croix to the southwest and the west. Roubaix, alongside those municipalities and twenty-one other communes, belongs to the land of Ferrain, a little district of the former Castellany of Lille between the Lys and Scheldt rivers.

As the crow flies, the distance between Roubaix and the following cities is some odd: to Tournai, to Kortrijk, to Brussels and to Paris.

=== Geology ===
The land upon which Roubaix stands belongs to the plain of Flanders. The Roubaisian area stretches on an east-west oriented shallow syncline axis which trends south-southeast to the Paleozoic limestone of the Mélantois-Tournaisis faulted anticline. It consists predominantly of Holocene alluvial sediment depositions. It is flat and low, with an elevation drop of only over its . The lowest altitude of this area stands at , while its highest altitude is meters above the sea level.

=== Hydrology ===
The Trichon stream fed by waters of the Espierre stream used to flow through the rural landscape of Roubaix before the industrialisation process began to alter this area in the middle of the 19th century. From that century on, the ensuing industries, with their increasing needs for reliable supplies of goods and water, led to the building of an inland waterway connected upstream from the Deûle and downstream to the Marque and Espierre toward the Scheldt, which linked directly Roubaix to Lille.

Opened in 1877, the Canal de Roubaix crosses the town from its northern neighbourhoods to its eastern neighbourhoods and partially flows along the city&#x27;s boundaries. The Canal de Roubaix closed in 1985, after more than a century in use. Thank to the European funded project &quot;Blue Links&quot;, the waterway has been reopened to boating traffic since 2011.

=== Climate ===
The area of the city is not known for undergoing unusual weather events. In regard to the town&#x27;s geographical location and the results of the Météo-France&#x27;s weather station of Lille-Lesquin, Roubaix is a temperate oceanic climate: while summer experiences mild temperatures, winter&#x27;s temperatures may fall to below zero. Precipitation is infrequently intense.

== Toponymy ==
The current city&#x27;s name is most likely derived from Frankish &quot;rausa&quot; &quot;reed&quot; and &quot;baki&quot; &quot;brook&quot;. Therefore, the meaning of &quot;Roubaix&quot; can, in all likelihood, find its origin on the banks of its three historical brooks: &quot;Espierre&quot;, &quot;Trichon&quot; and &quot;Favreuil&quot;. The place was mentioned for the first time in a Latinised form in the 9th century: &quot;Villa Rusbaci&quot;. Thereafter, the following names were in use: 1047 and 1106 &quot;Rubais&quot;, 1122 &quot;Rosbays&quot;, 1166 &quot;Rusbais&quot;, 1156 and 1202 &quot;Robais&quot;, 1223 &quot;Roubais&quot;. Over the span of centuries, the name evolved to &quot;Roubaix&quot; as shown on Mercator&#x27;s map of Flanders published at Leuven in 1540.

Parallel to the official and usual name &quot;Roubaix&quot;, some translations are worth a mention. Firstly, though the city has never belonged to the Flemish-speaking area, the seldom-heard renderings &quot;Robeke&quot; and &quot;Roodebeeke&quot; are documented for &quot;Roubaix&quot;. Furthermore, the Dutch Language Union established &quot;Robaais&quot; as the city&#x27;s proper Dutch name. Lastly, one can cite &quot;Rosbacum&quot; as the definite Latin transcription of &quot;Roubaix&quot; which has been in use since the 19th century, as recorded on dedication statements sealed in the first stones of the foundations of the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) laid in 1840 and the Church of Notre Dame laid in 1842.

== History ==

== Heraldry ==
== People ==
Inhabitants of Roubaix are known in English as &quot;Roubaisians&quot; and in French as &quot;Roubaisiens&quot; () or in the feminine form &quot;Roubaisiennes&quot; (), also natively called &quot;Roubaignots&quot; () or in the feminine form &quot;Roubaignotes&quot; ().

=== Demographics ===
The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793 and the research study of Louis-Edmond Marissal, Clerk of the Peace of the city, published in 1844. Roubaix evolved into a provincial market town until the end of the Early modern period with a census population of 4,715 inhabitants in 1716. By the late 18th century, the city began to emerge as regional textile manufacturing centre and its population increased, reaching a level of 8,091 in 1800. As a result of the industrialisation process of the 19th century, the need of workers was supplied by rural flight as well as immigration. Belgian settlement was a feature of the Roubaisian life at that time.

During the first-half period of the 19th century, Roubaix ranked the first French town in terms of population growth rate with a five times increase, whereas in the remaining period of this century its population doubled. Within this last time framework, Belgian immigration appeared to be one of the major factor to explain the significantly high population growth, with 30,465 Belgian inhabitants counted in 1866 and 42,103 in 1872. Nonetheless, the rate of natural increase shew to be a more important component of the population growth in that period.

At the 20th century threshold, the Roubaisian population reached a peak of 124,661, from which it progressively declined over the successive decades. Occupied by German troops from October 1914 to October 1918, Roubaix belonged to the combat zone of the Western Front during the First World War. Over this occupation period, Roubaisians suffered from dearth, deportation for compulsory labour and unusual casualties with a rather slight population drop from 122,723 to 113,265 between the 1911 and 1921 censuses.

The population of the city was 98,828 as of January 2019. This enables Roubaix to remain the third largest municipality in the region Hauts-de-France, after Lille and Amiens.

As of 2019, at least 25% of residents in Roubaix were immigrants, mainly of Arab, North African, Turkish, and Sub-Saharan African origin.

=== Languages ===
Although the region of Roubaix was subjected many times to the domination of Flanders&#x27; rulers throughout its history, Roubaisians have used a local Picard variant as the language of everyday life for centuries. This spoken vernacular is locally known as &quot;Roubaignot&quot;. Until the early 20th century this patois prevailed. Therefore, French language progressive penetration into local culture should not only be analysed as a result of the industrialisation and urbanisation of the area but should also be considered in terms of public education policies.

=== Religion ===
==== Christianity ====
The city of Roubaix is divided into six Catholic parishes and belongs to the deanery of the same name in the archdiocese of Lille.

==== Judaism ====
In the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War and the German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, many Jews left their homes and emigrated. Jewish arrival in Roubaix derives from that bitter period of history. At the time, the new immigrant community, even though its small size, dedicated a building to Jewish faith and liturgical practises. The newly opened synagogue, located in a house at number 51 on the narrow &quot;rue des Champs&quot;, operated more than 60 years, until 1939, when it was closed under imprecise local circumstances as the Nazi regime took over in Europe. Despite the closure of the synagogue, the occupation and police raids, the local practise of Judaism saw a humble revival after the war which lasted until the start of the 1990s when the modest Jewry of Roubaix handed over its Sefer Torah to the care of the Jewish community of Lille. Roubaix has no longer been home to a Jewish place of worship since that event. The house inside which the first one was created 123 years ago, has been demolished since an urban renewal project occurred in 2000. On 10 September 2015 the mayor unveiled a commemorative plaque on the &quot;rue des Champs&quot;, as a tribute to the Roubaisian Jewry, in memory of the religious purpose of this previous building.

==== Islam ====
As of August 2013 there were six mosques in the town, including one under construction. According to estimates by the mayor&#x27;s office, around 20,000 people, or at least 20% of the population were Muslims. Over one-in-three residents in Roubaix are of Arab, North African, Turkish, and Sub-Saharan African origin. Four areas of the cemetery were designated for Muslims.

==== Buddhism ====
During the second half of the 20th century, the city took in Buddhist communities from originally Buddhist countries in the Southeast Asian peninsula including Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Within this background Roubaix has brought together two Buddhist traditions on its territory, hence cultural variations across communities: Mahāyāna and Theravāda with, respectively, one and four places of worship.

== Urbanism ==

=== Urban geography ===
During the Middle Age, the city grew in a northward-facing semicircle around its primitive core, beyond the area spread out between the church Saint Martin and the former fortified castle. The existence of this south boundary remained until the 18th century and marked an urban expansion which mainly occurred on the western and northern sides of the town. Increasing industrialisation, land transport improvement, continued population growth and the resulting need for suitable low cost lands for housing and manufacturing plants, all of which finally led to expand the city southward from the centre, in the 19th century.

== Administrative and political affairs ==

=== Constituencies and cantons ===
Roubaix grouped four cantons from 1988 to 2012. Since then, this number has fallen to two with &quot;Roubaix 1&quot; and &quot;Roubaix 2&quot;. After the last redistricting of French legislative constituencies in 2010, the city is now divided into two constituencies: Nord&#x27;s 7th constituency which include the former canton of &quot;Roubaix-Ouest&quot; and Nord&#x27;s 8th constituency formed by the following former cantons: &quot;Roubaix-Centre&quot;, &quot;Roubaix-Nord&quot; and &quot;Roubaix-Est&quot;.

== Landmarks ==

Remarkable buildings, old brick factories and warehouses abound in this once renowned city which was esteemed to be a worldwide textile capital in the early years of the 20th century. Thus, the city inherited one of the most architectural works in the French history and culture of the 19th century Industrial Revolution and was designated Town of Art and History on 13 December 2000. Ever since the Ministry of Culture endowed Roubaix with this label, the city has entered the 21st century by promoting its cultural standing as the inheritance of its industrial and social history.

Several profane or sacral buildings of Roubaix are registered as historic monuments.

;Religious structures registered as &quot;monuments historiques&quot;
=== Sculptures and memorials ===

== Culture ==

=== Museums ===
Roubaix has been home to two major museums of the region Hauts-de-France since the beginning of the 21st century: &quot;La Piscine&quot; and &quot;La Manufacture&quot;; inheriting both of the local socioeconomic history. &quot;La Piscine&quot;, also known as the &quot;Musée d&#x27;Art &amp; d&#x27;Industrie André Diligent&quot;, is one of the most lauded cultural attractions in northern France. This museum is housed in the Art Deco-style former swimming pool of Roubaix, a building remodelled in 2000 to accommodate and exhibit 19th and 20th century collections of the city. After being closed for two years of renovation works and extension, it was reopened to the public in October 2018, becoming more successful than ever before. &quot;La Manufacture&quot; is the reference textile museum in northern France. It is hosted in an old weaving factory.

=== Painting ===
The most prestigious names of painters, who made their reputation in Roubaix from the middle of the 19th century to the early 20th century are Jean-Joseph Weerts and Rémy Cogghe.

From the end of the Second World War to the beginning of the 1970s, a casual group of young artists from Roubaix and the surrounding region was formed and given the name &quot;Groupe de Roubaix&quot;. Two painters commonly associated with the group are Arthur Van Hecke and Eugène Leroy.

=== Fashion ===
Anxious to restore the prestige of northern France&#x27;s textile industry and operating under the label of &quot;Maisons de Mode&quot;, the cities of Lille and Roubaix have created spaces for new fashion designers to thrive since 2007. The Roubaisian location, next to &quot;La Piscine&quot; museum, is known as &quot;Le Vestiaire&quot;. There are fifteen boutiques and fashion studios housed in an old industrial building.

== Sport ==
Roubaix has an old sporting heritage and is home to the finish of one of the world&#x27;s oldest races of professional road cycling at its velodrome: Paris–Roubaix, known as the &quot;Hell of the North&quot;. While Roubaix is famous for its velodrome, there is more to this city than the cycling sports facilities.

The building of indoor and outdoor sports amenities in the city should be associated with its era of economic rise during the industrial revolution, in addition to the development of local sporting clubs and associations.

In October 2021 Roubaix hosted the 2021 UCI Track Cycling World Championships.

== Economy ==
During the 19th century, Roubaix acquired an international reputation for textile industry and wool production. In the 1970s and 1980s, international competition and automation caused an industrial decline and resulted in the closure of many factories. From that moment on and since the implementation of the French urban policy in the early 1980s, around three-fourths of the town&#x27;s territory has been regularly assigned specific zoning designations as well as health and welfare plans.

Roubaix&#x27;s high level of unemployment is a consequence of the deindustrialisation. The town is listed among France&#x27;s poorest cities.
Successive local governments have tried to address difficulties associated with deindustrialisation by attracting new industries, making the most of the town&#x27;s cultural credentials and organising a strong student presence on different campuses. While undergoing conversion efforts, the city is experimenting with new models and able to take advantage of successful economic stories, with online retail and information technology, and seems to be on the way to reverse the decades of decline.

=== Textile industry ===
Nowadays, local textile companies are focusing on developing high-tech textile products.

=== Commerce and services ===
Mail order companies of international renown such as La Redoute, Damart and 3 Suisses, stemmed from textile industries which were founded in Roubaix. Showroomprive.com has been locally established since 2016 as an e-commerce company that specialises in online flash sales.

=== Information technology and e-business ===
*OVH was created in Roubaix in 1999 and became a global IT infrastructure company, creating more than thousand jobs in the city and surroundings. Its head office is still in Roubaix.
*Ankama Games has established its head office in Roubaix since 2007.
* Blanchemaille, an e-commerce cluster helped by the incubator EuraTechnologies, has been established in the former building of La Redoute in Roubaix since 2014.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
A22 autoroute, a French part of the European route E17 from Burgundy to Antwerp, is the only motorway, within a motorway roads network of the highest density in France after Paris, which passes by Roubaix.

The Gare de Roubaix railway station offers connections to Antwerp, Lille, Ostend, Paris and Tourcoing.

The city is also served by the Lille Metro.

=== Environmental perspectives ===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s desindustrialisation dramatically influenced major urban landscapes across the arrondissement of Lille. Large areas of brownfield land came to mark the city of Roubaix. With the support of the local and national government programs, these areas are acquired and gradually restored or rebuilt.

Roubaix has one of the most efficient biomass district heating plant in France and is therefore among the most advanced cities for sustainability in Hauts-de-France. Since 2014, the city has been engaged in several related initiatives aimed at moving to a circular economy and a zero waste future.

<doc id="291682" wikidata="Q182481" url="?curid=291682" title="Tourcoing">
<text>Tourcoing (; ; ; ) is a city in northern France on the Belgian border. It is designated municipally as a commune within the department of Nord. Located to the north-northeast of Lille, adjacent to Roubaix, Tourcoing is the chef-lieu of two cantons and the fourth largest city in the French region of Hauts-de-France ranked by population with about 97,000 inhabitants.

Together with the cities of Lille, Roubaix, Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq and eighty-six other communes, Tourcoing is part of four-city-centred metropolitan area inhabited by more than 1.1 million people: the Métropole Européenne de Lille. To a greater extent, Tourcoing belongs to a vast conurbation formed with the Belgian cities of Mouscron, Kortrijk and Tournai, which gave birth to the first European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation in January 2008, &quot;Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai&quot; with an aggregate of just over 2 million inhabitants.

==History==

The city was the site of a significant victory for France during the French Revolutionary Wars. Marshal Charles Pichegru and his generals Joseph Souham and Jean Moreau defeated a combined force of British and Austrian troops in the Battle of Tourcoing on 29 Floréal II (18 May 1794).

==Population==

==Main sights==
*Church of St Christopher (15th-16th centuries), considered one of the most beautiful Neo-Gothic edifices of Nord. In stone and brickwork, it has an high bell tower with more than 80 bells.
*&quot;Hospice de Havre&quot;, founded in 1260. The cloister and the chapel date from the seventeenth century.
*&quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; (1885), in Second Empire style.
*&quot;Jardin botanique de Tourcoing&quot;, a botanical garden and arboretum.

==Transport==
The Tourcoing station is a railway station offering direct connections to Lille and Paris (high speed trains), Kortrijk, Ostend, Ghent and Antwerp. The town was formerly served by the Somain-Halluin Railway.

==Notable people==
*Yohan Cabaye, footballer 
*Jean-Marc Degraeve, chess grandmaster
*Stéphane Denève, conductor
* Achille Desurmont, writer
*Brigitte Fossey, actress
*Anna Gomis, wrestler
* Henri Padou, water polo player and 1924 Olympic gold medallist 
*Brigitte Lahaie, pornstar
*Joseph-Charles Lefèbvre, bishop of Bourges, cardinal, cousin of
*Marcel Lefebvre, missionary priest and, later, archbishop, cousin of Joseph-Charles
*Mr. Sam, a popular deejay and producer running his own record label since 2008.
*Albert Roussel, composer
*Yves Devernay, organist

Guilbert de Lannoy (1545-) and his son Jean de Lannoy (1575-) were Protestants from Tourcoing who resettled in Leiden, Holland. Jean&#x27;s son, Philip Delano ( - ; born &quot;Philipe de la Noye&quot; or &quot;Philipe de Lannoy&quot;), was an early emigrant to the Plymouth Colony and progenitor of the prominent Delano family, which counts among its descendants prominent figures in American history, including president Franklin Roosevelt.

== Notable Startups ==

In 2013, Maxime Piquette and Charles De Potter founded iCreo, a digital audio company in Tourcoing. The company created RadioKing, a platform for internet radio, and Ausha, a platform for podcast hosting and marketing. It received support from regional funders, Nord France Amorquage and IRD Gestion. The company is now the platform for media outlets Le Figaro, Liberation, l&#x27;Équipe and AFP, as well as large corporations and independent content producers.

==International relations==
===Twin towns - sister cities===
Tourcoing is twinned with:

* Biella, Italy

<doc id="291683" wikidata="Q607967" url="?curid=291683" title="XOR linked list">
<text>An XOR linked list is a type of data structure used in computer programming. It takes advantage of the bitwise XOR operation to decrease storage requirements for doubly linked lists by storing the composition of both addresses in one field. While the composed address is not meaningful on its own, during traversal it can be combined with knowledge of the last-visited node address to deduce the address of the following node.

== Description ==
An ordinary doubly linked list stores addresses of the previous and next list items in each list node, requiring two address fields:

 ... A B C D E ...
 –&gt; next –&gt; next –&gt; next –&gt;
 &lt;– prev &lt;– prev &lt;– prev &lt;–

An XOR linked list compresses the same information into &quot;one&quot; address field by storing the bitwise XOR (here denoted by ⊕) of the address for &quot;previous&quot; and the address for &quot;next&quot; in one field:

 ... A B C D E ...
 ⇌ A⊕C ⇌ B⊕D ⇌ C⊕E ⇌

More formally: 
 link(B) = addr(A)⊕addr(C), link(C) = addr(B)⊕addr(D), ...

When traversing the list from left to right: supposing the cursor is at C, the previous item, B, may be XORed with the value in the link field (B⊕D). The address for D will then be obtained and list traversal may resume. The same pattern applies in the other direction.

i.e. 
where
 link(C) = addr(B)⊕addr(D)
so 
 addr(D) = addr(B)⊕addr(D) ⊕ addr(B) 
 addr(D) = addr(B)⊕addr(B) ⊕ addr(D) 
since 
 X⊕X = 0 
 =&gt; addr(D) = 0 ⊕ addr(D)
since
 X⊕0 = X
 =&gt; addr(D) = addr(D)
The XOR operation cancels appearing twice in the equation and all we are left with is the .

To start traversing the list in either direction from some point, the address of two consecutive items is required. If the addresses of the two consecutive items are reversed, list traversal will occur in the opposite direction.

===Theory of operation===
The key is the first operation, and the properties of XOR: 
*X⊕X = 0
*X⊕0 = X
*X⊕Y = Y⊕X
*(X⊕Y)⊕Z = X⊕(Y⊕Z)

The R2 register always contains the XOR of the address of current item C with the address of the predecessor item P: C⊕P. The Link fields in the records contain the XOR of the left and right successor addresses, say L⊕R. XOR of R2 (C⊕P) with the current link field (L⊕R) yields C⊕P⊕L⊕R. 
* If the predecessor was L, the P(=L) and L &quot;cancel out&quot; leaving C⊕R. 
* If the predecessor had been R, the P(=R) and R cancel, leaving C⊕L.

In each case, the result is the XOR of the current address with the next address. XOR of this with the current address in R1 leaves the next address. R2 is left with the requisite XOR pair of the (now) current address and the predecessor.

==Features==
* Two XOR operations suffice to do the traversal from one item to the next, the same instructions sufficing in both cases. Consider a list with items codice_1 and with R1 and R2 being registers containing, respectively, the address of the current (say C) list item and a work register containing the XOR of the current address with the previous address (say C⊕D). Cast as System/360 instructions:

 X R2,Link R2 &lt;- C⊕D ⊕ B⊕D (i.e. B⊕C, &quot;Link&quot; being the link field
 in the current record, containing B⊕D)
 XR R1,R2 R1 &lt;- C ⊕ B⊕C (i.e. B, voilà: the next record)

* End of list is signified by imagining a list item at address zero placed adjacent to an end point, as in codice_2. The link field at A would be 0⊕B. An additional instruction is needed in the above sequence after the two XOR operations to detect a zero result in developing the address of the current item,
* A list end point can be made reflective by making the link pointer be zero. A zero pointer is a &quot;mirror&quot;. (The XOR of the left and right neighbor addresses, being the same, is zero.)

== Drawbacks ==

* General-purpose debugging tools cannot follow the XOR chain, making debugging more difficult;
* The price for the decrease in memory usage is an increase in code complexity, making maintenance more expensive;
* Most garbage collection schemes do not work with data structures that do not contain literal pointers;
* Not all languages support type conversion between pointers and integers, XOR on pointers is not defined in some contexts;
* While traversing the list, the address of the previously accessed node is needed to calculate the next node&#x27;s address and the pointers will be unreadable if one isn&#x27;t traversing the list—for example, if the pointer to a list item was contained in another data structure;
* XOR linked lists do not provide some of the important advantages of doubly linked lists, such as the ability to delete a node from the list knowing only its address or the ability to insert a new node before or after an existing node when knowing only the address of the existing node.

Computer systems have increasingly cheap and plentiful memory, therefore storage overhead is not generally an overriding issue outside specialized embedded systems. Where it is still desirable to reduce the overhead of a linked list, unrolling provides a more practical approach (as well as other advantages, such as increasing cache performance and speeding random access).

==Variations==
The underlying principle of the XOR linked list can be applied to any reversible binary operation. Replacing XOR by addition or subtraction gives slightly different, but largely equivalent, formulations:

===Addition linked list===

 ... A B C D E ...
 ⇌ A+C ⇌ B+D ⇌ C+E ⇌

This kind of list has exactly the same properties as the XOR linked list, except that a zero link field is not a &quot;mirror&quot;. The address of the next node in the list is given by subtracting the previous node&#x27;s address from the current node&#x27;s link field.

===Subtraction linked list===

 ... A B C D E ...
 ⇌ C-A ⇌ D-B ⇌ E-C ⇌

This kind of list differs from the standard &quot;traditional&quot; XOR linked list in that the instruction sequences needed to traverse the list forwards is different from the sequence needed to traverse the list in reverse. The address of the next node, going forwards, is given by &quot;adding&quot; the link field to the previous node&#x27;s address; the address of the preceding node is given by &quot;subtracting&quot; the link field from the next node&#x27;s address.

The subtraction linked list is also special in that the entire list can be relocated in memory without needing any patching of pointer values, since adding a constant offset to each address in the list will not require any changes to the values stored in the link fields. (See also serialization.) This is an advantage over both XOR linked lists and traditional linked lists.

The XOR linked list concept can be generalized to XOR binary search trees.

<text>The Southern Netherlands, also called the Catholic Netherlands, were the parts of the Low Countries belonging to the Holy Roman Empire which were at first largely controlled by Habsburg Spain (Spanish Netherlands, 1556–1714) and later by the Austrian Habsburgs (Austrian Netherlands, 1714–1794) until occupied and annexed by Revolutionary France (1794–1815).

The region also included a number of smaller states that were never ruled by Spain or Austria: the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, the Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy, the County of Bouillon, the County of Horne and the Princely Abbey of Thorn. 
The Southern Netherlands comprised most of modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg, small parts of the modern Netherlands and Germany (the Upper Guelders region, as well as the Bitburg area in Germany, then part of Luxembourg), in addition to (until 1678) most of the present Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, and Longwy area in northern France. The (southern) Upper Guelders region consisted of what is now divided between Germany and the modern Dutch Province of Limburg (in 1713 largely ceded to Prussia).

== Place in the broader Netherlands ==

As they were very wealthy, the Netherlands in general were an important territory of the Habsburg crown which also ruled Spain and Austria among other places. But unlike the other Habsburg dominions, they were led by a merchant class. It was the merchant economy which made them wealthy, and the Habsburg attempts at increasing taxation to finance their wars was a major factor in the Dutch (merchants&#x27;) efforts to defend their privileges. This, added to resistance to penal laws enforced by the Habsburg monarchy that made heresy a capital crime, led to a general rebellion of the Netherlands against Habsburg rule towards 1570 (protests and hostilities started the Dutch Eighty Years&#x27; War for independence –1568). Although the northern seven provinces, led by Holland and Zeeland, established their independence as the United Provinces after 1581, the ten southern Netherlands were reconquered by the Spanish general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. Liège, Stavelot-Malmédy and Bouillon maintained their independence.

The Habsburg Netherlands passed to the Austrian Habsburgs after the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714. Under Austrian rule, the ten provinces&#x27; defence of their privileges proved as troublesome to the reforming Emperor Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor as it had to his ancestor Philip II two centuries earlier, leading to a major rebellion in 1789–1790. The Austrian Netherlands were ultimately lost to the French Revolutionary armies, and annexed to France in 1794. Following the war, Austria&#x27;s loss of the territories was confirmed, and they were joined with the northern Netherlands as a single kingdom under the House of Orange at the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The southeastern third of Luxembourg Province was made into the autonomous Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, because it was claimed by both the Netherlands and Prussia.

In 1830 the predominantly Roman Catholic southern half became independent as the Kingdom of Belgium (the northern half being predominantly Calvinist). In 1839 the final border between the kingdom of the Netherlands and Belgium was determined and the eastern part of Limburg returned to the Netherlands as the province of Limburg. The autonomy of Luxembourg was recognised in 1839, but an instrument to that effect was not signed until 1867. The King of the Netherlands was Grand Duke of Luxembourg until 1890, when William III was succeeded by his daughter, Wilhelmina of the Netherlands – but Luxembourg still followed the Salic law at the time, which forbade a woman to rule in her own right; so the union of the Dutch and Luxembourgish crowns then ended. The northwestern two-thirds of the original Luxembourg remains a province of Belgium.

== Spanish Netherlands==

The Spanish Netherlands (Dutch: &quot;Spaanse Nederlanden&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Países Bajos españoles&quot;) was a portion of the Low Countries controlled by Spain from 1556 to 1714, inherited from the Dukes of Burgundy. Although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of Duke of Burgundy and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the Low Countries and the Free County of Burgundy in the Holy Roman Empire. They often used the term Burgundy to refer to it (e.g. in the name of the Imperial Circle it was grouped into), until 1794, when the Austrian Netherlands were lost to the French Republic.

When part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule and became the United Provinces in 1581 the remainder of the area became known as the Spanish Netherlands and remained under Spanish control. This region comprised modern Belgium, Luxembourg as well as part of northern France.

The Spanish Netherlands originally consisted of:
*County of Flanders, including Walloon Flanders
*County of Artois
*City of Tournai
*Cambrai (roughly the département Nord and the northern half of Pas-de-Calais in modern France)
*Duchy of Luxembourg
*Duchy of Limburg
*County of Hainaut
*County of Namur
*Lordship of Mechelen (officially a county since 1490)
*Duchy of Brabant, including the Margraviate of Antwerp
*the Upper Quarter (&quot;Bovenkwartier&quot;) of the duchy of Guelders (around Venlo and Roermond, in the present province of Dutch Limburg, and the town of Geldern in the present German district Kleve)

The capital, Brussels, was in Brabant. In the early 17th century, there was a flourishing court at Brussels, which was under the government of King Philip III&#x27;s half-sister Archduchess Isabella and her husband, Archduke Albert of Austria. Among the artists who emerged from the court of the &quot;Archdukes&quot;, as they were known, was Peter Paul Rubens. Under the Archdukes, the Spanish Netherlands actually had formal independence from Spain, but always remained unofficially within the Spanish sphere of influence, and with Albert&#x27;s death in 1621 they returned to formal Spanish control, although the childless Isabella remained on as Governor until her death in 1633.

The failing wars intended to regain the &#x27;heretical&#x27; northern Netherlands meant significant loss of (still mainly Catholic) territories in the north, which was consolidated in 1648 in the Peace of Westphalia, and given the peculiar, inferior status of &quot;Generality Lands&quot; (jointly ruled by the United Republic, not admitted as member provinces): Zeelandic Flanders (south of the river Scheldt), the present Dutch province of North Brabant and Maastricht (in the present Dutch province of Limburg).

As Spanish power waned in the latter decades of the 17th century, the territory of the Spanish Netherlands was repeatedly invaded by the French and an increasing portion of the territory came under French control in successive wars. By the Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659 the French annexed Artois while Dunkirk was ceded to the English. By the Treaties of Aix-la-Chapelle (ending the War of Devolution in 1668) and Nijmegen (ending the Franco-Dutch War in 1678), further territory up to the current Franco-Belgian border was ceded, including Cambrai, Walloon Flanders (the area around Lille, Douai and Orchies), as well as half of the county of Hainaut (including Valenciennes). Later, in the War of the Reunions and the Nine Years&#x27; War, France temporarily annexed other parts of the region that were returned in the 1697 Peace of Ryswick.

== Austrian Netherlands ==

Under the Treaty of Rastatt (1714), following the War of the Spanish Succession, what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria and thus became known as the Austrian Netherlands or &quot;Belgium Austriacum&quot;. However, the Austrians themselves generally had little interest in the region (aside from a short-lived attempt by Emperor Charles VI to compete with British and Dutch trade through the Ostend Company), and the fortresses along the border (the Barrier Fortresses) were, by treaty, garrisoned with Dutch troops. The area had, in fact, been given to Austria largely at British and Dutch insistence, as these powers feared potential French domination of the region.

Throughout the latter part of the eighteenth century, the principal foreign policy goal of the Habsburg rulers was to exchange the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria, which would round out Habsburg possessions in southern Germany. In the 1757 Treaty of Versailles, Austria agreed to the creation of an independent state in the Southern Netherlands ruled by Philip, Duke of Parma and garrisoned by French troops in exchange for French help in recovering Silesia. However the agreement was unimplemented and revoked by the Third Treaty of Versailles (1785) and Austrian rule continued.

In 1784, its ruler, Emperor Joseph II, took up the long-standing grudge of Antwerp, whose once-flourishing trade was destroyed by the permanent closing of the Scheldt, and he demanded for the Dutch Republic to open the river to navigation. However, his stance was far from militant, and he called off hostilities after the so-called Kettle War, so called because its only &quot;casualty&quot; was a kettle. Though Joseph secured in the 1785 Treaty of Fontainebleau that the territory&#x27;s rulers would be compensated by the Dutch Republic for the continued closing the Scheldt, this failed to gain him much popularity.

The people of the Austrian Netherlands rebelled against Austria in 1788 as a result of Joseph II&#x27;s centralizing policies. The different provinces established the United States of Belgium (January 1790). However, waylaying Joseph&#x27;s intended concessions to the Belgians to restore the height of their autonomy and privileges, Austrian imperial power had been restored by Joseph&#x27;s brother and successor, Leopold II, by the end of 1790.

==French annexation==
In the course of the French Revolution, the entire region (including territories that were never under Habsburg rule, like the Prince-Bishopric of Liège) was overrun by French armies after they won the Battle of Sprimont in 1794. The territory was then annexed to the Republic (October 1, 1795).

Only a minority of the population – mostly the local Jacobins and other members of &quot;Societies of Friends of Liberty and Equality&quot; in urban areas – supported the annexation. The majority were hostile to the French regime, above all because of the imposition of the assignat, wholesale conscription, and the ferocious antireligious policies of the French revolutionaries. The opposition was first led by the Catholic clergy, which became an irreducible enemy of the French Republic after it dissolved convents and monasteries and confiscated ecclesiastical properties, ordered the separation of Church and State, shut down the University of Louvain and other Catholic educational institutions, regulated church attendance and introduced divorce. In 1797, nearly 8000 priests refused to swear the newly introduced Oath of Hatred of Kings (&quot;serment de haine à la royauté&quot;), and went into hiding to escape arrest and deportation. The situation, particularly in the religious field, eased with the rise to power of Bonaparte in 1799, but soon, the intensification of conscription, the police state and the Continental System, which brought ruin to Ostend and Antwerp, reignited opposition to French rule. During that period Belgium was divided into nine départements: Deux-Nèthes, Dyle, Escaut, Forêts, Jemmape, Lys, Meuse-Inférieure, Ourthe and Sambre-et-Meuse.

Austria confirmed the loss of its territories by the Treaty of Campo Formio, in 1797.

In anticipation of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1814, it was hotly debated inside Austrian ruling circles whether Austria should get the Southern Netherlands back or, in view of the experience gained after the War of the Spanish Succession about the difficulty of defending non contiguous possessions, whether she should not instead obtain contiguous territorial compensations in Northern Italy. This latter viewpoint won and the Congress of Vienna allotted the Southern Netherlands to the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands. After the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the region separated to become the independent Kingdom of Belgium.

<text>The RATP Group () is a French state-owned enterprise (EPIC) that operates public transport systems primarily in Paris, France. Headquartered in Paris, it originally operated under the name (). Its logo represents the Seine&#x27;s meandering path through the Paris Region stylised as the face of a person looking up. The company had described itself as the fourth-largest presence in public transport.

RATP Group was established in 1949 with the express purpose of operating Paris&#x27;s public transport system. During the twentieth century, it focused solely on the provision of the capital&#x27;s various forms of transit, from the Paris Métro, Île-de-France tram, and the RATP bus network, as well as part of the regional express rail (RER) network. However, since 2002, RATP Group&#x27;s operations have no longer been geographically restricted; it has competitively pursued contracts to operate transit systems around the world. It also had a partnership with, and a minority shareholding in, Transdev, which has further involved RATP Group in various global transport operations. During 2002, RATP Dev was created as the Group&#x27;s dedicated international operations and maintenance subsidiary; it is present in 16 countries across Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America.

RATP Group&#x27;s Paris-related activities are still a major part of its business through to the present day; in 2019, it was recorded that, in the Île-de-France region, it carried roughly 3.3 billion passengers per year. In 2019, RATP Group&#x27;s consolidated revenue was ; it employed 64,000 people at that time. In recent decades, the company has operated on an increasingly competitive basis as a result of legislative changes.

==History==
The RATP was created on 1 January 1949 by combining the assets of the &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris&quot; (CMP), which operated the Paris Métro, and the &quot;Société des Transports en Commun de la Région Parisienne&quot; (STCRP), which operated the city&#x27;s bus system.

Prior to this, the CMP had absorbed the Nord-Sud Company in 1930 and the Ligne de Sceaux in 1937, which operated commuter rail to the suburbs. The STCRP had been created on 1 January 1921 by the merger of about half a dozen independent bus and streetcar operators in the Paris area. By the time the STCRP was merged into the RATP, all of its streetcars had been replaced by bus routes.

=== Shift towards competitive operations ===
A major change in French law came on 3 November 2009, when article 5 of the ARAF (French rail regulatory body) law came into effect. This law opens public transport operation to competition. The law was part of a broader push by the European Union to open all passenger transport operation to competition. Under this law, the RATP Group lost the exclusive right to operate all new public transport lines immediately. The company&#x27;s exclusive operation rights for existing lines would expire over time, with the bus network going out to bid 15 years later in 2024, the tram network (Lines T1, T2 &amp; T3) going out to bid 20 years later in 2029, and the Metro and RER lines out to bid 30 years later in 2039.

With the RATP anticipating this shift to a competitive environment, the company began to reorganize itself. 

In the early years of the 21st century, a partnership with Transdev resulted in RATP acquiring a minority shareholding in that group, with its many worldwide transport operations. However, in 2009, the Caisse des dépôts et consignations, the majority owner of the Transdev, started negotiations with Veolia to merge Transdev with Veolia Transport. As part of the resulting agreement, made in May 2010, it was agreed that RATP would take over ownership of some of Transdev&#x27;s operations in lieu of cash payment for its holdings in Transdev. This gave RATP a considerable number of international operations.

In 2009, RATP entered the United States by purchasing transit contractor McDonald Transit Associates. McDonald operated Fort Worth Transportation Authority (now Trinity Metro) in Texas, Votran in Florida, and Waco Transit System in Texas, among others. On 1 August 2011, the RATP Group purchased Stagecoach Metrolink&#x27;s contract to operate the Metrolink light rail system in Greater Manchester, England until July 2017. Two years later, in 2013, RATP purchased the nearby long-established coach company, Selwyns Travel, a National Express operator.

=== Presidents ===

The current president and CEO of the RATP, Jean Castex, is in office since 28 November 2022.

Hiba Farès is the Chairman of the Board of RATP Dev since January 2022.

==Operations in Paris==

In Paris, RATP operates, under its own name, on behalf of and under contract with Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), the Paris region transit authority. RATP&#x27;s services constitute, in their own right, a multi-mode public transportation infrastructure, but also contribute to a larger multi-mode system extending out into the surrounding Île-de-France communities.

RATP&#x27;s services in the Greater Paris area include:
*The Paris Métro, a system of mostly underground rapid transit lines which run throughout the city, with some lines extending somewhat beyond the city boundaries.

*Orlyval, the automated shuttle serving Orly Airport.
*Parts of the RER, the Paris regional express rail network that runs mostly underground in the centre of Paris and overground in the rest of the region.

*Nine out of the fourteen lines of the Paris tram system (T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T5, T6, T7, T8, T10) totaling and 197 stops.

*Two BRT lines: the Trans-Val-de-Marne (TVM, ) and line 393 ().
*The Montmartre funicular.

Paris bus route 341 was RATP&#x27;s first line equipped with 100% electric full-size buses (starting June 2016). By early 2021, there were over 150 full battery electric buses in the fleet with a target of 1,500 by 2025.

==Operations outside Paris==
RATP Dev (Dev being a contraction of , French for development), established in 2002 as a 100% subsidiary of the RATP Group, provides operations and maintenance of passenger transport services outside of the &quot;historical&quot; RATP network in the Greater Paris area although it also operates some specialised services within Paris.

<text>A truffle is the fruiting body of a subterranean ascomycete fungus, one of the species of the genus &quot;Tuber&quot;. More than one hundred other genera of fungi are classified as truffles including &quot;Geopora&quot;, &quot;Peziza&quot;, &quot;Choiromyces&quot;, and &quot;Leucangium&quot;. These genera belong to the class Pezizomycetes and the Pezizales order. Several truffle-like basidiomycetes are excluded from Pezizales, including &quot;Rhizopogon&quot; and &quot;Glomus&quot;. Truffles are ectomycorrhizal fungi, so they are found in close association with tree roots. Spore dispersal is accomplished through fungivores, animals that eat fungi. These fungi have ecological roles in nutrient cycling and drought tolerance.

Some truffle species are prized as food. Edible truffles are used in Italian, French and other national . Truffles are cultivated and harvested from natural environments.

==Taxonomic details==

=== Species ===

==== Black ====

The black truffle or black Périgord truffle (&quot;Tuber melanosporum&quot;), the second-most commercially valuable species, is named after the Périgord region in France. Black truffles associate with oaks, hazelnut, cherry, and other deciduous trees and are harvested in late autumn and winter. The genome sequence of the black truffle was published in March 2010.

==== Summer or burgundy ====

The black summer truffle (&quot;Tuber aestivum&quot;) is found across Europe and is prized for its culinary value. Burgundy truffles (designated &quot;Tuber uncinatum&quot;, but the same species) are harvested in autumn until December and have aromatic flesh of a darker colour. These are associated with various trees and shrubs.

==== White ====
Tuber magnatum, the high-value &quot;white truffle&quot; () is found mainly in the Langhe and Montferrat areas of the Piedmont region in northern Italy, and most famously, in the countryside around the cities of Alba and Asti. A large percentage of Italy&#x27;s white truffles also come from Molise.

==== Whitish ====

The &quot;whitish truffle&quot; (&quot;Tuber borchii&quot;) is a similar species native to Tuscany, Abruzzo, Romagna, Umbria, the Marche, and Molise. It is reportedly not as aromatic as those from Piedmont, although those from Città di Castello are said to come quite close.

==== Other &quot;Tuber&quot; ====
A less common truffle is &quot;garlic truffle&quot; (&quot;Tuber macrosporum&quot;).

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, several species of truffle are harvested both recreationally and commercially, most notably, the &quot;Leucangium carthusianum&quot;, Oregon black truffle; &quot;Tuber gibbosum&quot;, Oregon spring white truffle; and &quot;Tuber oregonense&quot;, Oregon winter white truffle. &quot;Kalapuya brunnea&quot;, the Oregon brown truffle, has also been commercially harvested and is of culinary note. The Oregon white truffle is increasingly harvested due to its high quality and also exported to other countries. Oregon celebrates its traditional truffle harvesting with a &#x27;truffle festival&#x27;, combined with culinary shows and wine tastings.

The pecan truffle (&quot;Tuber lyonii&quot;) syn. &quot;texense&quot; is found in the Southern United States, usually associated with pecan trees. Chefs who have experimented with them agree &quot;they are very good and have potential as a food commodity&quot;. Although pecan farmers used to find them along with pecans and discard them, considering them a nuisance, they sell for about $160 a pound and have been used in some gourmet restaurants.

==== Beyond &quot;Tuber&quot; ====

The term &quot;truffle&quot; has been applied to several other genera of similar underground fungi. The genera &quot;Terfezia&quot; and &quot;Tirmania&quot; of the family Terfeziaceae are known as the &quot;desert truffles&quot; of Africa and the Middle East. &quot;Pisolithus tinctorius&quot;, which was historically eaten in parts of Germany, is sometimes called &quot;Bohemian truffle&quot;.

&quot;Geopora&quot; spp. are important ectomycorrhizal partners of trees in woodlands and forests throughout the world. &quot;Pinus edulis&quot;, a widespread pine species of the Southwest US, is dependent on &quot;Geopora&quot; for nutrient and water acquisition in arid environments. Like other truffle fungi, &quot;Geopora&quot; produces subterranean sporocarps as a means of sexual reproduction. &quot;Geopora cooperi&quot;, also known as pine truffle or fuzzy truffle, is an edible species of this genus.
&quot;Rhizopogon&quot; spp. are ectomycorrhizal members of the Basidiomycota and the order Boletales, a group of fungi that typically form mushrooms. Like their ascomycete counterparts, these fungi can create truffle-like fruiting bodies. &quot;Rhizopogon&quot; spp. are ecologically important in coniferous forests where they associate with various pines, firs, and Douglas fir. In addition to their ecological importance, these fungi hold economic value, as well. &quot;Rhizopogon&quot; spp. are commonly used to inoculate coniferous seedlings in nurseries and during reforestation.

&quot;Hysterangium&quot; spp. are ectomycorrhizal members of the Basidiomycota and the order Hysterangiales that form sporocarps similar to true truffles. These fungi form mycelial mats of vegetative hyphae that may cover 25–40% of the forest floor in Douglas fir forests, thereby contributing to a significant portion of the biomass present in soils. Like other ectomycorrhizal fungi, &quot;Hysterangium&quot; spp. play a role in nutrient exchange in the nitrogen cycle by accessing nitrogen unavailable to host plants and acting as nitrogen sinks in forests.

&quot;Glomus&quot; spp. are arbuscular mycorrhizae of the phylum Glomeromycota within the order Glomerales. Members of this genus have low host specificity, associating with a variety of plants including hardwoods, forbs, shrubs, and grasses. These fungi commonly occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere.

Members of the genus &quot;Elaphomyces&quot; are commonly mistaken for truffles.

=== Phylogeny ===

Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated the convergent evolution of the ectomycorrhizal trophic mode in diverse fungi. The subphylum Pezizomycotina, containing the order Pezizales, is approximately 400 million years old. Within the order Pezizales, subterranean fungi evolved independently at least fifteen times. Contained within Pezizales are the families Tuberaceae, Pezizaceae, Pyronematacae, and Morchellaceae. All of these families contain lineages of subterranean or truffle fungi.

The oldest ectomycorrhizal fossils are from the Eocene about 50 million years ago. The specimens are preserved permineralized in-situ in the Eocene Okanagan Highlands Princeton chert site. This indicates that the soft bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not easily fossilize. Molecular clockwork has suggested the evolution of ectomycorrhizal fungi occurred approximately 130 million years ago.

The evolution of subterranean fruiting bodies has occurred numerous times within the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota. For example, the genera &quot;Rhizopogon&quot; and &quot;Hysterangium&quot; of Basidiomycota both form subterranean fruiting bodies and play similar ecological roles as truffle forming ascomycetes. The ancestors of the Ascomycota genera &quot;Geopora&quot;, &quot;Tuber&quot;, and &quot;Leucangium&quot; originated in Laurasia during the Paleozoic era.

Phylogenetic evidence suggests that most subterranean fruiting bodies evolved from above-ground mushrooms. Over time mushroom stipes and caps were reduced, and caps began to enclose reproductive tissue. The dispersal of sexual spores then shifted from wind and rain to utilising animals.

The phylogeny and biogeography of the genus &quot;Tuber&quot; was investigated in 2008 using internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear DNA and revealed five major clades (Aestivum, Excavatum, Rufum, Melanosporum and Puberulum); this was later improved and expanded in 2010 to nine major clades using 28S large subunits (LSU) rRNA of mitochondrial DNA. The Magnatum and Macrosporum clades were distinguished as distinct from the Aestivum clade. The Gibbosum clade was resolved as distinct from all other clades, and the Spinoreticulatum clade was separated from the Rufum clade.

The truffle habit has evolved independently among several basidiomycete genera. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that basidiomycete subterranean fruiting bodies, like their ascomycete counterparts, evolved from above ground mushrooms. For example, &quot;Rhizopogon&quot; species likely arose from an ancestor shared with &quot;Suillus&quot;, a mushroom-forming genus. Studies have suggested that selection for subterranean fruiting bodies among ascomycetes and basidiomycetes occurred in water-limited environments.

=== Etymology ===
Most sources agree that the term &quot;truffle&quot; is derived from the Latin term by way of the Vulgar Latin , meaning &quot;swelling&quot; or &quot;lump&quot;. This then entered other languages through Old French dialects.

== Ecology ==
The mycelia of truffles form symbiotic, mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of several tree species, including beech, birch, hazel, hornbeam, oak, pine, and poplar. Mutualistic ectomycorrhizal fungi such as truffles provide valuable nutrients to plants in exchange for carbohydrates. Ectomycorrhizal fungi cannot survive in the soil without their plant hosts. In fact, many of these fungi have lost the enzymes necessary for obtaining carbon through other means. For example, truffle fungi have lost their ability to degrade the cell walls of plants, limiting their capacity to decompose plant litter. Plant hosts can also depend on their associated truffle fungi. &quot;Geopora&quot;, &quot;Peziza&quot;, and &quot;Tuber&quot; spp. are vital in the establishment of oak communities.

&quot;Tuber&quot; species prefer argillaceous or calcareous soils that are well drained and neutral or alkaline. &quot;Tuber&quot; truffles fruit throughout the year, depending on the species, and can be found buried between the leaf litter and the soil. Most fungal biomass is found in the humus and litter layers of soil.
Most truffle fungi produce both asexual spores (mitospores or conidia) and sexual spores (meiospores or ascospores/basidiospores). Conidia can be produced more readily and with less energy than ascospores and can disperse during disturbance events. Production of ascospores is energy intensive because the fungus must allocate resources to the production of large sporocarps. Ascospores are borne within sac-like structures called asci, which are contained within the sporocarp.

Because truffle fungi produce their sexual fruiting bodies underground, spores cannot be spread by wind and water. Therefore, nearly all truffles depend on mycophagous animal vectors for spore dispersal. This is analogous to the dispersal of seeds in fruit of angiosperms. When the ascospores are fully developed, the truffle exudes volatile compounds that attract animal vectors. For successful dispersal, these spores must survive passage through the digestive tracts of animals. Ascospores have thick walls composed of chitin to help them endure the environment of animal guts.

Animal vectors include birds, deer, and rodents such as voles, squirrels, and chipmunks. Many species of trees, such as &quot;Quercus garryana&quot;, are dependent on the dispersal of sporocarps to inoculate isolated individuals. For example, the acorns of &quot;Q. garryana&quot; may be carried to new territory that lacks the necessary mycorrhizal fungi for establishment.

Some mycophagous animals depend on truffles as their dominant food source. Flying squirrels, &quot;Glaucomys sabrinus&quot;, of North America play a three-way symbiosis with truffles and their associated plants. &quot;G. sabrinus&quot; is particularly adapted to finding truffles using its refined sense of smell, visual clues, and long-term memory of prosperous populations of truffles. This intimacy between animals and truffles indirectly influences the success of mycorrhizal plant species.

After ascospores are dispersed, they remain dormant until germination is initiated by exudates excreted from host plant roots. Following germination, hyphae form and seek out the roots of host plants. Arriving at roots, hyphae begin to form a mantle or sheath on the outer surface of root tips. Hyphae then enter the root cortex intercellularly to form the Hartig net for nutrient exchange. Hyphae can spread to other root tips colonising the entire root system of the host. Over time, the truffle fungus accumulates sufficient resources to form fruiting bodies. Rate of growth is correlated with increasing photosynthetic rates in the spring as trees leaf out.

=== Nutrient exchange ===
Truffle fungi receive carbohydrates from their host plants, providing them with valuable micro- and macronutrients. Plant macronutrients include potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur. In contrast, micronutrients include iron, copper, zinc, and chloride. In truffle fungi, as in all ectomycorrhizae, the majority of nutrient exchange occurs in the Hartig net, the intercellular hyphal network between plant root cells. A unique feature of ectomycorrhizal fungi is the formation of the mantle on the outer surface of fine roots.

Truffles have been suggested to co-locate with the orchid species &quot;Epipactis helleborine&quot; and &quot;Cephalanthera damasonium&quot;, though this is not always the case.

=== Nutrient cycling ===
Truffle fungi are ecologically important in nutrient cycling. Plants obtain nutrients via their fine roots. Mycorrhizal fungi are much smaller than fine roots, so they have a higher surface area and a greater ability to explore soils for nutrients. Acquisition of nutrients includes the uptake of phosphorus, nitrate or ammonium, iron, magnesium, and other ions. Many ectomycorrhizal fungi form fungal mats in the upper layers of soils surrounding host plants. These mats have significantly higher carbon and fixed nitrogen concentrations than surrounding soils. Because these mats are nitrogen sinks, leaching of nutrients is reduced.

Mycelial mats can also help maintain the structure of soils by holding organic matter in place and preventing erosion. Often, these networks of mycelium provide support for smaller organisms in the soil, such as bacteria and microscopic arthropods. Bacteria feed on the exudates released by mycelium and colonise the soil surrounding them. Microscopic arthropods such as mites feed directly on mycelium and release valuable nutrients for the uptake of other organisms. Thus, truffle fungi and other ectomycorrhizal fungi facilitate a complex system of nutrient exchange between plants, animals, and microbes.

=== Importance in arid-land ecosystems ===
Plant community structure is often affected by the availability of compatible mycorrhizal fungi. In arid-land ecosystems, these fungi become essential for the survival of their host plants by enhancing the ability to withstand drought. A foundation species in arid-land ecosystems of the Southwest United States is &quot;Pinus edulis&quot;, commonly known as pinyon pine. &quot;P. edulis&quot; associates with the subterranean fungi &quot;Geopora&quot; and &quot;Rhizopogon&quot;.

As global temperatures rise, so does the occurrence of severe droughts, detrimentally affecting the survival of aridland plants. This variability in climate has increased the mortality of &quot;P. edulis&quot;. Therefore, the availability of compatible mycorrhizal inoculum can greatly affect the successful establishment of &quot;P. edulis&quot; seedlings. Associated ectomycorrhizal fungi will likely play a significant role in the survival of &quot;P. edulis&quot; with continuing global climate change.

== Extraction ==

Because truffles are subterranean, they are often located with the help of an animal (sometimes called a truffler) possessing a refined sense of smell. Traditionally, pigs have been used to extract truffles. Both the female pig&#x27;s natural truffle-seeking and her intent to eat the truffle were thought to be due to a compound within the truffle similar to androstenol, the sex pheromone of boar saliva, to which the sow is keenly attracted. Studies in 1990 demonstrated that the compound actively recognised by both truffle pigs and dogs is dimethyl sulfide.

In Italy, the use of pigs to hunt truffles has been prohibited since 1985 because of damage caused by animals to truffle mycelia during the digging that dropped the production rate of the area for some years. An alternative to truffle pigs are dogs. Dogs offer an advantage because they do not have a strong desire to eat truffles, so they can be trained to locate sporocarps without digging them up. Pigs attempt to dig up truffles.

Fly species of the genus &quot;Suillia&quot; can also detect the volatile compounds associated with subterranean fruiting bodies. These flies lay their eggs above truffles to provide food for their young. At ground level, &quot;Suilla&quot; flies can be seen flying above truffles.

== Volatile constituents ==
The mycelia or fruiting bodies release the volatile constituents responsible for the natural aroma of truffles or derive from truffle-associated microbes. The chemical ecology of truffle volatiles is complex, interacting with plants, insects, and mammals, which contribute to spore dispersal. Depending on the truffle species, lifecycle, or location, they include:
* Sulfur volatiles, which occur in all truffle species, such as dimethyl mono- (DMS), di- (DMDS) and tri- (DMTS) sulfides, as well as 2-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiophene, characteristic of the white truffle &quot;T. borchii&quot; and 2,4-Dithiapentane occurring in all species but mostly characteristic of the white truffle &quot;T. magnatum&quot;. Some very aromatic white truffles are notably pungent, even irritating the eye when cut or sliced.
* Metabolites of nonsulfur amino acid constituents (simple and branched-chain hydrocarbons) such as ethylene (produced by mycelia of white truffles affecting root architecture of host tree), as well as 2-methylbutanal, 2-methylpropanal, and 2-phenylethanol (also common in baker&#x27;s yeast).
* Fatty acid-derived volatiles (C8-alcohols and aldehydes with a characteristic fungal odor, such as 1-octen-3-ol and 2-octenal). The former is derived from linoleic acid and produced by mature white truffle &quot;T. borchii&quot;.
* Thiophene derivatives appear to be produced by bacterial symbionts living in the truffle body. The most abundant of these, 3-methyl, 4-5 dihydrothiophene, contributes to the white truffle&#x27;s aroma.
Several truffle species and varieties are differentiated based on their relative contents or absence of sulfides, ethers or alcohols, respectively. The sweaty-musky aroma of truffles is similar to that of the pheromone androstenol that also occurs in humans. , the volatile profiles of seven black and six white truffle species have been studied.

== Cultivation ==

Truffles long eluded techniques of cultivation, as Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1825) noted:

The most learned men have sought to ascertain the secret and fancied they discovered the seed. Their promises, however, were vain, and no planting was ever followed by a harvest. This perhaps is all right, for as one of the great values of truffles is their dearness, perhaps they would be less highly esteemed if they were cheaper.

Truffles can be cultivated. As early as 1808, attempts to cultivate truffles, known in French as , were successful. People had long observed that truffles were growing among the roots of certain trees, and in 1808, Joseph Talon, from Apt ( of Vaucluse) in southern France, had the idea of transplanting some seedlings that he had collected at the foot of oak trees known to host truffles in their root system.

For discovering how to cultivate truffles, some sources now give priority to Pierre II Mauléon (1744–1831) of Loudun (in western France), who began to cultivate truffles around 1790. Mauléon saw an &quot;obvious symbiosis&quot; between the oak tree, the rocky soil, and the truffle and attempted to reproduce such an environment by taking acorns from trees known to have produced truffles and sowing them in chalky soil. His experiment was successful, with truffles found in the soil around the newly grown oak trees years later. In 1847, Auguste Rousseau of Carpentras (in Vaucluse) planted of oak trees (again from acorns found on the soil around truffle-producing oak trees), and he subsequently obtained large harvests of truffles. He received a prize at the 1855 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris.
Others imitated these successful attempts in France and Italy. In the late 19th century, an epidemic of phylloxera destroyed many of the vineyards in southern France. Another epidemic killed most of the silkworms there, too, making the fields of mulberry trees useless. Trufficulture became an important source of income for those affected. The calcareous and exposed vineyard soils were well-suited to the cultivation of truffles. By 1890, truffières (truffle plantations) covered 750 km2 of land in France, and 2,000 tonnes of truffles were produced in that year.

From the 19th century to the present, truffle production fell by 97–99% to 20–50 tonnes annually. Reasons given for this decline include the Industrial Revolution, the subsequent rural flight and the multiple European wars of the 20th century, which reduced the rural population. For example, World War I resulted in the mobilisation of 65% of the agricultural workers from the region of Lot alone. Knowledge of truffle cultivation, the soil and the seasons was lost along with the people. Another consequence was no more grazing sheep or shepherds who pruned trees for feed and fuelwood, so former truffle plantations turned into closed forests that no longer produced truffles. Truffles were once sold at weekly markets (bi-weekly in the case of a market in Martel, Lot) and in quantities of two to six tonnes in good weeks, but only Lalbenque and Limogne today have weekly truffle markets. Prices have increased so that truffles, once seen as a food of the middle class, have become a luxury.

The situation changed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with researchers in France and Italy establishing mycorrhizas with truffle spores. Beginning from the 1980s, truffle plantations are compensating for some of the decline in wild truffles, and exist in various countries including France, Italy, Spain and Australia. About 80% of the truffles now produced in France come from specially planted truffle groves. Investments in cultivated plantations are underway in many parts of the world using controlled irrigation for regular and resilient production.

A critical phase of the cultivation is the quality control of the mycorrhizal plants. Between 7 and 10 years are needed for the truffles to develop their mycorrhizal network, and only after that do the host plants come into production. Complete soil analysis to avoid contamination by other dominant fungi and very strict control of the formation of mycorrhizae are necessary to ensure the success of a plantation. Total investment per hectare for an irrigated and barrier-sealed plantation (against wild boars) can cost up to €10,000. Considering the level of initial investment and the maturity delay, farmers who have not taken care of both soil conditions and seedling conditions are at high risk of failure.

=== New Zealand and Australia ===
The first black truffles (&quot;Tuber melanosporum&quot;) to be produced in the Southern Hemisphere were harvested in Gisborne, New Zealand in 1993.

New Zealand&#x27;s first burgundy truffle was found in July 2012 at a Waipara truffle farm. It weighed 330 g and was found by the farm owner&#x27;s beagle.

In 1999, the first Australian truffles were harvested in Tasmania, the result of eight years of work. Trees were inoculated with the truffle fungus to create a local truffle industry. Their success and the value of the resulting truffles has encouraged a small industry to develop.

Truffle production has expanded into the colder regions of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. In 2014, over of truffles were harvested by Truffle Hill, Manjimup, Western Australia.

In June 2014, a grower harvested Australia&#x27;s largest truffle from their property at Robertson, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. It was a French black périgord fungus weighing in at and was valued at over $2,000 per kilogram.

=== United States ===

Périgord truffles were first farmed in Tennessee in 2007. At its peak in the 2008–2009 season, one farm produced about 200 pounds of truffles, but Eastern filbert blight almost entirely wiped out the hazel trees by 2013 and production dropped, essentially ending the business. Eastern filbert blight similarly destroyed the orchards of other once-promising commercial farms in East Tennessee, while newer farms in California, North Carolina, Oregon, and Arkansas were started. , the Appalachian truffle (&quot;Tuber canaliculatum&quot;) was being developed as a potential market.

== Uses ==

Because of their high price and their strong aroma, truffles are used sparingly. Supplies can be found commercially as unadulterated fresh produce or preserved, typically in a light brine.

Their chemical compounds infuse well with fats such as butter, cream, cheeses, avocados, and coconut cream.

As the volatile aromas dissipate quicker when heated, truffles are generally served raw and shaved over warm, simple foods which highlight their flavour, such as buttered pasta or eggs. Thin truffle slices may be inserted into meats, under the skins of roasted fowl, in &quot;foie gras&quot; preparations, in &quot;pâtés&quot;, or in stuffings. Some speciality cheeses contain truffles, as well. Truffles are also used for producing truffle salt and truffle honey.

While chefs once peeled truffles, in modern times, most restaurants brush the truffle carefully and shave it or dice it with the skin on to make the most of the valuable ingredient. Some restaurants stamp out circular discs of truffle flesh and use the skins for sauces.
=== Oil ===
Truffle oil is used as a lower-cost and convenient substitute for truffles, to provide flavouring, or to enhance the flavour and aroma of truffles in cooking. Some products called &quot;truffle oils&quot; contain no truffles or include pieces of inexpensive, unprized truffle varietals, which have no culinary value, simply for show. The vast majority is oil that has been artificially flavoured using a synthetic agent such as 2,4-dithiapentane.

The scientific name is included on the ingredient list of truffle oils infused with natural truffles.

=== Vodka ===
Because more aromatic molecules in truffles are soluble in alcohol, they can carry a more complex and accurate truffle flavour than oil without synthetic flavourings. Many commercial producers use 2,4-dithiapentane regardless, as it has become the dominant flavour most consumers, unexposed to fresh truffles but familiar with oils, associate with them. Because most Western nations do not have ingredient labelling requirements for spirits, consumers often do not know if artificial flavourings have been used. It is used as a spirit in its own right, a cocktail mix or a food flavouring.

== Cultural history ==

=== Antiquity ===
The first mention of truffles appears in the inscriptions of the neo-Sumerians regarding their Amorite enemy&#x27;s eating habits (Third Dynasty of Ur, 2nd century BCE) and later in writings of Theophrastus in the 4th century BCE. In classical times, their origins were a mystery that challenged many; Plutarch and others thought them to be the result of lightning, warmth, and water in the soil, while Juvenal thought thunder and rain to be instrumental in their origin. Cicero deemed them children of the earth, while Dioscorides thought they were tuberous roots.

Rome and Thracia in the Classical period identified three kinds of truffles: &quot;Tuber melanosporum&quot;, &quot;T. magnificus&quot;, and &quot;T. magnatum&quot;. The Romans instead used a variety of fungus called terfez, also sometimes called a &quot;desert truffle&quot;. Terfez used in Rome came from Lesbos, Carthage, and especially Libya, where the coastal climate was less dry in ancient times. Their substance is pale, tinged with rose. Unlike truffles, terfez have little inherent flavour. The Romans used the terfez as a flavour carrier because the terfez tends to absorb surrounding flavours. Because Ancient Roman cuisine used many spices and flavourings, the terfez may have been appropriate in that context.

=== Middle Ages ===
Truffles were rarely used during the Middle Ages. Truffle hunting is mentioned by Bartolomeo Platina, the papal historian, in 1481, when he recorded that the sows of Notza were without equal in hunting truffles, but they should be muzzled to prevent them from eating the prize.

=== Renaissance and modernity ===
During the Renaissance, truffles regained popularity in Europe and were honoured at the court of King Francis I of France. They were popular in Parisian markets in the 1780s, imported seasonally from truffle grounds, where peasants had long enjoyed them. Brillat-Savarin (1825) noted that they were so expensive they appeared only at the dinner tables of great nobles and kept women. They were sometimes served with turkey.

<doc id="291698" wikidata="Q43736" url="?curid=291698" title="Yasunari Kawabata">
<text>was a Japanese novelist and short story writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly-shaded prose works won him the 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature, the first Japanese author to receive the award. His works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read.

==Early life==

Born into a well-established family in Osaka, Japan, Kawabata was orphaned by the time he was four, after which he lived with his grandparents. He had an older sister who was taken in by an aunt, and whom he met only once thereafter, in July 1909, when he was ten. She died when Kawabata was 11. Kawabata&#x27;s grandmother died in September 1906, when he was seven, and his grandfather in May 1914, when he was fifteen.

Having lost all close paternal relatives, Kawabata moved in with his mother&#x27;s family, the Kurodas. However, in January 1916, he moved into a boarding house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) to which he had formerly commuted by train. After graduating in March 1917, Kawabata moved to Tokyo just before his 18th birthday. He hoped to pass the exams for &quot;Dai-ichi Kōtō-gakkō&quot; (First Upper School), which was under the direction of the Tokyo Imperial University. He succeeded in the exam the same year and entered the Humanities Faculty as an English major in July 1920. The young Kawabata, by this time, was enamoured of the works of another Asian Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore.

One of Kawabata&#x27;s painful love episodes was with , whom he met when he was 20 years old. They were engaged to be married in 1921, but only one month later Hatsuyo broke off the engagement for unclear reasons. Kawabata never completely recovered from the blow of losing her. Hatsuyo may have been the inspiration for some of his works, including the novella &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; and several &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot;. She died following complications from a stroke in 1951, aged 44, but Kawabata was not informed of her death until 1955. An unsent love letter to her was found at his former residence in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, in 2014. 

While still a university student, Kawabata re-established the Tokyo University literary magazine &quot;Shin-shichō&quot; (&quot;New Tide of Thought&quot;), which had been defunct for more than four years. There he published his first short story, &quot;Shokonsai ikkei&quot; (&quot;A View from Yasukuni Festival&quot;) in 1921. During university, he changed faculties to Japanese literature and wrote a graduation thesis titled &quot;A short history of Japanese novels&quot;. He graduated from university in March 1924, by which time he had already caught the attention of Kikuchi Kan and other noted writers and editors through his submissions to Kikuchi&#x27;s literary magazine, the &quot;Bungei Shunju&quot;.

==New writing movement==
In October 1924, Kawabata, Riichi Yokomitsu and other young writers started a new literary journal &quot;Bungei Jidai&quot; (&quot;The Artistic Age&quot;). This journal was a reaction to the entrenched old school of Japanese literature, specifically the Japanese movement descended from Naturalism, while it also stood in opposition to the &quot;workers&#x27;&quot; or proletarian literature movement of the Socialist/Communist schools. It was an &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles. The term &quot;Shinkankakuha&quot;, which Kawabata and Yokomitsu used to describe their philosophy, has often been mistakenly translated into English as &quot;Neo-Impressionism&quot;. However, &quot;Shinkankakuha&quot; was not meant to be an updated or restored version of Impressionism; it focused on offering &quot;new impressions&quot; or, more accurately, &quot;new sensations&quot; or &quot;new perceptions&quot; in the writing of literature. An early example from this period is the draft of &quot;Hoshi wo nusunda chichi&quot; (The Father who stole a Star), an adaption of Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s play &quot;Liliom&quot;.

==Career==

Kawabata started to achieve recognition for a number of his short stories shortly after he graduated, receiving acclaim for &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; in 1926, a story about a melancholy student who, on a walking trip down Izu Peninsula, meets a young dancer, and returns to Tokyo in much improved spirits. The work explores the dawning eroticism of young love but includes shades of melancholy and even bitterness, which offset what might have otherwise been an overly sweet story. Most of his subsequent works explored similar themes.

In the 1920s, Kawabata was living in the plebeian district of Asakusa, Tokyo. During this period, Kawabata experimented with different styles of writing. In &quot;Asakusa kurenaidan&quot; (&quot;The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa&quot;), serialized from 1929 to 1930, he explores the lives of the demimonde and others on the fringe of society, in a style echoing that of late Edo period literature. On the other hand, his is pure stream-of-consciousness writing. He was even involved in writing the script for the experimental film &quot;A Page of Madness&quot;.

Kawabata met his wife Hideko (née Matsubayashi) in 1925, and they registered their marriage on 2 December 1931.

In 1933, Kawabata protested publicly against the arrest, torture and death of the young leftist writer Takiji Kobayashi in Tokyo by the Tokkō special political police.

Kawabata relocated from Asakusa to Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1934 and, although he initially enjoyed a very active social life among the many other writers and literary people residing in that city during the war years and immediately thereafter, in his later years he became very reclusive.

One of his most famous novels was &quot;Snow Country&quot;, started in 1934 and first published in installments from 1935 through 1937. &quot;Snow Country&quot; is a stark tale of a love affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a provincial geisha, which takes place in a remote hot-spring town somewhere in the mountainous regions of northern Japan. It established Kawabata as one of Japan&#x27;s foremost authors and became an instant classic, described by Edward G. Seidensticker as &quot;perhaps Kawabata&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;.

After the end of World War II, Kawabata&#x27;s success continued with novels such as &quot;Thousand Cranes&quot; (a story of ill-fated love), &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot;, &quot;The House of the Sleeping Beauties&quot;, &quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot;, and &quot;The Old Capital&quot;.

&quot;Thousand Cranes&quot; (serialized 1949-1951) is centered on the Japanese tea ceremony and hopeless love. The protagonist is attracted to the mistress of his dead father and, after her death, to her daughter, who flees from him. The tea ceremony provides a beautiful background for ugly human affairs, but Kawabata&#x27;s intent is rather to explore feelings about death. The tea ceremony utensils are permanent and forever, whereas people are frail and fleeting. These themes of impossible love and impending death are again explored in &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; (serialized 1949-1954), set in Kawabata&#x27;s adopted home of Kamakura. The protagonist, an aging man, has become disappointed with his children and no longer feels strong passion for his wife. He is strongly attracted to someone forbidden – his daughter-in-law – and his thoughts for her are interspersed with memories of another forbidden love, for his dead sister-in-law.

The book that Kawabata himself considered his finest work, &quot;The Master of Go&quot; (1951), contrasts sharply with his other works. It is a semi-fictional recounting of a major Go match in 1938, on which he had actually reported for the &quot;Mainichi&quot; newspaper chain. It was the last game of master Shūsai&#x27;s career and he lost to his younger challenger, Minoru Kitani, only to die a little over a year later. Although the novel is moving on the surface as a retelling of a climactic struggle, some readers consider it a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II.

Through many of Kawabata&#x27;s works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: &quot;I feel as though I have never held a woman&#x27;s hand in a romantic sense [...] Am I a happy man deserving of pity?”. Indeed, this does not have to be taken literally, but it does show the type of emotional insecurity that Kawabata felt, especially experiencing two painful love affairs at a young age. 

Kawabata left many of his stories apparently unfinished, sometimes to the annoyance of readers and reviewers, but this goes hand to hand with his aesthetics of art for art&#x27;s sake, leaving outside any sentimentalism, or morality, that an ending would give to any book. This was done intentionally, as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were far more important than conclusions. He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan, the haiku.

In addition to fictional writing, Kawabata also worked as a reporter, most notably for the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;. Although he refused to participate in the militaristic fervor that accompanied World War II, he also demonstrated little interest in postwar political reforms. Along with the death of all his family members while he was young, Kawabata suggested that the war was one of the greatest influences on his work, stating he would be able to write only elegies in postwar Japan. Still, many commentators detect little thematic change between Kawabata&#x27;s prewar and postwar writings.

==Awards==
As the president of Japanese P.E.N. for many years after the war (1948–1965), Kawabata was a driving force behind the translation of Japanese literature into English and other Western languages. He was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt in 1959, appointed an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters of France in 1960, and awarded Japan&#x27;s Order of Culture the following year. In 1969, Kawabata was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Hawaiʻi.

==Nobel Prize==

Kawabata was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on 16 October 1968, the first Japanese person to receive such a distinction. In awarding the prize &quot;for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind&quot;, the Nobel Committee cited three of his novels, &quot;Snow Country&quot;, &quot;Thousand Cranes&quot;, and &quot;The Old Capital&quot;.

Kawabata&#x27;s Nobel Lecture was titled . Zen Buddhism was a key focal point of the speech; much was devoted to practitioners and the general practices of Zen Buddhism and how it differed from other types of Buddhism. He presented a severe picture of Zen Buddhism, where disciples can enter salvation only through their efforts, where they are isolated for several hours at a time, and how from this isolation there can come beauty. He noted that Zen practices focus on simplicity and it is this simplicity that proves to be the beauty. &quot;The heart of the ink painting is in space, abbreviation, what is left undrawn.&quot; From painting he moved on to talk about ikebana and bonsai as art forms that emphasize the elegance and beauty that arises from the simplicity. &quot;The Japanese garden, too, of course symbolizes the vastness of nature.&quot;

In addition to the numerous mentions of Zen and nature, one topic that was briefly mentioned in Kawabata&#x27;s lecture was that of suicide. Kawabata reminisced of other famous Japanese authors who committed suicide, in particular Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. He contradicted the custom of suicide as being a form of enlightenment, mentioning the priest Ikkyū, who also thought of suicide twice. He quoted Ikkyū, &quot;Among those who give thoughts to things, is there one who does not think of suicide?&quot; There was much speculation about this quote being a clue to Kawabata&#x27;s suicide in 1972, a year and a half after Mishima had committed suicide.

==Death==
Kawabata apparently committed suicide in 1972 by gassing himself, but several close associates and friends, including his widow, consider his death to have been accidental. One thesis, as advanced by Donald Richie, was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath. Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself, among them poor health (the discovery he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease), a possible illicit love affair, or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970. Unlike Mishima, Kawabata left no note, and since (again unlike Mishima) he had not discussed significantly in his writings the topic of taking his own life, his motives remain unclear. However, his Japanese biographer, Takeo Okuno, has related how he had nightmares about Mishima for two or three hundred nights in a row, and was incessantly haunted by the specter of Mishima. In a persistently depressed state of mind, he would tell friends during his last years that sometimes, when on a journey, he hoped his plane would crash.

==Selected works==
Kawabata&#x27;s works have been translated into languages such as English, French, German, and Turkish, Korean.

<text>To the Extreme is the major-label debut studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice, released on September 10, 1990, by SBK Records and EMI Records. Recorded between 1989–90, it contains Vanilla Ice&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;. It primarily contains hip hop and pop rap tracks produced by Earthquake, Kim Sharp, Khayree, and Darryl Williams.

Following the release of an early version of the album titled &quot;Hooked&quot; by Ichiban Records, Ice was signed by SBK for $325,000 and the mixtape was re-recorded and repackaged. It was supported by the release of three official singles: &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; and &quot;I Love You&quot;. 

The album was met with lukewarm reviews, with some critics praising Ice&#x27;s abilities and showmanship, and others the simplistic lyrics and comparisons with fellow rapper MC Hammer. The album sparked controversy due to the unlicensed samples included on the album, including &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by David Bowie and Queen that was later settled out of court. 

Despite this, &quot;To the Extreme&quot; appeared at the top of the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; albums chart for sixteen consecutive weeks and was certified seven times platinum by RIAA. The lead single &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was the first rap single to top the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;. The album was certified platinum in Canada, Australia and United Kingdom selling over 15 million copies in total. Ice was selected as the opening act of MC Hammer&#x27;s 1990 tour, and later embarked on his To the Extreme World Tour, performing in North America, Europe, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Japan in 1991, and in Latin America in 1992.

==History==

In early 1990, Vanilla Ice released an early version of &quot;To the Extreme&quot; under the title &quot;Hooked&quot; on the independent label Ichiban Records. &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, with &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; appearing as the B-side. The 12-inch single featured the radio, instrumental and a cappella versions of &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; and the radio version and &quot;Miami Drop&quot; remix of &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;. When a disc jockey played &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; instead of the single&#x27;s A-side, the song gained more success than &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;. A music video for &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was produced for $8,000. The video was financed by Vanilla Ice&#x27;s manager, Tommy Quon, and shot on the roof of a warehouse in Dallas, Texas.

In 1990, Vanilla Ice signed to SBK Records, who reissued &quot;Hooked&quot; under the title &quot;To the Extreme&quot;. The reissue contained new artwork and music. &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was released in August 1990 as a single in its own right, by SBK in the United States, and EMI Records in the United Kingdom. The SBK single contained the &quot;Miami Drop&quot;, instrumental and radio mixes of &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; and the album version of &quot;It&#x27;s A Party&quot;. The EMI single contained the club and radio mixes of the song, and the shortened radio edit.

== Music ==
Vanilla Ice wrote &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; at the age of 16, basing its lyrics upon the South Florida area in which he was raised. The lyrics describe a drive-by shooting and Vanilla Ice&#x27;s rhyming skills. The chorus of &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; originates from the signature chant of the national African American fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha. The song&#x27;s hook samples the bassline of the 1981 song &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by Queen and David Bowie. Freddie Mercury and David Bowie did not receive credit or royalties for the sample. In a 1990 interview, Vanilla Ice joked the two melodies were slightly different because he had added an additional note. Vanilla Ice later paid Mercury and Bowie, who have since been given songwriting credit for the sample. However, he ended up purchasing the rights to the song, because it was cheaper than licensing the sample.

The stylistic origins of &quot;Rosta Man&quot; are based upon reggae toasting.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Dom Lombardo gave the album a B, calling the album &quot;so consistent in its borrowings that it could be a parody, if it weren&#x27;t for its total absence of wit&quot;, but concluding that &quot;if there&#x27;s about a two-to-one ratio of winners [...] to clunkers, that&#x27;s not the worst track record for a debut album.&quot; Udovitch cited &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;, &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Party&quot; as the album&#x27;s highlights. Robert Christgau gave the album a C− rating, writing that Vanilla Ice&#x27;s &quot;suave sexism, fashionably male supremacist rather than dangerously obscene, is no worse than his suave beats&quot;. Stephen Dalton from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;To the Extreme&quot; is the highly competent debut from a major pop talent. Listen without prejudice.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; stated that the album &quot;packs in just about every musical and lyrical code of rap, yet still says nothing&quot; and that &quot;Kids and neophytes have a right to love it, but grown-ups will find Vanilla Ice spectacularly hollow.&quot;

AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote that:
Ice&#x27;s mic technique is actually stronger and more nimble than MC Hammer&#x27;s, and he really tries earnestly to show off the skills he does have. Unfortunately, even if he can keep a mid-tempo pace, his flow is rhythmically stiff, and his voice has an odd timbre; plus, he never seems sure of the proper accent to adopt. He&#x27;s able to overcome those flaws somewhat in isolated moments, but they become all too apparent over the course of an entire album.

After audiences began to view Vanilla Ice as a novelty act, his popularity began to decline. He would later regain some success, attracting a new audience outside of the mainstream audience that had formerly accepted him, and then rejected him.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;To the Extreme&quot; was released in the US on September 10, 1990. On the issue of October 31, 1990 the album jumped from 23 to 7 on the US Billboard 200 selling over two million copies in its first five weeks of being released. The album reached the number one spot on the week of November 10, 1990 ending a 23-week run by M.C. Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot; and it stayed at the top for sixteen consecutive weeks. At the time, To the Extreme was named the fastest debut album of all time selling over 6 million on 14 weeks. In the same month, was certified gold, platinum, double-platinum, triple-platinum and quadruple-platinum in the next day, becoming one of the fastest-certified &quot;albums&quot; in history. 

By January 1991, it was the fastest selling album since &quot;Purple Rain (1984)&quot; reaching six million copies sold in just three months and four days. Eventually, seven million copies were shipped across the United States. 

By March 1991, the album was closing in on 10.5 million units worldwide, just six months from being released. &quot;To the Extreme&quot; was the best selling hip hop album up until that time. &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; has been credited for helping diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream, white audience.

In Canada, the album peaked at the number one and was certified 6 times platinum and won the Best Selling Album by a Foreign Artist at To the Extreme at the 1992 June Awards.

==Track listing==
The first version was released in 1989 by the independent record label Ichiban Records under the title &quot;Hooked&quot;. Vanilla Ice eventually signed to SBK Records, who reissued the album under its current name, &quot;To the Extreme&quot;, with some differences in the track list. &quot;To the Extreme&quot; contains all tracks from &quot;Hooked&quot; except for &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, and six extra tracks: &quot;Yo Vanilla&quot;, &quot;Stop That Train&quot;, &quot;Ice Is Workin&#x27; It&quot;, &quot;Life Is a Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Juice to Get Loose Boy&quot;. &quot;Havin&#x27; a Roni&quot; was a hidden track on &quot;Hooked&quot;.

<doc id="291706" wikidata="Q1129003" url="?curid=291706" title="Continuous wave">
<text>A continuous wave or continuous waveform (CW) is an electromagnetic wave of constant amplitude and frequency, typically a sine wave, that for mathematical analysis is considered to be of infinite duration. It may refer to e.g. a laser or particle accelerator having a continuous output, as opposed to a pulsed output.

By extension, the term &quot;continuous wave&quot; also refers to an early method of radio transmission in which a sinusoidal carrier wave is switched on and off. This is more precisely called interrupted continuous wave (ICW). Information is carried in the varying duration of the on and off periods of the signal, for example by Morse code in early radio. In early wireless telegraphy radio transmission, CW waves were also known as &quot;undamped waves&quot;, to distinguish this method from damped wave signals produced by earlier &quot;spark gap&quot; type transmitters.

== Radio ==

===Transmissions before CW===
Very early radio transmitters used a spark gap to produce radio-frequency oscillations in the transmitting antenna. The signals produced by these spark-gap transmitters consisted of strings of brief pulses of sinusoidal radio frequency oscillations which died out rapidly to zero, called damped waves. The disadvantage of damped waves was that their energy was spread over an extremely wide band of frequencies; they had wide bandwidth. As a result, they produced electromagnetic interference (RFI) that spread over the transmissions of stations at other frequencies.

This motivated efforts to produce radio frequency oscillations that decayed more slowly; had less damping. There is an inverse relation between the rate of decay (the time constant) of a damped wave and its bandwidth; the longer the damped waves take to decay toward zero, the narrower the frequency band the radio signal occupies, so the less it interferes with other transmissions. As more transmitters began crowding the radio spectrum, reducing the frequency spacing between transmissions, government regulations began to limit the maximum damping or &quot;decrement&quot; a radio transmitter could have. Manufacturers produced spark transmitters which generated long &quot;ringing&quot; waves with minimal damping.

===Transition to CW===
It was realized that the ideal radio wave for radiotelegraphic communication would be a sine wave with zero damping, a &quot;continuous wave&quot;. An unbroken continuous sine wave theoretically has no bandwidth; all its energy is concentrated at a single frequency, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with transmissions on other frequencies. Continuous waves could not be produced with an electric spark, but were achieved with the vacuum tube electronic oscillator, invented around 1913 by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner. After World War I, transmitters capable of producing continuous wave, the Alexanderson alternator and vacuum tube oscillators, became widely available.

Damped wave spark transmitters were replaced by continuous wave vacuum tube transmitters around 1920, and damped wave transmissions were finally outlawed in 1934.

===Key clicks===
In order to transmit information, the continuous wave must be turned off and on with a telegraph key to produce the different length pulses, &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot;, that spell out text messages in Morse code, so a &quot;continuous wave&quot; radiotelegraphy signal consists of pulses of sine waves with a constant amplitude interspersed with gaps of no signal.

In on-off carrier keying, if the carrier wave is turned on or off abruptly, communications theory can show that the bandwidth will be large; if the carrier turns on and off more gradually, the bandwidth will be smaller. The bandwidth of an on-off keyed signal is related to the data transmission rate as:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the necessary bandwidth in hertz,
formula_3 is the keying rate in signal changes per second (baud rate),
and formula_4 is a constant related to the expected radio propagation conditions; K=1 is difficult for a human ear to decode, K=3 or K=5 is used when fading or multipath propagation is expected.

The spurious noise emitted by a transmitter which abruptly switches a carrier on and off is called &quot;key clicks&quot;. The noise occurs in the part of the signal bandwidth further above and below the carrier than required for normal, less abrupt switching. The solution to the problem for CW is to make the transition between on and off to be more gradual, making the edges of pulses &quot;soft&quot;, appearing more rounded, or to use other modulation methods (e.g. phase modulation). Certain types of power amplifiers used in transmission may aggravate the effect of key clicks.

===Persistence of radio telegraphy===

Early radio transmitters could not be modulated to transmit speech, and so CW radio telegraphy was the only form of communication available. CW still remains a viable form of radio communication many years after voice transmission was perfected, because simple, robust transmitters can be used, and because its signals are the simplest of the forms of modulation able to penetrate interference. The low bandwidth of the code signal, due in part to low information transmission rate, allows very selective filters to be used in the receiver, which block out much of the radio noise that would otherwise reduce the intelligibility of the signal.

Continuous-wave radio was called radiotelegraphy because like the telegraph, it worked by means of a simple switch to transmit Morse code. However, instead of controlling the electricity in a cross-country wire, the switch controlled the power sent to a radio transmitter. This mode is still in common use by amateur radio operators due to its narrow bandwidth and high signal-to-noise ratio compared to other modes of communication.

In military communications and amateur radio the terms &quot;CW&quot; and &quot;Morse code&quot; are often used interchangeably, despite the distinctions between the two. Aside from radio signals, Morse code may be sent using direct current in wires, sound, or light, for example. For radio signals, a carrier wave is keyed on and off to represent the dots and dashes of the code elements. The carrier&#x27;s amplitude and frequency remain constant during each code element. At the receiver, the received signal is mixed with a heterodyne signal from a BFO (beat frequency oscillator) to change the radio frequency impulses to sound. Almost all commercial traffic has now ceased operation using Morse, but it is still used by amateur radio operators. Non-directional beacons (NDB) and VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) used in air navigation use Morse to transmit their identifier.

== Radar == 
Morse code is all but extinct outside the amateur service, so in non-amateur contexts the term CW usually refers to a continuous-wave radar system, as opposed to one transmitting short pulses. Some monostatic (single antenna) CW radars transmit and receive a single (non-swept) frequency, often using the transmitted signal as the local oscillator for the return; examples include police speed radars and microwave-type motion detectors and automatic door openers. This type of radar is effectively &quot;blinded&quot; by its own transmitted signal to stationary targets; they must move toward or away from the radar quickly enough to create a Doppler shift sufficient to allow the radar to isolate the outbound and return signal frequencies. This kind of CW radar can measure range rate but not range (distance).

Other CW radars linearly or pseudo-randomly &quot;chirp&quot; (frequency modulate) their transmitters rapidly enough to avoid self-interference with returns from objects beyond some minimum distance; this kind of radar can detect and range static targets. This approach is commonly used in radar altimeters, in meteorology and in oceanic and atmospheric research. The landing radar on the Apollo Lunar Module combined both CW radar types.

CW bistatic radars use physically separate transmit and receive antennas to lessen the self-interference problems inherent in monostatic CW radars.

== Laser physics ==
In laser physics and engineering, &quot;continuous wave&quot; or &quot;CW&quot; refers to a laser that produces a continuous output beam, sometimes referred to as &quot;free-running,&quot; as opposed to a q-switched, gain-switched or modelocked laser, which has a pulsed output beam.

The continuous wave semiconductor laser was invented by Japanese physicist Izuo Hayashi in 1970. It led directly to the light sources in fiber-optic communication, laser printers, barcode readers, and optical disc drives, commercialized by Japanese entrepreneurs, and opened up the field of optical communication, playing an important role in future communication networks. Optical communication in turn provided the hardware basis for internet technology, laying the foundations for the Digital Revolution and Information Age.

<doc id="291714" wikidata="Q363402" url="?curid=291714" title="Stephen Sommers">
<text>Stephen Sommers (born March 20, 1962) is an American film director, screenwriter and producer, best known for big-budget action films, such as &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999), its sequel, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001), &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), and &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; (2009). He also directed &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; (1993), Disney&#x27;s live action version of &quot;Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s The Jungle Book&quot; (1994) and the action horror film &quot;Deep Rising&quot; (1998).

==Early life==
Stephen Sommers was born in Indianapolis, and grew up in St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he attended St. Cloud Apollo High School. He is a graduate of Saint John&#x27;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota, and the University of Seville in Spain. After graduating, he spent four years performing as an actor in theater groups and managing rock bands throughout Europe. He eventually returned to the United States and moved to Los Angeles, where he attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts for three years, earning a master&#x27;s degree and writing and directing the award-winning short film &quot;Perfect Alibi&quot;.

==Career==
&quot;Perfect Alibi&quot; helped Sommers acquire independent funding to write and direct his first feature film, the teen racing film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, filmed for $800,000 on location in his hometown of St. Cloud. The film was sold at the Cannes Film Festival for $7 million and later debuted on video in the United States.

Almost four years later, broke and in danger of having his house repossessed, he wrote and directed an adaptation of Mark Twain&#x27;s classic &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures, as well as &quot;Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s The Jungle Book&quot;. He later wrote the screenplays for &quot;Gunmen&quot; and &quot;Tom and Huck&quot;, which he also executive produced for Disney (along with a TV version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; in 1997 starring Richard Dreyfuss and Elijah Wood), and worked as a staff writer at Hollywood Pictures. While there, he worked on a script called &quot;Tentacle&quot;, which he later directed under the title &quot;Deep Rising&quot; in 1998.

In 1999, he wrote and directed Universal Studios&#x27; big-budget remake of &quot;The Mummy&quot;. The film was a smash hit, and Sommers received two Saturn Awards nominations for Best Director and Best Writer in 2000 by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films. A successful sequel, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, followed two years later, and he also co-wrote and produced 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, a prequel/spin-off of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;.

In 2004, Sommers founded his own company (along with editor/producing partner Bob Ducsay), The Sommers Company, and returned to theater screens with &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, a film pitting legendary vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing against the triumvirate of Universal movie monsters: Count Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. Before &quot;Van Helsing&quot; even premiered, Sommers and Ducsay began developing a spin-off TV series for NBC called &quot;Transylvania&quot;. Though featuring none of the characters from the film, the series (which was to have made use of the film&#x27;s Prague set) was about a young cowboy from Texas who becomes a sheriff in Transylvania, has many strange adventures, and encounters many strange creatures. Sommers and Ducsay were to have been executive producers, and Sommers wrote scripts for the pilot and first several episodes, but NBC decided not to go through with the show.

Since &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, Sommers has been attached to a number of projects. He was originally set to direct &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, but dropped out due to creative differences. He was also attached to a remake of &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (to be executive produced by Steven Spielberg), a new big-screen adaptation of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, a swashbuckling adventure film called &quot;Airborn&quot; based on the novel by Kenneth Oppel, a romantic/adventure story called &quot;The Big Love&quot; based on the novel by Sarah Dunn, and a remake of the French film &quot;Les Victimes&quot;. Sommers opted out of directing the third &quot;Mummy&quot; film, titled &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;, instead becoming one of its producers.

Sommers directed Paramount Pictures&#x27; 2009 live-action adaptation of &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, and also served as a producer. Around that time, he was developing a Tarzan adaptation for Warner Bros. but left the project. His most recent film, &quot;Odd Thomas&quot;, had been delayed from release due to lawsuits against the production company, but was eventually released.

<text>RRS &quot;Discovery&quot; is a barque-rigged auxiliary steamship built in Dundee, Scotland for Antarctic research. Launched in 1901, she was the last traditional wooden three-masted ship to be built in the United Kingdom. Her first mission was the British National Antarctic Expedition, carrying Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton on their first, and highly successful, journey to the Antarctic, known as the &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition.

After service as a merchant ship before and during the First World War, &quot;Discovery&quot; was taken into the service of the British government in 1923 to carry out scientific research in the Southern Ocean, becoming the first Royal Research Ship. The ship undertook a two-year expedition – the Discovery Investigations – recording valuable information on the oceans, marine life and being the first scientific investigation into whale populations. From 1929 to 1931 &quot;Discovery&quot; served as the base for the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) under Douglas Mawson. This was a major scientific and territorial quest in what is now the Australian Antarctic Territory.

On her return from the BANZARE, &quot;Discovery&quot; was moored in London as a static training ship and visitor attraction until 1979. That year she was placed in the care of the Maritime Trust as a museum ship. In 1986 she was moved to Dundee, the city where she was built. After an extensive restoration, &quot;Discovery&quot; is now the centrepiece of a visitor attraction in the city. She is one of only two surviving expedition ships from the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, the other being the Norwegian ship &quot;Fram&quot;. The , which survives and sailed in the Antarctic in 1903, is excluded from this group, as it was not built specifically for Antarctic Exploration.

== Design and construction==
With increasing scientific and political attention being turned to the uncharted continent of Antarctica during the late 19th century, numerous proposals arose for a British-mounted expedition to the continent. The Royal Navy had been something of a pioneer with Antarctic exploration, mounting the Ross expedition in 1839 which discovered the Ross Ice Shelf. Attention had turned northward to the Arctic and attempts to reach the North Pole. The RN mounted the British Arctic Expedition in 1874.

Towards the turn of the century, there was increasing pressure for a similar expedition to the southern polar region. The British government and the Admiralty stopped short of organising a government expedition but agreed to partially fund a project led by the two main interested scientific organisations, the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society. The Admiralty would provide practical support in designing and crewing a purpose-built ship for the expedition, while the ship would be owned by the RGS.

Early discussions on building a dedicated polar exploration ship considered replicating Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s ship &quot;Fram&quot;, but that vessel was designed specifically for working through the pack ice of the Arctic. The British ship would have to cross thousands of miles of open ocean before reaching the Antarctic, so a more conventional design was chosen. In charge of her overall design was W.E. Smith, one of the senior naval architects at the Admiralty. The ship&#x27;s engine, boilers and other machinery were designed by Fleet Engineer Philip Marrack.

Smith borrowed many elements of his design from the &quot;Bloodhound&quot;, a Dundee-built whaling ship taken into Royal Navy service as HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; for the Arctic Expedition. By 1900 few shipyards in the United Kingdom had the capability to build wooden ships of the size needed – only two shipbuilders submitted bids for the contract. The designers deemed it essential that the ship be made from wood, both for strength and ease of repair, and to reduce magnetic interference from a steel hull. They wanted to gain the most accurate navigation and surveying.

The main compass was mounted perfectly amidships, and there were to be no steel or iron fittings within of this point. The original cushions for the wardroom (just aft and below the main bridge) were changed when it was found they included steel-backed buttons. Similarly some of the wardroom cabins fell within this area, and their occupants had to sleep on mattresses stuffed with horsehair. Others located at a distance had more modern types of mattresses with steel springs inside. For the same reason of navigation, the boilers and engine were mounted towards the stern of the ship, a feature which also provided maximum space for equipment and provisions. A special laboratory for taking magnetic field measurements was provided below the bridge.

The ship committee considered having the ship built in Norway by Framnæs, the yard which would later build . But supporters believed that the British government&#x27;s money should be spent at a British yard. The new &quot;Discovery&quot; was built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company, which primarily made smaller vessels such as trawlers, tugboats and steam yachts. The yard was previously owned by Alexander Stephen and Sons and had built the &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, purchased by Scott for his last expedition, in 1884. The committee responsible for the ship&#x27;s construction offered a separate tender for her boilers, engine and auxiliary machinery in an effort to reduce costs. Dundee Shipbuilders also won that order, but sub-contracted the work to Gourlay Brothers, another Dundee engineering firm.

The ship cost £34,050 to build, plus another £10,322 to be fitted with engines and machinery, and more than £6000 for other equipment and fittings. The total cost for the &quot;Discovery&quot; was £51,000, equivalent to £4.1m in modern currency. Much of the detail work of fitting out the ship&#x27;s interior spaces, scientific equipment and provisions was overseen directly by Scott and the ship&#x27;s newly appointed engineer Reginald Skelton.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was fitted with a 450-horsepower coal-fired triple expansion steam engine, but had to rely primarily on sail because the coal bunkers did not have sufficient capacity to take the ship on long voyages. At her economical cruising speed of , &quot;Discovery&quot; carried enough coal for only of steaming; the voyage to New Zealand covered over . At , she could steam only .

The ship was considered to be a sailing vessel with auxiliary steam propulsion: when first registered in 1900 &quot;Discovery&quot; was classified as a sailing ship. Her legal owners were the Royal Geographical Society. As its president, Sir Clements Markham, was a member of the Royal Harwich Yacht Club, &quot;Discovery&quot; was registered as a private sailing yacht of the RHYC. She carried the official name and prefix &#x27;S.Y. Discovery&#x27;. She flew the RHYC&#x27;s burgee, the emblem of the RGS as a house flag, and the Blue Ensign throughout her first expedition.

She was rigged as a barque (the fore- and mainmasts being square rig and the mizzen mast carrying a fore-aft sail), and the total maximum sail area was . Following the practice of the most modern sailing ships of the time, the windjammers, she carried split topsails to reduce the size of the deck crew needed to handle them. Her spars and sails on the foremast and mainmast were identical to reduce the amount of spares carried and allow easier repairs.

The ship was rigged to carry several large staysails. The funnel was hinged at the base so it could be laid on the deck when the mizzen staysail was rigged once at sea. The &quot;Discovery&quot; was marginally faster under sail than she was under engine power – her record for distance travelled in 24 hours is , equivalent to .

The ship has a massively built wooden hull designed to withstand being frozen into pack ice and resist crushing. At the time of her launch, &quot;Discovery&quot; was widely held to be the strongest wooden ship ever built. The hull frames, placed much closer together than was normal, were made of solid sections of oak up to thick. The outer hull was formed from two layers – one thick and an outer skin some thick.

A third lining was laid inside the frames, forming a double bottom and skin around almost the entire hull. This meant that in places the hull was over thick, providing not only formidable strength but excellent insulation against the cold. The construction made it impossible to install portholes (and fitting them would have weakened the hull), so the crew relied on &#x27;mushroom vents&#x27; on the deck to allow air and light into the interior.

The wood used for the planking varied depending on where in the ship it was laid and what structural purpose it served: the inner layer is Scots pine while the skin is made of pitch pine, Honduras mahogany or oak. The outer hull is made of English elm and Greenheart. Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks – the lower deck beams are square in cross-section and are placed less than apart along the ship&#x27;s length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and ensured that any ice damage would not flood the entire ship.

To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing, the two-blade propeller could be hoisted out of the way and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. A second rudder and spare propeller blades were carried, and the ship could be steered by use of her sails if her rudder or steering gear was completely disabled. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so that when ramming the ice, they would ride up over the margin and crush the ice with deadweight.

The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel compartment, each of which could hold 60 tons of fresh water. These would be filled on the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand but for the Antarctic expedition the extra coal capacity was more important as ice and snow could be melted each day to provide water, so the tanks would be filled with coal. The metal tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine spaces.

On 16 March 1900, in the context of significant donations to the approaching expedition by patrons Llewellyn W. Longstaff and the British Government, construction on the &quot;Discovery&quot; began in Dundee, Scotland, by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company. She was launched into the Firth of Tay on 21 March 1901 by Lady Markham, the wife of Sir Clements Markham, President of the Royal Geographical Society.

==History==

===British National Antarctic Expedition===
The British National Antarctic Expedition departed the UK less than five months after the &quot;Discovery&quot; was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. With limited time between the ship&#x27;s launch and her departure for Antarctica there was limited time for sea trials. Her speed under steam was tested and proved better than expected – her averaged maximum speed during trials was 9 knots instead of the planned 8 knots. Without a full crew available and short of time neither her builders nor Scott were able to test her performance or handling under sail.

Much of her equipment was also untested, so the long voyage to New Zealand, made via Madeira and Cape Town, would also be the new vessel&#x27;s shakedown cruise. Before reaching London from Dundee a leak was found from her stern around the rudder post. There was no time to dry dock the ship for a full repair, with Skelton having to make do with applying extra caulking.

The ship was berthed in London loading supplies and equipment until July 1901, when she sailed to Cowes on the Isle of Wight where she anchored during August. In this time she served as the yacht of the RGS during Cowes Week and was toured by several dignitaries, culminating in a visit by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 5 August. The expedition left from Cowes the next day, 6 August 1901.

Scott&#x27;s first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances to work well in ice, provided minimal stability. &quot;Discovery&quot; rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded rolling through 94 degrees – 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended to &#x27;gripe&#x27; (a strong tendency to turn up into the wind). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship&#x27;s hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice.

But once the expedition reached the Roaring Forties the ship proved to have excellent seakeeping qualities, and because she was heavy and carried relatively little sail area for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having to reef. The &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original &quot;Bloodhound&quot; design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking over the back of the ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to &#x27;slamming&#x27; into waves, making the officers&#x27; accommodation and wardroom noisy.
The expedition travelled to New Zealand via Madeira and Cape Town for resupplying. The ship was put in dry dock for the first time at Lyttelton and the carpenter, Frederick Dailey, prepared a lengthy report detailing the numerous empty bolt holes and slack hull fittings he found. depth of water had seeped into the ship&#x27;s bilges and lower hold through badly-sealed joints in the planking. While these were repaired there was considerable dispute between the RGS and Dundee Shipbuilders as to who was responsible for the defects, but the &quot;Discovery&quot; left for the Antarctic on 21 December 1901, after three weeks in New Zealand.

The Antarctic coastline was sighted on 8 January 1902. During the first month Scott began charting the coastline. Then, in preparation for the winter, he anchored in McMurdo Sound in a bay sheltered from the prevailing west wind by the Hut Point Peninsula. The &quot;Discovery&quot; was moored directly to the ice shelf by anchors and Scott used explosives to blow away part of the shelf so the ship could be protected on three sides.

On 8 February &quot;Discovery&quot; was surrounded by pack ice on all sides. The expedition divided itself between the ship and the shore, with &quot;Discovery&quot; being used for accommodation and the prefabricated hut, intended to be the expedition&#x27;s winter living quarters, was used as a laboratory. Although surrounded by ice the ship was not yet frozen in. In increasingly strong gales the ship would bump, slam and grind against the ice shelf but her strong multi-layered wooden hull withstood the forces which would have ripped open a conventional ship.

By the end of March &quot;Discovery&quot; was fully frozen into the ice-covered sound. The ship would remain there, locked in ice, for the next two years; the expedition had expected to spend the winter there and to move on in the spring. Despite this, the ship&#x27;s routine and work continued through the Antarctic winter. The Expedition was able to determine that Antarctica was indeed a continent, and they were able to relocate the South magnetic pole. Scott, Shackleton and Edward Wilson also achieved a &quot;Furthest South&quot; of 82 degrees 18 minutes.

&quot;Discovery&quot; proved to be a superb accommodation vessel. The only recurring complaint was that the officers&#x27; cabins were extremely cold. They were placed amidships either side of the wardroom and above the boilers and coal bunkers. Once the boilers were extinguished the unheated and deep-frozen mass of coal in the bunkers made it hard to keep heat in the rooms. Ice frequently formed on the cabin walls and Scott reported that, sat at his desk, he had to have his feet in a box of straw to keep warm.

In January 1903 the &quot;Morning&quot;, commanded by William Colbeck, arrived in McMurdo Sound with extra supplies for the expedition. It was hoped (by both the expedition in Antarctic and the organisers in London) that &quot;Discovery&quot; would be freed as the ice broke up in the Antarctic summer, allowing her to continue her voyage. But she remained icebound, and the ship and her crew had to overwinter for a second year as the &quot;Morning&quot; left in March.

Another land expedition was organised over the spring of 1903, with Scott again confident that a second summer would allow &quot;Discovery&quot; to leave the Sound. In January 1904 a second relief expedition, commanded again by Colbeck, arrived consisting of the &quot;Morning&quot; and the &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, with orders to extract the entire expedition and abandon &quot;Discovery&quot; if the ship was not free of the ice by 25 February.

The two relief ships slowly broke a path through the ice while Scott organised work parties at the &quot;Discovery&quot; to use saws and pickaxes to cut the ice away from the hull. However, by 10 February the research ship was still locked in the ice and the relief ships were from the beleaguered ship. Scott began evacuating his equipment and samples from &quot;Discovery&quot; in preparation to abandon her but on 16 February 1904 the ice suddenly began to break up. After carrying out a number of controlled explosions with dynamite &quot;Discovery&quot; was freed from the pack and soon afterwards the relief ships were able to draw alongside.

Fifty tons of coal was transferred from the &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, which had carried extra fuel for the purpose, and the captain of the &quot;Morning&quot; gave an extra 25 tons. Steam began to be raised on the &quot;Discovery&quot; on 17 February but before the ship was fully prepared for sea a gale blew up. The ship dragged at her anchor and only just had enough pressure in her boilers to prevent her being blown back onto the ice shelf which had provided her shelter for two years.

Scott attempted to round Hut Point in the teeth of the gale at 11 am on a slight ebb tide but the ship grounded on an uncharted shoal. Attempts were made to force the ship ahead over the obstruction and back her off but the engine lacked the power and the water intakes for her condenser became blocked by ice and churned-up dirt. The ship spent nearly ten hours aground, being bodily slammed and pounded into the ground by the action of the waves and wind.

The captains of the relief ships stood by in preparation for a rescue and the crew feared that their ship would be at best dismasted and at worst split apart. Scott described that evening as &quot;truly the most dreadful&quot; he had spent during the expedition. At 3 am on 18 February the wind moderated, the tide turned and the ship began to slide astern off the shoal under her own weight. Once the stern was afloat the water intakes were cleared and the engine was able to pull the bow off. Inspections showed that &quot;Discovery&quot; had come through the ordeal almost entirely without damage, losing only some of her external sheathing of greenheart and incurring some minor damage to the rudder. By dawn the ship was clear of the land.

The extra coal taken on from the relief ships meant that Scott didn&#x27;t have to take a direct route back to New Zealand, instead proceeding north via Cape North and the Balleny Islands, a route which also proved the non-existence of land charted by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1840. Off Cape Adare the damaged rudder broke free and the spare had to be fitted.

The three ships regrouped at the Auckland Islands and docked at Lyttelton on 1 April. &quot;Discovery&quot; then headed east following the clipper route back to the UK, taking some oceanographic soundings and searching for the &#x27;phantom&#x27; Dougherty Island as she did so. After passing through the Strait of Magellan she stopped at the Falkland Islands to make magnetic surveys. &quot;Discovery&quot; arrived back at Spithead on 10 September 1904, 1131 days after her departure.

===Cargo vessel===
The British National Antarctic Expedition was acclaimed upon its return but was also in serious financial trouble, and so in 1905, &quot;Discovery&quot; was sold to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company for £10,000 (a fifth of her original build cost) which used her as a cargo vessel between London and Hudson Bay, Canada. The HBC heavily remodelled the ship for her new purpose, stripping all the accommodation and other rooms below her weather deck in order to maximise cargo space. Features such as her lifting propeller, dredging winches and her original galley stove were removed and sold. The ship&#x27;s officers were now accommodated in the deckhouses which had housed the ship&#x27;s laboratories and scientific storerooms while the crew berthed in the focsle.

&quot;Discovery&quot; made an annual transatlantic trip for the HBC between 1905 and 1911 carrying food, fuel, building materials and gunpowder from London to Charlton Island in Canada (near the HBC&#x27;s large depot at Moose Factory). The ship was laden with the season&#x27;s haul of fur hides for the return voyage. Each round trip took around two months and was made in the summer, although the ship often still had to break through ice in the Davis and Hudson Straights.

From the 1912 season &quot;Discovery&quot; and the other HBC ship, the &quot;Pelican&quot;, were replaced by a brand new and much larger steam-powered icebreaker, the &quot;Nascopie&quot;, and the vessel was laid up in London. In October 1913 she was sold for £9,500 to Joseph Foster Stackhouse, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society who was planning another research expedition to Antarctica. Stackhouse paid the HBC a £1000 initial deposit on the ship but was unable to raise the funds to pay the balance.

===During and after World War I===

The start of the First World War saw the planned expedition postponed and Stackhouse died in the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; in May 1915, while returning from a fundraising trip to New York City. Following Stackhouse&#x27;s death the HBC kept his £1000 deposit to cover the interim costs of maintaining &quot;Discovery&quot;.

The following month she was drydocked and re-rigged at the cost of £55 as part of a scheme financed and run by the HBC to carry wartime supplies from around the world to France – &quot;Discovery&quot; would be one of around 300 ships chartered via 6600 contracts under the scheme (she was Steamer #141), managed by a specially-formed shell company called the Bay Steamship Company. &quot;Discovery&quot; sailed from London bound for New York in April but had to put in at Falmouth due to a large leak around her rudder.

The journey took 27 days in bad weather and the ship was found to be in poor condition with many leaking deck seams and a number of mechanical failures. Her eastbound trip was made to La Rochelle carrying caustic soda, sacking and corduroy. More leaks occurred, flooding the cabins and store rooms. Some of her timbers were found to have dry rot and her condenser failed, requiring sea water to be used in her boilers which then needed repairs.

Another refit and repair was made in Swansea in August 1915 and then the ship sailed for Arkhangelsk via the French ports of Nantes, Bordeaux and Brest. Her cargo was 500 tons of French munitions being carried to support the Russian Empire, with Arkhangelsk on the White Sea being the only Russian port in European waters free of German blockade.

The voyage via North Cape brought up more examples of the ship&#x27;s poor condition as she suffered further leaks and rigging damage. Her return cargo was 557 barrels of methanol, which she carried to Le Havre. &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; infamous roll in heavy seas caused some damage to the barrels and her lack of a dedicated cargo deck hatch meant that loading and unloading took much longer than in a purpose-made cargo vessel.

In 1916, &quot;Discovery&quot; was loaned to the British government to rescue Shackleton&#x27;s party marooned on Elephant Island. &quot;Discovery&quot; was refitted in Plymouth and departed on 11 August 1916. Due to the ship&#x27;s notoriously slow speed she was towed by the collier &quot;Polesley&quot; until she reached the favourable trade winds. With the First World War still raging, the tow was escorted by two Royal Navy destroyers.

Just four weeks after leaving the UK &quot;Discovery&quot; reached Montevideo, to learn that Shackleton had effected his crew&#x27;s own rescue in the &quot;Yelcho&quot; while &quot;Discovery&quot; was en route. In order to cover some of the costs of the abortive voyage, &quot;Discovery&quot; took on a cargo of 5943 sacks of wheat at commercial carriage rates for her return voyage. She returned to Plymouth in November where she was handed back to the HBC. She sailed to Lorient where she unloaded the cargo of grain.

Between January 1917 and March 1918 &quot;Discovery&quot; carried cargo along the French coast of the Bay of Biscay between Brest and Bayonne. She was released from convoy duty back to the HBC in April 1918 and in June made her last transatlantic voyage, sailing from Cardiff to Charlton Island via Montreal. She twice became stuck in ice in the Hudson Straight near Cape Chidley and Charles Island.

Her condition was such that she was not permitted to carry the valuable furs on the eastbound voyage, taking them only as far as Newfoundland in special wrappings to protect them from water leaks. With a cargo of general goods loaded at St John&#x27;s, &quot;Discovery&quot; arrived back at Liverpool in January 1919. Between then and July that year she made further coastal voyages along the French Atlantic coast, through the English Channel to Antwerp.

In July 1919, &quot;Discovery&quot; was taken up again by the British government for another voyage to Russia, this time in support of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. With the Red Army in control of Russia&#x27;s major northeastern cities and ports, the only supply route was via ports on the Black Sea. &quot;Discovery&quot; departed from Kingston upon Hull and travelled to Gibraltar and across the Mediterranean Sea, reached Istanbul in late August and passed through the Dardanelles and docked at Novorossiysk in September. Here she transferred cargo from another HBC supply ship on the same run (&quot;Pelican&quot;) and proceeded to Rostov-on-Don, which she reached on 6 October.

A three-week wait for cargo followed before &quot;Discovery&quot; was loaded with a cargo of nearly 4000 barrels of cement. This was taken to Piraeus (reached on 1 December) and then the ship returned to Istanbul where she loaded a general cargo including bags of nuts, linseed, rugs and carpets, caviar, mohair and copper sheet. She departed for London in mid-February 1920 and refuelled at Gibraltar on 28 February. She unloaded at the East India Docks in London in mid-March.

The progress of the conflict in Russia meant that no further voyages were possible. A slump in the shipping business and the purchase of new, more modern ships by the HBC meant that &quot;Discovery&quot; was surplus to requirements. She spent a month moored to a buoy in the Thames at Deptford while she was offered for charter but in June was laid up in the South West India Dock. All her equipment was removed to be stored or sold while her machinery was preserved in a layer of grease.

She was still at her berth in South West India Dock in early 1922 when the HBC agreed to loan the ship as a temporary headquarters for the 16th Stepney Sea Scouts.

===Discovery investigations===
In 1923 her fortunes were revived when the Colonial Office of the British government purchased her for further research work. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sold &quot;Discovery&quot; for £5000 and retained a right of first refusal to re-purchase the ship if she was sold in order to prevent a rival firm using her to compete on the Canadian fur trade. The government had bought the vessel to mount long-term projects investigating, charting and analysing the whale populations of the Southern Ocean.

&quot;Discovery&quot; underwent a £114,000 refit at Vosper &amp; Company which amounted to a rebuilding to put right years of wear and tear and equip the ship for her new purpose. Much of the cost was borne by the Government of the Falkland Islands as the territory was increasingly dependent on whaling for its economy and the voyage would provide essential information on the location, size and management of the whale stocks. Because of this, ownership of the &quot;Discovery&quot; was vested in the Falkland Islands executive council and her port of registration was changed from London to Port Stanley. Now in the official service of the British government she was also designated as a Royal Research Ship.

Because her new role would require many thousands of miles of open-ocean travel, changes were made to improve &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; handling and sailing performance. As suggested by Scott and Shackleton in 1900 her fore- and mainmasts were moved forward (by respectively) to make her more balanced and steady on a course while new yards and the addition of split topgallant sails increased her sail area by 20 percent to improve her speed. As built the ship&#x27;s helm was positioned near the stern and connected to the rudder via chains, while the ship was conned from the bridge forward of the mainmast, creating communication problems between those commanding the ship and those actually steering it.

In her refit a second wheel was positioned on the bridge, operating the rudder via a newly fitted steam-powered steering engine. The original helm and steering gear was retained as an emergency system. All three of her hull skins were extensively re-planked and parts of her keel were replaced with new sections of imported Quebec oak, it proving impossible to obtain English oak of the required shape, size and strength. New cabins and other rooms were built both below deck and in deckhouses. These included biological and chemical laboratories, a library, a darkroom and new cabins and other facilities, including a new wardroom.

The ship was fitted with several winches for handling sounding lines and deep-water trawling nets with cables totalling thousands of fathoms in length, plus an early electronic echo sounder. This allowed the ship to not only chart the depth of the ocean as she travelled but recover samples of the seabed, seawater and specimens of deep-sea fish. She was fitted with electric lighting powered by both a steam generator and a paraffin engine for use when under sail and also now boasted a refrigerated store for fresh provisions. She carried four motorboats of various sizes. In her new form she was re-registered as a steamship.

Stanley Wells Kemp was appointed the project&#x27;s director of research while Joseph Stenhouse, veteran of the drift of the Aurora, was made captain of &quot;Discovery&quot;. The ship left Portsmouth in July 1925. The final aspects of the refit and trials had been rushed in order to reach the Southern Ocean before the start of the whaling season in November, which led to a number of faults developing in the ship as she sailed through the Bay of Biscay and she had to put into Dartmouth for repairs and modifications which took two months.

She made her final departure on 24 September and reached Cape Town on 20 December, having stopped only at Ascension Island. She resupplied and took on cargo and mail to be delivered to Tristan da Cunha on her way to South Georgia. During all her movements beyond this point &quot;Discovery&quot; stopped regularly to take oceanographic surveys which could take up to six hours to complete at each pre-set position.

The ship reached South Georgia on 20 February and was based there for two months while her crew of scientists and seamen worked alongside the whalers, both on shore at Grytviken and at sea, examining the remains of the caught and processed whales and observing their numbers and movements. &quot;Discovery&quot; herself made hydrographic and oceanographic surveys of the seas around South Georgia and surveys of the poorly-charted island itself and its wildlife were also made.

Due to her delayed departure from Britain these voyages were made in the depths of the South Atlantic winter and the ship&#x27;s excessive roll, high windage and limited engine power all caused difficulties in her work. On 17 April 1926, &quot;Discovery&quot; left Grytviken and sailed for the Falkland Islands before returning to Cape Town on 29 June, having taken five weeks to make the eastbound voyage in heavy seas while carrying out her research work.

The difficulties encountered led to &quot;Discovery&quot; being placed in dry dock at the Simon&#x27;s Town naval base for three months to be fitted with bilge keels to improve her stability. For the same reason her foremast topgallant and all the yards and topmasts on the mainmast were removed to reduce the weight she carried high up and &#x27;stiffen&#x27; the ship. Her donkey boiler, mounted in the forecastle, was removed for the same reason.

For the next season of work &quot;Discovery&quot; was joined by the British government&#x27;s brand new purpose-built research steamer, . She returned to South Georgia on 15 December, with her crew finding the alterations had greatly improved her seakeeping and reduced the pronounced roll. She carried out a plankton survey of the surrounding seas until February 1927, when she headed to the South Shetland Islands, where she carried out a programme to &#x27;tag&#x27; whales in order to track their movements.

In March &quot;Discovery&quot; visited Deception Island, which at the time served as a natural harbour to eight large factory ships for further studies. During the southern winter the ship travelled down the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, carrying out surveys to draw and correct nautical charts. Discovery Sound was explored and surveyed for the first time and was named after the ship. She was at Cape Renard on 24 March, before working back north to Deception Island, still taking regular oceanographic surveys and biological samples.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was the first ship to take oceanographic readings in the stormy and dangerous Drake Passage, including one survey station just a few miles off Cape Horn. This sequence provided the missing data to construct the first complete view of the Antarctic currents. After anchoring off the Hermite Islands and transiting the Le Maire Strait, &quot;Discovery&quot; anchored at Port Stanley on 6 May 1927.

A final surveying trip was made back to Cape Town before the expedition&#x27;s work was concluded and &quot;Discovery&quot; sailed for Britain. She arrived at Falmouth on 29 September 1927. Sidney Frederic Harmer called the voyage &quot;the most important scientific expedition that has left our shores since the time of the &quot;Challenger&quot;.&quot;

===BANZARE===
While &quot;Discovery&quot; was in the Southern Ocean, the 1926 Imperial Conference considered the question of British imperial sovereignty in Antarctica. At the time only two territories in the Antarctic were formally part of the British Empire – the Falkland Islands and the Ross Dependency. The conference identified seven other parts of the continent, totalling over 3 million square miles (8 million square kilometres) which could be claimed by Britain on the grounds of first-discovery.

With the increasing economic and strategic importance of Antarctica and its waters, it was deemed vital that the British claim be formalised. An expedition would be sent with officers authorised to claim land in the government&#x27;s name while also carrying out further surveying, exploration and scientific work. The expedition would be the joint responsibility of Britain, Australia and New Zealand, thus becoming the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition, frequently abbreviated to BANZARE.

The Australian government was to be in charge of the practical aspects of the expedition, under the leadership of the Australian National Research Council. The ANRC identified &quot;Discovery&quot; as the only suitable vessel to accommodate the expedition. The ship was still under the control of the committee for the Discovery Investigations and owned by the government of the Falkland Islands, who were initially reluctant to part with the ship as their work was still ongoing.

When the Norvegia expedition annexed Bouvet Island for Norway in December 1927, political pressure meant that it was swiftly arranged for &quot;Discovery&quot; to be leased to Australia free of charge. Antarctic veteran Douglas Mawson was appointed leader of the BANZARE, and he assigned John King Davis, of Shackleton&#x27;s Nimrod expedition and Mawson&#x27;s own Australasian Antarctic Expedition as captain of &quot;Discovery&quot;.

&quot;Discovery&quot; left London on 1 August 1929, carrying a complement of 25 officers and men, some scientific equipment and a partially-dismantled de Havilland DH.60 Moth light aircraft on her deck, which was to be used for aerial survey work. After loading with coal and further supplies in Cardiff, the ship headed into the Atlantic to follow the clipper route to Cape Town, where Mawson and the scientific staff (most of whom were Australian) would join the ship.

Like Scott, and despite the vessel&#x27;s modifications made during the 1923 rebuilding, Davis was not initially impressed with &quot;Discovery&quot; as a sailing vessel, finding her sluggish and awkward in the light winds of the Doldrums and often being unable to point closer than 75 degrees off the wind. He also struggled with the inexperience of the crew, with none of the officers and (despite his efforts) few of the crew having experience in ocean-going sailing ships.

As with her previous captains, Davis&#x27; opinion of the ship changed as they reached the strong winds of the higher latitudes. In a gale on 1 October &quot;Discovery&quot; was able to carry all her sail and was logged as travelling at 10 knots. The ship reached Cape Town on 5 October, making the journey in three days less than she had on her maiden voyage under Scott.

Preparations for the expedition proper included (following Stenhouse&#x27;s experiences in the same waters) removing all the yards from the ship&#x27;s mainmast and taking down the fore topgallant yards and storing them on the deck to both reduce the centre of gravity, lessen the roll and hopefully improve performance when steaming. Two new boats, including a motor-whaler, were added to the ship, as well as 40 tons of food and supplies, a library of 100 books, 2000 cases of scientific equipment and over 300 tons of coal.

The twelve scientists, including zoologists, biologists, an ornithologist, a cartographer and a hydrologist, as well as veteran Antarctic photographer Frank Hurley, also joined the ship here. &quot;Discovery&quot; departed Cape Town on 19 October and called at Île de la Possession, the Kerguelen Islands and Heard Island – the latter reached on 26 November, with parties going ashore to study the wildlife and carry out geographical surveys at each location. The weather was nearly perpetually stormy and after leaving Heard Island the ship was pummelled by three days of continuous gale.

The weather calmed as they headed south and on 8 December &quot;Discovery&quot; reached the Antarctic ice field and entered the pack ice three days later. The ship continued to work through dense field ice, heavily populated by penguins and seals. The aircraft, fitted as a seaplane was used for scouting and survey work, becoming the first aircraft to be operated in Antarctica. Oceanographic work and trawls of sealife at various depths were made at regular intervals.

A flight on 1 January 1930, with Mawson on board, sighted new land and mountains, which were named Mac. Robertson Land. Davis refused to draw the ship near enough for a landing – an attitude that would be a regular source of conflict between the captain and Mawson. On 4 January, the ship reached Kemp Land, confirming its presence as it had been unseen since its initial discovery in the 1830s. On 12 January &quot;Discovery&quot; sighted Enderby Land. The first landfall was made the next day, with the Union Jack being planted on Proclamation Island by Mawson.

Two days later &quot;Discovery&quot; encountered her fellow expedition ship, the &quot;Norvegia&quot;, still engaged in similar exploratory and territorial work on behalf of Norway. Mawson had been sent regular wireless messages informing of his rival&#x27;s whereabouts. The Norwegian leader, Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, was received aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;. The longitude of the meeting – 44°38′E – became the boundary between the subsequent Australian and Norwegian territorial claims.

After the ships had parted &quot;Discovery&quot; was swept 150 miles to the west before a fierce storm, once again impressing those aboard with her seaworthiness. Captain Davis was beginning to worry about his coal supplies, leading to more disagreements with Mawson who refused to let up on the expedition&#x27;s scientific work which added greatly to the fuel consumption and distance travelled.

Working back eastwards, the expedition surveyed and photographed Cape Ann and confirmed it to be the headland recorded by John Biscoe in 1831. Unknown to the BANZARE crew, the Norwegians had also made aerial photographs of the same point and had reached the same conclusion just a few weeks before. With Davis still refusing to risk the ship close inshore, Mawson made a flight over Enderby Land on 25 January and dropped a second flag inland.

The next day Davis informed Mawson that there were only 120 tons of coal left in &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; bunkers and that they had to turn for home. Mawson felt that they should stay until they were down to 80 tons given that, despite the removal of some of her yards and rigging, &quot;Discovery&quot; was still fully capable of voyaging under sail. Davis was backed up by W. Griggs, his engineer, who felt that the boilers would need cleaning within three weeks.

Reluctantly Mawson agreed to head north. Some oceanographic work was carried out on the return voyage to the Kerguelen Islands, where 190 tons of coal were taken aboard and the boilers washed out. Severe weather meant that Mawson had to abandon his plans for a cruise to Queen Mary Land and instead &quot;Discovery&quot; carried out a month of biological and oceanographic work in the waters around the islands until she headed for Australia, reaching Adelaide on 1 April 1930.

A second year of research was authorised soon after the expedition&#x27;s return and the British government&#x27;s free loan of &quot;Discovery&quot; was extended. Mawson was still in command. Captain Davis showed no interest in returning for the second expedition but personally recommended the first officer, Kenneth N. MacKenzie, as captain. The second expedition left Hobart on 22 November 1930. She carried 73 tons of supplies, which included 20 live sheep (accommodated in a pen on top of the sounding winch deckhouse) with a ton of fodder. There was also two tons of butter plus an &#x27;electric cow&#x27; which would mix water and powdered milk, six tons of potatoes, 7800 eggs, half a ton of fresh meat in the refrigerated locker and 30 tons of fresh water (loaded aboard from a single hosepipe on the dockside). She also carried 430 tons of coal.

With a standard load &quot;Discovery&quot; normally drew of water but on leaving Hobart she drew . Five days out of port the expedition made its first discovery – an under-ocean ridge rising out of a flat sea floor. This would later be found to be part of the Macquarie Fault Zone.

On 1 December the ship anchored off Macquarie Island, where shore parties were put ashore to study wildlife, the inland lakes and plants while &quot;Discovery&quot; made soundings and surveys in the coastal waters. On 15 December the expedition rendezvoused with a whaling ship to take on 100 tons of coal and 25 tons of fresh water – an operation which took 16 hours. Scientific records were made of the whales being processed on the factory ship while the transfer was being carried out.

The expedition headed towards a small sliver of known coastline called Adélie Land, hoping to discover and claim land on either side. The southern summer of 1930 proved to be one of extremely heavy ice, with 111 icebergs being sighted from the ship in one day (21 December) alone. Snow flurries, fog and gales hampered navigation but on fine days &quot;Discovery&quot; could make nearly 150 miles a day but over the Christmas period the ship was blocked in by pack ice. A Norwegian whaler was met on 29 December, which gifted the &quot;Discovery&quot; a further 50 tons of coal.

On 31 December the ship was struck by a violent storm with winds of up to 70 mph (Force 11 on the Beaufort Scale). The ship was driven against the ice, while larger bergs were blown onto the ship by the wind. For eight hours &quot;Discovery&quot; was repeatedly slammed into and onto thick ice and battered by bergs but MacKenzie was able to slowly work the ship offshore by use of the engine and, despite the fierce wind, sails. The ship found safe anchorage at Mawson&#x27;s old base camp site at Cape Denison, where the wind moderated to Force 9. Here readings of the magnetic field were taken over 18 hours, which relocated the South Magnetic Pole and showed it had moved to the northwest since Mawson&#x27;s previous readings in 1913.

On 5 January 1931, another flag-planting ceremony and proclamation was made as Mawson claimed the newly surveyed coast, Cape Denison and all the land between the coast and the pole for the British Empire as George V Land. During the rest of the month &quot;Discovery&quot; continued to work westward, prevented by heavy ice from approaching closer than around 100 miles from the coast. Most survey and photography work was carried out by aircraft while the shipboard team continued their oceanographic and biological work.

The aerial team relocated a coastline originally found by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1840 and renamed it and the newly surveyed land around it as the Banzare Coast. The work was still frequently interrupted by gales and storms, which brought many large icebergs and floes around the ship.

On 11 February both the weather and the seas cleared, allowing &quot;Discovery&quot; to edge in to less than 10 miles from the coast, allowing surveying from the ship and inland flights by the aircraft. This land, entirely unknown before the BANZARE&#x27;s arrival, was named Princess Elizabeth Land, which was claimed by means of the flag being dropped from the air. The Murray Monolith was discovered and claimed a few days later. By now the ship was back at the coast of Mac. Robertson Land which had been charted the previous year. Now conditions were right to send a party ashore to undertake another flag-planting ceremony.

On 18 February the coal bunkers had only 100 tons of fuel left, which both Mawson and MacKenzie had agreed would be the minimum for the ship&#x27;s return voyage. The next day &quot;Discovery&quot; sheltered in the lee of a large iceberg while the topgallant yards were rigged to ready the ship for the ocean crossing. The early days of the northward journey were in the teeth of another furious gale. With only two sails carried on the foremast &quot;Discovery&quot; still averaged over 24 hours, in seas with waves over high and with crests apart.

In his diary recording these days MacKenzie called &quot;Discovery&quot; &quot;my wonderful little ship&quot;. The weather eased after three days and &quot;Discovery&quot; arrived back at Hobart on 19 March 1931, having covered since she left.

The ship and most of her crew still had to return to Britain. She did so via the traditional clipper route via Cape Horn, which was rounded on 1 June. She arrived back at her usual berth in London&#x27;s East India Dock on 1 August 1931, exactly two years after her departure.

===Boy Scouts/Sea Cadet Corps===
Having returned to Britain, &quot;Discovery&quot;″s research days were now over. As well as RRS &quot;William Scoresby&quot;; the British government also had a brand new steamship available for research work. had been launched in 1929, partially to tide over the Discovery Committee (still continuing the whale and ocean research started in 1923 – the Discovery Investigations would not conclude until 1951) while the original &quot;Discovery&quot; was undertaking the BANZARE but also in recognition of the original ship&#x27;s age.

She had now had thirty years of hard work in some of the most punishing seas in the world. Her limitations, not being originally designed for open-ocean research work, were clear – despite improvements she was still slow, ponderous and notoriously prone to rolling. As both Davis and MacKenzie found, it was increasingly difficult to find crew with sufficient experience to man traditional sailing vessels and when used purely as a steamship &quot;Discovery&quot; lacked the engine power and bunker capacity for the work required.

In the years following her return from Australia &quot;Discovery&quot; was laid-up and offered for charter. Several proposed expeditions were either offered to the ship (often at little or no charge) or expressed interest in using her, but none came to fruition. Either the proposed expedition failed to raise the required funds in the years of the Great Depression or the organisers felt that &quot;Discovery&quot; was unsuitable for their purpose.

The Crown Agents, the statutory corporation which was the ship&#x27;s ultimate legal owner, made moves to sell or dispose of the ship in 1935. Two members of the Discovery Committee worked to find a means to ensure the ship&#x27;s survival and recognition of her national importance. The solution was found in 1936 when she was presented to the Boy Scouts Association as a static training ship for Sea Scouts in London. She was kept at a mooring in the centre of London on the Victoria Embankment near Westminster Bridge.

During the Second World War &quot;Discovery&quot; served as the headquarters and depot ship for the River Emergency Service, a network of first aid stations and &#x27;floating ambulances&#x27; using requisitioned pleasure craft. In 1941 a barrage balloon broke its moorings and became entangled in the ship&#x27;s main course yardarm. When the balloon was cut free it was found that the yard was rotten and all the yards and spars were removed. In 1943 her boilers and machinery were removed.

Previously it was thought these had been scrapped to provide material for the war effort, but in 2016 a 1943 advert by a salvage firm was found offering the entire contents of the engine room for sale as a single lot, suggesting the equipment was removed for reuse although its ultimate fate is unknown.

To maintain the ship&#x27;s trim and stability with the loss of her machinery the bilges and shaft tunnel were filled with ballast in the form of small rocks (shingle). The former engine space became a mess hall and the boiler room and coal bunkers became a classroom. During the Festival of Britain in the summer of 1951 (held at South Bank just across the river from &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; mooring), the ship hosted an exhibition on Antarctica and the history of its exploration. This required opening much of the existing crew quarters as public exhibition space and the former water tanks were removed and replaced with new crew quarters.
In the 1950s the ageing ship proved too costly for the Scout Association to maintain and she was transferred to the Admiralty in 1954 and formally commissioned as HMS&quot;Discovery&quot; for use as a drill ship for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, and also as a training ship for the Westminster Sea Cadet Corps.

The RN carried out another refitting which saw virtually all the remaining accommodation and fittings from the ship&#x27;s original 1900 build and the 1923 Vospers rebuild removed or remodelled. In 1960, following reforms to the reserve forces, HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; became part of the newly unified Royal Naval Reserve and was the flagship of the Admiral Commanding, Reserves, thus becoming one of only two sailing ships to fly the White Ensign and an Admiral&#x27;s flag during the 20th century, along with .

The Navy maintained the ship but this was rarely in a manner primarily concerned with retaining her historical fabric or her integrity as a sailing vessel, and as the wooden ship passed her 70th birthday (and 40 years moored in the Thames without dry-docking) her condition deteriorated. When no longer of use to the Navy, she was in danger of being scrapped.

The Maritime Trust, into whose care she passed in 1979, saved her from the breaker&#x27;s yard. Her future secured, she was berthed first on the River Thames next to and , and later in St Katharine Docks. During this time, she remained the home and training ship of the Westminster Sea Cadet Corps. Despite significant superficial deterioration and some rotten timbers in her outer and upper hull, &quot;Discovery&quot; was found to be sound below the waterline and structurally solid.

She reverted to the Royal Research Ship (RRS) designation and was open to the public as a museum. The Sea Cadets unit eventually relocated to onshore premises in Pimlico situated in the converted basement of a local council estate. The Maritime Trust spent some £500,000 on essential restoration until she was passed into the ownership of the Dundee Heritage Trust in 1985.

===Transportation from London to Dundee===

On 28 March 1986, &quot;Discovery&quot; left London aboard the semi-submersible docklift ship &quot;Happy Mariner&quot; to make her journey home to the Scottish city that had built her. She arrived at Victoria Dock on the River Tay on 3 April – the first time she had been back to Dundee since her construction.

===Discovery Point, Dundee===

Placed in a custom-built dock in 1992, &quot;Discovery&quot; is now the centrepiece of Dundee&#x27;s visitor attraction Discovery Point.

She is displayed in a configuration as near as possible to her 1923 state, when she was refitted in the Vosper yard at Portsmouth. She is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet. Discovery Point is a fully accredited museum and has won numerous national awards, as well as being a 5-star rated tourist attraction with Visit Scotland. In 2008, &quot;Discovery&quot; and the associated polar collections were named as a Recognised Collection of National Significance.

Since the 1990s, the Discovery Point museum has concentrated on interpreting the vessel on all of her voyages, with personal items from the ship&#x27;s crew as well as information on her scientific activities. Items range from the games played by the crew on her first expedition to examples of sea fauna. Star objects on display include Captain Scott&#x27;s rifle and pipe.

&quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; three main voyages, the National Antarctic Expedition (1901–1904), the Discovery Oceanographic Expedition (1925–1927) and the BANZARE expedition (1929–31), are all explored in the museum through film and photographic evidence with artefacts from each era represented. The museum also holds other pieces from Scott&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition and Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Endurance&quot; expedition.

The ship also features on the crest of the coat of arms of the British Antarctic Territory.

==Subsequent ships==
There have been three subsequent royal research ships named &quot;Discovery&quot;. The second, RRS &quot;Discovery II&quot; (1929), and third, RRS &quot;Discovery&quot; (1962), subsequently left service. A fourth ship is the current RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;, which was built in 2013.

The spaceship &quot;Discovery One&quot; in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was named by Clarke after RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;; Clarke used to eat his lunch aboard her, as she was moored near the office where he worked in London.

The Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; is named for RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;, and other famous ships of the same name, particularly Captain Cook&#x27;s HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; and Henry Hudson&#x27;s &quot;Discovery&quot;.

<text>This article on the history of Afghanistan covers the period from the fall of the Najibullah government in 1992 to the end of the international military presence in Afghanistan.

==Background==
After the Soviet Union withdrew completely from Afghanistan in February 1989, fighting between the communist backed government and mujahideen continued. With material help from the Soviets, Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s government survived, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was overthrown on April 28, 1992. The forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum surrendered to Ahmed Shah Massoud and Kabul was left without defenses and soon fell to Massoud. At the time, Doustum had 1,500 militia in Kabul airport.

==Islamic State of Afghanistan (1992-1996)==

Seeking to resolve these differences, the leaders of the Peshawar-based mujahideen groups established an interim Jamiat-e Islami in mid-April to assume power in Kabul. Moderate leader Prof. Sibghatullah Mojadeddi was to chair the council for 2 months, after which a 10-member leadership council composed of mujahideen leaders and presided over by the head of the Jamiat-i-Islami, Prof. Burhanuddin Rabbani, was to be set up for 4 months. During this 6-month period, a Loya Jirga, or grand council of Afghan elders and notables, would convene and designate an interim administration which would hold power up to a year, pending elections.

But in May 1992, Rabbani prematurely formed the leadership council, undermining Mojaddedi&#x27;s fragile authority. On June 28, 1992, Mojaddedi surrendered power to the Leadership Council, which then elected Rabbani as President. Nonetheless, heavy fighting broke out in August 1992 in Kabul between forces loyal to President Rabbani and rival factions, particularly those who supported Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin. After Rabbani extended his tenure in December 1992, fighting in the capital flared up in January and February 1993. The Islamabad Accord, signed in March 1993, which appointed Hekmatyar as Prime Minister, failed to have a lasting effect. A follow-up agreement, the Jalalabad Accord, called for the militias to be disarmed but was never fully implemented. Through 1993, Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-i-Islami forces, allied with the Shi&#x27;a Hezb-i-Wahdat militia, clashed intermittently with Rabbani and Massoud&#x27;s Jamiat forces. Cooperating with Jamiat were militants of Sayyaf&#x27;s Ittehad-i-Islami and, periodically, troops loyal to ethnic Uzbek strongman Abdul Rashid Dostam. On January 1, 1994, Dostam switched sides, precipitating large scale fighting in Kabul and in northern provinces, which caused thousands of civilian casualties in Kabul and elsewhere and created a new wave of displaced persons and refugees. The country sank even further into anomie, forces loyal to Rabbani and Masud, both ethnic Tajiks, controlled Kabul and much of the northeast, while local warlords exerted power over the rest of the country.

==Islamic Emirate and the Taliban (1996-2001)==

In reaction to the warlordism prevalent in the country, and the lack of Pashtun representation in the Kabul government, the Taliban movement arose. Many Taliban had been educated in madrasas in Pakistan and were largely from rural Pashtun backgrounds. This group was made up of mostly Pashtuns that dedicated itself to removing the warlords, providing law and order, and imposing strict Islamic Sharia law on the country. In 1994 it developed enough strength to capture the city of Kandahar from a local warlord and proceeded to expand its control throughout Afghanistan, controlling Herat in September 1995, then Kabul in September 1996, and declaring the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. By this time Afghanistan was in its 17th year of war. It had the highest infant, child and maternal mortality rates in Asia. An estimated 10 million landmines covered its terrain. Two million refugees were in camps.

Pakistan recognized the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan in 1997. By the end of 2000, the Taliban controlled about 95% of the country, limiting the opposition to a small corner in the northeast Panjshir Valley. Efforts by the UN, prominent Afghans living outside the country, and other interested countries to bring about a peaceful solution to the continuing conflict came to nothing, largely because of intransigence on the part of the Taliban.

The Taliban sought to impose an extreme interpretation of Islam—based in part upon rural Pashtun tradition—upon the entire country and committed human rights violations, particularly directed against women and girls, in the process. Women were restricted from working outside the home or pursuing an education, were not to leave their homes without an accompanying male relative, and required to wear a traditional burqa.The Taliban repressed minority populations, particularly the Shia, as a retaliation in which approximately 2,500 Taliban soldiers were massacred by Abdul Malik and his Shia followers; attacked the Iranian embassy, killing eight diplomats and a television reporter, claiming them as spies.

In 2001, as part of a drive against relics of Afghanistan&#x27;s pre-Islamic past, the Taliban destroyed two large statues of Buddha outside of the city of Bamiyan and announced destruction of all pre-Islamic statues in Afghanistan, including the remaining holdings of the Kabul Museum.In addition to the continuing civil strife, the country suffered from widespread poverty, drought, a devastated infrastructure, and ubiquitous use of landmines. These conditions led to about a million Afghans facing starvation. The February and May 1998 earthquakes killed thousands of Afghans in the northeast Badakhshan Province.

==International Intervention and Interim Government (2001-2004)==
From the mid-1990s the Taliban provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi national who had fought with them against the Soviets, and provided a base for his and other terrorist organizations. The United Nations Security Council repeatedly sanctioned the Taliban for these activities. Bin Laden provided both financial and political support to the Taliban, as did Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, until American pressure forced them to drop their public support for the Taliban after September 11, 2001. Bin Laden and his al Qaeda group were charged with the bombing of the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam in 1998, and in August 1998 the United States launched a cruise missile attack against bin Laden&#x27;s terrorist camp in Afghanistan. Bin Laden and al Qaeda are believed responsible for the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, among other crimes.

By September 2001 the remaining opposition to the Taliban had been confined to the Panjshir Valley and a small region in the northeast. The opposition by this time had formed the Afghan Northern Alliance but controlled less than 5% of the country. Nevertheless, they held onto Afghanistan&#x27;s diplomatic representation in the United Nations as only three countries in the world continued to recognize the Taliban government. On September 9, agents working on behalf of the Taliban and believed to be associated with bin Laden&#x27;s al Qaeda group assassinated Northern Alliance Defense Minister and chief military commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, a hero of the Afghan resistance against the Soviets and the Taliban&#x27;s principal military opponent. Following the Taliban&#x27;s repeated refusal to expel bin Laden and his group and end its support for international terrorism, the United States and its partners launched an invasion of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001.

A period of bombing followed, which for about a month appeared to be having little effect. The US required the assistance of countries around Afghanistan to provide a route for the attack, but criticism increased as various mosques, aid agencies, hospitals, and other civilian buildings were damaged by US bombs. However, the Northern Alliance, fighting against a Taliban weakened by US bombing and massive defections, captured Mazari Sharif on November 9. It rapidly gained control of most of northern Afghanistan and took control of Kabul on November 13 after the Taliban unexpectedly fled the city. The Taliban were restricted to a smaller and smaller region, with Kunduz, the last Taliban-held city in the north, captured on November 26. Most of the Taliban fled to Pakistan. The war continued in the south of the country, where the Taliban retreated to Kandahar. After Kandahar fell in December, remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda continued to mount resistance.

Following the Ioya Jirga in June 2002, a transitional government was put in place to govern Afghanistan, overseen by the United Nations and the Bush administration of the United States. The assembly voted Hamid Karzai as President, a position he was reelected to in successor governments until 2014.

== Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004-2021) ==

The 2003 Ioya Jirga saw an assembly vote and approve the foundations of a new republic and constitution for Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic saw NATO troops being maintained in the country while fighting the Taliban insurgency. The first election for president was held in 2004, Hamid Karzai was declared the winner and became President of the Islamic Republic. Karzai won reelection in 2009 and left office in 2014. He was succeeded by Ashraf Ghani who won the 2014 presidential election and reelected in 2019.

== Reinstatement of the Islamic Emirate (2021-present) ==
NATO troops began to slowly withdraw international troops from Afghanistan as the war continued. Concurrently in 2021, the Taliban insurgency quickly began to see success, capturing 33 of the 34 provincial capitals of Afghanistan in the span of three months. On August 15, 2021, the Taliban captured Kabul with President Ghani fleeing the country. Anti Taliban-forces along with the remnants of the Islamic Republic formed the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, launching an insurgency against the Taliban from the Panjshir Valley.

<text>The Islamic State of Afghanistan was established by the Peshawar Accords of 26 April 1992. Many Afghan mujahideen parties participated in its creation, after the fall of the socialist government. Its power was limited due to the country&#x27;s second civil war, which was won by the Taliban, who took control of Kabul in 1996. The Islamic state then transitioned to a government in exile and led the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. It remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan at the United Nations until 2001, when the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan was created and an Afghan Interim Administration took control of Afghanistan with US and NATO assistance following the overthrow of the first Taliban government. The Transitional Islamic State was subsequently transformed into the Islamic Republic, which existed until the Taliban seized power again in 2021 following a prolonged insurgency.

== Background ==

In March 1992, President Mohammad Najibullah, having lost the Russian support that upheld his government, agreed to resign and make way for a neutral, interim government. Several mujahideen parties started negotiations to form a national coalition government. But one group, the Hezb-e Islami led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, presumably supported and directed by Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), did not join the negotiations and announced its intent to conquer Kabul alone. Hekmatyar moved his troops to Kabul, and was allowed into the town soon after 17 April. This left the other mujahideen groups no choice but to enter Kabul, on 24 April, to prevent Hekmatyar from taking over national government.This ignited a civil war between five or six rival armies, (nearly) all backed by foreign states. Several mujahideen groups proclaimed an &#x27;interim government&#x27; on 26 April 1992 but this never attained real authority over Afghanistan.

== History ==
=== Rabbani and Hekmatyar ===

President Mohammad Najibullah, leader of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, was forced to resign on 15 April 1992. The Peshawar Accord of 25 April 1992, which established a power-sharing interim government to take control of Kabul, was signed by six of the seven major Afghan anti-Soviet resistance parties (notably excluding the Hezb-e Islami [&quot;Islamic Party&quot;] faction of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a Pashtun, who refused to sign the Accord), and supported by some remnants of the Najibullah administration. An Islamic state was proclaimed, Islamic law introduced, bars were closed, and women were ordered to wear the hijab. In June, Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the Tajik-dominated Jamiat-e Islami (&quot;Islamic Association&quot;) faction, was made interim-president of the new Islamic State of Afghanistan, and on 30 December 1992 he was elected head of the 7-member Government Council for a two-year term. However, Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e Islami rebel faction (which had split from Jamiat-e Islami in 1976) demanded a share in power as well, and started clashing with Rabbani&#x27;s troops. After months of fighting, they signed an agreement in March 1993 making Hekmatyar the Prime Minister of Afghanistan in June, and shortening Rabbani&#x27;s presidency from 2 years to 1.5 year. Fighting between different rebel factions continued, however, and Kabul was largely destroyed.

=== Rise of the Taliban ===

In late 1994, a new Pashtun-dominated Islamic fundamentalist militia called the Taliban () managed to conquer large parts of southern Afghanistan with the support of Pakistan. Making steady gains throughout 1995 and 1996, the Taliban were able to seize control of the capital city of Kabul in September 1996, driving the Rabbani government and other factions northward, and by the end of the year occupying two-thirds of Afghanistan. Former president Najibullah was arrested and executed in public by hanging on 27 September 1996.

The Taliban renamed the country the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, and imposed an even more strict version of Sharia and purdah on the population they controlled. This especially negatively impacted women, who were forced to wear a burqa, stay indoors and banned from working outside the house with rare exceptions. Almost all girls lost access to education, increasing illiteracy rates. Movie theaters, soccer stadiums, and television stations were now closed as well.

=== The Northern Alliance ===
The ousted Rabbani government formed a political coalition with Tajik leader Ahmed Shah Massoud, Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, and the Shia Hizb-i-Wahdat faction (dominated by Hazaras) of Karim Khalili. Its formal name was United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, known in the Western world as the Northern Alliance, and its goal was to take back the country from the Taliban. 
By the end of May 1997, the Taliban offensive came to a halt due to a number of strategic victories by the Northern Alliance. International pressure forced both sides to negotiate, but the demands posed by either party were so high that the differences were irreconcilable, and a political impasse ensued. The country was in a dire state according to a 1997 United Nations report, which found that the infant mortality rate was 25%, numerous civil casualties due to landmines, economic blockades imposed by the militias causing hunger, and international humanitarian organisations being unable to carry out their work. A February 1998 earthquake in northeastern Afghanistan killed 4,500 people.

In the first half of 1998, the negotiations appeared to reach a peace settlement, but then the Northern Alliance fell apart. Taking advantage of the resistance factions&#x27; disunity the Taliban launched a campaign, rapidly conquering the provincial capital cities of Maimana, Sheberghan, and finally Mazar-i-Sharif (8 August 1998). Taliban fighters committed a massacre amongst the Shia population of the last city, also killing eight Iranian diplomats and journalists. This aroused international outrage, and brought the Taliban regime on the brink of war with Iran.

The Northern Alliance drove the Taliban away in December 2001, following the United States invasion of Afghanistan. The Islamic State of Afghanistan was succeeded by the interim Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan in 2002.

<text>Argenteuil () is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris. Argenteuil is a sub-prefecture of the Val-d&#x27;Oise department, the seat of the arrondissement of Argenteuil. Argenteuil is part of the Métropole du Grand Paris.

Argenteuil is the fourth most populous commune in the suburbs of Paris (after Boulogne-Billancourt, Saint-Denis, and Montreuil) and the most populous one in the Val-d&#x27;Oise department, although it is not its prefecture, which is shared between the communes of Cergy and Pontoise.

Argenteuil shares borders with communes in 3 departements others than &quot;Val d&#x27;Oise&quot; : the Yvelines, Hauts-de-Seine, and Seine-Saint-Denis departements.

==Name==

The name Argenteuil is recorded for the first time in a royal charter of 697 as &quot;Argentoialum&quot;, from a Latin/Gaulish root &quot;argento&quot; meaning &quot;silver&quot;, &quot;silvery&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, perhaps in reference to the gleaming surface of the river Seine, on the banks of which Argenteuil is located, and from a Gaulish language suffix &quot;-ialo&quot; meaning &quot;clearing, glade&quot; or &quot;place of&quot;.

==History==
Argenteuil was founded as a convent in the 7th century (see Pierre Abélard and the Convent of Argenteuil). The monastery that arose from the convent was later destroyed during the French Revolution.

A rural escape for Parisians, it is now a suburb of Paris. Painters made Argenteuil famous, including Claude Monet, Eugène Delacroix, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Alfred Sisley and Georges Braque.

The Hotel de Ville was completed in 1994.

==Transport==
Argenteuil is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail line, which are Argenteuil and Val d&#x27;Argenteuil.

Since redeveloped by STIF and SNCF, Argenteuil has been equipped with the new Paris-Saint-Lazare-Ermont-Eaubonne line. The new line was launched in 2006, adding the Paris-Saint Lazare / Cormeilles-en-Parisis - Pontoise / Mantes-la-Jolie service to Paris for about ten minutes.

<doc id="291726" wikidata="Q3506949" url="?curid=291726" title="Emergency tourniquet">
<text>Emergency tourniquets are cuff-like devices designed to stop severe traumatic bleeding before or during transport to a care facility. They are wrapped around the limb, proximal to the site of trauma, and tightened until all blood vessels underneath are occluded. The design and construction of emergency tourniquets allows quick application by first aid responders or the injured persons themselves. Correct use of tourniquet devices has been shown to save lives under austere conditions with comparatively low risk of injury. In field trials, prompt application of emergency tourniquets before the patient goes into shock are associated with higher survival rates than any other scenario where tourniquets were used later or not at all.

==Tourniquet design==

Existing guidelines call for the use of improvised &quot;rope-and-stick&quot; tourniquets as a last resort to stop severe bleeding. However, purpose-made tourniquet devices that are well designed can provide greatly increased safety and efficacy. Variability in performance has been shown to exist between various designs and application methods.

===Mechanical advantage===
Mechanisms that confer sufficient mechanical advantage are essential for applying adequate pressure to stop bleeding, particularly on the lower extremities. Pressures that occlude venous but not arterial flow can exacerbate hemorrhage and cause damage to healthy tissue.

====Mechanical characteristics of emergency tourniquet devices====

Most commercial tourniquets cost in the range from $30-$50 (USD). Results from laboratory and field testing suggest that windlass and pneumatic mechanisms are effective where other systems fail due to excessive pain, slipping, inadequate force, or mechanical failure.

===Pressure gradients===
Pressure underneath a tourniquet cuff is not evenly distributed, with the highest pressures localized around the cuff center line and decreasing to zero near the cuff edges. A high rate of change of pressure across the cuff width, or a high cuff pressure gradient, is a leading cause of nerve and muscle injury from tourniquet use. Tourniquets with wider straps or cuffs, especially those with pneumatic actuation in contrast to mechanical force, distribute pressure more evenly and produce lower pressure gradients. They are therefore more likely to stop bleeding and less likely to cause damage to underlying tissue, in addition to being significantly less painful than tourniquets with narrow straps and bands. Over pressure protection in certain emergency tourniquets also help to prevent excessive force from damaging the limb.

==Risks==
Possible risks of complications—morbidity—related to emergency tourniquet use include 
Emergency care services implementing routine tourniquet use, especially in the civilian setting, should exercise caution and ensure that training is adequate for optimal results. However, given proper precautions, the occurrence of complications due to tourniquet use is quite rare. Designed tourniquet devices are routinely tightened over healthy limbs during training with no ill effects, and recent evidence from combat hospitals in Iraq suggests that morbidity rates are low when users adhere to standard best practices. Since no better alternatives exist for users to self-apply with only basic training, the benefit of tourniquet use far outweighs the risks.

Safe tourniquet practice involves:
==Current developments==
=== Field experience ===
Latest field trials suggest that wider straps are more effective and less painful than tourniquets with thinner straps. The concept of limb occlusion pressure is also gaining prominence over the misconception that greater applied force results in greater effectiveness. In addition, studies of failed cases indicate that the correct devices should be coupled with training that facilitates realistic expectations and correct user actions. The Stop The Bleed educational initiative provides knowledge aimed at the greater public on when to use a tourniquet and the correct user actions.

=== Emerging needs ===
Despite the success of widespread tourniquet deployment to limit combat casualties, many preventable deaths from hemorrhage occur where conventional tourniquet use is inappropriate. The need exists for controlling junctional bleeding, especially in the pelvic area. In 2012, the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC) was selected by the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) for that purpose. Another emerging need is more refined training regimes and doctrine based on scientific evidence, which can ensure that future tourniquet practice and policies are in line with the most current body of knowledge.

<doc id="291727" wikidata="Q707806" url="?curid=291727" title="Hemostat">
<text>A hemostat (also called a hemostatic clamp; arterial forceps; and pean, after Jules-Émile Péan) is a tool used to control bleeding during surgery. Similar in design to both pliers and scissors, it is used to clamp exposed blood vessels shut.

Hemostats belong to a group of instruments that pivot (similar to scissors, and including needle holders, tissue holders, and some other clamps) where the structure of the tip determines the tool&#x27;s function.

A hemostat has handles that can be held in place by their locking mechanism, which usually is a series of interlocking teeth, a few on each handle, that allow the user to adjust the clamping force of the pliers. When the tips are locked together, the force between them is about 40 N (9 lbf).

Often in the first phases of surgery, the incision is lined with hemostats on blood vessels that are awaiting ligation.

==History==
The earliest known drawing of a pivoting surgical instrument dates from 1500 B.C. and is on a tomb at Thebes, Egypt. Later Roman bronze and steel pivot-controlled instruments were found in Pompeii. In the ninth century A.D., Abulcasis made illustrations of pivoting instruments for tooth extraction.

The concept of clamping a bleeding vessel with an instrument before tying it off is generally attributed to Galen, in the second century A.D. This method of hemostasis was largely forgotten until it was rediscovered by a French barber-surgeon, Ambroise Paré, in the 16th century. He made the predecessor to the modern hemostat and called it the &quot;Bec de Corbin&quot; (crow&#x27;s beak). With it he could clamp a bleeding vessel before securing it with a ligature.

Credit for the modern hemostat has been given to several persons, the foremost of whom is Jules-Émile Péan. Later surgeons, such as William Halsted, made small changes to the design.

==List of hemostats==
*Rankin forceps
*Kelly forceps
*Satinsky clamps
*Kocher forceps
*Crile forceps
*Halsted Mosquito forceps
*Mixter &quot;right angle&quot; forceps
*Spencer Wells artery forceps (the father of all artery forceps used today)

<text>Punk&#x27;d is an American hidden camera–practical joke reality television series that first aired on MTV in 2003. It was created by Ashton Kutcher and Jason Goldberg, with Kutcher serving as producer and host. It bears a resemblance to both the classic hidden camera show &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and to &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes&quot;, which also featured pranks on celebrities. Being &quot;punk&#x27;d&quot; referred to being the victim of such a prank. New episodes hosted by King Bach and DeStorm Power aired on BET.

A reboot of the series hosted by Chance the Rapper premiered on Quibi in 2020&lt;ref name=&quot;/Film-90&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to The Roku Channel until its cancellation in December 2021.

==History and format==
Originally, Ashton Kutcher and MTV were developing a program called &quot;Harassment&quot;, a hidden camera show which would feature pranks on regular everyday anonymous people. However, a January 2002 prank involving a fake dead body at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas backfired and the couple who were targets of the prank sued Kutcher, MTV, and the hotel for $10 million. The concept was later retooled to involve celebrities instead. Pranks would be set at a variety of locations, public and private. One of the show&#x27;s first pranks was set at singer Justin Timberlake&#x27;s home, where he was led to believe that government agents were seizing his home and valuables because of unpaid income taxes. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked the prank #3 on its list of 32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History. Another (the very first) involved Frankie Muniz&#x27;s special custom-made limited edition Porsche being stolen.

A frequent segment during the first two seasons was a &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; cast member pretending to interview celebrities at red carpet events, only to mock them instead. This segment closely copies what originated on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in the 1980s, when Stern and his writers began sending interns (most notably Stuttering John Melendez) to ask celebrities embarrassing questions on the red carpet. During the first season then-fifteen-year-old Ryan Pinkston posed as a reporter from a children&#x27;s television program, and would insult the celebrities. During season two, the producers then chose a foreign interviewer accompanied by her interpreter who would then ask inane questions to the guests. Several actors, like Jill Wagner, Masi Oka, B. J. Novak, Caitlyn Taylor Love, Dax Shepard, and a then-unknown Bill Hader were accomplices in the pranks. But when the next celebrity targets who saw the show would recognize the members of &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; and realized what was happening to them, the show would get new field agents every season.

The series finale aired on MTV on May 29, 2007, and culminated in early June with the Punk&#x27;d Awards.

===Revival===
In October 2010, &quot;New York Magazine&quot; revealed that &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; was being revived with Justin Bieber replacing Kutcher as the host; however, it stated that Kutcher would remain as executive producer. After a five-year hiatus, the program was revived with a March 2012 premiere. The first episode of the ninth season, featuring Bieber as a guest host, was filmed in late August 2011. On December 31, 2011, MTV confirmed that the program would be revived in 2012, and that a different celebrity guest host would be featured each episode, the guests included: Tyler, the Creator, Justin Bieber, Bam Margera, Hayden Panettiere, Lucy Hale, Nick Cannon, Dax Shepard, Ashley Tisdale, Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus, Heather Morris, Kellan Lutz, Daniel Tosh, and Mac Miller. Ashton Kutcher made a returning appearance on an episode where he got to punk again.

The ninth season ended on June 7, 2012.

===BET reboot===
On May 25, 2013, Katalyst Media stated that a tenth season was in development. At their 2015 upfronts, BET announced that they would be rebooting the program for their network. Although Katalyst had closed by then Goldberg returned as executive producer with a revival of the Katalyst banner without Kutcher. Ryan Good also executive produced. The reboot is tailored for the network&#x27;s audience and goes behind the scenes of many pranks. The reboot premiered on August 18, 2015.

To promote the program, BET announced the return of &quot;&quot;, a block for uncut music videos, on August 11, 2015. In reality, after a revelation and introduction from new hosts, King Bach and DeStorm Power, BET aired highlights from past segments of the program as well as previews for their program.

===Quibi reboot===
In 2020, it was announced that a new &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; reboot would air on the mobile video platform Quibi hosted by Chance the Rapper. After Quibi was shut down in December 2020, on January 8, 2021, Roku bought the rights to Quibi&#x27;s content library, including &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; for seven years. Season 2 premiered on The Roku Channel on December 10, 2021.

==Syndication==

Punk&#x27;d began in off-network syndication in 2008 and in the fall of that year, Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media put it into barter syndication and aired on affiliates of Fox, MyNetworkTV, The CW, and Independent stations. However, as of fall 2012, the show has left local syndication along with &quot;The Hills&quot; and &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; due to lack of ratings.

<doc id="291729" wikidata="Q215231" url="?curid=291729" title="Great Fire of Rome">
<text>The Great Fire of Rome () began on the 19th of July 64 AD. The fire started in the merchant shops around Rome&#x27;s chariot stadium, Circus Maximus. After six days, the fire was brought under control, but before the damage could be assessed, the fire reignited and burned for another three days. In the aftermath of the fire, 71% of Rome had been destroyed (10 out of 14 districts).

According to Tacitus and later Christian tradition, Emperor Nero blamed the devastation on the Christian community in the city, initiating the empire&#x27;s first persecution against the Christians. Other contemporary historians blamed Nero&#x27;s incompetence but it is commonly agreed by historians now that Rome was so tightly packed a fire was inevitable.

== Background ==
=== Previous recorded fires in Rome ===
Fires in Rome were common, especially in houses, and fires that had occurred previously in Rome and destroyed parts of major buildings include:
* AD 6, which led to the introduction of the Cohortes Vigiles
* AD 12 which destroyed the Basilica Julia
* AD 14 at the Basilica Aemilia
* AD 22 at the Campus Martius
* AD 26 at Caelian Hill
* AD 36 at the Circus Maximus

=== Nero ===
Nero was proclaimed Roman emperor in AD 54 at the age of 17. His rule has commonly been associated with impulsiveness and tyranny but was, for the most part, liked by the general populace and only really disliked by the aristocracy. Early in his reign, he was heavily advised, but he slowly became more independent. In AD 59, encouraged by his mistress Poppaea, Nero murdered his mother Agrippina. His leading adviser, Seneca, was discharged and forced to commit suicide. After the Great Fire of Rome occurred in July AD 64, it was rumored that Nero had ordered the fire to clear space for a new palace, the Domus Aurea. At the time of the fire Nero may not have been in the city but 35 miles away at his villa in Antium, and possibly returned to the city before the fire was out.

=== Tacitus ===
Publius Cornelius Tacitus was a senator and historian of the Roman Empire. His exact birth date is unknown, but most sources place it in either AD 56 or 57. His two main works, the &quot;Annals&quot; and the &quot;Histories&quot;, covered the history of the empire between AD 14 and AD 96. However, much of the work has been lost, including the books covering events after AD 70. Tacitus was only eight years old at the time of the fire, but he was able to use public records and reports to write an accurate account.

=== Vigiles ===
In 22 BC, Augustus funded a fire brigade.
In AD 6, he introduced the &quot;Vigiles&quot; (&quot;cohorts of the watchmen&quot;). The &quot;cohortes vigilum&quot;, run by freedmen, were tasked with guarding Rome at night while the &quot;cohortes urbanae&quot; were tasked with guarding Rome during the day. By the time of the Great Fire of Rome, there were thousands of &quot;Vigiles&quot; in the city, and they went to work trying to stop the flames by pouring buckets of water into buildings, trying to move flammable material from the fire&#x27;s path, and even demolishing buildings to attempt to make a fire break.

=== Rome&#x27;s water system ===
Before the fire, Rome&#x27;s water was brought in by nine aqueducts, which were not set up with equipment to fight fires. Carrying out repairs to the aqueducts was an ongoing task for the &quot;Curator Aquarum&quot; or Water Commissioner of Rome. The &quot;Curator Aquarum&quot; was also in charge of investigations into those who were illegally piping water away without paying a license fee to the state. Firefighters relied on blankets, buckets of water, vinegar, and demolition of buildings to put fires out.

==Outbreak and progress of fire==
According to Tacitus, the fire began in shops where flammable goods were stored, in the region of the Circus neighboring the Caelian and Palatine Hills of Rome. The night brought strong winds and the flames rapidly spread along the full length of the Circus. The fire expanded through an area of narrow, twisting streets and closely located apartment blocks. In this lower area of ancient Rome, there were no large buildings such as temples, or open areas of ground, to impede the conflagration. It then spread along the Palatine and Caelian slopes. The population fled first to areas unaffected by the fire and then to the open fields and rural roads outside the city. Looters and arsonists were reported to have spread the flames by throwing torches or, acting in groups, hindering measures being made to halt or slow the progress of the flames. Some groups responsible for throwing torches and stopping those from fighting the fire were reported to have claimed they were under orders to do so. The fire stopped after six days of continuous burning. However, it soon reignited and burned for another three days.

Tests into how fires spread have shown that large fires are able to create their own wind and this, combined with embers being blown to new buildings, could have caused the fire to spread further and could account for witnesses claiming that random fires started in houses that were away from the flames. As well as wind playing a factor in fire spread, those who had claimed to be under orders to stop people from fighting the fires never named the one who ordered them and they were also reported to have looted buildings.

== Aftermath ==

According to Tacitus, Nero was away from Rome, in Antium, when the fire broke out. Nero returned to the city and took measures to bring in food supplies and to open gardens and public buildings to accommodate refugees. Of Rome&#x27;s fourteen districts, three were completely devastated, seven more were reduced to a few scorched and mangled ruins and only four completely escaped damage. The Temple of Jupiter Stator, the House of the Vestals, and Nero&#x27;s palace, the Domus Transitoria were damaged or destroyed. Also destroyed in the fire was the portion of the Forum where the Roman senators lived and worked. However, the open space in the middle of the Forum remained a shopping/meeting centre. The accusations of Nero having started the fire were further exacerbated by his quickness to rebuild burned neighbourhoods in the Greek style and to launch construction of his new palace.

For the city&#x27;s reconstruction, Nero dictated new and far-sighted building rules, intended to curb the excesses of speculation and trace a new urban plan, which still can be discerned from the city layout today. He rebuilt much of the destroyed area, and had the ostentatious building complex known as Domus Aurea (Golden House) built, his personal residence (replacing the Domus Transitoria and including an extension of about 2.5 km2), which came to include the Palatine, the slopes of the Esquiline (Opium) and part of the Celio. This may not have been a possible motive for the fire, as he could have requisitioned the necessary land anyway, and most was already in his possession.

To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction, Nero&#x27;s government increased taxation. In particular heavy tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire. To meet at least a proportion of the costs, Nero devalued the Roman currency, increasing inflationary pressure for the first time in the Empire&#x27;s history.

Debris from the fire was used as fill for the nearby malaria-infested marshes.

Christians, blamed by Nero for the fire, were identified, arrested, and killed. Some, for the entertainment of spectators, were torn to pieces by hunting dogs, others were crucified in ways calculated to make them look ridiculous. According to St Jerome, the total number of Christians martyred by Nero was 979.

==Varying historical accounts==

The varying historical accounts of the event come from three secondary sources—Cassius Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus. The primary accounts, which possibly included histories written by Fabius Rusticus, Marcus Cluvius Rufus, and Pliny the Elder, do not survive. At least six separate stories circulate regarding Nero and the fire:
* Motivated by a desire to destroy the city, Nero secretly sent out men pretending to be drunk to set fire to the city. Nero watched from his palace on the Palatine Hill, singing and playing the lyre.
* Nero openly sent out men to set fire to the city. Nero watched from the Tower of Maecenas on the Esquiline Hill while singing.
* Nero sent out men to set fire to the city. There were unconfirmed rumors that Nero sang from a private stage during the fire.
* Nero was motivated to destroy the city so he would be able to bypass the senate and rebuild Rome in his image.
* Rumor had it that Nero had started the fire. Therefore, to blame someone else for it (and thus exonerate Nero from blame), the fire was said to have been caused by the already unpopular Christians.
* The fire was an accident that occurred while Nero was in Antium.

<text>A seaplane is a powered fixed-wing aircraft capable of taking off and landing (alighting) on water. Seaplanes are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: floatplanes and flying boats; the latter are generally far larger and can carry far more. Seaplanes that can also take off and land on airfields are in a subclass called amphibious aircraft, or amphibians. Seaplanes were sometimes called &quot;hydroplanes&quot;, but currently this term applies instead to motor-powered watercraft that use the technique of hydrodynamic lift to skim the surface of water when running at speed.

The use of seaplanes gradually tapered off after World War II, partially because of the investments in airports during the war but mainly because landplanes were less constrained by weather conditions that could result in sea states being too high to operate seaplanes while landplanes could continue to operate. In the 21st century, seaplanes maintain a few niche uses, such as for aerial firefighting, air transport around archipelagos, and access to undeveloped or roadless areas, some of which have numerous lakes. In British English, seaplane is sometimes used specifically to refer to a floatplane, rather than a flying boat.

== Types ==

The word &quot;seaplane&quot; is used to describe two types of air/water vehicles: the floatplane and the flying boat.

* A floatplane has slender floats, mounted under the fuselage. Two floats are common, but other configurations are possible. Only the floats of a floatplane normally come into contact with water. The fuselage remains above water. Some small land aircraft can be modified to become float planes, and in general, floatplanes are small aircraft. Floatplanes are limited by their inability to handle wave heights typically greater than 12 inches (0.31 m). These floats add to the empty weight of the airplane and to the drag coefficient, resulting in reduced payload capacity, slower rate of climb, and slower cruise speed.
* In a flying boat, the main source of buoyancy is the fuselage, which acts like a ship&#x27;s hull in the water because the fuselage&#x27;s underside has been hydrodynamically shaped to allow water to flow around it. Most flying boats have small floats mounted on their wings to keep them stable. Not all small seaplanes have been floatplanes, but most large seaplanes have been flying boats, with their great weight supported by their hulls.

The term &quot;seaplane&quot; is used by some to mean &quot;floatplane&quot;. This is the standard British usage. This article treats both flying boats and floatplanes as types of seaplane, in the US fashion.

An amphibious aircraft can take off and land both on conventional runways and water. A true seaplane can only take off and land on water. There are amphibious flying boats and amphibious floatplanes, as well as some hybrid designs, &quot;e.g.&quot;, floatplanes with retractable floats.

Modern (2019) production seaplanes range in size from flying-boat type light-sport aircraft amphibians, such as the Icon A5 and AirMax SeaMax, to the 100,000 lb ShinMaywa US-2 and Beriev Be-200 multi-role amphibians. Examples in between include the Dornier Seastar flying-boat type, 12-seat, utility amphibian and the Canadair CL-415 amphibious water-bomber. The Viking Air DHC-6 Twin Otter and Cessna Caravan utility aircraft have landing gear options which include amphibious floats.

==History==

Taking off on water was attempted by some early flight attempts, but water take off and landing began in earnest in the 1910s and seaplanes pioneered transatlantic routes, and were used in World War I. They continued to develop before World War II, and had widespread use. After World War II, the creation of so many land airstrips meant water landings began to drift into special applications. They continued in niches such as access in remote areas, forest fire fighting, and maritime patrol. 

===Early pioneers===

The Frenchman Alphonse Pénaud filed the first patent for a flying machine with a boat hull and retractable landing gear in 1876, but Austrian Wilhelm Kress is credited with building the first seaplane, &quot;Drachenflieger,&quot; in 1898, although its two Daimler engines were inadequate for take-off, and it later sank when one of its two floats collapsed.

On 6 June 1905, Gabriel Voisin took off and landed on the River Seine with a towed kite glider on floats. The first of his unpowered flights was . He later built a powered floatplane in partnership with Louis Blériot, but the machine was unsuccessful.

Other pioneers also attempted to attach floats to aircraft in Britain, Australia, France and the United States.

On 28 March 1910, Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered &quot;hydravion&quot;, a trimaran floatplane. Fabre&#x27;s first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators, and he designed floats for several other flyers. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. This led to the first scheduled seaplane passenger services, at Aix-les-Bains, using a five-seat Sanchez-Besa from 1 August 1912. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in 1912. On May 10, 1912 Glenn L. Martin flew a homemade seaplane in California, setting records for distance and time.

In 1911−12, François Denhaut constructed the first seaplane with a fuselage forming a hull, using various designs to give hydrodynamic lift at take-off. Its first successful flight was on 13 April 1912.
Throughout 1910 and 1911, American pioneering aviator Glenn Curtiss developed his floatplane into the successful Curtiss Model D land-plane, which used a larger central float and sponsons. Combining floats with wheels, he made the first amphibian flights in February 1911 and was awarded the first Collier Trophy for US flight achievement. From 1912, his experiments with a hulled seaplane resulted in the 1913 Model E and Model F, which he called &quot;flying-boats&quot;. 
In February 1911, the United States Navy took delivery of the Curtiss Model E and soon tested landings on and take-offs from ships, using the Curtiss Model D.

There were experiments by aviators to adapt the Wright Model B to a water landing. The first motion picture recorded from an airplane was from a Wright Model B floatplane, by Frank Coffyn in 1911. The Wright Brothers, widely celebrated for their breakthrough aircraft designs, were slower to develop a seaplane; Wilbur died in 1912, and the company was bogged down in lawsuits. However, by 1913, the Wright Brother company developed the Wright Model CH Flyer. In 1913, the Wright company also came out withe Wright Model G Aerboat, which was a seaplane with an enclosed cabin (a first for the company);the chief engineer of this version was Grover Loening.

In Britain, Captain Edward Wakefield and Oscar Gnosspelius began to explore the feasibility of flight from water in 1908. They decided to make use of Windermere in the Lake District, England&#x27;s largest lake. The latter&#x27;s first attempts to fly attracted large crowds, though the aircraft failed to take off and required a re-design of the floats incorporating features from the boat hulls of the lake&#x27;s motor boat racing club member Isaac Borwick. Meanwhile, Wakefield ordered a floatplane similar to the design of the 1910 Fabre Hydravion. By November 1911, both Gnosspelius and Wakefield had aircraft capable of flight from water and awaited suitable weather conditions. Gnosspelius&#x27;s flight was short-lived, as the aircraft crashed into the lake. Wakefield&#x27;s pilot, however, taking advantage of a light northerly wind, successfully took off and flew at a height of to Ferry Nab, where he made a wide turn and returned for a perfect landing on the lake&#x27;s surface.

In Switzerland, Émile Taddéoli equipped the Dufaux 4 biplane with swimmers and successfully took off in 1912. A seaplane was used during the Balkan Wars in 1913, when a Greek &quot;Astra Hydravion&quot; did a reconnaissance of the Turkish fleet and dropped four bombs.

===Birth of an industry===
In 1913, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper put up a £10,000 prize for the first non-stop aerial crossing of the Atlantic, which was soon &quot;enhanced by a further sum&quot; from the &quot;Women&#x27;s Aerial League of Great Britain&quot;.

American businessman Rodman Wanamaker became determined that the prize should go to an American aircraft and commissioned the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to design and build an aircraft capable of making the flight. Curtiss&#x27;s development of the &quot;Flying Fish&quot; flying boat in 1913 brought him into contact with John Cyril Porte, a retired Royal Navy Lieutenant, aircraft designer and test pilot who was to become an influential British aviation pioneer. Recognising that many of the early accidents were attributable to a poor understanding of handling while in contact with the water, the pair&#x27;s efforts went into developing practical hull designs to make the transatlantic crossing possible.

The two years before World War I&#x27;s breakout also saw the privately produced pair of Benoist XIV biplane flying boats, designed by Thomas W. Benoist, initiate the start of the first heavier-than-air airline service anywhere in the world, and the first airline service of any kind at all in the United States.

At the same time, the British boat-building firm J. Samuel White of Cowes on the Isle of Wight set up a new aircraft division and produced a flying boat in the United Kingdom. This was displayed at the London Air Show at Olympia in 1913. In that same year, a collaboration between the S. E. Saunders boatyard of East Cowes and the Sopwith Aviation Company produced the &quot;Bat Boat&quot;, an aircraft with a consuta laminated hull that could operate from land or on water, which today is called an amphibious aircraft. The &quot;Bat Boat&quot; completed several landings on sea and on land and was duly awarded the Mortimer Singer Prize. It was the first all-British aeroplane capable of making six return flights over five miles within five hours.

In the US, Wanamaker&#x27;s commission built on Glen Curtiss&#x27;s previous development and experience with the Curtiss Model F for the U.S. Navy, which rapidly resulted in the &quot;America&quot;, designed under Porte&#x27;s supervision following his study and rearrangement of the flight plan; the aircraft was a conventional biplane design with two-bay, unstaggered wings of unequal span with two pusher inline engines mounted side-by-side above the fuselage in the interplane gap. Wingtip pontoons were attached directly below the lower wings near their tips. The design (later developed into the Model H) resembled Curtiss&#x27;s earlier flying boats but was built considerably larger so it could carry enough fuel to cover . The three crew members were accommodated in a fully enclosed cabin.

Trials of the &quot;America&quot; began 23 June 1914 with Porte also as Chief Test Pilot; testing soon revealed serious shortcomings in the design; it was under-powered, so the engines were replaced with more powerful tractor engines. There was also a tendency for the nose of the aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water. This phenomenon had not been encountered before, since Curtiss&#x27;s earlier designs had not used such powerful engines nor large fuel/cargo loads and so were relatively more buoyant. In order to counteract this effect, Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add hydrodynamic lift, but soon replaced these with sponsons, a type of underwater pontoon mounted in pairs on either side of a hull. These sponsons (or their engineering equivalents) and the flared, notched hull would remain a prominent feature of flying-boat hull design in the decades to follow. With the problem resolved, preparations for the crossing resumed. While the craft was found to handle &quot;heavily&quot; on takeoff, and required rather longer take-off distances than expected, the full moon on 5 August 1914 was selected for the trans-Atlantic flight; Porte was to pilot the &quot;America&quot; with George Hallett as co-pilot and mechanic.

===World War I (1914–1918)===
Curtiss and Porte&#x27;s plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Porte sailed for England on 4 August 1914 and rejoined the Navy as a member of the Royal Naval Air Service. Appointed Squadron Commander of Royal Navy Air Station Hendon, he soon convinced the Admiralty of the potential of flying boats and was put in charge of the naval air station at Felixstowe in 1915. Porte persuaded the Admiralty to commandeer (and later, purchase) the &quot;America&quot; and a sister craft from Curtiss. This was followed by an order for 12 more similar aircraft, one Model H-2 and the remaining as Model H-4s. Four examples of the latter were assembled in the UK by Saunders. All of these were similar to the design of the &quot;America&quot; and, indeed, were all referred to as &quot;America&quot;s in Royal Navy service. The engines, however, were changed from the under-powered 160 hp Curtiss engines to 250 hp Rolls-Royce Falcon engines. The initial batch was followed by an order for 50 more (totalling 64 &quot;Americas&quot; overall during the war). Porte also acquired permission to modify and experiment with the Curtiss aircraft.

The Curtiss H-4s were soon found to have a number of problems; they were underpowered, their hulls were too weak for sustained operations, and they had poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off. One flying boat pilot, Major Theodore Douglas Hallam, wrote that they were &quot;comic machines, weighing well under two tons; with two comic engines giving, when they functioned, 180 horsepower; and comic control, being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide.&quot;
At Felixstowe, Porte made advances in flying-boat design and developed a practical hull design with the distinctive &quot;Felixstowe notch&quot;.
Porte&#x27;s first design to be implemented in Felixstowe was the Felixstowe Porte Baby, a large, three-engined biplane flying boat, powered by one central pusher and two outboard tractor Rolls-Royce Eagle engines.

Porte modified an H-4 with a new hull whose improved hydrodynamic qualities made taxiing, take-off and landing much more practical and called it the Felixstowe F.1.

Porte&#x27;s innovation of the &quot;Felixstowe notch&quot; enabled the craft to overcome suction from the water more quickly and break free for flight much more easily. This made operating the craft far safer and more reliable. The &quot;notch&quot; breakthrough would soon after evolve into a &quot;step&quot;, with the rear section of the lower hull sharply recessed above the forward lower hull section, and that characteristic became a feature of both flying-boat hulls and seaplane floats. The resulting aircraft would be large enough to carry sufficient fuel to fly long distances and could berth alongside ships to take on more fuel.

Porte then designed a similar hull for the larger Curtiss H-12 flying boat which, while larger and more capable than the H-4s, shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling. The combination of the new Porte-designed hull, this time fitted with two steps, with the wings of the H-12 and a new tail, and powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, was named the Felixstowe F.2 and first flew in July 1916, proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which it was based. It was used as the basis for all future designs. It entered production as the Felixstowe F.2A, being used as a patrol aircraft, with about 100 being completed by the end of World War I. Another seventy were built, and these were followed by two F.2c, which were built at Felixstowe.

In February 1917, the first prototype of the Felixstowe F.3 was flown. It was larger and heavier than the F.2, giving it greater range and heavier bomb load, but poorer agility. Approximately 100 Felixstowe F.3s were produced before the end of the war.
The Felixstowe F.5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F.2 and F.3, with the prototype first flying in May 1918. The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but, to ease production, the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F.3, which resulted in lower performance than the F.2A or F.5.

Porte&#x27;s final design at the Seaplane Experimental Station was the 123-foot-span five-engined Felixstowe Fury triplane (also known as the &quot;Porte Super-Baby&quot; or &quot;PSB&quot;).

F.2, F.3, and F.5 flying boats were extensively employed by the Royal Navy for coastal patrols and to search for German U-boats.
In 1918, they were towed on lighters towards the northern German ports to extend their range; on 4 June 1918, this resulted in three F.2As engaging in a dogfight with ten German seaplanes, shooting down two confirmed and four probables at no loss. As a result of this action, British flying boats were dazzle-painted to aid identification in combat.
The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company independently developed its designs into the small Model F, the larger Model K (several of which were sold to the Russian Naval Air Service), and the Model C for the U.S. Navy. Curtiss, among others, also built the Felixstowe F.5 as the Curtiss F5L, based on the final Porte hull designs and powered by American Liberty engines.

Meanwhile, the pioneering flying-boat designs of François Denhaut had been steadily developed by the Franco-British Aviation Company into a range of practical craft. Smaller than the Felixstowes, several thousand FBAs served with almost all of the Allied forces as reconnaissance craft, patrolling the North Sea, Atlantic and Mediterranean Oceans.

In Italy, several seaplanes were developed, starting with the L series and progressing with the M series. The Macchi M.5, in particular, was extremely manoeuvrable and agile and matched the land-based aircraft it had to fight. Two hundred forty-four were built in total.
Towards the end of World War I, the aircraft were flown by Italian Navy Aviation, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen. Ensign Charles Hammann won the first Medal of Honor awarded to a United States naval aviator in an M.5

The German aircraft manufacturing company Hansa-Brandenburg built flying boats starting with the model Hansa-Brandenburg GW in 1916, and had a degree of military success with their Hansa-Brandenburg W.12 two-seat floatplane fighter the following year, being the primary aircraft flown by Imperial Germany&#x27;s maritime fighter ace, Friedrich Christiansen. The Austro-Hungarian firm Lohner-Werke began building flying boats, starting with the Lohner E in 1914 and the later (1915) widely copied Lohner L.

===Between the wars===

In September 1919, British company Supermarine started operating the first flying-boat service in the world, from Woolston to Le Havre in France, but it was short-lived.

A Curtiss NC-4 became the first airplane to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1919, crossing with multiple stops via the Azores. Of the four that made the attempt, only one completed the flight.

In 1923, the first successful commercial flying-boat service was introduced, with flights to and from the Channel Islands. After frequent appeals by the industry for subsidies, the Government decided that nationalization was necessary and ordered five aviation companies to merge to form the state-owned Imperial Airways of London (IAL). IAL became the international flag-carrying British airline, providing flying-boat passenger and mail-transport links between Britain and South Africa and India using aircraft such as the Short S.8 Calcutta.

In 1928, four Supermarine Southampton flying boats of the RAF Far East flight arrived in Melbourne, Australia. The flight was considered proof that flying boats had become a reliable means of long-distance transport.
In the 1930s, flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U.S. and Europe, opening up new air travel routes to South America, Africa, and Asia. Foynes, Ireland and Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador were the terminals for many early transatlantic flights. In areas where there were no airfields for land-based aircraft, flying boats could stop at small river, lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply. The Pan Am Boeing 314 &quot;Clipper&quot; flying boats brought new exotic destinations like the Far East within reach and came to represent the romance of flight.

By 1931, mail from Australia was reaching Britain in 16 days, or less than half the time taken by sea. In that year, government tenders on both sides of the world invited applications to run new passenger and mail services between the ends of the Empire, and Qantas and IAL were successful with a joint bid. A company under combined ownership was then formed, Qantas Empire Airways. The new ten-day service between Rose Bay, New South Wales, (near Sydney) and Southampton was such a success that the volume of mail soon exceeded aircraft storage space.

A solution was found by the British government, who had requested Short Brothers to design a large long-range monoplane for IAL in 1933. Partner Qantas purchased six Short Empire flying boats.

Delivering the mail as quickly as possible generated much competition and some innovative designs. One variant of the Short Empire flying boats was the strange-looking &quot;Maia&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot;. It was a four-engined floatplane &quot;Mercury&quot; (the winged messenger) fixed on top of &quot;Maia&quot;, a heavily modified Short Empire flying boat. The larger Maia took off, carrying the smaller Mercury loaded to a weight greater than it could take off with. This allowed the Mercury to carry sufficient fuel for a direct trans-Atlantic flight with the mail. Unfortunately, this was too complex, and the Mercury had to be returned from America by ship. The Mercury did set some distance records before in-flight refuelling was adopted.

Sir Alan Cobham devised a method of in-flight refuelling in the 1930s. In the air, the Short Empire could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with. Short Empire flying boats serving the trans-Atlantic crossing were refueled over Foynes; with the extra fuel load, they could make a direct trans-Atlantic flight. A Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow was used as the fuel tanker.

The German Dornier Do X flying boat was noticeably different from its UK and U.S.-built counterparts. It had wing-like protrusions from the fuselage, called sponsons, to stabilize it on the water without the need for wing-mounted outboard floats. This feature was pioneered by Claudius Dornier during World War I on his Dornier Rs. I giant flying boat and perfected on the Dornier Wal in 1924. The enormous Do X was powered by 12 engines and carried 170 people. It flew across the Atlantic to the Americas in 1929, It was the largest flying boat of its time, but was severely underpowered and was limited by a very low operational ceiling. Only three were built, with a variety of engines installed, in an attempt to overcome the lack of power. Two of these were sold to Italy.
===World War II===

The military value of flying boats was well-recognized, and every country bordering on water operated them in a military capacity at the outbreak of the war. They were utilized in various tasks from anti-submarine patrol to air-sea rescue and gunfire spotting for battleships. Aircraft such as the PBM Mariner patrol bomber, PBY Catalina, Short Sunderland, and Grumman Goose recovered downed airmen and operated as scout aircraft over the vast distances of the Pacific Theater and Atlantic. They also sank numerous submarines and found enemy ships. In May 1941, the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; was discovered by a PBY Catalina flying out of Castle Archdale Flying boat base, Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland.

The largest flying boat of the war was the Blohm &amp; Voss BV 238, which was also the heaviest plane to fly during World War II and the largest aircraft built and flown by any of the Axis Powers.

In November 1939, IAL was restructured into three separate companies: British European Airways, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), and British South American Airways (which merged with BOAC in 1949), with the change being made official on 1 April 1940. BOAC continued to operate flying-boat services from the (slightly) safer confines of Poole Harbour during wartime, returning to Southampton in 1947. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, the Mediterranean was closed to Allied planes and BOAC and Qantas operated the Horseshoe Route between Durban and Sydney using Short Empire flying boats.

The Martin Company produced the prototype XPB2M Mars based on their PBM Mariner patrol bomber, with flight tests between 1941 and 1943. The Mars was converted by the Navy into a transport aircraft designated the XPB2M-1R. Satisfied with the performance, twenty of the modified JRM-1 Mars were ordered. The first, named &quot;Hawaii Mars&quot;, was delivered in June 1945, but the Navy scaled back their order at the end of World War II, buying only the five aircraft which were then on the production line. The five Mars were completed, and the last delivered in 1947.

===Post-War===

After World War II, the use of flying boats rapidly declined for several reasons. The ability to land on water became less of an advantage owing to the considerable increase in the number and length of land-based runways during World War II. Further, as the speed and range of land-based aircraft increased, the commercial competitiveness of flying boats diminished; their design compromised aerodynamic efficiency and speed to accomplish the feat of waterborne takeoff and landing. Competing with new civilian jet aircraft like the de Havilland Comet and Boeing 707 proved impossible.

The Hughes H-4 Hercules, in development in the U.S. during the war, was even larger than the BV 238, but it did not fly until 1947. The &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, as the 180-ton H-4 was nicknamed, was the largest flying boat ever to fly. Carried out during Senate hearings into Hughes&#x27;s use of government funds on its construction, the short hop of about a mile (1.6 km) at above the water by the &quot;Flying Lumberyard&quot; was claimed by Hughes as vindication of his efforts. Cutbacks in expenditure after the war and the disappearance of its intended mission as a transatlantic transport left it no purpose.

In 1944, the Royal Air Force began development of a small jet-powered flying boat that it intended to use as an air defence aircraft optimised for the Pacific, where the relatively calm sea conditions around the many archipelagos made the use of seaplanes easier. By making the aircraft jet-powered, it was possible to design it with a hull rather than making it a floatplane. The Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 prototype first flew in 1947 and was relatively successful in terms of its performance and handling. However, by the end of the war, carrier-based aircraft were becoming more sophisticated, and the need for the SR.A/1 evaporated.

During the Berlin Airlift (which lasted from June 1948 until August 1949), ten Sunderlands and two Hythes were used to transport goods from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to isolated Berlin, landing on the Havelsee beside RAF Gatow until it iced over. The Sunderlands were particularly used for transporting salt, as their airframes were already protected against corrosion from seawater. Transporting salt in standard aircraft risked rapid and severe structural corrosion in the event of a spillage. In addition, three Aquila flying boats were used during the airlift. This is the only known operational use of flying boats within central Europe.

BOAC ceased flying boat services out of Southampton in November 1950.

Bucking the trend, in 1948, Aquila Airways was founded to serve destinations that were still inaccessible to land-based aircraft. This company operated Short S.25 and Short S.45 flying boats out of Southampton on routes to Madeira, Las Palmas, Lisbon, Jersey, Mallorca, Marseille, Capri, Genoa, Montreux and Santa Margherita. From 1950 to 1957, Aquila also operated a service from Southampton to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The flying boats of Aquila Airways were also chartered for one-off trips, usually to deploy troops where scheduled services did not exist or where there were political considerations. The longest charter, in 1952, was from Southampton to the Falkland Islands. In 1953, the flying boats were chartered for troop-deployment trips to Freetown and Lagos, and there was a special trip from Kingston upon Hull to Helsinki to relocate a ship&#x27;s crew. The airline ceased operations on 30 September 1958.

The technically advanced Saunders-Roe Princess first flew in 1952 and later received a certificate of airworthiness. Despite being the pinnacle of flying-boat development, none were sold, though Aquila Airways reportedly attempted to buy them. Of the three Princesses that were built, two never flew, and all were scrapped in 1967. In the late 1940s, Saunders-Roe also produced the jet-powered SR.A/1 flying-boat fighter, which did not progress beyond flying prototypes.
The U.S. Navy continued to operate flying boats (notably the Martin P5M Marlin) until the early 1970s. The Navy even built a jet-powered seaplane bomber, the Martin Seamaster.

The U.S. Coast Guard operated HU-16 Albatross (affectionately known as the &#x27;goat&#x27;) well into the 1980s, retiring them as the airframes clocked out their flying 11 thousand flying hours. About twenty were still in service in the 1970s, and the last operation flight was in 1983. The aircraft was very popular with the Coast Guard due to its unique capabilities compared to other types, and was noted for its versatility, range, and ability to land on water which was especially useful for water rescues.

Ansett Australia operated a flying-boat service from Rose Bay to Lord Howe Island until 1974, using Short Sandringhams.

On 18 December 1990, Pilot Tom Casey completed the first round-the-world flight in a floatplane with only water landings using a Cessna 206 named Liberty II.

==Uses and operation==

Many modern civilian aircraft have a floatplane variant, usually as utility transports to lakes and other remote areas. Most of these are offered as third-party modifications under a supplemental type certificate (STC), although there are several aircraft manufacturers that build floatplanes from scratch, and a few that continue to build flying boats. Some older flying boats remain in service for firefighting duty, as well as the Canadair CL-415 which remains in production as of 2022, and Chalk&#x27;s Ocean Airways operated a fleet of Grumman Mallards in passenger service until service was suspended after a crash on December 19, 2005, which was linked to maintenance, not to design of the aircraft. Purely water-based seaplanes have largely been supplanted by amphibious aircraft.
Seaplanes can only take off and land on water with little or no wave action and, like other aircraft, have trouble in extreme weather. The size of waves a given design can withstand depends on, among other factors, the aircraft&#x27;s size, hull or float design, and its weight, all making for a much more unstable aircraft, limiting actual operational days. 
Flying boats can typically handle rougher water and are generally more stable than floatplanes while on the water.

Seaplanes are also used in remote areas such as the Alaskan and Canadian wilderness, especially in areas with a large number of lakes convenient for takeoff and landing. They may operate on a charter basis, provide scheduled service, or be operated by residents of the area for personal use. There are seaplane operators that offer services between islands such as in the Caribbean Sea or the Maldives. Usually these are converted from reliable commercial models, and fitted for floats.

One of the modern floatplane conversions under consideration in the 2020s, is floatplane version of the C-130 for special military applications.

<text>Ya, Ia or Ja (Я я; italics: &quot;Я я&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script, the civil script variant of Old Cyrillic Little Yus (), and possibly Iotated A (). Among modern Slavic languages, it is used in the East Slavic languages and Bulgarian. It is also used in the Cyrillic alphabets used by Mongolian and many Uralic, Caucasian and Turkic languages of the former Soviet Union.

==Pronunciation==

The iotated vowel is pronounced in initial or post-vocalic positions, like the English pronunciation of in &quot;yard&quot;.

When follows a soft consonant, no sound occurs between the consonant and the vowel.

The exact pronunciation of the vowel sound of depends also on the following sound by allophony in the Slavic languages. In Russian, before a soft consonant, it is , like in the English &quot;cat&quot;. If a hard consonant follows or none, the result is an open vowel, usually []. This difference does not exist in the other Cyrillic languages.

In non-stressed positions, the vowel reduction depends on the language and the dialect. The standard Russian language reduces the vowel to [], but yakanye dialects undergo no reduction unlike other instances of the phoneme (represented with the letter ). In Bulgarian, the vowel sound is reduced to in unstressed syllables and is pronounced in both stressed verb and definite article endings.

== History ==

The letter , known as little jus (yus) (, ) originally stood for a front nasal vowel, conventionally transcribed as ę. The history of the letter (in both Church Slavonic and vernacular texts) varies according to the development of this sound in the different areas where Cyrillic was used.

In Serbia, [ɛ̃] became [e] at a very early period and the letter ceased to be used, being replaced by e. In Bulgaria the situation is complicated by the fact that dialects differ and that there were different orthographic systems in use, but broadly speaking [ɛ̃] became [ɛ] in most positions, but in some circumstances it merged with [ǫ], particularly in inflexional endings, e.g. the third person plural ending of the present tense of certain verbs such as (Modern Bulgarian правят). The letter continued to be used, but its distribution, particularly in regard to the other yuses, was governed as much by orthographical convention as by phonetic value or etymology.

After the Bulgarian language adopted the civil script, the sound /ja/ would come to be represented by the letter я, despite etymological я being pronounced /ɛ/.

Among the Eastern Slavs, [ɛ̃] was denasalised, probably to [æ], which palatalised the preceding consonant; after palatalisation became phonemic, the /æ/ phoneme merged with /a/, and ѧ henceforth indicated /a/ after a palatalised consonant, or else, in initial or post-vocalic position, /ja/. However, Cyrillic already had a character with this function, namely , so that for the Eastern Slavs these two characters were henceforth equivalent. The alphabet in Meletij Smotrickij&#x27;s grammar of 1619 accordingly lists &quot;&quot; (&quot;ꙗ ili ѧ&quot;, &quot;ꙗ or ѧ&quot;); he explains that is used initially and elsewhere. (In fact he also distinguishes the feminine form of the accusative plural of the third person pronoun from the masculine and neuter .) This reflects the practice of earlier scribes and was further codified by the Muscovite printers of the seventeenth century (and is continued in modern Church Slavonic). However, in vernacular and informal writing of the period, the two letters may be used completely indiscriminately.
It was in Russian cursive (skoropis&#x27;) writing of this time that the letter acquired its modern form: the left-hand leg of was progressively shortened, eventually disappearing altogether, while the foot of the middle leg shifted towards the left, producing the я shape.

In the specimens of the civil script produced for Peter I, forms of and я were grouped together; Peter removed the first two, leaving only я in the modern alphabet, and its use in Russian remains the same to the present day. It was similarly adopted for the standardised orthographies of modern Ukrainian and Belarusian. In nineteenth-century Bulgaria, both Old Cyrillic and civil scripts were used for printing, with я in the latter corresponding to in the former, and there were various attempts to standardise the orthography, of which some, such as the Plovdiv school exemplified by Nayden Gerov, were more conservative, essentially preserving the Middle Bulgarian distribution of the letter, others attempted to rationalise spelling on more phonetic principles, and one project in 1893 proposed abolishing the letter я altogether. By the early twentieth century, under Russian influence, я came to be used for (which is not a reflex of ę in Bulgarian), retaining its use for but was no longer used for other purposes; this is its function today.

== Use in loanwords and transcriptions ==
In Russian, the letter has little use in loanwords and orthographic transcriptions of foreign words. A notable exception is the use of to transcribe , mostly from Romance languages, Polish, German and Arabic. This makes to match [] better than its dark l pronunciation in . is also used to transcribe Romanian , pronounced as .

Although is a distinctive pronunciation of in Russian, the letter is almost never used to transcribe that sound, unlike the use of to approximate close front and central rounded vowels. Nonetheless, is used for Estonian and Finnish  – for instance, Pärnu is written in Russian, although the Russian pronunciation does not match the original.

In internet culture, is used in faux Cyrillic to substitute the Latin letter , as in for &quot;Russia.&quot;

==Ya with diaeresis==
Ya with diaeresis (Я̈ я̈; italics: &quot;Я̈ я̈&quot;) is currently only used in the Selkup language.

In Russian, ya with diaeresis saw rare use prior to the 1918 orthography reform to indicate that a stressed letter ya () should be pronounced as instead of the expected , in a similar fashion to the role of yo (). For example, the modern pronouns and were formerly spelled and in the genitive and possessive, due to their historical pronunciations as and , which had since shifted to and . As with the letter yo, use of the diaeresis was rare outside of learning materials and dictionaries, and following the reform the letter was replaced with yo outright.

==Computing codes==
Unicode provides separate code-points for the Old Cyrillic and civil script forms of this letter. A number of Old Cyrillic fonts developed before the publication of Unicode 5.1 placed iotated A () at the code points for Ya (Я/я) instead of the Private Use Area, but since Unicode 5.1, iotated A has been encoded separately from Ya.

<doc id="291743" wikidata="Q1012481" url="?curid=291743" title="Whitehaven">
<text>Whitehaven is a town and port on the English north west coast and near to the Lake District National Park in Cumberland, Cumbria, England. It lies by road south-west of Carlisle and to the north of Barrow-in-Furness. It was the administrative seat of the former Borough of Copeland, and has a town council for the parish of Whitehaven. The population of the town was 23,986 at the 2011 census.

The town&#x27;s growth was largely due to the exploitation of the extensive coal measures by the Lowther family, driving a growing export of coal through the harbour from the 17th century onwards. It was also a major port for trading with the American colonies, and was, after London, the second busiest port of England by tonnage from 1750 to 1772. This prosperity led to the creation of a Georgian planned town in the 18th century which has left an architectural legacy of over 170 listed buildings. Whitehaven has been designated a &quot;gem town&quot; by the Council for British Archaeology due to the historic quality of the town environment.

Whitehaven was the site of a major chemical industry after World War II, but both that and the coal industry have disappeared, and today the major industry is the nearby Sellafield nuclear complex, which is the largest local employer of labour and has a significant administrative base in the town. Whitehaven includes a number of former villages, estates and suburbs, such as Mirehouse, Woodhouse, Kells and Hensingham, and is served by the Cumbrian coast railway line and the A595 road.

==Early history==
Although there was a Roman fort at Parton, around to the north, there is no evidence of a Roman settlement on the site of the present town of Whitehaven.

The area was settled by Irish-Norse Vikings in the 10th century. The area name of Copeland, which includes Whitehaven, indicates that the land was purchased from the Kingdom of Strathclyde, possibly with loot from Ireland.

Following the arrival of the Normans, in about 1120 St Bees Priory was founded by William de Meschin, which was granted a large tract of land from the coast at Whitehaven to the river Keekle, and then south down the River Ehen to the sea. This included the small fishing village of Whitehaven. Following Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the priory in 1539, ownership of this estate passed through a number of secular landlords until it passed into the hands of the Lowther family in the 17th century.

Whitehaven was a township within the &quot;Preston Quarter&quot; of the parish of St Bees, and the town&#x27;s churches were chapels-of-ease of St Bees until 1835 when three ecclesiastical districts were created in Whitehaven.

==Growth and prosperity==

The modern growth of Whitehaven started with the purchase by Sir Christopher Lowther of the Whitehaven estate in 1630 and the subsequent development of the port and the mines. In 1634 he built a stone pier providing shelter and access for shipping, enabling the export of coal from the Cumberland Coalfield, particularly to Ireland. This was a key event in the rapid growth of the town from a small fishing village to an industrial port.

In 1642 the manor of St. Bees was inherited by Sir John Lowther, 2nd Baronet, of Whitehaven (1642–1706), who developed the town of Whitehaven, its coal industry and the trade with Ireland. He oversaw the rise of Whitehaven from a small fishing village (at his birth consisting of some fifty houses and a population of about 250) to a planned town three times the size of Carlisle. At his death the &#x27;port of Whitehaven&#x27; had 77 registered vessels, totalling about four thousand tons, and was exporting more than 35,000 tons of coal a year.

Whitehaven&#x27;s growing prosperity was also based on tobacco. By 1685 there were ships regularly bringing tobacco from the British colonies of Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania in America, and by the early 18th century about 10% of England&#x27;s tobacco imports passed through Whitehaven. By the middle of the 18th century it was the second or third port in England for tobacco imports. The tobacco was then sold on the domestic market or re-exported, e.g. to Ireland, France and the Netherlands.

However, after the Acts of Union 1707 united England with Scotland, thereby abolishing excise duties between them, the port of Glasgow began to take over Whitehaven&#x27;s tobacco trade, leading to the later creation of Glasgow&#x27;s Tobacco Lords. By the second half of the 18th century there was a marked decline in shipping of tobacco via Whitehaven, and by 1820 the Customs Collector did not mention tobacco in his report on Whitehaven. Whitehaven Town Hall, which started life as a private house built for a merchant, was completed in 1710.

Daniel Defoe visited Whitehaven in the 1720s and wrote that the town had
 To replace the tobacco trade, Whitehaven turned to importing sugar from Barbados, cotton from Antigua and coffee and cocoa from St Lucia. Due to the coal trade Whitehaven was, after London, the second port of England in terms of tonnage of shipping from 1750 to 1772. In 1835 Whitehaven was still the fifth placed port, with 443 ships registered, but by the end of the 19th century only 68 vessels were registered. Whitehaven was involved with the transatlantic slave trade, and records show slave ships leaving Whitehaven for voyages to Africa between 1711 and 1767. In 2006, the Copeland Council (Whitehaven&#x27;s local authority) issued a formal apology for Whitehaven&#x27;s role in the slave trade.

Scottish-American naval officer John Paul Jones raided the town in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, burning some merchant ships in the harbour.

During the 19th century the port of Whitehaven was overtaken by Bristol, Liverpool and Glasgow, as they had deep-water dock facilities and were closer to large centres of population and industry. The huge development of a national railway network had also reduced Whitehaven&#x27;s 18th century competitive advantage of having coal extracted very close to a harbour for shipment by sea.

An 1888 legal case, &quot;Bush v Whitehaven Port and Town Trustees&quot;, was one of a series of legal cases involved in the development of the doctrine of frustration of contract in English law. Bush, the contractor in this case, had contracted to construct a water-main for a &quot;slump sum&quot; . His tender was submitted in June, and he was &quot;given to understand&quot; that he could begin the work at once, but part of the land was not available until October. This meant the work took place during the winter, when operations are more difficult and more costly. The jury in this case decided that the timing issue substantially affected the contract, and awarded damages to be paid to the contractor.

==Coal mining==
James Pit is a pit in Whitehaven. The school &quot;St James&#x27; Juniors&quot; is on the site of the old pit.

===Early mining===
The earliest reference to coal mining in the Whitehaven area is in the time of Prior Langton (1256–1282) of St Bees Priory, concerning the coal mines at Arrowthwaite. St Bees Priory was dissolved in 1539, and the lands and mineral rights passed to secular owners. The first of these, Sir Thomas Chaloner, granted leases of land in 1560 for digging coal, and in 1586 he granted St Bees School liberty &quot;to take 40 loads of coal at his coal pits in the parish of St Bees for the use of the school&quot;. Such workings were small-scale and near the surface, using adits and bell pits. But the Lowther family later developed and dominated the coal industry in Whitehaven from the mid 17th century to the early 20th century.

===The influence of the Lowthers===
Sir John Lowther, 2nd Baronet (1642–1706) significantly developed the coal industry and the trade with Ireland. He spent over £11,000 in expanding the Lowther holdings in the area, and considerably improved the drainage of his pits; thus allowing mining at greater depths.

Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet FRS (1673–1755) continued the work of his father and reputedly became the richest commoner in England. Between 1709 and 1754, over £46,000 was spent to extend the Lowther holdings of land and coal royalties in West Cumberland. By the 1740s Lowther was the dominant exporter at every harbour in the Cumberland coalfield and from the late 17th to the mid-19th centuries this coal represented 6%-7% of all English exports to Ireland; most of the coal burnt in Dublin came from here. However, Lowther was noted for his unscrupulous business practices, and a lease of the coal royalties owned by St Bees School was obtained in 1742 on manifestly unfair terms: an annual rent of £3.50, with no payment per ton raised, for 867 years. The lease was eventually quashed in 1827, with compensation of over £13,000 paid to the school.

===Mining under the sea===
Sir John, and after him Sir James, had concerns that there were few reserves of economically retrievable coal under dry land. They felt that exploration under the sea was necessary, but this carried the risk of flooding. However, Sir James had two very able managers, the brothers Carlisle and John Spedding, who were willing to explore new technology and techniques. In 1712 John Spedding urged Lowther to consider pumping by steam, and in 1715 he became one of the earliest customers for the newly invented Newcomen engine. Spedding concluded that such an engine would drain a flooded pit in two-thirds the time that horse gins would take, and would do so at a quarter of the cost. Consequently, a small (17-inch diameter cylinder) &quot;Engine No. 5&quot;, built by Thomas Newcomen and John Calley, was erected. It was so successful that in 1727 Lowther bought an additional pumping engine.

With this proven method of pumping Lowther was able to exploit the coal measures under the sea by sinking a pit at Saltom on land below the cliffs south of the harbour, to a depth of 456 ft (138m). Work began early in 1730, and the pit was officially opened in May 1732 with great celebration. Carlisle Spedding had charge of the design and construction, and successfully sank only the second sub-sea pit in Britain. It was reported that &quot;A shaft twelve foot by ten had been sunk seventy-seven fathoms&quot; (141 metres) &quot;(the deepest a pit had been sunk in any part of Europe) to a three-yard thick coal seam (the Main Band) in twenty-three months, using thirty barrels of gunpowder, and without any loss of life or limb by the workforce&#x27;.
Saltom Pit ceased working coal in 1848, and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SM 27801) and is the best known surviving example of an 18th-century colliery layout. Evidence of the shaft, horse gin, stable, winding engine house, boiler house and chimney, cottages, cart roads and retaining walls, all survives. Coal excavated from Saltom Pit was raised by horse gin to the surface, then transported by tramway through a tunnel to Ravenhill Pit for lifting to the cliff top. Saltom Pit was used as a central pumping station, draining many of the other local mines via a drift driven in the 1790s, and continued in use long after it had ceased to work coal.

===Technical innovation===

To counter the considerable danger of methane gas explosion, Carlisle Spedding invented a forerunner to the Davy Lamp, known as the Spedding Wheel or Steel Mill. This used the sparks generated by a flint against a rotating steel wheel to provide light, on the basis the sparks were not quite hot enough to ignite the gas. On occasions it caused explosions or fires but it was a major improvement over the naked flame.
Lowther also supported experimental work on firedamp by William Brownrigg, a local doctor and scientist, and he presented papers by Brownrigg at the Royal Society. Brownrigg had gas piped from a nearby pit to his workshop, which provided light and heat, and bladders of the gas were taken to London to be demonstrated at the Royal Society. Brownrigg was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) for this work.

===The decline of Lowther influence===
After Sir James, there was a succession of Lowthers who inherited the coal interests but did not emulate his close interest. The Lowthers&#x27; direct involvement in coal diminished, and in 1888 the mines were leased to the Whitehaven Colliery Company. By 1893 nearly all the coal was being extracted from under the sea, and William pit extended 4 miles out under the Solway. In 1900 the output of the collieries was 536,000 tons. However they became less economic; the company failed in 1933, and the pits were sold to Priestman collieries. They in turn failed in 1935, and the pits were closed for 18 months. Work resumed with help from a Nuffield foundation, and the Cumberland Coal Company was formed, re-opening the pits in 1937. In 1947 the pits came under the nationalised body, the National Coal Board.

===Extent of mining===
In 300 years over seventy pits were sunk in the Whitehaven area. During this period some five hundred or more people were killed in pit disasters and mining accidents. The largest disaster in the area was in 1910 at Wellington Pit, where 136 miners died. In another disaster in 1947 at William Pit, 104 men were killed. Four separate explosions over the period 1922–1931 at Haig Pit together killed 83. Haig was the last pit to operate in Whitehaven.

===Temporary end of coal mining===

In 1983, a major geological fault was encountered at Haig pit which increased the difficulty of operation. This, combined with the political situation, and the miners&#x27; strike in 1984–85, contributed to problems at the colliery. The workforce attempted to open a new face, but a decision had been taken to close, and after two years of recovery work, Haig finally ceased mining on 31 March 1986. Today there is no mining carried out in Whitehaven though there is a proposal to sink a new mine out under the sea for coking coal. In November 2019 the UK government gave the green light for this mine to go ahead.

===Preservation of Saltom pit===
In 2007, Copeland Council declared that it could no longer afford to maintain the remaining Saltom Pit buildings, and preserve them from damage by the sea. But after an online campaign by myWhitehaven.net, the council changed their mind. They teamed up with the National Trust to try to save Saltom Pit, and obtained the necessary funding from various sources, including a 50% grant from the European Union. On Monday 8 December 2007, Saltom Pit was reopened as an historic monument. The pit buildings have been conserved and are now part of the &#x27;Whitehaven Coast&#x27; project, a scheme to regenerate the coastal area of Whitehaven.

==Governance==
Whitehaven is within the Whitehaven and Workington constituency. , its Member of Parliament (MP) is Josh MacAlister of the Labour Party, who has held the seat since the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency.

Prior to the introduction of Cumberland (district), for Local Government purposes it had the following wards in the Borough of Copeland:
* Whitehaven South
* Whitehaven Central
* Kells
* Hillcrest
* Corkicle
* Sneckyeat

The following divisions were included in Cumbria County Council:
* Bransty
* Kells and Sandwith
* Hillcrest and Hensingham
* Mirehouse

Whitehaven has its own Parish Council, &quot;Whitehaven Town Council&quot;.

==The harbour==




The existence of a harbour or landing place at Whitehaven can be traced back to 1517, when quay-dues, otherwise known as wharfage, were recorded.

The purchase of the manor of St Bees in 1630 by the Lowther family started the development of Whitehaven harbour primarily to export coal. Sir Christopher Lowther built a stone pier in 1631–1634, and it survives, albeit very modified, as the Old Quay.

By the 1660s the pier was suffering from storm damage and by the 1670s it was considered too small for the growing number of vessels wanting to use it. In 1677 a description refers to &quot;a little pier, in shallow water, built with some wooden piles and stones&quot;.

The prospect of a rival pier being built at Parton to the north of Whitehaven galvanised Sir John Lowther into developing the harbour, and by 1679 further work was under way. In the late 17th and 18th century the harbour was extended by ballast walls, moles and piers to become one of the most complex pier harbours in Britain. April 1778 saw the harbour as the first site of an American attack on the British Isles during the American War of Independence.

The port&#x27;s trade waned rapidly when ports with much larger shipping capacity, such as Bristol and Liverpool, began to take over its main trade. Its peak of prosperity was in the 19th century when West Cumberland experienced a brief boom because haematite found locally was one of the few iron ores that could be used to produce steel by the original Bessemer process. Improvements to the Bessemer process and the development of the open hearth process removed this advantage. In the 20th century, as in most mining communities, the inter-war Great Depression was severe; this was exacerbated for West Cumbria by Irish independence which suddenly placed tariff barriers on its principal export market.

The harbour lost its last commercial cargo handling operation in 1992 when Marchon ceased their phosphate rock import operations. Drivers Jonas and marine consulting engineers Beckett Rankine drew up a new master plan to impound the inner basins of the harbour to create a large marina and fishing harbour, and refocus the town on a renovated harbour.

The harbour has seen much other renovation due to millennium developments, and the rejuvenation project cost an estimated £11.3 million. This has provided 100 more moorings within the marina. Another £5.5 million has been spent on developing a 40 m (130 ft) high crow&#x27;s nest and a wave light feature that changes colour depending on the tide, together with The Rum Story on Lowther Street, voted Cumbria Tourism&#x27;s small visitor attraction of the year 2007. A picture of the harbour was used on the front page of the Tate Modern&#x27;s promotional material for an exhibition of Millennium Projects in 2003.
In June 2008, Queen Elizabeth II visited Whitehaven as part of the 300th Anniversary Celebrations. The Queen and Prince Philip then officially re-opened the refurbished Beacon museum at the harbour; 10,000 people attended the event.

==Town planning==
Whitehaven was, with Falmouth, the first post-medieval new planned town in England. It is the most complete example of planned Georgian architecture in Europe and there are over 170 listed buildings. Whitehaven&#x27;s planned layout was with streets in a right-angled grid which it is thought was imitated by the new towns of the American Colonies, with which there were strong trade links.

Although Sir Christopher Lowther initially purchased Whitehaven it was his son, Sir John Lowther, 2nd Baronet, who was responsible for its growth and development. Sir John acquired a market charter in 1660 for the town, but the urban expansion did not start until the 1680s when he laid out a spacious rectangular grid of streets to the north east of the existing tiny hamlet.

Sir John specified that the houses were &quot;to be three storeys high, not less than 28 feet from the street level to the square of the side walls, the windows of the first and second storeys to be transomed and the same, together with the doors to be of hewn stone.&quot; Ample provision was made for gardens.

One block was left vacant for a new church and in 1694 another site was given for a Presbyterian chapel. Most of the streets were relatively narrow, about ten yards, but the principal thoroughfare, Lowther Street, which ran through the town centre from the Lowther family residence to the waterfront, was 16 yards wide. The old St Nicholas chapel was demolished in 1693 to make way for Lowther Street, and its materials used to build a new school.

Whitehaven Castle was built in 1769 for Sir John Lowther as his private residence at the end of Lowther Street, replacing an earlier building destroyed by fire. In 1924, the Earl of Lonsdale sold Whitehaven Castle to Herbert Wilson Walker, a local industrialist. Walker donated the building to the people of West Cumberland, along with £20,000 to convert it into a hospital to replace the old Whitehaven Infirmary at Howgill Street, which was established in 1830.

==Railways==
Whitehaven is on the Cumbrian Coast Line which runs from Carlisle to Barrow-in-Furness. The town has two railway stations: Whitehaven (Bransty) and Corkickle, joined by a tunnel underneath the town.

===Coming of the public railway===
The first railway to reach Whitehaven was the Whitehaven Junction Railway (WJR) in 1847 from , which terminated at the Bransty Row station and allowed rail access to Carlisle and Newcastle upon Tyne. On the southern side of the town, the first section of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway (W&amp;FJR) opened on 1 June 1849 from a terminus at Whitehaven (Preston Street) to , and thereafter gradually in stages until Barrow in Furness and ultimately Carnforth were reached. This gave access to the south onto the main West Coast line, and later became the main line of the Furness Railway. The two lines were separated by the town centre, and a tramway was constructed through the market place allowing goods wagons to be horse-drawn from Preston Street to the harbour, but there was still no through route for passenger trains. In 1852, a tunnel long was built under the town, and in 1854 the W&amp;FJR passenger trains ran through to the Bransty station from a new station at Corkickle. Preston Street became a goods-only station and served as the main goods depot for the town.
===Industrial networks===
As in other colliery areas, horse-drawn tramways and then locomotive-powered railways were used extensively to move coal. The first steam locomotive made an early appearance in 1816, to a design similar to the noted Steam Elephant built by William Chapman of Newcastle. However this pioneering engine was not too successful and was converted to a pumping and winding engine. Nonetheless, the harbour and collieries eventually developed an extensive network of industrial railways within the constraints of the steep valley sides and the coast. The system had two roped inclines. The Howgill incline connected Ladysmith pit on the steep north-western side of the valley to Wellington pit at the harbour, and operated to the 1970s, and on the south of the town the Corkickle incline, known locally as &quot;The Brake&quot;, was built in 1881 from the Furness Railway main line to Croft Pit. This closed in 1931 but was reopened in May 1955 to serve Marchon Products&#x27; chemical factory. The Brake closed for good on 31 October 1986, when it was the last commercial roped incline in Britain. It was in length with gradients of between 1 in 5.2 and 1 in 6.6.

===Engineering===
The nearby Lowca engineering works began to produce locomotives in 1843, including the first Crampton locomotives, which became the fastest locomotives of the day; one was reported to have reached 62 mph. Over the life of the works, some 260 locomotives were produced – mainly for industrial lines. The works entered shipbuilding in 1842–3, producing &quot;Lowca&quot;, the first iron ship launched in Cumberland.

==Marchon chemical complex==
In 1941, Fred Marzillier and Frank Schon relocated Marchon Products Ltd from London to Whitehaven, which was a special development area, after their offices were destroyed by German bombing. At Whitehaven they started manufacturing firelighters, then in 1943 they moved production to the site of the Ladysmith pit coke ovens at Kells, where they formed a sister company, &quot;Solway Chemicals&quot;, to produce liquid fertilisers and foaming agents. At the end of the war, a number of chemists and engineers were released after the closure of the Royal Ordnance Factories at Drigg and Sellafield. This helped drive the pioneering expansion into detergent bases to include some of the first soap-substitutes to reach the UK market.

The new detergents were a big success, as soap was in short supply after the war; however the original reason for moving to Whitehaven, remoteness from Europe, was now a serious handicap as the site was remote from raw materials. The answer was to manufacture as much processed raw material as possible on the site. New plants were built for the production of fatty alcohols in a pioneering process; tripolyphosphate was produced on site using phosphate rock from Casablanca imported via the harbour; and sulphuric acid was produced using anhydrite from the specially-created Sandwith mine adjacent to the factory. Production diversified further into specialist additives and chemicals, and continued to expand to become the town&#x27;s largest employer, with 2,300 employees.

In 1955 the companies were taken over by Albright and Wilson, and they in turn were taken over by the French company, Rhodia, in 1999. The decline of this site had started in the late 1980s, and finally in 2005 the site was closed down after a number of production processes had been terminated over the years.

==Sekers Fabrics==
To help counter the 50% unemployment in the area, John Adams, of the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company, invited Miki Sekers and his cousin, Tomi de Gara to establish the West Cumberland Silk Mills at Hensingham, Whitehaven in 1938. The intention was to manufacture high quality silk and rayon fabrics for the fashion trade, but during World War II they mainly produced parachute nylon. After the war, it became Sekers Fabrics and reverted to its original purpose. It supplied material to the great fashion houses such as Edward Molyneux and Bianca Mosca in London and Christian Dior, Pierre Cardin and Givenchy in Paris. At the same time it supplied luxury-style dress materials within the purchasing power of most home dressmakers working in nylon.

The company was awarded the Duke of Edinburgh prize for elegant design in 1962, 1965 and 1973, and a Royal warrant was awarded as suppliers of furnishing fabric to Her Majesty the Queen. In 1964, they established a large showroom at 190-192 Sloane Street, London.

Miki Sekers was appointed an MBE in 1955 for services to the fashion industry, and was knighted in 1965 for services to the arts.

The Whitehaven silk mill closed in 2006.

==Cumberland Curled Hair Ltd==

In 1945, Kurt Oppenheim, a 26-year-old refugee from Nazi Germany, bought the abandoned Whitehaven Brewery site on Inkerman Terrace and began using it as a home for the family and a factory to house the production of curled hair. Curled hair was utilised as part of the filling for bed mattresses, railway and carriage seating, car and domestic upholstery and when rubberised it was used in flooring. 

Oppenheim&#x27;s family had been in the curled hair manufacturing business for many generations in Kassel, Germany, with factories in Kassel and Basel, Switzerland. After the war, however, little of the business remained. Oppenheim started up again in Whitehaven on a small amount of borrowed funds. The product was manufactured from horse and cow hair sourced from China and Argentina. Hair was cleansed, spun into rope on machinery mainly produced in continental Europe and then the rope was broken up to produce the hair with a spring-like curl in it. This bulky product was bagged and sent off to customers all over the UK. 

With the introduction of synthetic upholstery fillings in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK curled hair business began to contract and Cumberland Curled Hair consolidated the industry by buying up competitors that were closing down and moved their production to Whitehaven. The business expanded into a factory in the Hensingham industrial area and brought employment to about eighty people of the town.

The new foam business was called Cheri Foam. By the mid-1960s, the space requirements outgrew the factory in Hensingham and only the offices were kept in the original Tower Brewery in Whitehaven, whilst production of curled hair and flexile urethane foam was moved to an 11-acre site with two large aircraft hangars at Silloth Airfield.

==&quot;Jam eater&quot;==
The term &quot;jam eater&quot; is often used by the people of neighbouring Workington to refer to the people of Whitehaven, or more generally to people from West Cumbria. When the &quot;Financial Times&quot; ran a lighthearted article on famous feuds in September 2008, featuring this, the local &quot;Whitehaven News&quot; published its own complementary feature, reporting that: &quot;The common view is that the term is insulting because it implies people could not afford to buy meat for their sandwiches, so they had to eat jam instead.&quot;

The original article had summed up the situation in terms of the long-term rivalry between Whitehaven and nearby Workington: &quot;Legend has it that one town&#x27;s miners had jam on their sandwiches and the other did not, but no one agrees on which town it was or whether they did it because they were snobs or peasants.&quot; A reader from Maryport, a few miles further up the Cumbria coast (which, as occasionally mentioned in discussions on the topic, used to have a jam factory) reported that he had understood the term originally referred to people from Whitehaven, and this was echoed in the comments on the &quot;Whitehaven News&quot; article, suggesting that a former distinction between the Whitehaven &quot;jam eaters&quot; and Workington &quot;high siders&quot; had gradually been lost in the trading of insults across the rugby pitch.

==Maritime Festival==
Whitehaven has also played host to a Maritime Festival, which started in 1999 and was held every two years, and then annually (the last being in 2013) attracting an estimated 350,000 people to the small town.

Attractions included tall ships, air displays which included the Red Arrows and various modern and old planes, street entertainment and firework displays. At the 2003, 2005 and 2007 festivals the local Sea Cadets were very much in evidence, conducting the traditional Evening Colours ceremony each evening aboard one of the visiting tall ships, and also taking part in the festival&#x27;s official closing ceremony during the late Sunday afternoon each year.
The 2005 festival also marked the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, in which Whitehaven had been designated Cumbria&#x27;s official commemoration celebration. Up to 1,000 veterans and ex-service personnel took part in the parade from the town&#x27;s Castle Park to the harbour side, led by members of three military bands. Services were held on the harbour side, and aircraft from the Royal Air Force provided a tribute display above the harbour.

The Maritime Festivals were founded by Gerard Richardson and organised by the Whitehaven Festival Company, made up of a board of volunteers, who organised 17 major events between 1999 and 2015. The company was closed in 2016. They organised the Queen&#x27;s visit to Whitehaven in June 2008, followed by the Status Quo gig in August of that year. The company staged two events in August 2009. The first was the redesigned festival (known for this year as the Whitehaven Food Festival, although it did still feature tall ships) which offered the usual wide variety of attractions, both around the southern half of the harbour and at St. Nicholas&#x27; Church, on 8–9 August. The second event, the following week, was the Here and Now Gig (a music concert with 1980&#x27;s pop icons). For the June 2010 festival, which was similar in format to 2009, the music performances (Status Quo, N-Dubz and Katherine Jenkins) were moved to the harbour area.

The 2011 festival (featuring Razorlight plus several 1980s acts including Madness) continued the successful culinary theme, with the return of Jean-Christophe Novelli and other favourites. In 2012 the date of the festival was changed to the first weekend in June, to make it part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebration (with a red, white and blue themed firework display).

== Local media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter.

Whitehaven&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 104.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland on 103.4 FM and Hospital Radio Haven, a community based radio that broadcast from the West Cumberland Hospital in the town.

The Whitehaven News is the town&#x27;s local newspaper.

==June 2010 shootings==

On 2 June 2010, Whitehaven became a focus in the international media in relation to gun laws in the United Kingdom, following a killing spree targeting people living in the western area of the county. After killing his twin brother in Lamplugh, and his family solicitor in Frizington, taxi driver Derrick Bird began the spree in Whitehaven, shooting several people on the streets and at the taxi rank where he worked, killing 12.

==Digital switchover trial==
On 20 July 2006, Broadcasting Minister Shaun Woodward and Industry Minister Margaret Hodge announced that Whitehaven would be the pilot site for the switchover to digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom. The selection of a pilot site followed on from trial switchovers held in Ferryside and Bolton.

The switchover began when BBC Two was switched off at 0200 on 17 October 2007. This was followed by the remaining analogue channels at 0200, on 14 November 2007. As a result of the switchover, all televisions in the Whitehaven area had to have a digital terrestrial receiver (Freeview) or digital satellite alternative (Freesat, Sky, etc.) The switchover in the Whitehaven area was not entirely successful: in nearby Eskdale, poor signal quality left viewers with blank television screens and the digital switchover was supposed to give over 40 channels but certain areas received fewer than 20.

<text>A special-purpose local-option sales tax (SPLOST) is a financing method for funding capital outlay projects in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is an optional 1% sales tax levied by any county for the purpose of funding the building of parks, schools, roads, and other public facilities. The revenue generated cannot be used towards operating expenses or most maintenance projects.

==Capital outlay projects==
Capital outlay projects are defined as major projects of a permanent, long-lived nature, such as land and structures. Among the projects explicitly included are road, street, bridges, police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and garbage trucks. Georgia law allows counties and municipalities complete discretion over the types of projects selected for SPLOST funding.

While funds cannot be used for most maintenance, SPLOST law explicitly allows the expenditure of funds for maintenance and repair of roads, streets and bridges.

== Procedure ==
Georgia&#x27;s state sales tax is currently 4% (groceries and prescription drugs exempted), with the counties allowed to add up to 2% more for SPLOST.

A SPLOST is passed by a county commission, usually with the agreement of its city councils, and voted up or down by residents in a referendum, usually during the next scheduled election. A SPLOST only lasts five years, and always begins and ends with a full calendar quarter. At that time, if the funds are still needed, it must be voted upon again. All expenditures of SPLOST funds must be in compliance with Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution, and Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) Section 48-8-115. Each SPLOST must define the projects on which the money is to be used, hence the designation of a &quot;special purpose&quot; tax. If enough money is raised before the full term of the tax, it may be ended at the end of an earlier calendar quarter.

Counties and school systems are required to provide an independent accountants&#x27; report, examining the way the funds were allocated and attesting to the fact that the system receiving funds managed those funds appropriately. School taxes are not technically considered a SPLOST, but are essentially managed the same way, with referendum dates and lists of projects to be funded being approved by county (and if applicable, city) school boards instead of county commissions and city councils.

== Types of SPLOST ==
*One SPLOST (1%) may be used to increase the homestead exemption for property taxes (sometimes called a HOST, or homestead-option sales tax).
*A SPLOST is not required to exempt groceries (and almost none do), but still cannot be applied to prescriptions.
*Cities are normally not allowed to levy sales taxes, they instead share proportionately with their county, according to how much was collected within respective city limits and unincorporated areas. Cities can have a separate tax if the county does not participate. Early on, in the 1970s, Dalton had its own tax. The county (Whitfield) sued and won the right to take over the tax.
*Since 2004, Atlanta charges a city sales tax of 1% to separate and repair its old sewers and storm drains. This does not count against the 3% cap on SPLOST/LOST/HOST taxes, and was sometimes called a MOST (municipal-option sales tax).
*Like the sewer tax, the MARTA sales tax is separate and not considered a SPLOST.
*The state has been divided into twelve regions, which each voted on a TSPLOST for transportation needs in July 2012. This also does not count against the 3% cap on SPLOST/LOST/HOST taxes.

==Transportation SPLOST==
Authorized by the 2010 Transportation Investment Act, the 2012 TSPLOST or T-SPLOST referendum was held on July 31 after well-attended advance voting and early voting, and failed in nine of the 12 regions across the state. This includes the metro Atlanta region, where it failed by a wide margin of 37% to 63% overall, and failed in each of the ten counties, despite an advertising campaign that cost eight million dollars, funded mostly by local businesses, and controversially by some community improvement districts. It was largely opposed by those who are against any tax for any reason, and those who felt that having just half of the projects being improvements to the region&#x27;s severely-limited rapid transit was still too much, although there is no other funding for expanding transit options while the gas tax and county SPLOSTs already go toward roads. It was also opposed by the Sierra Club for putting so much more toward roads that will simply fill up again, as well as by the NAACP since it is a regressive tax that would have also applied to basic necessities like groceries, and would have singled-out MARTA as the only agency that would be blocked from receiving operating funds.

Former Governor Nathan Deal said there will be no re-vote, and no increase in the taxes on gasoline (which are constitutionally prohibited from going to transportation alternatives), even though such taxes are borne by the drivers actually creating the traffic (a user fee).

The three regions which voted for the tax are all in middle Georgia, including Columbus and Augusta. Still causing controversy is the fact that local government in the other nine regions will now be required to put up 30% matching funds for projects for the next two years instead of the typical 10% to 15%.

<text>Kūkai (; 27 July 774 – 22 April 835), born Saeki no Mao (佐伯 眞魚), posthumously called , was a Japanese Buddhist monk, calligrapher, and poet who founded the esoteric Shingon school of Buddhism. He travelled to China, where he studied Tangmi (Chinese Vajrayana Buddhism) under the monk Huiguo. Upon returning to Japan, he founded Shingon—the Japanese branch of Vajrayana Buddhism. With the blessing of several Emperors, Kūkai was able to preach Shingon teachings and found Shingon temples. Like other influential monks, Kūkai oversaw public works and constructions. Mount Kōya was chosen by him as a holy site, and he spent his later years there until his death in 835 C.E.

Because of his importance in Japanese Buddhism, Kūkai is associated with many stories and legends. One such legend attribute the invention of the &quot;kana&quot; syllabary to Kūkai, with which the Japanese language is written to this day (in combination with &quot;kanji&quot;), as well as the &quot;Iroha&quot; poem, which helped to standardise and popularise &quot;kana&quot;.

Shingon followers usually refer to Kūkai by the honorific title of , and the religious name of .

==Biography==

===Early years===

Kūkai was born in 774 in the precinct of Zentsū-ji temple, in Sanuki province on the island of Shikoku. His family were members of the aristocratic Saeki family, a branch of the ancient Ōtomo clan. In modern scholarship, his first name is generally believed to be Mao (&quot;True Fish&quot;), although one source records his birth name as Tōtomono (&quot;Precious One&quot;). Kūkai was born in a period of important political changes with Emperor Kanmu (r. 781–806) seeking to consolidate his power and to extend his realm, taking measures which included moving the capital of Japan from Nara ultimately to Heian (modern-day Kyoto).

Little more is known about Kūkai&#x27;s childhood. At the age of fifteen, he began to receive instruction in the Chinese classics under the guidance of his maternal uncle. During this time, the Saeki-Ōtomo clan suffered government persecution due to allegations that the clan chief, Ōtomo Yakamochi, was responsible for the assassination of his rival Fujiwara no Tanetsugu. The family fortunes had fallen by 791 when Kūkai journeyed to Nara, the capital at the time, to study at the government university, the . Graduates were typically chosen for prestigious positions as bureaucrats. Biographies of Kūkai suggest that he became disillusioned with his Confucian studies, but developed a strong interest in Buddhist studies instead.

Around the age of 22, Kūkai was introduced to Buddhist practice involving chanting the mantra of Kokūzō (Sanskrit: Ākāśagarbha), the bodhisattva of the void. During this period, Kūkai frequently sought out isolated mountain regions where he chanted the Ākāśagarbha mantra relentlessly. At age 24 he published his first major literary work, &quot;Sangō Shiiki&quot;, in which he quotes from an extensive list of sources, including the classics of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. The Nara temples, with their extensive libraries, possessed these texts.

During this period in Japanese history, the central government closely regulated Buddhism through the and enforced its policies, based on the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; legal code. Ascetics and independent monks, like Kūkai, were frequently banned and lived outside the law, but still wandered the countryside or from temple to temple.

During this period of private Buddhist practice, Kūkai had a dream, in which a man appeared and told Kūkai that the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; is the scripture which contained the doctrine Kūkai was seeking. Though Kūkai soon managed to obtain a copy of this sutra which had only recently become available in Japan, he immediately encountered difficulty. Much of the sutra was in untranslated Sanskrit written in the Siddhaṃ script. Kūkai found the translated portion of the sutra was very cryptic. Because Kūkai could find no one who could elucidate the text for him, he resolved to go to China to study the text there. Ryuichi Abe suggests that the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; bridged the gap between his interest in the practice of religious exercises and the doctrinal knowledge acquired through his studies.

===Travel and study in China===
In 804, Kūkai took part in a government-sponsored expedition to China, led by Fujiwara no Kadanomaro, in order to learn more about the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;. Scholars are unsure why Kūkai was selected to take part in an official mission to China, given his background as a private monk who was not sponsored by the state. Theories include family connections within the Saeki-Ōtomo clan, or connections through fellow clergy or a member of the Fujiwara clan.

The expedition included four ships, with Kūkai on the first ship, while another famous monk, Saichō was on the second ship. During a storm, the third ship turned back, while the fourth ship was lost at sea. Kūkai&#x27;s ship arrived weeks later in the province of Fujian and its passengers were initially denied entry to the port while the ship was impounded. Kūkai, being literate in Chinese, wrote a letter to the governor of the province explaining their situation. The governor allowed the ship to dock, and the party was asked to proceed to the capital of Chang&#x27;an (present day Xi&#x27;an), the capital of the Tang dynasty.

After further delays, the Tang court granted Kūkai a place in Ximing Temple, where his study of Chinese Buddhism began in earnest. He also studied Sanskrit with the Gandharan pandit Prajñā (734–810?), who had been educated at the Indian Buddhist university at Nalanda.

It was in 805 that Kūkai finally met the monk Huiguo (746–805) the man who would initiate him into Chinese Esoteric Buddhism (&quot;Tangmi&quot;) at Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s Qinglong Monastery (青龍寺). Huiguo came from an illustrious lineage of Buddhist masters, famed especially for translating Sanskrit texts into Chinese, including the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;. Kūkai describes their first meeting:

Huiguo immediately bestowed upon Kūkai the first level &quot;abhisheka&quot; (esoteric initiation). Whereas Kūkai had expected to spend 20 years studying in China, in a few short months he was to receive the final initiation, and become a master of the esoteric lineage. Huiguo was said to have described teaching Kūkai as like &quot;pouring water from one vase into another&quot;. Huiguo died shortly afterwards, but not before instructing Kūkai to return to Japan and spread the esoteric teachings there, assuring him that other disciples would carry on his work in China.

Kūkai arrived back in Japan in 806 as the eighth Patriarch of Esoteric Buddhism, having learnt Sanskrit and its Siddhaṃ script, studied Indian Buddhism, as well as having studied the arts of Chinese calligraphy and poetry, all with recognized masters. He also arrived with a large number of texts, many of which were new to Japan and were esoteric in character, as well as several texts on the Sanskrit language and the Siddhaṃ script.

However, in Kūkai&#x27;s absence Emperor Kanmu had died and was replaced by Emperor Heizei who exhibited no great enthusiasm for Buddhism. Kūkai&#x27;s return from China was eclipsed by Saichō, the founder of the Tendai school, who found favor with the court during this time. Saichō had already had esoteric rites officially recognised by the court as an integral part of Tendai, and had already performed the &quot;abhisheka&quot;, or initiatory ritual, for the court by the time Kūkai returned to Japan. Later, with Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s death, Saichō&#x27;s fortunes began to wane.

Saichō requested, in 812, that Kūkai give him the introductory initiation, which Kūkai agreed to do. He also granted a second-level initiation upon Saichō, but refused to bestow the final initiation (which would have qualified Saichō as a master of esoteric Buddhism) because Saichō had not completed the required studies, leading to a falling out between the two that was not resolved; this feud later extended to the Shingon and Tendai sects.

Little is known about Kūkai&#x27;s movements until 809 when the court finally responded to Kūkai&#x27;s report on his studies, which also contained an inventory of the texts and other objects he had brought with him, and a petition for state support to establish the new esoteric Buddhism in Japan. That document, the &quot;Catalogue of Imported Items&quot;, is the first attempt by Kūkai to distinguish the new form of Buddhism from that already practiced in Japan. The court&#x27;s response was an order to reside in Takao-san temple (modern Jingo-ji) in the suburbs of Kyoto. This was to be Kūkai&#x27;s headquarters for the next 14 years. The year 809 also saw the retirement of Emperor Heizei due to illness and the succession of the Emperor Saga, who supported Kūkai and exchanged poems and other gifts.

===Emerging from obscurity===

In 810, Kūkai emerged as a public figure when he was appointed administrative head of Tōdai-ji, the central temple in Nara, and head of the .

Shortly after his enthronement, Emperor Saga became seriously ill, and while he was recovering, Emperor Heizei fomented a rebellion, which had to be put down by force. Kūkai petitioned the Emperor to allow him to carry out certain esoteric rituals which were said to &quot;enable a king to vanquish the seven calamities, to maintain the four seasons in harmony, to protect the nation and family, and to give comfort to himself and others&quot;. The petition was granted. Prior to this, the government relied on the monks from the traditional schools in Nara to perform rituals, such as chanting the Golden Light Sutra to bolster the government, but this event marked a new reliance on the esoteric tradition to fulfill this role.

With the public initiation ceremonies for Saichō and others at Takao-san temple in 812, Kūkai became the acknowledged master of esoteric Buddhism in Japan. He set about organizing his disciples into an order – making them responsible for administration, maintenance and construction at the temple, as well as for monastic discipline. In 813 Kūkai outlined his aims and practices in the document called &quot;The admonishments of Konin&quot;. It was also during this period at Takaosan that he completed many of the seminal works of the Shingon School:

* &quot;Attaining Enlightenment in This Very Existence&quot;
* &quot;The Meaning of Sound, Word, Reality&quot;
* &quot;Meanings of the Word Hūm&quot;

All of these were written in 817. Records show that Kūkai was also busy writing poetry, conducting rituals, and writing epitaphs and memorials on request. His popularity at the court only increased, and spread.

Meanwhile, Kukai&#x27;s new esoteric teachings and literature drew scrutiny from a noted scholar-monk of the time named Tokuitsu, who traded letters back and forth in 815 asking for clarification. The dialogue between them proved constructive and helped to give Kūkai more credibility, while the Nara Schools took greater interest in esoteric practice.

===Mount Kōya===

In 816, Emperor Saga accepted Kūkai&#x27;s request to establish a mountain retreat at Mount Kōya as a retreat from worldly affairs. The ground was officially consecrated in the middle of 819 with rituals lasting seven days. He could not stay, however, as he had received an imperial order to act as advisor to the secretary of state, and he therefore entrusted the project to a senior disciple. As many surviving letters to patrons attest, fund-raising for the project now began to take up much of Kūkai&#x27;s time, and financial difficulties were a persistent concern; indeed, the project was not fully realised until after Kūkai&#x27;s death in 835.

Kūkai&#x27;s vision was that Mt. Kōya was to become a representation of the Mandala of the Two Realms that form the basis of Shingon Buddhism: the central plateau as the Womb Realm mandala, with the peaks surrounding the area as petals of a lotus; and located in the centre of this would be the Diamond Realm mandala in the form of a temple which he named Kongōbu-ji (&quot;Diamond Peak Temple&quot;). At the center of the temple complex sits an enormous statue of Vairocana, who is the personification of Ultimate Reality.

=== Public works ===
In 821, Kūkai took on a civil engineering task, that of restoring Manno Reservoir, which is still the largest irrigation reservoir in Japan. His leadership enabled the previously floundering project to be completed smoothly, and is now the source of some of the many legendary stories which surround his figure. In 822 Kūkai performed an initiation ceremony for the ex-emperor Heizei. In the same year Saichō died.

===Tō-ji period===

When Emperor Kanmu had moved the capital in 784, he had not permitted the powerful Buddhists from the temples of Nara to follow him. He did commission two new temples: Tō-ji (Eastern Temple) and Sai-ji (Western Temple) which flanked the road at southern entrance to the city, protecting the capital from evil influences. However, after nearly thirty years the temples were still not completed. In 823 the soon-to-retire Emperor Saga asked Kūkai, experienced in public works projects, to take over Tō-ji and finish the building project. Saga gave Kūkai free rein, enabling him to make Tō-ji the first Esoteric Buddhist centre in Kyoto, and also giving him a base much closer to the court, and its power.

The new emperor, Emperor Junna (r. 823–833), was also well disposed towards Kūkai. In response to a request from the emperor, Kūkai, along with other Japanese Buddhist leaders, submitted a document which set out the beliefs, practices and important texts of his form of Buddhism. In his imperial decree granting approval of Kūkai&#x27;s outline of esoteric Buddhism, Junna uses the term for the first time. An imperial decree gave Kūkai exclusive use of Tō-ji for the Shingon School, which set a new precedent in an environment where previously temples had been open to all forms of Buddhism. It also allowed him to retain 50 monks at the temple and train them in Shingon. This was the final step in establishing Shingon as an independent Buddhist movement, with a solid institutional basis with state authorization. Shingon had become legitimate.

In 824, Kūkai was officially appointed to the temple construction project. In that year he founded Zenpuku-ji, the second oldest temple of the Edo (Tokyo) region. In 824 he was also appointed to the Office of Priestly Affairs. The Office consisted of four positions, with the Supreme Priest being an honorary position which was often vacant. The effective head of the Sōgō was the . Kūkai&#x27;s appointment was to the position of . In addition there was a who was responsible for the monastic code of discipline. At Tō-ji, in addition to the main hall (&quot;kondō&quot;) and some minor buildings on the site, Kūkai added the lecture hall in 825 which was specifically designed along Shingon Buddhist principles, which included the making of 14 Buddha images. Also in 825, Kūkai was invited to become tutor to the crown prince. Then in 826 he initiated the construction of a large pagoda at Tō-ji which was not completed in his lifetime (the present pagoda was built in 1644 by the third Tokugawa Shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu). In 827 Kūkai was promoted to be &quot;Daisōzu&quot; in which capacity he presided over state rituals, the emperor and the imperial family.

The year 828 saw Kūkai open his School of Arts and Sciences (&quot;Shugei Shuchi-in&quot;). The school was a private institution open to all regardless of social rank. This was in contrast to the only other school in the capital which was only open to members of the aristocracy. The school taught Taoism and Confucianism, in addition to Buddhism, and provided free meals to the pupils. The latter was essential because the poor could not afford to live and attend the school without it. The school closed ten years after Kūkai&#x27;s death, when it was sold in order to purchase some rice fields for supporting monastic affairs.

===Final years===
Kūkai completed his magnum opus, The , in 830. Because of its great length, it has yet to have been fully translated into any language. A simplified summary, , followed soon after. The first signs of the illness that would eventually lead to Kūkai&#x27;s death appeared in 831. He sought to retire, but the emperor would not accept his resignation and instead gave him sick leave. Toward the end of 832, Kūkai went back to Mt. Kōya and spent most of his remaining life there. In 834, he petitioned the court to establish a Shingon chapel in the palace for the purpose of conducting rituals that would ensure the health of the state. This request was granted and Shingon ritual became incorporated into the official court calendar of events. In 835, just two months before his death, Kūkai was finally granted permission to annually ordain three Shingon monks at Mt. Kōya – the number of new ordainees being still strictly controlled by the state. This meant that Kōya had gone from being a private institution to a state-sponsored one.

With the end approaching, he stopped taking food and water, and spent much of his time absorbed in meditation. At midnight on the 21st day of the third month (835), he died at the age of 62. Emperor Ninmyō (r. 833–50) sent a message of condolence to Mount Kōya, expressing his regret that he could not attend the cremation due to the time lag in communication caused by Mount Kōya&#x27;s isolation. However, Kūkai was not given the traditional cremation, but instead, in accordance with his will, was entombed on the eastern peak of Mount Kōya. &quot;When, some time after, the tomb was opened, Kōbō-Daishi was found as if still sleeping, with complexion unchanged and hair grown a bit longer.&quot;

Legend has it that Kūkai has not died, but entered into an eternal &quot;samadhi&quot; (meditative trance) and is still alive on Mount Kōya, awaiting the appearance of Maitreya, the Buddha of the future.

== Kūkai devotion and mantra ==

In modern Shingon, Kūkai is seen as a bodhisattva that one can pray and have devotion towards, similar to how the historical figure Padmasambhava became a figure of devotion in Tibet. Pilgrimages and devotional events focused around Kūkai remain a key part of the Shingon faith. The most important Kūkai pilgrimage route is the Shikoku Pilgrimage (四国遍路, &quot;Shikoku Henro&quot;).

Kūkai&#x27;s mausoleum (the &quot;Gobyo&quot;) at Mount Kōya is at Okunoin (奥の院) temple and it is the main site for devotion to Kūkai. Offerings and prayers to Kūkai are made around the year at this site. He is believed by the faithful to still be alive, having entered a deep &quot;samadhi&quot; (meditative absorption) until the arrival of the next Buddha Maitreya. There is also a large graveyard at this site, as many individuals throughout Japanese Buddhist history have wished to be buried near Kūkai.

Kūkai also has a popular mantra which is recited in Shingon religious services. It is called the Hōgō (treasure name) and is: namu daishi henjō kongō

南 無 大 師 遍 照 金 剛The mantra means &quot;homage (namu) great teacher (daishi) henjō kongō (Vairocana vajra, Kūkai&#x27;s secret tantric name). It could be rendered in Sanskrit as namo mahāguru vairocana vajra. The modern form of the Hōgō was widely used at least by the Muromachi period (1336–1573). It may have been created by the Shingon priest Dōhan (道範, 1178–1252) and is found in his &quot;Himitsu nenbutsu shō.&quot;

== Stories and legends ==

Kūkai&#x27;s prominence in Japanese Buddhism has spawned numerous stories and legends about him. When searching for a place on Mount Kōya to build a temple, Kūkai was said to have been welcomed by two Shinto deities of the mountain—the male Kariba, and the female Niu. Kariba was said to have appeared as a hunter, and guided Kūkai through the mountains with the help of a white dog and a black dog. Later, both Kariba and Niu were interpreted as manifestations of the Buddha Vairocana, the central figure in Shingon Buddhism and subject of Kūkai&#x27;s lifelong interest.

Another legend tells the story of Emon Saburō, the wealthiest man in Shikoku. One day, a mendicant monk came to his house, seeking alms. Emon refused, broke the pilgrim&#x27;s begging bowl, and chased him away. After this, his eight sons fell ill and died. Emon realized that Kūkai was the affronted pilgrim and set out to seek his forgiveness. Having traveled round the island twenty times clockwise in vain, he undertook the route in reverse. Finally, he collapsed exhausted and on his deathbed. Kūkai appeared to grant absolution. Emon requested that he be reborn into a wealthy family in Matsuyama so that he might restore a neglected temple. Dying, he clasped a stone. Shortly afterwards a baby was born with his hand grasped tightly around a stone inscribed &quot;Emon Saburō is reborn.&quot; When the baby grew up, he used his wealth to restore the , in which there is an inscription from 1567 recounting the tale.

According to one legend, male same-sex love was introduced into Japan by Kūkai. Historians, however, point that this is probably not true since Kūkai was an enthusiastic follower of monastic regulations. Nonetheless, the legend served to &quot;affirm same-sex relation between men and boys in 17th-century Japan.&quot;

==In popular culture==
 a film from 1984 directed by Junya Sato. Kūkai is played by Kin&#x27;ya Kitaōji and Saichō is played by Gō Katō.

The 1991 drama film &quot;Mandala&quot; (Chinese: 曼荼羅; Japanese: 若き日の弘法大師・空海), a China–Japan co-production, was based on Kūkai&#x27;s travels in China. The film stars Toshiyuki Nagashima as Kūkai, also co-starring Junko Sakurada and Zhang Fengyi as Huiguo.

The 2017 fantasy film &quot;Legend of the Demon Cat&quot; stars Shōta Sometani as Kūkai.

<doc id="291754" wikidata="Q92775" url="?curid=291754" title="Humphrey Carpenter">
<text>Humphrey William Bouverie Carpenter (29 April 1946 – 4 January 2005) was an English biographer, writer, and radio broadcaster. He is known especially for his biographies of J. R. R. Tolkien and other members of the literary society the Inklings. He won a Mythopoeic Award for his book &quot;The Inklings&quot; in 1982.

== Early life ==

Carpenter was born in the city of Oxford, England. His father was Harry Carpenter, Bishop of Oxford. His mother was Urith Monica Trevelyan, who had training in the Fröbel teaching method. As a child, he lived in the Warden&#x27;s Lodgings at Keble College, Oxford, where his father served as warden until his appointment as Bishop of Oxford. He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford and Marlborough College. He returned to Oxford to read English at Keble College.

==Broadcasting==
Carpenter began his broadcasting career at BBC Radio Oxford as a presenter and producer where he met Mari Prichard (whose father was Caradog Prichard, the Welsh novelist and poet); they married in 1973. They jointly produced &quot;A Thames Companion&quot; in 1975. He played a role in launching Radio 3&#x27;s arts discussion programme &quot;Night Waves&quot; and acted as a regular presenter of other programmes on the network including Radio 3&#x27;s afternoon drivetime programme &quot;In Tune&quot; and, until it was discontinued, its Sunday request programme &quot;Listeners&#x27; Choice&quot;. Until his death, he presented the BBC Radio 4 biography series &quot;Great Lives&quot; recorded in Bristol. The last edition recorded before his death featured an interview with the singer Eddi Reader about the poet Robert Burns, the major focus of her creative work. BBC Radio 4 broadcast this programme on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2004.

==Jazz music and children&#x27;s drama==
Carpenter was an amateur jazz musician who played the piano, the saxophone, and the double-bass, the last instrument professionally in a dance band in the 1970s. In 1983, he formed a 1930s style jazz band, Vile Bodies, which for many years enjoyed a residency at the Ritz Hotel in London. He also founded the Mushy Pea Theatre Group, a children&#x27;s drama group based in Oxford, which premiered his &quot;Mr Majeika: The Musical&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Babes&quot;, a musical about Hollywood child stars.

==Children&#x27;s books==
His &quot;Mr Majeika&quot; series of children&#x27;s books were adapted for television. &quot;The Joshers: Or London to Birmingham with Albert and Victoria&quot; (1977) is a children&#x27;s adventure book, similar in style to &quot;The Railway Children&quot; and based on the adventure of taking a working narrowboat up the Grand Union Canal from London to Birmingham.

==Non-fiction works==
His biographies included &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography&quot; (1977; also editing of &quot;The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;), &quot;The Inklings: CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Charles Williams and their Friends&quot; (1978; winner of the 1978 Somerset Maugham Award), W. H. Auden (1981), Ezra Pound (1988; winner of the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize), Evelyn Waugh (1989), Benjamin Britten (1992), Robert Runcie (1997), Dennis Potter, and Spike Milligan (2004). He authored &quot;Geniuses Together: American Writers in Paris in the 1920s&quot; (1987); his last book was &quot;The Seven Lives of John Murray&quot; (2008) about John Murray and the publishing house of Albemarle Street, was published posthumously.

He wrote histories of BBC Radio 3, the British satire boom of the 1960s, &quot;Angry Young Men: A Literary Comedy of the 1950s&quot; (2002), and a centennial history of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1985. His encyclopaedic work, &quot;The Oxford Companion to Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; (1984), written jointly with his wife, Mari Prichard, has become a standard reference source.

==Death==
Humphrey Carpenter died in 2005 of heart failure, compounded by the Parkinson&#x27;s disease from which he had suffered for several years. He was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford, also the final resting place of J. R. R. Tolkien. A commemorative stained-glass window was installed in St Margaret&#x27;s Institute, Polstead Road, honouring Carpenter&#x27;s many accomplishments.

<text>Witch-hazels or witch hazels (Hamamelis) are a genus of flowering plants in the family Hamamelidaceae, with three species in North America (&quot;H. ovalis&quot;, &quot;H. virginiana&quot;, and &quot;H. vernalis&quot;), and one each in Japan (&quot;H. japonica&quot;) and China (&quot;H. mollis&quot;). The North American species are occasionally called winterbloom.

==Description==
The witch-hazels are deciduous shrubs or (rarely) small trees growing to 3 to 7.5 m tall, even more rarely to 12 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, oval, 5 to 15 cm long, and 2.5 to 10 cm wide, with a smooth or wavy margin. The genus name, &quot;Hamamelis&quot;, means &quot;together with fruit&quot;, referring to the simultaneous occurrence of flowers with the maturing fruit from the previous year. &quot;H. virginiana&quot; blooms in September–November while the other species bloom from January–March. Each flower has four slender strap-shaped petals 1 to 2 cm long, pale to dark yellow, orange, or red. The fruit is a two-part capsule 1 cm long, containing a single 0.6 cm glossy black seed in each of the two parts; the capsule splits explosively at maturity in the autumn about eight months after flowering, ejecting the seeds with sufficient force to fly for distances of up to , thus another alternative name &quot;snapping hazel&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;witch&quot; in witch-hazel has its origins in Middle English &quot;wiche&quot;, from the Old English &quot;wice&quot;, meaning &quot;pliant&quot; or &quot;bendable&quot;, and is not related to the word &quot;witch&quot; meaning a practitioner of magic. Jacob George Strutt&#x27;s 1822 book, &quot;Sylva Britannica&quot; attests that &quot;Wych Hazel&quot; was used in England as a synonym for wych elm, the entirely unrelated &quot;Ulmus glabra&quot;; The use of the twigs as divining rods, just as hazel twigs were used in England, may also have, by folk etymology, influenced the &quot;witch&quot; part of the name.

==Species==
Five species are recognized:
* &quot;Hamamelis japonica&quot; – Japanese witch-hazel
* &quot;Hamamelis mollis&quot; – Chinese witch hazel
* &quot;Hamamelis ovalis&quot; – big-leaf witch-hazel
* &quot;Hamamelis vernalis&quot; – Ozark witchhazel
* &quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot; – common witch-hazel or American witch-hazel

&quot;Hamamelis mexicana&quot; is sometimes considered a species, though Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online considers it a variety of &quot;H. virginiana&quot;.

The Persian ironwood, a closely related tree formerly treated as &quot;Hamamelis persica&quot;, is now given a genus of its own, as &quot;Parrotia persica&quot;, as it differs in the flowers having just sepals and no petals. Other closely allied genera are &quot;Parrotiopsis&quot;, &quot;Fothergilla&quot;, and &quot;Sycopsis&quot; (see under Hamamelidaceae). Witch-hazels are not closely related to the true &quot;Corylus&quot; hazels, though they have a few superficially similar characteristics which may cause one to believe that they are - their leaves are a similar shape, and turn a similar shade of yellow in autumn.

==Cultivation==
They are popular ornamental plants, grown for their clusters of rich yellow to orange-red flowers, which begin to expand in the autumn as or slightly before the leaves fall and continue throughout the winter.

===Garden shrubs===
&quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot; was introduced into English gardens by Peter Collinson, who maintained correspondence with plant hunters in the American colonies. It is rarely seen in the nursery trade except for woodland/wildlife restoration projects and native plant enthusiasts. Much more common is &quot;H. mollis&quot;, which has bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter instead of the yellow blossoms of &quot;H. virginiana&quot; which tend to be lost among the plant&#x27;s fall foliage. The plant-hunter Charles Maries collected for Veitch Nurseries in the Chinese district of Jiujiang in 1879. It languished in nursery rows for years until it was noticed, propagated, and put on the market in 1902.

Numerous cultivars have been selected for use as garden shrubs, many of them derived from the hybrid &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;intermedia&quot; Rehder (&quot;H. japonica&quot; × &quot;H. mollis&quot;). Jelena and Robert de Belder of Arboretum Kalmthout, selecting for red cultivars, found three: the first, with bronze flowers, was named &#x27;Jelena&#x27;; the next, with red flowers, was named &#x27;Diane&#x27; (the name of their daughter); the last, with deep red flowers, was called &#x27;Livia&#x27; (the name of their granddaughter).

==Phytochemicals and hamamelis water==
The main phytochemicals in witch-hazel leaves are polyphenols, including 3–10% tannins, flavonoids, and up to 0.5% essential oil, while the bark has a higher tannin content. Hamamelis water, also called &quot;white hazel&quot; or &quot;witch hazel water&quot; prepared from a steam-distillation process using leaves, bark or twigs, is a clear, colorless liquid containing 13–15% ethanol having the odor of the essential oil, but with no tannins present. Essential oil components, such as carvacrol and eugenol, may be present.

As an ingredient and topical agent, witch-hazel water is regulated in the United States as an over-the-counter drug for external use only to soothe minor skin irritations. Hamamelis (witch-hazel) water is diluted using water in a 1:3 preparation, and is not intended for oral use which may cause nausea, vomiting, or constipation.

===Topical ointment===
Witch-hazel may be sold as a semisolid ointment, cream, gel, or salve for topical use, and due to its astringent and antiseptic properties, has long been used to treat various skin conditions like acne. The ointment may ease discomfort from post-partum vaginal soreness and hemorrhoids. It is commonly used to treat diaper rash in infants, and may reduce symptoms of inflammation from minor skin injuries. A 2012 review (updated in October 2020) found little evidence of effectiveness from local cooling treatments (including witch-hazel pads) applied to the perineum following childbirth to relieve pain.

==Folk medicine==
The leaves and bark of the North American witch-hazel, &quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot;, are used in folk medicine, herbalism, and skincare decoctions by Native Americans. Extracts of witch-hazel have been claimed to be effective for psoriasis and eczema, to prevent dehydration of skin, and for insect bites, poison ivy, and razor burn. There is limited clinical evidence to support witch-hazel as an effective treatment for any of these conditions. Prepared by distillation, the essential oil of witch-hazel has such a small proportion of tannins or other polyphenols that it is unlikely to have any therapeutic effect, and may cause contact dermatitis when used topically. It might be useful in treating hemorrhoids and relieving some of its symptoms, although more research is needed.

In 2017, one manufacturer of skin care products containing witch-hazel was warned by the Food and Drug Administration for making unsubstantiated health claims and for not providing evidence the products were safe.

===History===
Early Puritan settlers in New England learned about witch-hazel from the Native peoples, but its use did not become widely established in the United States until the 19th century. 

A missionary, Dr. Charles Hawes, adopted the process of steam distillation of witch-hazel twigs, creating a &quot;Hawes Extract&quot; product sold in Essex, Connecticut, in 1846, by druggist and chemist, Alvan Whittemore. Thomas Newton Dickinson Sr. is credited with starting the commercial production of witch-hazel extract in 1866, and eventually establishing nine production sites in eastern Connecticut during the 20th century. Following his death, his two sons, Thomas N. Dickinson Jr., of Mystic, Connecticut, and Everett E. Dickinson of Essex, each inherited parts of the family business and continued the manufacture of witch-hazel extract, operating competing &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s&quot; businesses that their descendants continued until 1997 when the manufacturing operations from both companies were consolidated at the American Distilling plant in East Hampton, CT.

In 1846, Theron T. Pond marketed a similar product, &quot;Golden Treasure&quot;, extracted from witch hazel bark. After Pond died in 1852, it was marketed as &quot;Pond&#x27;s Extract&quot;, used in a topical ointment remaining on the market, as of 2024.

<doc id="291767" wikidata="Q375837" url="?curid=291767" title="Gallic acid">
<text>Gallic acid (also known as 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) is a trihydroxybenzoic acid with the formula C6H2(OH)3CO2H. It is classified as a phenolic acid. It is found in gallnuts, sumac, witch hazel, tea leaves, oak bark, and other plants. It is a white solid, although samples are typically brown owing to partial oxidation. Salts and esters of gallic acid are termed &quot;gallates&quot;.

Its name is derived from oak galls, which were historically used to prepare tannic acid. Despite the name, gallic acid does not contain gallium.

==Isolation and derivatives==
Gallic acid is easily freed from gallotannins by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis. When heated with concentrated sulfuric acid, gallic acid converts to rufigallol. Hydrolyzable tannins break down on hydrolysis to give gallic acid and glucose or ellagic acid and glucose, known as gallotannins and ellagitannins, respectively.

=== Biosynthesis ===

Gallic acid is formed from 3-dehydroshikimate by the action of the enzyme shikimate dehydrogenase to produce 3,5-didehydroshikimate. This latter compound aromatizes.

===Reactions===
====Oxidation and oxidative coupling====
Alkaline solutions of gallic acid are readily oxidized by air. The oxidation is catalyzed by the enzyme gallate dioxygenase, an enzyme found in &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot;.

Oxidative coupling of gallic acid with arsenic acid, permanganate, persulfate, or iodine yields ellagic acid, as does reaction of methyl gallate with iron(III) chloride. Gallic acid forms intermolecular esters (depsides) such as digallic and cyclic ether-esters (depsidones).
====Hydrogenation====
Hydrogenation of gallic acid gives the cyclohexane derivative hexahydrogallic acid.
====Decarboxylation====
Heating gallic acid gives pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene). This conversion is catalyzed by gallate decarboxylase.
====Esterification====
Many esters of gallic acid are known, both synthetic and natural. Gallate 1-beta-glucosyltransferase catalyzes the glycosylation (attachment of glucose) of gallic acid.

== Historical context and uses ==
Gallic acid is an important component of iron gall ink, the standard European writing and drawing ink from the 12th to 19th centuries, with a history extending to the Roman empire and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) describes the use of gallic acid as a means of detecting an adulteration of verdigris and writes that it was used to produce dyes. Galls (also known as oak apples) from oak trees were crushed and mixed with water, producing tannic acid. It could then be mixed with green vitriol (ferrous sulfate)—obtained by allowing sulfate-saturated water from a spring or mine drainage to evaporate—and gum arabic from acacia trees; this combination of ingredients produced the ink.

Gallic acid was one of the substances used by Angelo Mai (1782–1854), among other early investigators of palimpsests, to clear the top layer of text off and reveal hidden manuscripts underneath. Mai was the first to employ it, but did so &quot;with a heavy hand&quot;, often rendering manuscripts too damaged for subsequent study by other researchers.

Gallic acid was first studied by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1786. In 1818, French chemist and pharmacist Henri Braconnot (1780–1855) devised a simpler method of purifying gallic acid from galls; gallic acid was also studied by the French chemist Théophile-Jules Pelouze (1807–1867), among others.

When mixed with acetic acid, gallic acid had uses in early types of photography, like the calotype to make the silver more sensitive to light; it was also used in developing photographs.

== Occurrence ==
Gallic acid is found in a number of land plants, such as the parasitic plant &quot;Cynomorium coccineum&quot;, the aquatic plant &quot;Myriophyllum spicatum&quot;, and the blue-green alga &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot;. Gallic acid is also found in various oak species, &quot;Caesalpinia mimosoides,&quot; and in the stem bark of &quot;Boswellia dalzielii,&quot; among others. Many foodstuffs contain various amounts of gallic acid, especially fruits (including strawberries, grapes, bananas), as well as teas, cloves, and vinegars. Carob fruit is a rich source of gallic acid (24–165 mg per 100 g).

== Esters ==
Also known as galloylated esters:
* Methyl gallate
* Ethyl gallate, a food additive with E number E313
* Propyl gallate, or propyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate, an ester formed by the condensation of gallic acid and propanol
* Octyl gallate, the ester of octanol and gallic acid
* Dodecyl gallate, or lauryl gallate, the ester of dodecanol and gallic acid
* Epicatechin gallate, a flavan-3-ol, a type of flavonoid, present in green tea
* Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), also known as epigallocatechin 3-gallate, the ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid, and a type of catechin
* Gallocatechin gallate (GCG), the ester of gallocatechin and gallic acid and a type of flavan-3ol
* Theaflavin-3-gallate, a theaflavin derivative

Gallate esters are antioxidants useful in food preservation, with propyl gallate being the most commonly used. Their use in human health is scantly supported by evidence.

<text>The Yankee&quot; class, [[List of ships of Russia by project number|Soviet designations]]Project 667A &quot;Navaga (navaga) and Project 667AU &quot;Nalim ([[burbot]]) for the [[Initial operating capability|basic]] Yankee&quot;-I, were a family of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines built in the Soviet Union for the Soviet Navy. In total, 34 units were built: 24 in Severodvinsk for the Northern Fleet and the remaining 10 in Komsomolsk-on-Amur for the Pacific Fleet. Two Northern Fleet units were later transferred to the Pacific.

The &quot;Yankee&quot;-class were subject to a wide variety of modifications; these ships have a different designation to the original model.

==Design==
The Yankee-class nuclear submarines were the first class of Soviet ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) to have thermonuclear firepower comparable with that of their American and British Polaris submarine counterparts. The Yankee class were quieter in the ocean than were their predecessors, and had better streamlining that improved their underwater performance. The Yankee class were actually quite similar to the Polaris submarines of the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy. These boats were all armed with 16 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) with multiple nuclear warheads as nuclear deterrents during the Cold War, and their ballistic missiles had ranges from .

==General characteristics (Yankee I)==
*Length: 
*Beam: 
*Draught: 
*Surface displacement: 7,760 tonnes
*Full (Diving) displacement: 11,500 tonnes
*Speed: 
*Power plant: 2 VM-4 reactors
*Hull: Low magnetic steel
*Crew: 114
*Compartments: 10
*Armament:
**4 torpedo tubes for 14 Type 53 torpedoes or mines.
**2 torpedo tubes for 4 Type 40 torpedoes
**16 SS-N-6 liquid-fueled ballistic missiles
== Operational history ==

The Yankee-class SSBNs served in the Soviet Navy in three oceans: the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean beginning in the 1960s. During the 1970s about three Yankee-class were continually on patrol in a so-called &quot;patrol box&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean just east of Bermuda and off the US Pacific coast. This forward deployment of the SSBNs was seen to balance the presence of American, British, and French nuclear weapons kept in Western Europe and on warships (including nuclear submarines) in the surrounding Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic.

The lead boat K-137 &quot;Leninets&quot; received its honorific name on 11 April 1970, two and one half years after being commissioned.

One Yankee-class submarine, , was lost on 6 October 1986 after an explosion and fire on board. This boat had been at sea near Bermuda, and she sank from loss of buoyancy because of flooding. Four of her sailors died before rescue ships arrived. The events surrounding the loss of this boat has continued to be controversial.

At least one other boat in this class was involved in a collision with a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine.

Because of their increasing age, and as negotiated in the SALT I, START I and START II treaties that reduce nuclear armaments of the United States and the Soviet Union, all boats of Yankee class were disarmed, decommissioned and sent to the nuclear ship scrapyards.

== Variants ==
There were eight different versions of the &quot;Yankee&quot;-class submarines:

In addition, Soviet/Russian classification includes the &quot;Delta&quot;-class submarines within the same family of Project 667; Deltas being Project 667B onwards.

=== Units ===

=== Popular culture ===

In Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1986 techno-thriller Red Storm Rising, the entire Yankee-class of SSBNs are proposed to be taken out of service and scrapped by the Soviet Union as part of the Maskirovka I, in part to have the United States to do likewise with its own first-generation George Washington class, Ethan Allen class and Lafayette class SSBNs, and allay NATO misgivings of the USSR&#x27;s intentions.

<doc id="291782" wikidata="Q1324633" url="?curid=291782" title="Naval base">
<text>A naval base, navy base, or military port is a military base, where warships and naval ships are docked when they have no mission at sea or need to restock. Ships may also undergo repairs. Some naval bases are temporary homes to aircraft that usually stay on ships but are undergoing maintenance while the ship is in port.

In the United States, the United States Department of the Navy&#x27;s General Order No. 135 issued in 1911 as a formal guide to naval terminology described a naval station as &quot;any establishment for building, manufacturing, docking, repair, supply, or training under control of the Navy. It may also include several establishments&quot;. A naval base, by contrast, was &quot;a point from which naval operations may be conducted&quot;.

In most countries, naval bases are expressly named and identified as such.

One peculiarity of the Royal Navy and certain other navies which closely follow British naval traditions is the concept of the stone frigate: a naval base on land that is named like a ship. Certain facilities were often initially housed on hulks as a cost-saving measure and were later moved to land but kept their traditional names.

<doc id="291783" wikidata="Q534961" url="?curid=291783" title="Henri, Count of Paris (1933–2019)">
<text>Henri Philippe Pierre Marie d&#x27;Orléans (14 June 1933 – 21 January 2019) was the Orléanist pretender to the defunct French throne as Henry VII. He used the style of Count of Paris.

He was head of the House of Orléans as senior in male-line descent from King Louis-Philippe, who reigned from 1830 to 1848. Henri was a retired military officer as well as an author and painter.

== Early life ==
He was the first son of Henri, Count of Paris (1908–1999), and his wife Princess Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza, and was born in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, Belgium, a law in 1886 having permanently exiled from France the heads of its formerly reigning dynasties and their eldest sons.

Despite the ban, while living in Belgium Henri occasionally accompanied his mother on brief visits to France and, later, to his mother&#x27;s relatives in Brazil. In August 1940 as World War II escalated, the family relocated to property they owned in Larache in the French protectorate of Morocco. While his father sought to play a role in the French resistance, Henri, in 1940 a child of 7, remained at Larache with his mother, siblings, grandmother and father&#x27;s sisters&#x27; families during the Nazi occupation of France, sharing a small desert home that lacked electricity. Advised by Henri Giraud&#x27;s Moroccan command that the Orléans had become unwelcome in the protectorate following the assassination of Vichy regime collaborater François Darlan by the monarchist Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, the family relocated to Pamplona in Spain until 1947, when they took up residence at the &quot;Quinta do Anjinho&quot;, an estate near Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera. During that year, President Vincent Auriol allowed Henri and his brother François to visit France, and in 1948 he was allowed to enroll in a &quot;lycée&quot; in Bordeaux.

The law of exile was abrogated in 1950, allowing Henri to repatriate with his parents. Later that year, his parents purchased an estate near Paris, the &quot;Manoir du Cœur-Volant&quot; in Louveciennes, which became Henri&#x27;s first home in France. He took part in the ship tour organized by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederica in 1954, which became known as the &quot;Cruise of the Kings&quot; and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

Henri studied at the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)&quot;, obtaining his &quot;bac&quot; in 1957, and on 30 June of that year, his father conferred upon him, as the heir apparent of his house, the title of &quot;Count of Clermont&quot;, by which he was generally known during his father&#x27;s lifetime.

== Career ==
From October 1959 to April 1962, Henri worked at the Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security as a member of the French Foreign Legion. Transferred from there to a garrison in Germany, he took up a new assignment as military instructor at Bonifacio in Corsica, where his wife and children joined him early in 1963.

Returning to civilian life in 1967, Henri and his family briefly occupied the &quot;Blanche Neige&quot; pavilion on the grounds of his father&#x27;s &quot;Cœur-Volant&quot; estate before renting an apartment of their own in the &quot;15th arrondissement&quot; of Paris. In the early 1970s Clermont managed public relations for the Geneva office of a Swiss investment firm while dwelling in Corly.

Henri wrote several books, including:
* &quot;À mes fils&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Adresse au futur chef d&#x27;État&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Désolé, Altesse, c’est mon jour de sortie&quot; (1994)
* &quot;La France survivra-t-elle à l&#x27;an 2000&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Le passeur de miroir&quot; (2000)
* &quot;La France à bout de bras&quot; (2002)
* &quot;L&#x27;histoire en héritage&quot; (2003)
* &quot;La Royauté de l&#x27;Homme&quot; (2016)

Henri was also a painter and launched his own brand of perfume. His political career included unsuccessfully contesting the 2004 European elections for the Alliance Royale, a monarchist party.

== Marriages and children ==
Henri met Duchess Marie Therese of Württemberg (born 1934), like himself a descendant of King Louis-Philippe, at a ball given by the Thurn and Taxis family in Munich. They were married on 5 July 1957 at the Royal Chapel of Dreux, on which occasion President Charles de Gaulle publicly offered congratulations, calling the wedding a great national event and observing that the dynasty and couple&#x27;s future were bound to the hopes of France. Five children were born from this union: 
# Princess Marie d&#x27;Orléans (born 3 January 1959 in Boulogne-sur-Seine) married civilly in Dreux, on 22 July 1989, and religiously in Friedrichshafen, on 29 July 1989, to Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein (born on 1 April 1949 in Vienna), and has issue:

In 1984, Henri and Marie-Thérèse were divorced. On 31 October 1984 Henri entered a civil marriage with Micaëla Anna María Cousiño y Quiñones de León (1938–2022), daughter of Luis Cousiño y Sebire and his wife Antonia Maria Quiñones de Léon y Bañuelos, 4th , and who had previously been divorced from Jean-Robert Bœuf. For remarrying without consent, Henri&#x27;s father initially declared him disinherited, substituting the non-dynastic title &quot;Comte de Mortain&quot; for his son&#x27;s Clermont countship (the latter once held in appanage by a son of Louis IX of France, who became ancestor of the Bourbon-Orléans line). Henri, though, refused all mail addressed to him as &quot;Mortain&quot;. On 27 February 1984 Marie-Thérèse, the former Countess of Clermont, was granted the title &quot;Duchess of Montpensier&quot; by her father-in-law.

On 11 February 1989 Henri was informed, by a hand-delivered letter written by his former wife, of the engagement of their eldest child Marie, to Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein, a cousin of the ruler of that principality, the wedding date being set for 29 July 1989. Although Henri acknowledged, in a 12 May 1989 &quot;Point de Vue&quot; interview, that it had been three years since he had seen Marie, he and his second wife, Micaëla Cousiño, had been welcomed for the first time to the home of his mother, the Countess of Paris, that day: Henri further acknowledged to the press that, Marie having written to invite him to her wedding, he looked forward to conducting her to the altar, rumours to the contrary notwithstanding. At the engagement party held the next day at the Palais Pallavicini, the Vienna home of the fiancé&#x27;s parents, photographs were taken, and would later be published, showing Henri speaking cordially with his daughter, sons, former wife and future son-in-law.

However, it was on this occasion that Henri learned that he would not be escorting Marie to her bridegroom during the wedding. Meanwhile, Marie-Thérèse had sent out invitations to the wedding in her name alone, omitting not only mention of Marie&#x27;s father, but also of her grandfather, &quot;Monseigneur&quot; the Count of Paris who, until then, had largely sided with the Duchess of Montpensier in family matters and had consented to his granddaughter&#x27;s choice of a spouse. This prompted father and son to join in calling for a familial boycott of the nuptials. Henri and his father refused to attend the wedding but Marie proceeded to marry civilly at Dreux&#x27;s city hall on 22 July 1989, and religiously at the castle of her mother&#x27;s brother in Germany, on 29 July 1989. All but two of Henri&#x27;s eight siblings also boycotted the ceremonies, but his sister Diane (wife of Montpensier&#x27;s brother) hosted, and Henri&#x27;s mother, &quot;Madame&quot; the Countess of Paris, was a guest at the religious wedding.

Tensions lessened after several years, and on 7 March 1991 Henri&#x27;s father reinstated him as heir apparent and Count of Clermont, simultaneously giving Micaëla the title &quot;Princesse de Joinville&quot;.

In 1980, Henri joined the Grand Orient de France where he became Grand Master of the regular Masonic Lodge &quot;Lys de France&quot; No 1297. In 2001, he left Freemasonry to become the head of the House d&#x27;Orléans. In the first half of the 2000s, he covered also the charge of Great Official of the Grande Loge de Marque de France.

== Head of house ==
Until he succeeded his father as royal claimant, Henri and his second wife occupied an apartment in Paris. On 19 June 1999, Henri&#x27;s father died and he became the new head of the House of Orléans. He took the traditional title, Count of Paris, adding an ancient one, Duke of France, not borne by his Orléans or Bourbon forebears, but used a thousand years ago by his ancestors, before Hugh Capet took the title of king. His wife assumed the title &quot;Duchess of France&quot;, deferring to the continued use of &quot;Countess of Paris&quot; by Henri&#x27;s widowed mother until her death on 5 July 2003, whereupon Micaela assumed that title.

After his father&#x27;s death, Henri annulled his father&#x27;s decision to deprive his brothers Michel (Count of Évreux) and Thibaut (the late Count of La Marche) of their succession rights because Michel married a noblewoman without permission and because Thibaut married a commoner. He also bestowed titles upon the sons of his brother Prince Jacques, Duke of Orléans: Prince Charles-Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Chartres (born 1972), and Prince Foulques d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale and Count of Eu (born 1974).

Henri recognised his disabled eldest son François as his dynastic heir-apparent, with the title Count of Clermont, declaring that François would exercise his prerogatives as head of the dynasty under the &quot;regency&quot; of his younger brother Prince Jean, Duke of Vendôme. However, with François&#x27; death on 30 December 2017, Vendôme became the Orléanist heir-apparent.

In 2009, Henri obtained an annulment of his marriage to Marie-Thérèse of Württemberg from the Holy See. He remarried his second wife, Micaëla Cousiño, in the Catholic Church in September of that year.

As Count of Paris, Henri took part in some European royal events attending, for instance, the 2011 marriage of Albert II of Monaco.

== Legal cases ==
Prior to succeeding his father as royal claimant, Henri launched an unsuccessful court case (1987–1989) in which he challenged the right of his rival paternal 10th cousin Louis-Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, to use the undifferenced royal arms of France and the Anjou title. The French courts dismissed the case on the grounds that Henri failed to prove that he had demonstrated a right to the hereditaments in questions, noting also that the court lacked jurisdiction in a dispute over dynastic claims of France&#x27;s former royal family.

After his father&#x27;s death, a court-appointed lawyer searched through the late count&#x27;s effects on behalf of his nine living children, to reclaim what remained of the family&#x27;s dissipated fortune. Jewels, art-work, and an exceptional medieval illustrated manuscript were found. These were auctioned off, raising approximately US$14 million.

In 2000 bailiffs pursued Henri for US$143,000 back rent after he fled the Villa Boileau, a 17th-century Paris house he had occupied.

<text>Gescom is an electronic music project based in the UK with close ties to the electronic duo Autechre.

Stylistically, the music of Gescom is closer to electronic dance music, acid techno, and industrial music than Autechre&#x27;s, with the exception of a few conceptual remixes (and &quot;Minidisc&quot;, see below). Notable releases include &quot;Key Nell&quot;, &quot;Minidisc&quot;, and &quot;ISS:SA&quot;.

==Members==
Sean Booth of Autechre describes Gescom as an umbrella project involving 20 or 30 people. However, since most of their releases are anonymous, the exact roster of the project is not widely known.

* Autechre&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Incunabula&quot;, has the motto &quot;Gescom &#x27;pleasure is our business&#x27;&quot; printed on the spine of the packaging, and thanks to &quot;Darrell Fitton 4 Gescom&quot; in the liner notes.
* Autechre&#x27;s remix EP &quot;Basscad&quot; has the motto &quot;Gescom &#x27;pleasure is our business&#x27;&quot; printed on the inside spine of the CD, and &quot;Autechre Music Systems from Gescom Transcendental&quot; in the liner notes.
* The Gescom EP credits &quot;conspirators&quot; as Sean Booth and Rob Brown (Autechre), Darrell Fitton (alias Bola), Rob Hall (from Skam Records), and Daniel 72 (a musician and designer near Manchester).
* The Gescom 2 EP credits its &quot;conspirators&quot; as Sean Booth and Rob Brown (Autechre), and Andy Maddocks (from Skam Records).
* The Key Nell EP just says, &quot;Conceived &amp; secreted by Gescom.&quot;
* The Keynell remixes EP just says, &quot;Conceived &amp; secreted by Gescom. Additional nurturing &amp; care from Autechre.&quot;
* The This EP credits remixes to &quot;Ae&quot; (Autechre), and Velocity Kendall.

<doc id="291789" wikidata="Q3954590" url="?curid=291789" title="Command–query separation">
<text>Command-query separation (CQS) is a principle of imperative computer programming. It was devised by Bertrand Meyer as part of his pioneering work on the Eiffel programming language.

It states that every method should either be a &quot;command&quot; that performs an action, or a &quot;query&quot; that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, &quot;asking a question should not change the answer&quot;. More formally, methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.

==Connection with design by contract==
Command-query separation is particularly well suited to a design by contract (DbC) methodology, in which the design of a program is expressed as assertions embedded in the source code, describing the state of the program at certain critical times. In DbC, assertions are considered design annotations—not program logic—and as such, their execution should not affect the program state. CQS is beneficial to DbC because any value-returning method (any query) can be called by any assertion without fear of modifying program state.

In theoretical terms, this establishes a measure of sanity, whereby one can reason about a program&#x27;s state without simultaneously modifying that state. In practical terms, CQS allows all assertion checks to be bypassed in a working system to improve its performance without inadvertently modifying its behaviour. CQS may also prevent the occurrence of certain kinds of heisenbugs.

==Broader impact on software engineering==
Even beyond the connection with design by contract, CQS is considered by its adherents to have a simplifying effect on a program, making its states (via queries) and state changes (via commands) more comprehensible.

CQS is well-suited to the object-oriented methodology, but can also be applied outside of object-oriented programming. Since the separation of side effects and return values is not inherently object-oriented, CQS can be profitably applied to any programming paradigm that requires reasoning about side effects.

==Command Query Responsibility Segregation==
Command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) generalises CQS to services, at the architectures level: it applies the CQS principle by using separate &quot;Query&quot; and &quot;Command&quot; interfaces and usually data models to &quot;retrieve&quot; and &quot;modify&quot; data, respectively.

==Other architectural patterns==
* As we move away from a single representation that we interact with via CRUD, we can easily move to a task-based UI.
* CQRS fits well with event-based programming models. It&#x27;s common to see a CQRS system split into separate services communicating with Event Collaboration. This allows these services to easily take advantage of Event Driven Architecture.
* Having separate models raises questions about how hard it is to keep those models consistent, which raises the likelihood of using eventual consistency.
* For many domains, much of the logic required is needed when you&#x27;re updating, so it may make sense to use Eager Read Derivation to simplify your query-side models.
* If the write model generates events for all updates, you can structure read models as Event Posters, allowing them to be Memory Images and thus avoiding a lot of database interactions.
* CQRS is suited to complex domains, the kind that also benefits from Domain-Driven Design.

==Limitations==
CQS can introduce complexities for implementing reentrant and multithreaded software correctly. This usually occurs when a non-thread-safe pattern is used to implement the command-query separation.

Here is a simple example that does not follow CQS, but is useful for multi-threaded software because it solves the complexity of locking for all other parts of the program, but by doing so it doesn&#x27;t follow CQS because the function both mutates state and returns it:

private int x;
public int incrementAndReturnX() {
 lock x; // by some mechanism
 x = x + 1;
 int x_copy = x;
 unlock x; // by some mechanism
 return x_copy;


Here is a CQS-compliant version. Note that it is safely usable only in single-threaded applications. In a multithreaded program, there is a race condition in the caller, between where codice_1 and codice_2 would be called:

private int x;
public int value() {
 return x;
void increment() {
 x = x + 1;


Even in single-threaded programs, it is sometimes arguably significantly more convenient to have a method that is a combined query and command. Martin Fowler cites the codice_3 method of a stack as an example.

<doc id="291790" wikidata="Q697152" url="?curid=291790" title="Volkswagen Jetta">
<text>The Volkswagen Jetta () is a compact car/small family car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen since 1979. Positioned to fill a sedan niche slightly above the firm&#x27;s Golf hatchback, it has been marketed over seven generations, variously as the Atlantic, [[Volkswagen Vento|Vento]], [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]], City Jetta, Jetta City, GLI, Jetta, Clasico, and Sagitar (in China).

The Jetta has been offered in two- and four-door saloon / sedan and sometimes as five-door wagon / estate versions. Since the original version in 1980, the car has grown in size and power with each generation. By mid-2011, almost 10 million Jettas have been produced and sold all over the world. As of April 2014, Volkswagen marketed over 14 million, becoming its top selling model.

==Nameplate etymology==
Numerous sources note that the Jetta nameplate derives from the Atlantic &#x27;jet stream&#x27; during a period when Volkswagen named its vehicles after prominent winds and currents (e.g., the Volkswagen Passat (after the German word for trade wind), Volkswagen Bora (after bora), and Volkswagen Scirocco (after sirocco)).

A 2013 report by former VW advertising copywriter Bertel Schmitt, said that — after consulting VW sources including Dr. Carl Hahn, former Volkswagen of America Chief and W.P. Schmidt, former sales chief at Volkswagen — no evidence suggested Volkswagen employed a naming theme for its front-drive, water-cooled vehicles; nor was there evidence the names derived from a theme; nor that a naming system &quot;was ever announced, either officially or confidentially.&quot;

==First generation (A1, &quot;Type&quot; 16; 1979)==

Although the Golf reached considerable success in the North American markets, Volkswagen observed the hatchback body style lacked some of the appeal to those who preferred the traditional three-box configuration. The styling of the 1970 AMC Gremlin was controversial for truncating the Hornet sedan, but Volkswagen stylists reversed the process by essentially grafting a new trunk onto the tail of the Golf to produce a larger Jetta saloon. The Jetta became the best-selling European car in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The car was also popular in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Turkey.

The Jetta was introduced to the world at the 1979 Frankfurt Auto Show. Production of the first generation began in August 1979 at the Wolfsburg plant. 

In Mexico, the Mark 1 was known as the &quot;Volkswagen Atlantic&quot;.

The car was available as a two-door sedan (replacing the aging rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle 2-door sedan in the United States and Canada) and four-door sedan body styles, both of which shared a traditional three-box design. Like the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, its angular styling was penned at ItalDesign, by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Styling differences could be found depending on the market. In most of the world, the car was available with composite headlamps, while in the US, it was only available with rectangular sealed beam lamps due to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 (FMVSS 108). The suspension setup was identical to the Golf and consisted of a MacPherson strut setup in front and a twist-beam rear suspension. It shared its 2,400 mm (94.5 in) wheelbase with its hatchback counterpart, although overall length was up by 380 millimetres (15 in). The capacity of the luggage compartment was 377 litres (13.3 ft3), making the Jetta reasonably practical. To distinguish the car from the Golf, interiors were made more upscale in all markets. This included velour seating and color coordinated sill to sill carpeting.

Engine choices varied considerably depending on the local market. Most were based on 827 engines of the era. Choices in petrol engines ranged from a 1.1 litre four-cylinder engine producing , to a 1.8-litre I4 which made and of torque. Some cars were equipped with carburetors, while others were fuel-injected using K or KE Jetronic supplied by Robert Bosch GmbH. Diesel engine choices included a 1.6-litre making and a turbocharged version of the same engine which produced and of torque.

Volkswagen briefly considered producing the Jetta in a plant located in Sterling Heights, Michigan in the US. However, due to declining sales in North America, the decision was postponed and abandoned in 1982. The site was subsequently sold to Chrysler in 1983 and was in operation . This generation was also produced in SFR Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the joint venture Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo (TAS) for the Balkan area.
==Second generation (A2, &quot;Typ&quot; 20E/1G; 1984)==


The Mark 2 series is the longest-running Jetta so far. Introduced to Europe in early 1984 and to North America in 1985, the second generation Jetta proved to be a sales success for Volkswagen. The car secured the title of best-selling European car in North America, Farmer&#x27;s Journal COTY 1991, and outsold the similar Golf by two-to-one in that market. Based on the all-new second-generation Golf platform, the car was larger, heavier, and could seat five people instead of four as in the Mark 1. Exterior dimensions increased in all directions. Overall length was up by , the wheelbase grew , and the width went up . The suspension setup was basically unchanged from the first generation, although refined slightly, for example by the inclusion of a separate subframe for mounting the front control arms to help noise isolation, as well as improved rubber mountings for all components. Aerodynamics improved considerably, with a drag coefficient of 0.36. With a 470-litre (16.6 ft3) luggage compartment, the trunk had grown nearly as large as some full-sized American sedans. Interior room was also increased by 14 percent, which changed the EPA class from sub-compact to compact.

Cars built in Germany were assembled in a brand new (at the time) plant at Wolfsburg in Assembly Hall 54. The plant was heavily robotised in an effort to make build quality more consistent. New innovations on the second generation included an optional trip computer (referred to as the MFA, German Multi-Funktions-Anzeige), as well as silicone dampened engine and transmission mounts to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In 1988, a more advanced fully electronic fuel injection system became available. This arrangement is known as the Digifant engine management system.

Like the Mark 1, the second generation was offered as a two-door or four-door sedan. External changes throughout the series&#x27; run were few: the front-quarter windows were eliminated in 1988 (along with a grille and door trim change), and larger body-colored bumpers and lower side skirts were added from 1990.

In 2007, Volkswagen of America held a contest to find the diesel-powered Volkswagen with the highest distance traveled on the original engine. The winning car was a 1986 Jetta Turbodiesel found in Blue Rock, Ohio which had . A local dealer verified the odometer reading. Notable on this particular car was that it also had the original muffler despite being located in an area subject to road salt in the winter.

==Third generation (A3, &quot;Typ&quot; 1H; 1992)==


For the third generation, the Jetta name was discontinued, and it was officially renamed the Volkswagen Vento in European countries, following the precedent of naming cars after winds, debuted in 1992. The Jetta 3 debuted in North America in 1993 after production delays and quality problems at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, Mexico. The name &quot;&quot; means &quot;wind&quot; in both Portuguese and Italian. It went on sale in most of Europe in the first quarter of the year, though it did not arrive on the British market until September 1992.

Because of the success of the second generation in North America, Volkswagen decided to keep the Jetta nameplate. However, in Europe the car was given its new name to appeal to a younger market.

Styling was penned by a design team led by Herbert Schafer, and again the car became more aerodynamic than the previous generation. Although visually similar to the Mark 2, there were many refinements underneath. The two-door model was dropped, aerodynamics were improved, with the car now having a drag coefficient of 0.32. This included a new structure which now met worldwide crash standards. Suspensions were an evolutionary rather than revolutionary refinement of the setup on previous editions, and mainly consisted of a wider track, and even maintaining backwards compatibility with older models. In addition, the car became more environmentally friendly with the use of recycled plastics, CFC-free air conditioning systems, and paint that did not contain heavy metals.

This generation of the car is widely credited for keeping Volkswagen from pulling out of the North American market. At the time of its introduction in 1993, Volkswagen of America&#x27;s sales hit a low not seen since the 1950s. The division sold only 43,902 cars in that year. Sales began slowly due to the aforementioned issues at the Puebla plant. However, sales rebounded dramatically in the following years, mostly based on the strength of the Jetta, which continued to be the best-selling Volkswagen in the USA.

==Fourth generation (A4, &quot;Typ&quot; 1J; 1999)==

Production of the fourth generation car began in July 1999. Carrying on the wind nomenclature, the car was known as the Volkswagen Bora in much of the world. Bora is a winter wind which blows intermittently over the coast of the Adriatic Sea, as well as in parts of Greece, Russia, Turkey, and in the Sliven region of Bulgaria. In North America and South Africa, the Jetta moniker was again kept on due to the continued popularity of the car in those markets.

The Mk4 debuted shortly after its larger sibling, the Passat, with which it shared many styling cues. The rounded shape and arched roofline served as the new Volkswagen styling trademark, abandoning traditional sharp creases for more curved corners. A distinguishing feature of the Mk4 is its Whiptenna, a trademark for the antenna on the rear end of the roof, which claims to incur less drag than traditional antennas due to its short length and leeward position. For the first time, the rear passenger doors differed from those of a 5-door Golf. The car was also offered as an estate/wagon (whose rear doors are also non-interchangeable with the others). New on this generation was some advanced options such as rain sensor-controlled windshield wipers and automatic climate control. However, these were expensive extras and many buyers did not specify them on their cars; as a result, the used market has many sparsely equipped models.

Although slightly shorter overall than the Mark 3, the fourth generation saw the wheelbase extended slightly. Some powertrain options were carried over. Nevertheless, two new internal combustion engines were offered, the 1.8-litre turbo 4-cylinder (often referred to as the 1.8 20vT), and the VR6. The suspension setup remained much as before. However, it was softened considerably in most models to give a comfortable ride, which was met with some criticism as it was still quite hard in comparison with rivals such as vehicles offered from French carmakers.

==Fifth generation (A5, &quot;Typ&quot; 1K5; 2005)==


The fifth-generation debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 5 January 2005. After the New Beetle, it was the second Volkswagen product to make its world debut at a U.S. auto show. The Mark 5 sedan went on sale in the USA prior to any other country, reflecting the importance of the car in that market for Volkswagen.

The fifth generation is marketed as the Jetta in most markets; as Bora in Mexico and Colombia; Vento in Argentina and Chile; and as the Sagitar in China. The Mark 5 is longer, wider, and has a longer wheelbase than the previous iteration. Interior room has increased from 2.46 cubic metres (87 cu ft) to 2.58 cubic metres (91 cu ft). In particular, rear legroom was increased by over the fourth generation. Luggage compartment volume is up to 453 litres (16 cu ft). One major change is the introduction of the first multi-link independent rear suspension in a Jetta. The design of the rear suspension has a strong resemblance to the one found in the Ford Focus. Volkswagen reportedly hired engineers from Ford who designed the suspension on the Focus.

Styling included a new chrome front grille, first seen on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 R32, which has spread to other models. Some critics appreciated the new styling, whilst others dismissed it as just as bland as the 4th generation.

It is manufactured in the largest volumes in Mexico. VW spent US$800 million to upgrade its Puebla facilities for this model&#x27;s production. This included a US$290 million new engine production line for the 5-cylinder power plant, a US$50 million investment in the press shop, as well as a US$200 million purchase of 460 robots, which increased automation by 80%. Final A5 assembly also took place also in China and South Africa for those markets. Like initial production of the second generation in China, the Asian and African plants build the car from a complete knock down (CKD) kit shipped from the factory in Puebla. Local assembly in Kaluga, Russia, started in early 2008. Production also began in India in 2008 at the Škoda factory in Aurangabad.

==Sixth generation (A6, &quot;Typ&quot; 5C6; 2010)==

The sixth-generation Volkswagen Jetta, known as the NCS (New Compact Sedan) during its development, was announced in the North American market on 16 June 2010. The A6 Jetta marked the departure from being a sedan derivative of the Golf, opting for a dedicated bodywork. It is partly based on the PQ35 platform shared with the Golf Mk6. The new model was larger and less expensive to manufacture than the previous generation making the vehicle more competitive against mainstream rivals in the compact car segment as part of Volkswagen&#x27;s goal of reaching sales of 800,000 units in the North American market by 2018. The sixth generation Volkswagen Jetta was primarily designed by Volkswagen Mexico under the supervision of Volkswagen Germany.

Volkswagen&#x27;s target of increasing its North American sales removed the Jetta from the premium compact car market. This forced many cost-cutting measures to be made for the North American models, which included a lower quality trim material for the interior and the replacement of leather with leatherette as an optional seating upholstery. Leather was still available on Canadian-spec models. The North American version also lost the multi-link rear suspension of the previous generation. The turbo hybrid version was unveiled in January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show, and was discontinued in 2016.

This is the latest generation to be offered in Europe.

==Seventh generation (A7; 2018)==


The seventh-generation 2018 (2019 in United States) Volkswagen Jetta debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, on 14 January 2018, after Volkswagen released an exterior design sketch in December 2017. The Jetta is based on Volkswagen&#x27;s MQB platform, which underpins other Volkswagen vehicles including the Volkswagen Golf and the Volkswagen Atlas.

The Mk7 is larger than its predecessor, offers more interior room and has the latest generation of Volkswagen&#x27;s infotainment systems, including integration of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Its ten-color customizable ambient interior lighting includes lighting across the dashboard and instrument panel, front and rear doors, footwells, and the gauge &quot;rings&quot; of a newly available fully digital instrument cluster display, marketed as the &quot;Digital Cockpit&quot;.

As with its predecessors, production of the all-new 2019 Jetta will continue at Volkswagen&#x27;s Puebla, Mexico Assembly Plant. The all-new Jetta will reach Volkswagen dealerships in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. A GLI model with a multi-link rear suspension is expected to come as a 2020 model. However, this new seventh-generation Jetta will not be sold in the European market.
The MK7 was recently launched in Korea, where it has become one of the top selling imported models. 

The Chinese-spec long-wheelbase Volkswagen Sagitar was launched on January 19, 2019 both in Beijing and Shanghai; it is about 50 mm longer than the U.S.-spec model, and is equipped with independent suspension. This is an attempt to occupy the more upscale market than the Volkswagen Lavida built by SAIC-VW, which share similar looks. Production continues in the FAW-VW Chengdu plant.

In 2022, the facelifted Volkswagen Jetta was revealed in Chicago. Bearing an updated look and design, the new C-segment sedan also gains added kit and a new engine. The 1.5 litre turbo four-cylinder replaces the long-serving 1.4 TSI. As for the GLI, it retains the EA888 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo from the Golf GTI.

==Alternative-propulsion cars==
In 2001, at the 18th International Electric Vehicle Symposium and Exhibition in Berlin, Volkswagen released two environmentally friendly cars: the Bora HyMotion and the Bora Electric.

The Bora HyMotion was a hydrogen powered Mark 4 with a 75 kW fuel cell that could accelerate from 0 to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 12.5 seconds. With a 49-litre tank of cryogenically stored hydrogen, it had a range of 350 km (220 mi). Top speed was .

In 2002, Volkswagen, along with Paul Scherrer Institute released another hydrogen-powered car called the Bora Hy.Power. The car was powered by hydrogen compressed to a pressure of 320 bar (4600 psi). It had ratings very similar to the HyMotion; with a power source. A special feature of the car was a 60-kilowatt supercapacitor which could boost power when needed and also recover energy when coasting.

Volkswagen had considered producing a mild hybrid version of the fifth-generation mainly for the North American market but never produced it. In 2013 Volkswagen produced a turbocharged full hybrid sixth generation offering for the North American market.

===Biofuels===

Volkswagen released a Jetta MultiFuel in 1991, at first to the governments of the state of California and New York, and then for limited retail sale in those states to the public. They are an early example of an E85 vehicle, burning a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. These Jettas can still be found on U.S. roads.

Volkswagen also released a Bora TDI which was powered by SunFuel, a synthetic fuel developed in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell. The company also displayed Bora TDI powered by SunDiesel that Volkswagen also developed with DaimlerChrysler along with Choren Industries.

Use of the two most popular blends of biodiesel that are mostly biodiesel, B80 and B100, is not recommended in 2009 and 2010 US TDI engines.

In Brazil, until 2015, the Jetta was sold with the 2.0 L flex-fuel (marketed as &quot;Total Flex&quot;) engine in Trendline and Comfortline trims. It could run on either E100 or Petrol. From 2016 model year onwards, the 2.0 L flex-fuel was replaced by the 1.4 L TSI turbocharged engine from EA211 family, that runs exclusively on petrol.

===Electric vehicle===
In the early 1980s, Volkswagen released a limited production electric Jetta called the Jetta CityStromer. It featured a 24.8 hp (18.5 kW) powertrain (later 37.5 hp (28 kW)), with a range of 190 km (250 km in the later version).

The second concept vehicle was called the Bora Electric. It had a power rating that varied according to the operating conditions. The Bora Electric could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 10 seconds with a range of 160 km. It was powered by a Lithium-ion battery. It was noted that its chance of success was limited in the marketplace given the high cost of the electric drive system.

==Awards and recognition==
In November 2008 the VW Jetta TDI (clean diesel) won the 2009 Green Car of the Year awarded by &quot;Green Car Journal&quot;. As a result of the Volkswagen emissions scandal the award was rescinded.

==Motorsport==
From 2008 through 2010, Volkswagen and the Sports Car Club of America hosted the Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup, using factory prepared 2009 Jetta TDIs.

For the 2010 SCCA World Challenge season, Irish Mike&#x27;s Racing is campaigning GLIs in the touring car class. Todd Buras won rounds 1 and 2 at the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg and round 10 at Virginia International Raceway while Chip Herr won round 4 at Mosport.

==Recalls==
On 30 September 2011, Volkswagen of America announced a recall involving 2009–2012 Jetta and Jetta Sportwagen models with the 2.0L TDI engine; this recall pointed to a resonance condition with the number 2 fuel injector line and the fuel injector pulses, causing small cracks in the line which could leak.

===Volkswagen emissions violations recall===
In September 2015, it was discovered that some Volkswagen TDIs had exceeded the United States legal emissions limits. These emissions violations, which would later be referred to as Volkswagen&#x27;s &quot;emissionsgate&quot; or &quot;dieselgate&quot;, affected the 2.0 L TDI diesel engines (the engines from 2008 that would later be in the Volkswagen TDIs in North America).

==Use in China==
Many versions and derivations of Jetta has been built and produced in China by FAW-Volkswagen (FAW-VW) and SAIC-VW, and the Jetta name itself has been used by FAW-VW as a new automotive brand starting in 2019.

The Volkswagen Jetta nameplate was produced from 1991 to 2019 by FAW-VW. It initially started as a rebadged version of the Mk2 Jetta, using the A2 platform. Later versions followed a different development path from the global Jetta, retaining the A2 platform until 2013, when it switched to the A05+ platform. In 2019, the Jetta nameplate was discontinued and spun off as a new brand called Jetta. The Jetta VA3 is the spiritual successor, as it is a sedan using the same A05+ platform.

The Volkswagen Bora (China) is produced by FAW-VW since 2001. It initially started as a rebadged version of the Mk4 Jetta (at the time named Bora in most markets). Later versions followed a different development path from the global Jetta, retaining the A4 (PQ34) platform until 2018, when it switched to the MQB A1 platform, similar to the global Mk7 Jetta.

The Volkswagen Sagitar (China) is produced by FAW-VW since 2006. It largely follows the design of the global Jetta, using the A5 (PQ35) platform from Mk5 to Mk6. For the Mk7 version, the Sagitar is still similar to the global Jetta (using the MQB A1 platform) except with a longer wheelbase of 2731mm.

The Volkswagen Lavida (China) is produced by SAIC-VW since 2008. It was based on a heavily modified FAW-VW first generation Bora (which itself was a rebadged Mk4 Jetta). In 2018, it also switched to the MQB A1 platform, similar to the 2018 Bora and global Mk7 Jetta.

Currently, the Bora and Lavida are considered to be similarly positioned as C segment cars, and the Sagitar is positioned slightly above them due to the longer wheelbase, while the Jetta VA3 is considered to be one segment below.

=== Jetta A2 (1991–2013)===

The first known Jetta was the A2 model that was used as a passenger car and a taxicab.

The A2 was then given a facelift in April 1997 where it was known as the Jetta King. Available engines were a 1.6 litre petrol engine called the EA113 for civilian cars and a 1.9 litre diesel engine only available for taxi models. A 4-speed manual gearbox was standard, which could be replaced by a 5-speed manual gearbox, and then a 4-speed automatic gearbox was made available from November 1998. For 2002, the Jetta King was facelifted with a new exterior. Trim levels consisted of the AT, ATF, Avantgarde, CDX, CiF, CiX, CT, GDF, GiF, GT, GTI, GTX and Meeresbrise. This model was also converted into a 2-door pickup truck in limited numbers.

The A2 was facelifted again in March 2010 with the same engines used by its predecessor; it was known as the Jetta Pioneer. This version of the Jetta was not offered in different trim levels and was a single model for the Chinese market. A2-based Jetta production ended in March 2013 where it was replaced by an independent model using the Volkswagen Group A05+ platform.

According to website Carsalesbase.com, FAW Volkswagen&#x27;s Jetta A2 model sold over 2.4 million cars.

=== Bora A4 (2001–present)===

The second known Jetta was the A4 model sold under the Bora name which commenced production in December 2001. It was given a facelift in 2006 and was available with the 1.6 and 1.8 litre EA113 petrol engine and a 1.9 litre diesel engine. A 5-speed manual was available alongside a 4-speed automatic transmission. A hatchback version was known as the Bora HS and was a badged Volkswagen Golf Mk4. Production for the first generation Bora ended in 2006 while the Bora HS ended production in 2008.

The Bora was facelifted in 2007 with two new engines, a 1.4 litre turbo and a 1.6, under the EA111 name. A 5-speed and 6-speed manual was standard alongside a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Production ended in 2015.

The third generation Bora commenced production in 2015 for the 2016 model year with a new exterior and interior. 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 litre engines were standard paired to 5- and 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. This generation is still available as of May 2019 as the Bora Classic with three trim levels.

The fourth generation Bora was produced since April 2018 and used Volkswagen&#x27;s MQB platform. 1.4 and 1.5 litre engines were standard paired to a 6-speed manual and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.

According to website Carsalesbase.com, FAW Volkswagen&#x27;s Bora model sold over 2.6 million cars as of 2019.

=== Sagitar (2006–present) ===

The third known Jetta example was known as the Sagitar and has been produced since April 2006. The Sagitar name was used for the fifth, sixth and seventh generation Jetta as FAW-Volkswagen already used the Jetta name on one of its models.

For the Mk1 Sagitar, a 1.6 litre engine was standard alongside a 1.8 litre turbo and 2 litre engine. The 2.0 litre was removed in 2009 to make way for a 1.4-litre turbocharged engine. Available gearboxes were a 5-speed manual, 6-speed automatic, and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.

The Mk2 Sagitar entered the market in March 2012. The Sagitar was available with the 1.4 litre turbo and 1.6 litre engine paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox for both engines, a 6-speed automatic gearbox for 1.6 models, and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic for 1.4 models. 1.8 TSI models were available for 2014 followed by the 2.0 litre TSI for 2016 and 1.2 TSI for 2017 and 2018. The 2.0 litre TSI engine and 6-speed &quot;DSG&quot; combination are standard on Sagitar GLi models while the 1.4 litre turbo with the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox is available on Sagitar R-Line models. The Mk2 Sagitar ended production in September 2019.

Its successor, the Mk3 Sagitar was launched in January 2019. A 1.4 and 1.5 litre EA211 engine was standard paired to a 5 speed manual and 6-speed automatic gearbox.

According to Carsalesbase.com, the Sagitar has had 2.8 million units sold in China as of 2019.

=== New Jetta/Jetta VA3 (2013–present) ===

The Volkswagen New Jetta was introduced in March 2013 replacing the Chinese built A2 model and is a China-built exclusive. The New Jetta was paired with two new Volkswagen engines under the codename &quot;EA211&quot; with displacements of 1.4 litres and 1.6 litres respectively. The EA211 firstly made its debut in the fifth generation Volkswagen Santana in 2012. For horsepower ratings, the 1.4 litre unit produced 66 kilowatts (88 horsepower), while the latter produced 81 kilowatts (108 horsepower). Transmission options consist of a 5 speed manual or a 6 speed automatic. Trim levels were known as Avantgarde (时尚), Comfortline (舒适) and Luxury (豪华) and pricing in 2013 ranged between 82,800 yuan and 119,300 yuan ($12,820 to $18,470 US - February 2021 exchange rate).

The New Jetta was given a facelift in 2017 with a new front and rear design and a brand new 1.5 litre engine producing 82 kilowatts (110 horsepower). A 7 speed dual clutch gearbox comes standard for the 230TSI model. To differentiate this version with 2013 type, the selling name was branded as &quot;New Jetta 2017&quot; (in Chinese: “新捷达2017款”). Production for the New Jetta ended in March 2020. According to Carsalesbase.com, the new Jetta model achieved 1.9 million units sold.

A new car marque was launched in China in February 2019 known as Jetta and one of the models, the Jetta VA3 is a facelifted and rebadged New Jetta. According to pictures found on Chinese car website Autohome, the Jetta VA3 was to be powered by two engines, a 1.4 litre turbo and the 1.5 litre naturally aspirated EA211 four cylinder engine. The VA3 was officially listed in September 2019 and the 1.5 litre EA211 is available paired to a 5 speed manual and 6 speed automatic gearbox. Pricing ranges between 65,800 and 92,800 yuan with 4 trim levels (10,185 and US$13,365 - February 2021 exchange rate).

A dry suit normally protects the whole body except the head, hands, and possibly the feet. In hazmat configurations, however, all of these are covered as well.

The main difference between dry suits and wetsuits is that dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering. This generally allows better insulation, making them more suitable for use in cold water. Dry suits can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. For divers, they add some degree of operational complexity and hazard as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth in order to minimize &quot;squeeze&quot; on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to excessive buoyancy, which requires additional skills for safe use. Dry suits provide passive thermal protection: Undergarments are worn for thermal insulation against heat transfer to the environment and are chosen to suit expected conditions. When this is insufficient, active warming or cooling may be provided by chemical or electrically powered heating accessories.

The essential components are the waterproof shell, the seals, and the watertight entry closure. A number of accessories are commonly fitted, particularly to dry suits used for diving, for safety, comfort and convenience of use. Gas inflation and exhaust equipment are generally used for diving applications, primarily for maintaining the thermal insulation of the undergarments, but also for buoyancy control and to prevent squeeze.

==Function==
The dry suit is a form of exposure suit, a garment worn to protect the user from adverse environmental conditions. The two most common purposes are to insulate the wearer against excessive heat loss, and to isolate the wearer from direct contact with a liquid environment during immersion or repeated multi-directional contact with bulk liquids or spray. Most often the liquid is water, usually without significant contaminants, but dry suits also have applications in isolation from hazardous materials and biological contaminants.

Most of the insulation function is provided by passive thermal protection in the form of garments worn under the dry suit, The suit itself has the primary function of keeping the insulating garments dry, and allowing them to be maintained at sufficient loft to provide adequate insulation by adding dry gas to the interior of the suit and releasing excess gas. Active heating systems may also be used but are less popular.

Isolation of the wearer from contact with the environment for purposes other than thermal insulation usually requires the entire surface of the skin to be kept dry and uncontaminated by the ambient environment. This requires that the seal between the breathing apparatus and the suit is also reliably watertight, which is most effectively provided by sealing the suit to a helmet with redundant series exhaust valves, or a return of exhaled gas to the surface by hose, similar to a gas reclaim system, though there are applications where a lesser level of isolation is acceptable.

Dry suits should not leak, but once the suit is sealed, interior humidity rises to 100% and condensation will occur on cold surfaces such as the inside of the suit. A certain amount of dampness is inevitable and common on the inside of the suit after a dive, and is acceptable provided the diver remains warm. Flexing the wrists and large movements of the head may allow water to enter along raised or sunken tendons. This is normal, and to some extent can be avoided or reduced with practice. It can be prevented by attaching the gloves directly to the suit and by sealing the suit to the helmet.

===Heat loss===

There are two physiological aspects of heat loss of particular relevance to the diver: Cold shock response and hypothermia.

Cold shock response is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, and is a common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. This effect is prevented or mitigated by almost any dry suit, as the cold water is kept from direct contact with most of the body and the immediate heat loss is reduced considerably. A person who survives the initial minute of trauma after falling into icy water can survive for at least thirty minutes before succumbing to hypothermia provided they don&#x27;t drown. However, the ability to perform useful work like staying afloat declines substantially after ten minutes as the body protectively cuts off blood flow to &quot;non-essential&quot; muscles.

Hypothermia is reduced body temperature that happens when a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs and produces, and is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently increases the risk of other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in inadequately protected divers, although it is not often the direct clinical cause of death. The effectiveness of a dry suit in preventing or delaying hypothermia depends on its insulating value.

There are two major routes for heat loss. Respiratory and through the skin. The mechanisms of respiratory heat loss are heating the inspired gas and humidifying the inspired gas by latent heat of evaporation. While they are major factors in diver compfort and safety, these are not influenced by the use of a dry suit. The loss of heat through the skin by radiation, conduction, and convection is the aspect which can be controlled by an exposure suit, and the one for which dry suits are effective and appropriate.

Skin will heat up gas and clothing inside a dry suit by radiation and conduction. Convection will transport heated gas within the suit, and may take it to places where it may be transferred through the suit shell more rapidly. Heat transfer by radiation occurs through a medium that is transparent to infrared radiation of the relevant wavelengths. This is mostly the gas, and the radiation paths are short, multiple, and with small temperature differences, so the effects are relatively small. Heat conduction is kinetic energy transfer by molecular or atomic collision. It has the more important role in heat transfer through a diving suit. Conduction occurs between the diver&#x27;s skin and the gas and suit materials in contact with it, and through these materials to the shell, through the shell to the surrounding water, where it is rapidly removed by convection. Conduction heat loss is strongly influenced by thermal conductivity of the gas in the suit.

Convective heat transfer is the consequence of movement of heat carried by a gas or liquid from one place to another, where conduction can occur. It can considerably speed up heat transfer, so thermal protection of the undersuit is improved when it limits convection of the gas within the suit. Convective heat transfer in the suit is strongly influenced by the freedom of the gas in the suit to move around, which is increased when there are large gas spaces, and reduced when the gas is constrained by the loft of the fabric. There is also heat transfer within the suit by evaporation of moisture in contact with the skin, and condensation on the inner surface of the shell. This is reduced by wicking it away from the skin before it evaporates, and preventing condensate on the inside of the shell from wetting the inner layer of the undersuit.

==Essential components==

The essential components include a shell of watertight material, sufficiently flexible to allow the wearer to function adequately, seals where parts of the body pass through the suit while in use, and a method of sealing the access opening while the suit is worn. An inflation valve with gas supply and dump valve are generally provided on dry suits used for diving, but were not standard on early models, and are not needed when the suit is sealed to the helmet and the helmet space is open to the interior of the suit, or for suits only used for surface activities.

===Shell===
The main part of the dry suit is a waterproof shell made from a membrane type material, closed cell foamed neoprene or a hybrid of both. Insulation may be provided in part by the suit shell, but is usually mainly provided by thermal insulation clothing worn under the suit, which relies to a large extent on trapped air for its insulating properties.

====Membrane====
Membrane dry suits are made from thin materials which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as , or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With the exception of the rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly oversized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer&#x27;s range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.
To stay warm in a membrane suit, the user must wear a thermally insulating undersuit, typically made from synthetic fiber, which is considered preferable to natural materials, since synthetic materials have better insulating properties when damp or wet from sweat, seepage, or a leak. A low capacity for water absorption, retention of loft under mild compression, and quick drying after use are also desirable characteristics.
Reasonable care must be taken not to puncture or tear membrane dry suits, because buoyancy and insulation depend entirely on the air layer held in the undersuit, (whereas a wetsuit normally allows water to enter, and retains its insulation despite it). The dry suit material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the dry suit leaks or is torn, water can soak the undersuit, with a corresponding loss of buoyancy and insulation.
Membrane dry suits for surface use may also be made of a waterproof but breathable material like Gore-Tex to enable comfortable wear without excessive humidity and buildup of condensation. This function does not work underwater. Sailors and boaters who intend to stay out of the water may prefer this type of suit, but the fabric is less tolerant of rough usage, and may develop leaks more easily.

Membrane suits rely entirely on thermal undergarments for thermal insulation. The thermal undergarments rely on large volumes of trapped air for insulation, and any excess air trapped within the suit is not well constrained from migrating to the high points of the suit when diving. The loose fit necessary to allow reasonable freedom of movement and to make it possible to get in and out of the suit creates baggy air pockets where trapped air accumulates if it is not vented immediately, and some of these air pockets form in the parts of the suit where they are least easily vented by a diver trimmed for efficient horizontal swimming. This combination makes it necessary for the diver to be more vigilant and increases task loading in buoyancy control, and thereby increases risk of overinflation incidents and uncontrolled ascents. These risks are reduced by use of a suit which has the minimum excess volume, which in most cases requires precise custom fitting. The large and baggy standard diving suits had the option of lacing up the back of the legs to reduce suit volume in the place where it was most hazardous, but this feature is not available on more recent suits, and the nearest functional substitute is gaiters over the lower legs. Bagginess in the torso and arms is less problematic as excess gas in these areas is much easier to vent, and will usually do so automatically if the dump valve is set correctly.

====Neoprene====
Neoprene is a type of synthetic rubber which can be foamed during manufacture to a high proportion of tiny enclosed gas bubbles, forming a buoyant and thermally-insulating material, called &quot;foamed neoprene&quot;, &quot;foam-neoprene&quot; or &quot;expanded neoprene&quot;. Wetsuits are made from this material as it is a good insulator, waterproof, and is flexible enough for comfortable wear. The neoprene alone is very flexible and elastic, but not very resistant to tearing, so it is usually skinned with a layer of knitted fabric bonded to each side for strength and abrasion resistance. Foamed neoprene may be used for the shell of a drysuit, providing insulation in proportion to the thickness due to the gas within the material, as in a standard wetsuit. If torn or punctured, leading to flooding, a foam-neoprene suit retains the insulation and buoyancy of the gas bubbles in the foam, like a wet suit. Although foamed-neoprene dry suits provide some insulation, thermal under-suits are usually worn in cold water.
Neoprene dry suits are generally not as easy to put on and remove as are membrane dry suits, largely due to a closer fit which is possible due to the inherent elasticity of the material, and partly due to greater weight. As with wetsuits, their buoyancy and thermal protection decreases with depth as the air bubbles in the neoprene are compressed. The air or other gas in the dry fabric undergarments providing insulation under a dry suit is also compressed, but can be restored to an effective volume by inflating the drysuit at depth through an inflator valve, thus preventing &quot;suit squeeze&quot; and compacting of the air-filled undersuit. Foam-neoprene tends to shrink over the years as it loses gas from the foam and slowly becomes less flexible as it ages.
An alternative is crushed or compressed foam neoprene, which is less susceptible to volume changes when under pressure. Crushed neoprene is foam neoprene which has been hydrostatically compressed so much that the gas bubbles have been mostly eliminated, this retains the elasticity of foamed neoprene which allows freedom of movement, but does not provide much insulation, and is functionally more like a membrane suit.

====Hybrid====
Some suits marketed as hybrid suits combine the features of both types, with a membrane top attached to a neoprene bottom near the waist. The neoprene part may also be configured as a &quot;farmer-john&quot; salopette that covers the torso as well as the legs, with membrane sleeves. This style is often used for surface water sports, especially in very cold water. The tighter fitting lower part lets the wearer kick while swimming, and the looser fitting top allows easy arm movement. A close-fitting neoprene torso covering provides additional self-rescue or survival time if the suit leaks. Other manufacturers such as &quot;Waterproof&quot;, use the term to refer to a membrane suit with a fitted liner of a relatively compression resistant porous 3-dimensional mesh, which creates a thin but resilient air space between the suit shell and the diver.

===Seals===
Seals, also known as gaskets, at the wrists and neck prevent water entering the suit by a close contact fit against the skin around the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The seals are typically made from latex rubber, foam neoprene, or silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be washed after use and replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter because they do not seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.

A more recent innovation is the silicone seal, which is claimed to be as supple as latex, more flexible, yet far more durable. These are available as original equipment on some makes of dry suit. Silicone seals are hypoallergenic, but can not be glued to the suit, and must be attached using clip-on rings. The silicone seals are similar in mechanical strength to latex seals but do not deteriorate as rapidly from oxidation and chemical attack. They are initially relatively expensive, but can be replaced without tools by the user which reduces cost of replacement.

===Waterproof entry===

Modern dry suits have a watertight zipper for entry and exit. The original bronze-toothed version was developed by NASA to hold air inside space suits. This complex and special zipper is one of the most expensive parts of the suit. Heavy-duty, medium, and lightweight versions are made. A later design uses injection moulded plastic teeth, and these are lighter, more flexible and less costly. The zipper is commonly installed across the back of the shoulders, since this placement compromises overall flexibility the least, and usually puts the least stress on the zipper — but this design normally means the wearer requires assistance to close and open the zipper. The other common zipper placement is diagonally across the front of the torso, which allows self-donning. Other designs place the zipper straight down the middle of the back (early &quot;Poseidon Unisuit&quot;), up one side of the front, around the back of the neck and partway back down the front (later model &quot;Poseidon Unisuit&quot;) or on a wide tubular chest tunnel entry opening which is folded down and clipped round the waist after sealing the zip (some &quot;Typhoon&quot; suits). The waterproof-zipper is stiff, and cannot stretch at all, which can make it difficult for a user to get into and out of the suit. Dry suits may also be fitted with an extra waterproof &quot;fly&quot;, &quot;relief&quot; or &quot;convenience&quot; zipper to let the user urinate when out of the water when the suit is worn for long periods.

Before truly watertight zippers were invented, other methods of keeping the suit waterproof at the entry point were used, with the most common being a long rubber tunnel entry on the chest or the back, which would be folded shut, then rolled together from the sides and finally folded and clamped with a metal clip or tied with surgical rubber tubing. Sometimes the entry tunnel protruded through a non-watertight zipper, which would be closed over it to hold the roll in place in the pocket so formed.

The alternatives to tunnel entry were neck entry and the two-piece suit. Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the neck opening and the hood over a grooved neck ring, and clamping with a large elastic O-ring. The two piece, or waist entry suits, were sealed by rolling or folding the overlapped rubber skirts of the jacket and trousers together and these were held in place by a separate rubber cummerbund or a ring and rail clamping system much like the neck seal system, but using a grooved rubber belt and elastic loop.

==Accessories==

===Thermal undersuits===

Most dry suits do not provide sufficient thermal insulation without suitable undergarments. The type of undergarment selected will depend on the environmental conditions, type of dry suit and the planned activity. The purpose of the undergarment is to maintain the wearer in comfortable thermal balance, where the heat lost is balanced by the heat generated by the user. More insulation is needed for colder conditions and for less energetic activity.

A balance of thermal comfort with freedom of movement, minimal variation in buoyancy with depth, and minimal effects on diver trim is one of the goals of undersuit selection for diving. For surface applications, thermal comfort with freedom of movement and minimum skin dampness from condensation is the target. Moisture management using wicking textiles is often used.

The principle of layered clothing can be used to provide a wider range of insulation possibilities from a relatively small range of underwear items, however this can only be done before entering the water. Most dry suit underwear insulates mainly by a trapped layer of gas in the garment, and this is largely lost if the gas is replaced by water in a flooded suit, so as an approximation, insulation is proportional to the combined thickness of the undergarments. The layering principle shows that the option of two layers of undergarment in two thicknesses allows three levels of insulation to be selected. Thin only, thick only, and both layers.

Some materials have better insulating properties than others when wet, and will keep the diver warmer if the suit leaks or floods. The best dry suit undergarment is the thinnest material that will provide the required insulation, by trapping air in the smallest spaces. These will require less air in the suit and thus less excess buoyancy for which weighting will be required.

The moisture given off by the human skin, even when not exercising and sweating, will condense against the inside of the dry suit, and the way this condensate is handled by the underwear material will influence the comfort of the diver. If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not soak up the condensate will be more comfortable. A thin polypropylene layer against the skin will keep moisture away from the skin, and may keep the main undersuit clean. Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.

The fit of the underwear should allow the same range of movement as the suit itself, and together should allow the wearer to bend, squat, kneel, climb a ladder, fin and reach all critical parts of equipment worn on the body. Underwear which is flexible and stretches, particularly at the joints, will allow the diver more freedom of movement, and is less likely to chafe, and for diving use, materials which resist compaction under light pressure will maintain a more even thickness in use, which will provide better insulation for the same overall volume.

For cold-water use, especially diving under ice, the user will usually wear a thick undersuit. The thickness of undersuits varies and can be chosen by the wearer according to the water temperature. Thinsulate is one of the preferred fabrics for diving undersuits.

The hydrophobic qualities of Thinsulate help prevent water absorption which helps to maintain the insulating airspace even in the presence of free water. More recently, aerogel material is being added to conventional undergarments to increase the insulating properties of those garments. Polar fleece is a good insulator with good stretch, is lightweight, and dries quickly if it gets wet. It is also hypoallergenic and comfortable against the skin. Polyester liners can add to the insulation and will wick perspiration away from the skin. Cotton absorbs moisture and saturates easily, and will then rapidly conduct heat away from the body, so it is not used. Most dry-suit underwear is full length, either as a one piece or jacket and trousers, but a vest may be added for extra insulation on the torso, and a &quot;Farmer John&quot; salopette style trousers with jacket is flexible and puts extra insulation where it is most useful. 

The dry suit manufacturer &quot;Waterproof&quot; has introduced an unusual style of suit liner for diving drysuits which is made of a compression resistant but light and flexible coarse nylon mesh, and attached to the inside of the trilaminate drysuit shell when in use, which maintains an air gap between the undersuit and the inner surface of the shell, and which keeps condensate that forms on the inside of the shell from contact with the undersuit, so the undersuit is more likely to remain dry.

Neoprene dry suits are made from a foam-rubber sheet containing tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and can eliminate the need for an under-suit, or reduce the thickness needed for the under-suit fabric, but the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed and the insulation of the suit decreases with depth in the same way as for a wetsuit. Crushed neoprene provides the flexibility of neoprene with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits, but is heavy like other neoprene suits and provides less insulation in shallow water than regular foamed neoprene. A neoprene wet suit can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for insulation and extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth, as will any flexible closed cell material.

===Suspenders===
Some dry suits are provided with internally attached suspenders (British English: braces), which when hooked over the shoulders, will hold the trouser section up while the top part of the suit has not been fully dressed into by the diver, this is also convenient if the suit is partly removed between dives for comfort. The suspenders also help to keep the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when finning, and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.

===Hoods===
The dry suit may also have an integral hood, which seals water out around the wearer&#x27;s face, and helps keep the wearer&#x27;s head warm. The integral hood is often latex rubber that fits tightly around the head, but can also be made mainly from neoprene or membrane to allow an insulating cap to be worn under the hood. Care must be taken to avoid the hood making an airtight seal around either of the ears, as this could cause an eardrum bursting outwards at depth.
Separate hoods are generally neoprene wetsuit hoods with a flare at the bottom opening, worn over the neck seal. Some suits are made with an external &quot;warm neck collar&quot; around the base of the neck seal, which allows the flare of the hood to tuck in over the outside of the seal and under the collar. This can keep the neck significantly warmer, since the seal itself provides little insulation.

===Helmets===
To provide more protection to the head against impact, to secure the airway, to fully isolate the diver from the water, and to permit easy communication with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or fibre-reinforced plastic diving helmet may be worn with the dry suit. This can be separate from the dry suit with its own watertight neck seal, or it can be clamped onto a neck ring attached to the suit, so that air can flow between the helmet and the suit.

===Boots or socks===
Most commercial diving dry suits have heavy duty integral boots. Sport diving suits may have lightweight integral boots or soft neoprene booties. or heavy working boots may also be worn over integral socks of latex or neoprene or the same material as the rest of the suit. Boots which are stiff at the ankle make finning inefficient and are unsuitable for many diving applications where mobility is important. If the suit will be used by a diver who needs to fin efficiently on some dives and to walk on sharp surfaces on other dives, it is more effective to wear boots suited to the dive over a dry suit with integral socks.

Latex rubber ankle seals are sometimes fitted in place of socks and can allow better foot control of water skis and surfboards. Survival suits may have neoprene socks of the same material as the suit, with tougher soles and ankle ties to keep them on the feet, as the &quot;one-size fits all&quot; socks must be too big for most users if they are to accommodate the few with larger feet.

===Gloves, mitts, and three-finger mitts===
Dry suits may have wrist seals, permanently attached gloves or mitts, or removable dry gloves connected by attachment rings.

Neoprene wetsuit gloves are pulled over the top of wrist seals. They are wet gloves and vary considerably in effectiveness depending on construction and fit. As they are not watertight they do not fail catastrophically when damaged, and are reasonably tough.

Permanently attached gloves or mitts are unusual, It is more common for them to be connected by attachment rings. Either way, the absence of a wrist seal makes getting in and out of the suit much easier since there is no need for the suit to tightly seal around the wrists. It may be necessary to use a wrist strap to prevent loose gloves pulling off the hands when filled with air. Dry gloves can also be fitted over a wrist seal, which prevents leakage into the sleeves if the gloves are penetrated. Rubber or rubber coated stretch fabric dry gloves are the most effective at insulation while they remain dry inside, Insulation is provided by liner gloves worn underneath, which may be chosen to suit insulation and dexterity requirements.

Full-hand diving mitts can be sometimes useful in extreme environments such as ice diving, but significantly reduce dexterity and grip. Dry gloves and mitts usually allow a dry insulating glove to be worn underneath.

Three-finger mitts are a compromise between gloves and full mittens. In the three-finger mitts, the fingers are arranged with the index finger in a separate pocket to the other three fingers. This provides slightly better hand-grasping dexterity while still permitting heavy insulation around the hands.

===Attachment rings===

Attachment rings allow separate neck seals, gloves, and (less commonly) boots to be clipped to the suit with a watertight seal.
On both commercial and recreational suits, &quot;quick-change&quot; rings have become common. These are glued to the suit, either during manufacture or as a retrofit. These systems form a watertight seal between the suit and components. Quick-change rings allow a diver to easily replace a damaged seal on the surface with no tools or adhesives, or to change attachments depending on conditions – for example, choosing between dry gloves and standard wrist seals. Different manufacturers&#x27; ring systems may be incompatible.

Some styles of cuff ring allow dry gloves to be clipped on over a wrist seal. A seal breaker strand is worn under the cuff seal to allow the interior of the glove to equalise with the sleeve of the dry suit. If the glove is damaged underwater, the strand can be removed to prevent further water leakage into the suit.

===Suit inflation ===

Dry suits for diving are usually equipped with an inflation valve (or inlet valve) and at least one exhaust valve (or dump valve, or outlet valve). Survival suits and other dry suits designed for wear on the surface have no inflation or dump valves as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not relevant.The inflation valve allows the diver to compensate for gas compression in the suit on descent. Suit gas compression squeezes the suit uncomfortably onto the diver&#x27;s body, especially where the suit folds, it hinders the diver&#x27;s freedom of movement, reduces thermal insulation through compression of insulating garments and interferes with buoyancy control. Environmentally sealed suits, which are sealed to the helmet, automatically equalise from the breathing gas, and will also inflate from the breathing gas if inverted.

====Suit inflation gas supply====

Compensating gas is supplied from a breathing gas cylinder, a small, dedicated suit inflation cylinder, or the umbilical of a surface-supplied diver. Normally, the gas used for dry suit inflation on scuba is air from the primary breathing cylinder. Helium-based gas mixes such as trimix or heliox are avoided for suit inflation because of helium&#x27;s high thermal conductivity. Nitrox blends from a decompression cylinder have essentially the same thermal conductivity as air but oxygen rich mixes introduce a fire hazard when out of the water. Using a small (1-2 litre), dedicated cylinder for suit inflation avoids these complications; usually this will contain air but argon may be used instead. Argon has a low thermal conductivity, which improves insulation by approximately 20% compared to air, without adding any further bulk or weight. However, the accidental breathing of pure argon results in rapid unconsciousness and probable death. Consequently, argon cylinders must be clearly marked to prevent the accidental attachment of a breathing regulator or have valves that cannot accept a breathing regulator. To gain the full benefit of argon the suit must be flushed with argon before the dive to remove the air.

====Inflation valve====

An inflation valve is fitted to diving dry suits to admit gas to compensate for compression during descent. This is not necessary when the suit is sealed directly to a diving helmet, as the demand valve will automatically feed gas into the suit if the internal pressure difference drops. The spring-loaded push-button inflation valve is usually mounted over the chest for easy access, and is manually operated by the diver during descent to maintain the loft of the undergarments for insulation and to prevent discomfort from suit squeeze. Descent rate may also be adjusted by controlling suit volume and thereby buoyancy. Gas is supplied to the valve through a low-pressure hose, which can be connected and disconnected under pressure and underwater. Like the dump valves, most dry suits use inflation valves made by Apeks or SI Tech.

====Inflation hose====


There are two types of low-pressure hose connections commonly used for suit inflation. These are the standard Seatec style quick release coupler, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most diving buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hose connectors use incompatible valve fittings, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose end fitting. Both types of BCD and dry suit low pressure inflator hoses are supplied with a standard fitting for connection to a scuba regulator first stage low-pressure port.

===Exhaust valves===
 
The exhaust valve (or dump valve, often an ) allows the diver to vent expanding gas from the suit during ascent to maintain buoyancy control in the same way that a buoyancy compensator must be vented during ascent to avoid an uncontrolled (or runaway) buoyant ascent, missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. Configurations may vary but adjustable over-pressure automatic vents (auto-dump valves) are generally on the sleeve at the left shoulder, clear of the harness or buoyancy compensator, and non-adjustable over-pressure vents at the left wrist, where they can be raised quickly to dump, and occasionally also at the ankles, to automatically dump in the event of an inversion.

Adjustable valves can be pre-set or set to suit the undergarments during or after the descent, and in most situations can be left at this setting throughout the dive, but may be closed after surfacing to retain more gas for buoyancy and insulation, An auto-dump valve is a two stage valve to reduce inward leakage of water. The inner valve is generally a mushroom type elastomer non-return valve, with a low opening pressure differential, which will close automatically when there is no suit gas flowing out. This serves to prevent water ingress when the valve is manually opened by pressing down on the outer cover to compress the adjustable spring and open the pressure relief valve. The outer valve is an adjustable pressure relief valve which can be manually opened by pressing it with the hand against the spring preload, or opens automatically when internal pressure overcomes the preload setting. Spring tension is adjusted by screwing the outer cover further down to increase opening pressure difference, and unscrewing to reduce pressure difference. The rotation of the cover has stops at both ends, and clicks every few degrees of turn, so the user can judge the setting. Non-adjustable valves are similar but do not have the adjustment facility and can be more compact. Most dry suit dump valves are manufactured by Apeks and SI Tech and may be relabeled by suit manufacturers, though Northern Divers and Mares manufacture their own valves.The SI Tech valve has a different size gasket to the Apeks glued to the suit, so they are not interchangeable. Maintenance is mostly rinsing in fresh water after a dive, and most minor leaks can be fixed by soaking the valve mechanism and flushing with fresh water.

Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have a watertight seal to the helmet, rely on the helmet exhaust valve to release air from the suit, and may not have a separate exhaust valve on the suit itself. This is common for free-flow helmets and was part of the standard diving dress system. 

Most, but not all, dry suits from the 1950s and the early 1960s came without dedicated vents; venting was achieved by raising an arm and lifting one of the wrist seals or placing a finger in the neck seal. Several manufacturers back then attached a rubber venting tube closed with a stopper to the chest area of valveless dry suits, enabling the latter to be completely deflated before entering the water or inflated in the water to make the suit buoyant if required. Some mid-twentieth-century divers installed duckbill valves, also known as spear valves or flutter valves, which were designed to release excess air from the interior of their otherwise valveless dry suits at the head, shoulders or ankles.

Surface-use dry suits do not normally have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the neck seal.

During ascent, the diver has several things to monitor and do, so an adjustable automatic exhaust valve which provides hands-free operation helps reduce this task loading.

===Zipper and seal protection===
Some suits are provided with a flap which can be closed over the outside of the zipper to protect it from being damaged by contact with the diver&#x27;s equipment or the environment. these flaps may be held in place by velcro or a non-watertight outer zipper. These flaps are almost always fitted to zippers fitted diagonally across the front of the suit, and less often to rear entry cross shoulder zippers.

Cuff and collar extensions to the shell may be fitted to protect the seals from abrasion and tears. This is particularly useful on suits used for activities like rescue, where the environment may be rough on the suit.

===The P-valve===
For commercial divers or technical divers who may spend many hours in a dry suit underwater, it is not practical to have to climb back on board the ship in order to open a waterproof relief zipper and urinate. The P-valve is a urinal built into the suit, which enables a diver to urinate at any time without having to get out of the water, while keeping him or her dry and clean inside the suit. Risks involved with the use of the P-valve can include urinary tract infection, pneumaturia and genital squeeze. Divers expecting the need to urinate in dry suits can also use an adult diaper / nappy, which soaks up and retains the urine. Watertight relief zippers may be fitted which allow urination when out of the water without removing the suit. but these are a potential source of leaks and an additional expense.

===Cargo pockets===

Pockets are a convenient storage for small items of equipment and tools that may be needed on a dive, or on surface dry suits, during work. They are often used by scuba divers who use back inflation buoyancy control devices without integral pockets, and are often simply glued to the suit in the position chosen by the diver. Various styles and capacities are used. The usual positions are on the thighs. Forward position is more ambidextrously accessible, but can make boarding a small boat over the gunwale difficult or impossible, the sides of the thighs is more streamlined and better for boat entry, but makes it difficult to reach into the pocket with the opposite hand. Chest pockets are also sometimes used. Pockets may alternatively be mounted on shorts, a tunic, or protective overalls worn over the dry suit, or be integral parts of the buoyancy compensator. They usually cause additional drag underwater, and should drain rapidly while climbing out of the water.

===&quot;Bio-seals&quot;===
To reduce the contact with latex seals in divers with a latex allergy, a soft elastomer band called a &quot;Bio-seal&quot; can be worn under the latex contact area. These may also reduce friction with the seal and improve watertightness.

===Active heating===
For applications where passive heating is insufficient, active heating can be used. One of the earliest systems was the tube suit, a set of underwear with a complicated labyrinth of tubes which carried heated water supplied from the surface or the lockout submersible through an additional hose in the diver&#x27;s umbilical. Other active heating systems use electrical heating elements in an undersuit layer, or internal pockets containing hot-packs, sealed plastic bags containing materials which emit latent heat during a phase change.

==Associated equipment==
Some equipment may require modification to suit use with a dry suit. This is particularly relevant for weighting systems and buoyancy control devices.

===Weighting systems===
Weight harnesses with shoulder straps have advantages over standard scuba weight belts, as they are more secure and more suited to supporting the larger mass often required to ballast a dry suit system, are less likely to cause lower back or hip pain and are less likely to slide of over the hips of divers with larger waists. Integrated weight systems in buoyancy compensators are not always able to contain the required weights.

====Gaiters, ankle straps and ankle weights====

The internal volume necessary in trouser legs to allow passage of the feet to the boots can hold a large volume of air when inverted, which may pull the boots off the feet. Both the accumulation of gas in this part of the suit and the inability to fin put the diver at severe risk of uncontrollable buoyant ascent. Elastic or tailored &quot;gaiters&quot; can be pulled snug around the lower legs to reduce the potential airspace to help prevent an inversion event and help maintain horizontal trim. Gaiters may also reduce hydrodynamic drag when finning, reduce the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots when inverted, and can be used effectively on membrane and neoprene suits. Ankle straps perform a similar function, but are less effective at restricting the volume around the lower leg. Small ankle-weights, typically 0.5 to 1 kg (one or two pounds) can also be used with any dry suit, both to provide trim weight at the bottom of the suit, and function as ankle straps. Ankle-weights have to be accelerated along with the fins during every kick, which requires more work from the diver. Gaiters do not have this drawback as they are typically very light and approximately neutral buoyancy, and usually reduce the drag of the lower leg. The heavy standard diving dress dry suit tended to be a very loose fit and had optional lacing at the back of the legs for this purpose.

===Buoyancy compensators===
The use of buoyancy compensators (BCs) for diving with dry suits is required by some organisations as they provide secure flotation in the event of catastrophic flooding of the suit. Large volumes of gas in the suit can also put pressure on the neck, or vent through the neck seal, which could cause a sudden loss of buoyancy, water ingress, or both. The BC is used to compensate for mass change due to consumption of breathing gas, while the dry suit is kept at a near constant volume to optimise thermal insulation. The BC must not obstruct free access to the inflation valve, which is usually on the chest, or the shoulder dump valve.

===Overalls===
Boilersuit style protective wear may be worn over the dry suit to protect it from environmental damage. This is most commonly done by commercial and military divers working in a harsh environment where the suit is exposed to sharp points or edges, or abrasive surfaces, or is likely to be contaminated on the surface by materials which can be warded off by the cheaper and relatively disposable protective clothing overlay.

==Applications==
Use of dry suits can conveniently be divided into underwater and surface applications, as the construction of the suit may be optimized for either.

===Underwater===
Dry suits are typically used where the water temperature is below 15 °C (60 °F), and for extended immersion in water above 15 °C (60 °F), where discomfort and a greater risk of hypothermia would be experienced by a wet suit user. They are also used with integral boots, and gloves and sealed to the helmet for personal protection when working in and around hazardous liquids regardless of temperature.

====Recreational diving====
Dry suits for recreational diving are made in both membrane and neoprene materials, and primarily differ from surface dry suits in that they have inflation and deflation air valves to maintain neutral buoyancy, and may be more durable in construction and a closer fit.

====Professional diving====
Dry suits for commercial and military diving tend to be heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they are more likely to endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater welding. A boiler suit may be worn over the dry suit for protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for contaminated environment diving, and when combined with a suitably rated diving helmet can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks. These &quot;hazmat diving suits&quot; are most often made of vulcanized rubber with a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate than other dry suit materials because of its slick surface.

===Surface===
Surface use may include partial immersion or even shallow complete immersion for short periods. These applications do not require fine control of buoyancy under varying pressure, and a simpler suit without inflation and dump valves is usually adequate. Aspects considered in selection may include initial cost, suitability for purpose, ease of use, and maintenance cost and effort.

====Aquaculture====
Full-body chest-entry dry suits for wading purposes are worn by aquaculture workers and fishermen in China. They are fitted with a pair of boots or socks for the feet, wrist seals or a pair of gloves for the hands and a neck seal or integral hood for the head. Suits with boots enable the wearer to stand or walk in deeper water, while suits with socks enable the user to don swimming fins for float-tube fishing. Entry is via the suit chest aperture, which comes with excess material on the outside to be tied off afterwards for a leak-tight seal. Some versions use a watertight zip fastener instead to close the front entry.

====Boating====
Dry suits are often worn for boating, especially sailing, and on personal watercraft in the winter months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat vapour permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Users will wear a thermal undersuit, or sportswear for warmth, but most fabrics will lose much of their insulating properties if the suit leaks in cold water.

====Surface water sports====

Dry suits are used for windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, water skiing and other surface water sports where the user is frequently immersed in cold water. These suits are often made from very lightweight material for minimum encumbrance. Membrane type suits are commonly used with moderate water temperatures, but neoprene and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred in cold water, as they provide greater thermal protection in the event of a leak. Suits for kayaking may have an overlap for the spray deck (skirt) and suits for surfing , kiteboarding and other standing sports may have ankle cuff seals instead of boots or socks, allowing the user a wider choice of specialised footwear. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types of suits is important to water sports users that do not use a boat.
Short suits with bicep and thigh cuff seals are also available, and are useful when it is mainly necessary to keep the torso dry.

====Working====

Crew members who must work on the decks of commercial ships wear a type of dry suit also known as an immersion work suit. Single engine aircraft ferry pilots flying between North America and Europe, and helicopter pilots that must fly over the open ocean, must wear a survival suit in the cockpit, so they can continue to fly the aircraft until impact, then exit immediately if the aircraft is ditched in cold water after an engine failure. These suits are also used on shore when working on docks, bridges, or other areas where cold water immersion is a safety risk. They are usually a three-part system consisting of:
* A warm undersuit made of synthetic fabric designed to wick moisture from sweat generated by physical exertion away from the user&#x27;s skin.
* A dry suit made with a waterproof breathable membrane to let moisture vapour permeate out of the suit when not immersed.
* A durable outer shell, designed to protect the dry suit, and to carry tools and survival gear. The outer shell may also be equipped with an inflatable bladder to give the wearer additional flotation and stability when immersed.

====Survival====
Immersion survival suits are dry suits carried for use by ship and aircraft crew who will be immersed in cold water if the craft must be abandoned. Unlike immersion survival work suits, these are not intended to be worn routinely for long periods, and are only intended to be used in an emergency. Survival suits will typically be a one-piece design made of fire-retardant neoprene, optimized with quick donning features, and produced in high visibility colours with reflective tape patches.

Immersion suits protect the wearer from cold shock and delay hypothermia by reducing heat loss. Other functions include providing buoyancy and increasing visibility to rescuers. They must allow sufficient freedom of movement to perform necessary actions. There are two basic types: Suits for emergency abandonment, and suits intended to be worn over long work periods where the risk of immersion is relatively high, or there may be no opportunity to put the suit on in the event of an emergency. The size range that must be available for marine abandonment immersion suits is specified by CAN/CGSB-65.16-2005 and other standards, and may include children, small adults, universal, jumbo, and custom sizes. ISO 15027, Canadian General Standards Board (CAN/CGSB-65.16-2005), and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) immersion suit standards, as well as others, apply.

A survival suit for protecting survivors of a helicopter ditching incident is also known as a helicopter transportation suit (HTS). A ditched helicopter may invert immediately after impact, and the suit must facilitate underwater escape, which requires minimal buoyancy until the survivor is outside the ditched helicopter. Once outside, and clear of the wreckage, the suit must provide buoyancy, protection from drowning, and thermal protection while immersed. During normal flight operations the suit must be acceptably comfortable. Except for the underwater egress these requirements are very similar to those for other survival suits.

Helicopter transportation suits are constant wear immersion suits that are required for crew and passengers during operations over cold water. Aircrew and passenger HTS typically differ as pilots must not be encumbered while busy flying, generate more heat due to activity in flight, and are often heated by sunlight through the cockpit glazing.

====Rescue====
Dry suits are also worn by rescue personnel who must enter, or may accidentally enter, cold water. Features of dry suits designed for rescue may be a hybrid of the immersion survival and work suits, since the wearer is not expected to be working in the suit for an extended time. They may also be optimized for a specific task such as ice rescue, swift water rescue, or helicopter rescue swimmer.

Lightweight suits of breathable shell fabric which are easy to don, comfortable, strong, seals which can be trimmed to custom fit, and bootees that are easy to don and not bulky in the outer boot are desirable characteristics. Durable materials with reinforcement and padding on the knees, elbows and seat improve the useful life of the suit. High visibility colours and reflective tape which can be seen while wearing a personal flotation device are appropriate for this use case. Adjustable internal suspenders, belts and thigh straps allow better adjustment of fit to the individual, and well drained pockets in convenient locations and relief zippers are useful in the field. Low drag in the water can be valuable in some use cases.

==Manufacture==


Manufacturing processes mainly depend on the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which in the case of neoprene suits are first butt-glued, and are then overlock blind-stitched and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams on the inside of the suit instead of tape, DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.

Polyurethane coated nylon and trilaminate suits are usually assembled using double stitched seams for strength, which are then taped on the inside for watertightness.

Vulcanised rubber dry suits are made from a rubber coated knitted fabric, stitched together along the seams to hold them together during the vulcanising process. Once the suit has been assembled, it is stretched over an aluminium mandrel in the shape and size of the finished suit. When the suit is on the mandrel, the seams are taped with strips of the same rubber, but without the liner cloth, then bonded together with heat and pressure in an autoclave, which vulcanises the rubber of the suit and seam tape into a homogeneous layer which is very reliably watertight. Any customising of the suit is done after this process, and requires cutting and gluing and taping of additional seams, which are generally not as reliable and strong as the original structure The thickness of the rubber layer can be varied and patches added for abrasion resistance. Vulcanised rubber suits can also be made using rubber coated fabric that has already been vulcanised, assembled in much the same way as trilaminate suits, and the seams taped after assembly. This is more versatile for customising, but the seam quality is not as reliable as the method of vulcanising the assembled suit and seam tape together. The combination of high stretch rubber over stretchy knitted fabric makes these suits very flexible and elastic, so a baggy cut is not needed. However, the mandrels are expensive, so a limited number of standard sizes are available.

Seals, zippers, boots, pockets, and other accessories, are usually glued on to the shell after assembly, and joins and edges may be reinforced by seam tape in high stress areas or to improve watertightness. Some abrasion reinforcement and logos are bonded or stitched to the suit or printed onto the component panels before or after assembly.

==Inherent weaknesses==
Some components are inherently susceptible to damage if not treated with due care.

===Seal damage===
Latex and silicone seals are easily pierced by sharp objects. Gripping the seal with long fingernails to pull it on or off can cut through the material, while long toenails can damage thin rubber booties when the foot is pushed inside tight-fitting fins.

Latex is subject to rubber perishing, or &quot;dry rot&quot;, where ozone normally present in the air deteriorates the material over time, regardless of use. A latex seal is generally expected to last 1–2 years. The useful life can be extended by detaching removable seals when not in use and keeping them in airtight containers in a cool, dark environment. Silicone seals are similar in strength and elasticity to latex, but are more chemical resistant and do not perish in the same way. Latex and silicone seals are highly elastic, but can be easily torn if overstretched or nicked on an edge to form a stress raiser. Powdered talc can help the seals slide on easier.

Neoprene seals are a tougher and more tear resistant alternative, though they must be correctly sized for the user, as they cannot be adjusted much. These are much more resistant to perishing than latex, and the knit fabric backing helps redistribute concentrated loads and thereby reduces the risk of major tears. Minor tears are usually repairable. A lubricating liquid such as dishwashing liquid or KY jelly can be used to facilitate for donning and removing neoprene wrist seals.

===Zipper damage===

Metal toothed watertight zippers rely on pressure between the two rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires considerably more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together in front of the slider it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication on the outside surface of the metal teeth, which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close. The zipper teeth are moulded from a low friction polymer, but must be kept free of grit, so are not normally lubricated, but the slider docking area at the closing end must be greased for a proper seal on the TIZIP model but must not be greased on the YKK model.
On metal toothed zippers, the cut edges of the rubberized fabric of the zipper tapes are susceptible to fraying along the exposed weave. if not trimmed, the frayed edges can accelerate damage to the weave and eventually cause zipper failure by delamination of the edge. The moulded plastic zippers do not have an exposed cut edge, so do not have this weakness. The metal toothed zippers are stiffer and require more force to move the slider, and are more easily damaged by bending to a small radius. There were structural problems with some of the early plastic tooth zippers losing teeth, but these have been fixed by changing the manufacturing process and later models have become reliable.

Metal zipper failure modes include: worn out backing rubber, where the slider wears through the outer layer of the zipper, exposing the reinforcing fabric, loose or lost teeth, kinked or torn side tape between teeth, and worn out teeth on the interlocking area. Fraying of the reinforcing fabric along the cut edge can be tolerated as long as frayed fibres do not get between the sealing surfaces, thereby causing a leak, cause the slider to jam, or hook on snags and cause more serious damage.

==Hazards of use==

===Overheating before a dive===
Dressing into a dry suit is usually more time-consuming than a wet suit, and may require the assistance of another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time on the deck of a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze, are the usual solutions to this problem. Overheating in the suit can also happen when there is a difficult route to the water for a shore dive. A side effect of overheating is that the sweat produced by the diver can condense on the inside of the suit, or wet the thermal undergarment, reducing the insulating qualities during the dive.

===Wind chill after a dive===

Evaporative cooling in wind can, in very cold or windy conditions, remove more heat from the diver than the water does. This effect can also occur on deck in cold wind with spray. Any form of protection against the wind and spray that reduces evaporative cooling on the surface of the suit can be to some degree effective against wind chill. Adding air to the interior of the suit also increases insulation.

Temperatures above the ice may be considerably lower than water temperature, which is limited by freezing point of the water, and may be further exacerbated by wind chill. This can be a limiting factor on the endurance of the surface team if inadequately insulated and sheltered, and can have an impact on the divers on exiting the water in wet exposure suits.

===Suit squeeze===

During descent the air in the suit is compressed and unless more is added, the folds may be pressed together so tightly by water pressure that they pinch the skin, which is painful and may cause local bruising. The suit may also become so tight that movement is restricted, particularly in a membrane suit. This problem is managed by suit inflation from a low pressure gas supply.

=== Over-inflation ===
During ascent, the air added during descent must be removed again, in order to prevent over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent, with possibly fatal consequences. Most modern dry suits are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic exhaust valves, which can assist with this problem by automatically dumping excess gas when properly set and when the valve is higher than the excess gas in the suit. This is most effective and reliable when the volume of the gas in the suit is limited to maintaining undergarment loft, and the dump valve is kept shallower than the feet. If the suit is sealed directly to a helmet, the exhaust valve of a free-flow helmet or the exhaust valve of the demand valve of a demand helmet serve this purpose.

===Suit flooding===
Damage to the lower part of the suit can cause a sudden inrush of very cold water for winter users, or an inrush of contaminated water or chemicals for hazmat divers.
Damage to the upper part of the suit can cause a sudden venting of the air, resulting in a loss of buoyancy and possible uncontrolled descent, followed by flooding with water and loss of thermal insulation, and possible exposure to hazardous materials if the water is contaminated.

A flooded suit may contain so much water that the diver cannot climb out of the water because of the weight and inertia. In this case it may be necessary to cut a small slit in the lower part of the leg to let water drain out as the diver rises out of the water. This will take some time, and agility will be seriously compromised. The damage should not be difficult to repair if the slit is cut with reasonable care. Ankle dump valves will also serve to drain a flooded suit once enough of the diver is above the water.

=== Decompression risk from loss of heat during a dive ===

Experimental work by the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit shows that getting cold during decompression after being warm during the working part of the dive may be the worst case body temperature profile for decompression risk. Active heating systems that fail during the dive, and suit flooding have the potential to cause this scenario. Divers should be aware of the possible effects of thermal stress on decompression outcome, and the use of active heating should be considered in the context of this risk. Decompression computer algorithms that are claimed to take temperature into consideration are generally taking ambient temperature measurements, which has no reliable correlation to actual body temperature of the diver, and are in those cases of little relevance. Pollock (2015) suggests that active diver heating should be minimised to safely complete dive tasks during ingassing and increased during decompression with due attention to avoiding heat stress and dehydration.

===Diving without a buoyancy compensator===
Dry suits are not designed to be used as buoyancy compensator devices (BCD) and cannot offer the same degree of safety and control as a BCD. However, the fact that it is possible to control buoyancy using a dry suit has led some divers to attempt to control their buoyancy with the dry suit alone and dive without the dedicated BCD normally worn by scuba divers. Although it is possible to dive like this, the risks are higher than when using a buoyancy compensator for the following reasons:

* The BCD is more robust than a dry suit. Dry suits are not designed to be buoyancy compensators and more prone to failure than BCDs, they have multiple points of failure and can completely flood when a seal tears or a zip breaks or leaks. Wrist and neck seals can vent accidentally; annoying if wearing a BCD, possibly fatal without.
* The vent valves of a BCD are more secure and have backups, often via the inflator hose, the left shoulder valve, and a dedicated dump valve at the bottom. The dry suit usually only has an automatic dump valve at the left shoulder, other than manipulating the neck and wrist seals, and wrist seals may not be available if wearing dry gloves attached by a cuff ring.
* The BCD is designed to act as a flotation device on the surface, the dry suit is not.
* The BCD can be orally inflated if out of air at the surface, the dry suit is not normally provided with oral inflation fittings.
* The lifting capacity of the dry suit is less. This is because it is not designed to lift. It may not be sufficient if entering the water overweighted or if required to assist others. A large lifting capacity makes the buoyancy more difficult to control and the risk of severe overinflation is greater.
* If a dry suit floods, the release of the diving weights may not be sufficient to compensate, especially if the cylinders are negatively buoyant. There is no simple method to test this without flooding the suit.
* It increases the risk on an inversion. Dry suit inversions are dangerous and are best controlled by minimising the volume of air in the suit. If using the BCD for buoyancy control, and the suit inflation only to avoid a squeeze and provide undergarment loft, the suit should never contain an excess of air. If it does contain excess air as a result of using it for buoyancy or to compensate for being over-weighted the excess air may migrate to the legs causing the diver to invert to a dangerous feet-up position making venting the dry suit difficult or impossible and leading to an uncontrolled ascent. 
* Maintaining horizontal trim is more difficult and trim may change suddenly. Excess air will migrate as the diver changes pitch attitude and may cause dangerous instability.
* No redundancy. A dry suit might compensate for a BCD failure, but relying on the dry suit alone leaves no buoyancy control redundancy.
* Having a BCD makes it easier for a buddy assisting in an emergency to determine where the buoyancy is located and how to control it.

===Carotid-sinus reflex===
An over-tight neck seal can put pressure on the carotid artery, causing a reflex which slows the heart, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to the brain, light-headedness and eventual unconsciousness. For this reason, neck seals should be stretched or trimmed to the correct size.

===Accidental body-inversion hazards===

====Underwater====
If there is more gas in the dry suit than is needed to counteract &quot;squeeze&quot; on the undersuit, that excess gas accumulates as a &quot;bubble&quot; at the highest point of the suit. In an upright diver this is at the shoulders and around the neck seal, or in an integral hood. Divers need to keep their upper body tilted sufficiently head-up to prevent the bubble from moving into the legs and feet, causing the legs to rise, and inverting the diver&#x27;s body into a head-down position.

The movement of a large bubble to the legs can be a problem for a number of reasons: It inflates the legs, and may inflate thin rubber booties enough to cause fins to pop off, or cause the boots to pop off the feet, with the fins still in place on the boots. A diver without fins has reduced ability to maneuver back to a head up trim, and also loses the ability to kick downward to maintain depth, so that the bubble expansion problem does not get worse. Gas in the legs and feet of the suit usually cannot be evacuated while the diver is inverted, as most suits do not have ankle dump valves, and the inverted diver may start to float toward the surface, causing the problem of expanding air in the suit to grow worse in proportion to the decrease in depth. If the diver is positively buoyant and rising, the buoyancy of the dry suit will become uncontrollable, and ascent rate will accelerate. The final result of such a run-away inversion is a diver rising all the way to the surface, feet first, in an uncontrolled ascent that is too rapid for decompression safety.

When the suit is used correctly, the excess gas bubble inside it is relatively small, and its movement is not important. The bubble may be large for a variety of reasons: if a diver ascends without venting the suit; if the valve supplying gas the suit fails in the open position; or if the diver is over-weighted, and extra gas has been added to the suit to make the diver neutrally buoyant. The size of the bubble can be minimised by being correctly weighted, using the buoyancy compensator to adjust for weight changes due to gas consumption, keeping the exhaust valve high, and venting excess gas from the suit on ascent. It is a recommended practice to ensure that the bubble remains small and at the top of the body by using the buoyancy compensator to counteract any excess weighting, keeping only the minimum gas necessary to maintain undergarment loft inside the drysuit. Suits that fit correctly and are not excessively stretchy also help.

The recommended procedure in all such inversion incidents, is for the diver to bend at the knees and powerfully swing the arms to do a backward or forward roll to the upright position without delay, to allow the gas to flow to the shoulders and arms, allowing the automatic dump valve to operate, and then vent the suit, if needed, by manually opening the neck seal (sometimes called &quot;burping the suit&quot;) by breaking the seal-neck contact with a finger. If finning downwards is not immediately effective, it will not become effective later as the gas continues to expand.

====Surface====
Surface dry suit users can face a similar inversion problem. The problem is more acute when not wearing a personal flotation device (life vest) over the dry suit. For surface dry suit users, an inversion can be critical since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe, however, as the user is unlikely to be wearing weights it should be easy to return to a horizontal, face-up position.

It is not a problem for close-fitting neoprene suits, or hybrid suits with neoprene bottoms, which prevent air from easily moving into the legs of the suit. Wearers of baggy surface dry suits can mitigate the problem by venting out as much excess air as possible before entering the water. This is typically done by crouching down and leaning forward, wrapping the arms around the knees. Excess air can be &quot;burped&quot; out of the neck or cuff seal if there is no dump valve. The zip should be closed with as little tension as reasonably practicable across the opening.

==History==
===Early years===


In the 1830s, the Deane brothers asked Augustus Siebe to improve their diving helmet design. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet clamped to a full-length watertight canvas diving suit. The real breakthrough of the equipment was sealing the helmet to the suit, and using a non-return valve in the helmet to exhaust the air, which meant that the suit and helmet could not flood no matter how the diver moved, and the interior of the suit remained dry. Siebe introduced various modifications on this design to accommodate the requirements of the salvage team on the wreck of , including making the helmet detachable from the corselet; his improved design gave rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving.

On 14 June 1834, Leonard Norcross of Dixfield, Maine was awarded a patent for a dry suit made of rubber with an attached metal helmet. This was not the first American patent for a diving suit – it was the third patent of that year for an underwater suit, but Norcross&#x27; invention was the first to specify rubber as the waterproofing material.

In France in the 1860s, Benoît Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze developed a single stage demand regulator with a small low pressure reservoir, to make more economical use of surface supplied air pumped by manpower. This was originally used without any form of mask or helmet, but vision was poor, and the &quot;pig-snout&quot; copper mask was developed in 1866 to provide a clearer view through a glass faceplate on a copper mask clamped to the neck opening of the suit. This was soon improved to become a three-bolt helmet supported by a corselet (1867). Later versions were fitted for free-flow air supply.

The earliest suits were made of waterproofed canvas invented by Charles Mackintosh. From the late 1800s and throughout most of the 20th century, most suits consisted of a solid sheet of rubber between layers of tan twill. Their thick vulcanized rubber collar is clamped to the corselet making the joint waterproof. The inner collar (bib) was made of the same material as the suit and pulled up inside the corselet and around the diver&#x27;s neck. The space between the bib and corselet would trap most condensation and minor leakage in the helmet, keeping the diver dry. The sleeves could be fitted with integral gloves or rubber wrist seals and the suit legs ended in integral socks.

The twill was available in heavy, medium, and light grades, with the heavy having the best resistance to abrasion and puncture against rough surfaces like barnacles, rocks and the jagged edges of wreckage. Vulnerable areas were reinforced by extra layers of fabric. Different types of standard diving dress are defined by the clamping of the collar seal to the rim of the corselet or to the joint between bonnet and corselet, and the number of bolts used for this purpose. In some suits the legs could be laced at the back to limit inflated volume, which would limit the volume of excess gas that could be trapped in the legs and reduce the risk of it dragging an inverted diver to the surface.

The waterproof rubberised fabric, the seal to the helmet and the cuff seals kept the diver dry, allowing sufficient clothing to be worn under the suit to keep warm depending on the water temperature and expected level of exertion. The suit was usually a very baggy fit on the diver, and if over-inflated, would be too bulky to allow the diver to reach the control valves for air supply and exhaust. This contributed to the risk of suit blowup, which could cause an uncontrollable buoyant ascent, with high risk of decompression illness. To add to this problem, a runaway ascent could cause sufficient internal pressure to burst the seal at the corselet, which could result in a catastrophic loss of buoyancy, and the injured diver sinking back to the bottom in a flooded suit. Consequently, divers would ensure that they were weighted enough to remain sufficiently negative when underwater to minimise this risk, and to allow reasonably stable walking on the bottom. The bulkiness of fit, weighted boots, lack of fins, and lack of fine buoyancy control made swimming impracticable. At the surface the diver could struggle a short distance using the arms, but underwater would normally walk on the bottom and climb up and down over obstacles, taking care to avoid passing under anything that could foul the air hose. The diver needed to remain upright when ascending to allow venting of excess air through the helmet exhaust valve, and would either be lowered and pulled up by the tenders, or would slide down the shotline and climb back up it.

The Pirelli dry suit was designed in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers after the war and was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by folding up the sealing area of the jacket, and overlapping the sealing area of the trousers, then and folding the overlap down over itself more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the multiply folded part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.

===World War II and later 20th century===
British frogmen of World War II and for some time afterwards used a similar one or two piece rubberized knit fabric suit by Siebe Gorman, who produced the one-piece front-tunnel-entry Sladen suit with integral rubber helmet, developed by the British Admiralty for use with manned torpedoes, and in the late 1950s also the Essjee two-piece waist entry swim suit, based on the Sladen suit. The Essjee suit consisted of a jacket with rubber hood and lightweight wrist cuffs, and trousers shod with moulded rubber soles. Soft open cell sponge-rubber pads inside the hood covered the ears and allowed air flow inside the suit for them to be equalised. There was space under the suit for plenty of woollen underclothes. The suit was available in proofed gabardine or rubberised stockinette, with the cloth on the outside and the rubber inside, to protect the rubber from sunlight while in use.

In 1945, the Spearfisherman Company, of Huntington Beach, California was approached by the US Navy to produce a rubber suit. These were advertised in the first issue of the Skin Diver magazine in December 1951. They were tunnel entry suits, and were available as full length or shortie suits with integral hood. Later versions had a neck level entry chute and a nape valve to purge trapped air. The shortie version was also rebranded as Kellys &quot;7-seas&quot; suit.

In 1946 Jacques Cousteau developed a constant volume drysuit which was inflated by blowing air under the mask skirt into the hood of the suit. Valves in the hood, wrists, and ankles, allowed venting in most positions.
Seamless dipped latex one and two-piece suits were available In the US from the early 1950s. Two piece suits were connected and sealed by a rolled overlap at the waist or with a &quot;ring and rail&quot; waist seal, and were available in long or short leg versions and long or short sleeved versions, all with integral neck, and cuff or arm and thigh seals, and in a range of sizes and colours. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front or back tunnel, pocket, or neck entry. Separate hoods and boots or reinforced feet for the long leg versions were available as options. Suits were manufactured in dipped latex, 2 and 3 ply gum rubber and textile backed rubber. Some were assembled from cut components, while others were dipped one-piece seamless latex construction. Kits were also available for home completion. Manufacturers included Waterwear of Newport Beach, California, Healthways, W.J. Voit Rubber Corporation, Bel-Aqua Water Sports Company of Los Angeles, (later Aquala Sports Manufacturing Company), So-Lo Marx Rubber Company of Loveland, Ohio, and the Dolphin Manufacturing Company of California.

The UK-based Dunlop Rubber Company produced drysuits for military and commercial divers and the Dunlop Aquafort range for recreational use.

By the mid-1950s, C.E. Heinke &amp; Co. Ltd., an established manufacturer of standard diving equipment, had diversified into recreational underwater swimming equipment, including the &quot;Delta&quot; dry suit, made from natural rubber on a stockinette base. The basic Delta was a two piece suit made up of a jacket with neck seal and trousers with ankle seals which could be worn over woolen undergarments. The full suit included integral hood and feet. For a few years after C.E. Heinke &amp; Co. Ltd. was taken over by Siebe-Gorman and Company in 1961, dry suits were marketed under the Siebe-Heinke label. The Siebe-Heinke &quot;Dip Suit&quot; for recreational diving, swimming, yachting and fishing, was a seamless black dipped-latex jacket with neck and cuff seals, and trousers with separate yellow latex cummerbund for the waist-seal. A yellow hood and black protective over-bootees were optional extras. The Siebe-Heinke &quot;Frogman&quot; dry suit for professional and recreational use, introduced in 1963, was available in stockinette proofed with black rubber, or proofed fawn twill. The suit consisted of booted trousers with reinforced soles or optional ankle seals, and a jacket with cuff seals and an option between a neck seal or integral hood, connected by a rolled waist seal and cummerbund.

===Introduction of the watertight zipper and variable volume dry suit===

Development of space-suits led to the pressure-tight zipper, first manufactured by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This was followed by the Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits, though the volume of gas in them will vary with the underwear in use, the attitude of the diver in the water, and during descent, with depth and manual addition of gas. What is constant is actually the opening pressure of the dump valves. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a vulcanised rubber drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume dry suit exhaust valve in 1971. This valve has a user adjustable overpressure opening setting, and can also be manually opened. When combined with the low pressure inflator valve, it gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control in what became known as the variable volume dry suit. Since then, plastic watertight zippers have been developed and are in widespread use on new suits and for replacement of damaged zippers, though the original metal toothed zippers are still available both as original equipment and for replacements. The all plastic injection moulded zipper must be greased on the landing wedge of the slider to create a proper seal.

===Standardisation of inflation and deflation controls===

Since recommendations on the standardisation of scuba equipment made at the 1989 American Academy of Underwater Science Biomechanics of Safe Ascents Workshop were made, there has been a general tendency for the position and operation of the inflation and dump valves to be very similar on most dry suits, making the adjustment to an unfamiliar suit relatively straightforward.

===21st century developments===
Neoprene materials for wetsuits have developed and some of the changes have made them more suitable for dry suits. Among these are much greater abrasion resistance of the surface textiles. The relatively high stretch allows suits to be made with a more form-fitting cut, which reduces both hydrodynamic drag and excess internal volume. Thinner and higher density neoprene cores reduce the effect of depth on the shell thickness. Repair is also easier than for most membrane materials and can in some cases even be done on wet neoprene, making field repairs more practicable. These improvements are also expected to prolong the useful life of the suit.
Injection moulded plastic zippers have been developed that are cheaper and require less force to open and close than the metal toothed version, but may leak more if not completely closed, and may not last as long under heavy loads.

==Training==
Training in the use of a dry suit include the techniques for putting it on and taking it off without damaging the zipper or seals, and for divers, the additional skills required for diving safely in a dry suit. Several diver training agencies offer skills training and certification specifically to safely dive in a dry suit. These skills are often part of a professional diver&#x27;s basic training. Developing full proficiency usually requires considerably more experience than is available from the training programmes.

Training in the use of a dry suit for diving generally involves a theory class on the characteristics and types of dry suit, and the advantages and hazards associated with their use. There may be content on selection of a suit and assessing fit. Practical training will generally include inspection of the suit, how to put it on and take it off, how to determine correct weighting in conjunction with the rest of the diving equipment, routine maintenance and cleaning, basic skills of buoyancy control, and recovery from common problems which if not promptly corrected, could develop into emergencies. A small number of confined water and open water dives will be done to learn and practice the skills, but the ability to use a dry suit competently develops with practice. The prerequisite is usually an entry-level diving certification, but in some regions where the water is very cold, and with some agencies, entry-level training may be done in dry suits as an option.

===Skills===

Skills necessary for the safe and effective use of dry suits include:
*Choosing a suit of appropriate size and fit. 
*Selecting appropriate undergarments for the water temperature.
*Setting up and preparation of the suit.
*Inspection of the suit for damage and defects before the dive.
*Dressing into the suit.
**Closing the zip correctly. 
**Removing excess gas after putting on the suit.
*Choosing and distributing ballast weight to provide correct trim and buoyancy from the start to the end of the dive.
*Maintaining an appropriate gas volume in the suit during the dive: 
**Buoyancy control during descent, at constant depth, during ascent, and at the surface. 
**Inflation and dumping excess gas and setting the auto-dump valve.
**Maintaining appropriate trim and attitude underwater and at the surface.
*Managing contingencies:
**Connecting and disconnecting a pressurised inflator hose.
**Managing a stuck inflation valve.
**Recovery from inversion.
**Recovery from uncontrolled buoyant ascent/blowup.
**Managing a leak or flood.
*Undressing from the suit without damaging zip or seals.
*Post dive cleaning and maintenance.

==Manufacturers and brands==
Inflation and dump valves are largely manufactured by Apeks and SI Tech. Inflation hoses are basically identical to low pressure hoses for use for inflating buoyancy compensators, but may be of different lengths depending on the gas source and hose routing. Silicone neck seals using a clamping ring system are made by DUI and SI Tech, and fitted to other brands by the manufacturer or as aftermarket improvements. Dry glove systems using clip-on mounting rings are made by several manufacturers; some can be fitted to a latex wrist seal already glued to the suit, others are glued directly to the sleeve of the suit, and the glove ring clips to the fixed ring while in use, usually with an o-ring seal. There is usually a wrist seal under the dry glove in case the glove comes off during the dive.

Watertight zippers are supplied to dry suit manufacturers by German company TiZip (plastic teeth) and BDM, Dynat and OEB from the YKK group (bronze teeth), and SZIP. (Chinese)

<doc id="291792" wikidata="Q820210" url="?curid=291792" title="Altitude diving">
<text>Altitude diving is underwater diving using scuba or surface supplied diving equipment where the surface is or more above sea level (for example, a mountain lake). Altitude is significant in diving because it affects the decompression requirement for a dive, so that the stop depths and decompression times used for dives at altitude are different from those used for the same dive profile at sea level. The U.S. Navy tables recommend that no alteration be made for dives at altitudes lower than and for dives between 91 and 300 meters correction is required for dives deeper than of sea water. Most recently manufactured decompression computers can automatically compensate for altitude.

== Measurement of depth at altitude ==
Special consideration must be given to measurement of depth given the effect of pressure on gauges.
The use of bourdon tube, diaphragm, and digital depth gauges may require adjustment for use at altitude. Capillary gauges have been shown to be a conservative method for measurement of compensated depth at altitude. Modern dive computers detect changes in altitude or accept it as a user input and automatically adjust their calculation of a safe decompression regime for a dive at that altitude. If an altitude-aware computer is not used, altitude decompression tables must be used.

==Effects of altitude on buoyancy control and barotraumas==
Buoyancy control is directly affected by volume change of gas with depth. The lower surface pressure causes larger volume change with the same change in depth relative to the surface compared to sea level conditions. As in the case for sea level diving, the ambient pressure at depth is the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the water plus the hydrostatic pressure due to the weight of the water column above that depth. The hydrostatic pressure increases in the same proportion to depth, but the atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. The lower initial pressure at the surface means that a mass of gas occupying a given volume will be compressed more than the same volume at sea level for the same depth. The formula for Boyle&#x27;s law applies:
:P1 V1 = P2 V2
:or: V2 = P1 V1/P2
:or: V2/V1 = P1/P2

Example:

At sea level P1 = 1 bar (approximately), and at 10  m depth at sea level P2 = 2 bar
so V2/V1 = 1/2 = 0.5

At altitude , P1 = 0.7 bar (approximatelty), and at a depth of 10 m, P2 = 1.7 bar, so V2/V1 = 0.7/1.7 = 0.412

As a consequence, dry suit squeeze, mask squeeze, and ear and sinus squeezes will all develop more rapidly at higher altitude. In most cases the difference will not be noticeable, as experienced divers tend to equalise most squeezes reflexively, but as an example, a dry suit without a functional inflation system will squeeze the diver shallower than would be the case at sea level, and more for the same water depth. For exactly the same reason, bartraumas of ascent can occur for slightly lower depth changes.

== Decompression when diving at altitude ==
At altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level, so surfacing at the end of an altitude dive leads to a greater relative reduction in pressure and an increased risk of decompression sickness compared to the same dive profile at sea level. The dives are also typically carried out in freshwater at altitude so it has a lower density than seawater used for calculation of decompression tables. The amount of time the diver has spent acclimatising at altitude is also of concern as divers with gas loadings near those of sea level may also be at an increased risk. The US Navy recommends waiting 12 hours following arrival at altitude before performing the first dive. The tissue supersaturation following an ascent to altitude can also be accounted for by considering it to be residual nitrogen and allocating a residual nitrogen group when using tables with this facility.

=== Decompression tables ===
The most common of the modifications to decompression tables at altitude are the &quot;Cross Corrections&quot; which use a ratio of atmospheric pressure and sea level to that of the altitude to provide a conservative equivalent sea level depth. The Cross Corrections were later looked at by Bassett and by Bell and Borgwardt.

Hennessy formulated that it was possible to convert standard air decompression tables for no-stop diving at altitude or from a habitat based on phase equilibration theory.

Albert A. Bühlmann recognized the problem and proposed a method which calculated maximum nitrogen loading in the tissues at a particular ambient pressure.

Wienke proposed guidelines for decompression diving at altitude in 1993.

Egi and Brubakk reviewed various models for preparing tables for diving at altitude.

Paulev and Zubieta have created a new conversion factor in order to make any sea-level dive table usable during high altitude diving in 2007.

=== Repetitive diving ===
Repetitive dives should be conducted in the same manner as other dives including &quot;Cross Corrections&quot; for altitude. The US Navy does not allow repetitive diving for surface-supplied helium-oxygen diving and a 12-hour surface interval is required. An 18-hour surface interval is required if the dive requires decompression.

=== Pre- and post-dive ascents ===
In addition to making depth adjustments using the Cross Conversions, dives at altitude often require pre- and post-dive altitude ascents which must be taken into consideration. Several methods for performing post-dive ascents are used. One is to adjust the dive times needed for an altitude ascent. Another is to use surface intervals to allow for an ascent.

== Extreme altitude diving ==

Although no official records are recognized, until 2007 the highest recorded altitude at which a scuba dive had been conducted was , by a team led by Charles Brush and Johan Reinhard in 1982 in Lago Licancabur. This record was equaled by a team led by Nathalie Cabrol (SETI Institute/NASA Ames) in 2006. That year, Cabrol set the highest recorded altitude scuba diving for women. She also free dived at Lake Licancabur in 2003 and 2004.

In 2007, a new record was set in the small lagoon located near the summit of Pili Volcano, at just over , by Philippe Reuter, Claudia Henríquez and Alain Meyes. This record stood for nine years before it was surpassed in 2016.
On 7 March 2016 Marcel Korkus discovered the highest lake on Earth (Cazadero at 5985 m above sea level) and thereby set the Guinness record in diving, confirmed by an official Guinness certificate. Shortly afterwards, as a result of the Guinness organization’s change of regulations to being less restrictive, the record was awarded to a Hungarian diver and mountaineer Erno Tósoki dived a maximum of 2 meters (6.6 ft) deep, for about 10 minutes on altitude 6,382 meters (20,938 ft). His record breaking dive was supported by only one support team member.

The current record for the highest scuba dive was set on December 13, 2019 by Polish diver and mountaineer Marcel Korkus. He dived at an altitude of 6,395 m above sea level (20,981 ft), on Ojos del Salado volcano setting an absolute world record in altitude diving. He is the first person to dive at such a high altitude. The dive took place in the so-called basin (a natural water reservoir, which in terms of dimensions cannot be considered a lake). The ice was 1.3 meters thick and the water temperature was 3 °C. It is probable that a human cannot dive at any higher altitude.

The highest scuba dive in the continental United States was done on 7 September 2013 by John Bali at Colorado&#x27;s Pacific Tarn Lake, altitude .

The deepest known staged decompression altitude dive was conducted by Nuno Gomes at Boesmansgat (Bushman&#x27;s hole) in South Africa. Conducted at an altitude of approximately , Gomes dived to a depth of . Gomes&#x27;s decompression schedule was calculated as being equivalent to a dive to if it had been conducted at sea level.

=== Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s 1968 Lake Titicaca expedition ===

In 1968 Jacques Cousteau mounted an expedition to explore Bolivia and Peru&#x27;s Lake Titicaca in search of submerged Inca treasure.

The diving equipment was tested and practice dives were made off the coast of Peru, but poor weather interrupted the practice session. The expedition departed from Matarani, Peru on the Pacific Ocean: two mini submarines were unloaded onto rail cars and transported up the Andes mountains to over 14,666 feet at Crucero Alto, then continued down the mountain by rail to Lake Titicaca at .

The team visited ruins in Peru before continuing south to Copacabana, Bolivia, where a parade was held in honor of the event. Ruins were visited at Isla del Sol and Isla de la Luna. Then dives were made in the area to minor underwater ruins. The expected rich schools of fish were not found. For the next four weeks, dives were made in the area, during which many dead fish were found and collected. Large toads were also found and collected. Samples of the dead fish and the toads were sent to the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco for study.

To help map the bottom of the lake Dr Harold Edgerton arrived from MIT with depth mapping equipment.

After mapping the lake an area was selected for the subs to dive. Floats were added to the subs to compensate for the lower density of fresh water, and the subs were launched. Jacques Cousteau and Albert Falco piloted the subs, which were accompanied by divers to a depth of 100 feet, then continued to a depth of 400 feet, where more toads were observed.

After the sub dive the results for the test on the dead fish arrived from Monaco. When trout were introduced into the lake in 1940 parasites were introduced with them.

==Training==
The effects of altitude on decompression and corrections to the tables or decompression computer settings to compensate for altitude would generally be included in entry level commercial and scientific diver training, and may be included in recreational diver training at some level, or may be split out as an additional training program for those who intend to dive at altitude, by which method the diver is not required to deal with the small addition to decompression theory if they don&#x27;t need it, but have to pay for an additional course if they do. For example PADI offer their Altitude Diver certification.

<text>The Place des Vosges (), originally the Place Royale, is the oldest planned square in Paris, France. It is located in the Marais district, and it straddles the dividing-line between the 3rd and 4th arrondissements of Paris. It is the oldest square in Paris, just before the Place Dauphine. It is an enclosed square, accessible via a main street on one of its four sides and two streets running beneath pavilions. It was a fashionable and expensive square to live in during the 17th and 18th centuries, and one of the main reasons for the chic nature of Le Marais among the Parisian nobility. Along with the Place des Victoires, Place Dauphine, Place Vendôme and Place de la Concorde, it is one of the five royal squares in Paris.

== History ==
Originally known as the Place Royale, the Place des Vosges was built by Henry IV of France from 1605 to 1612. A true square (140 m × 140 m), it embodied one of the first European programs of royal city planning (Plaza Mayor in Madrid, begun in 1590, precedes it). It was built on the site of the Hôtel des Tournelles and its gardens, which were demolished by Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

The Place Royale was inaugurated in 1612 with a grand &quot;carrousel&quot; to celebrate the engagement of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, and became a prototype of the residential squares of European cities that were to come. What was new about the Place Royale, was that the house-fronts were all built to the same design, probably by Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, of red brick with strips of stone quoins over vaulted arcades that stand on square pillars. The steeply-pitched blue slate roofs are pierced with discreet small-paned dormers above the pedimented dormers that stand upon the cornices. Only the north range was built with the vaulted ceilings that the &quot;galleries&quot; were meant to have. 

There are two pavilions that rise higher than the unified roofline of the square on the north and south faces and offer access to the square through triple arches. Though they are designated the Pavilion of the King and of the Queen, no royal has ever lived in the aristocratic square, except for Anne of Austria who lived in the Pavilion de la Reine for a short while. The Place Royale inspired subsequent developments of Paris that created a suitable urban background for the French aristocracy and nobility.

The square was often the place for the nobility to chat, and served as a meeting place for them. This was so until the French Revolution.

Before the square was completed, Henri IV ordered the Place Dauphine to be laid out. Within a mere five-year period, the king oversaw an unmatched building scheme for the ravaged medieval city: additions to the Louvre Palace, the Pont Neuf, and the Hôpital Saint Louis as well as the two royal squares.

Cardinal Richelieu had an equestrian bronze of Louis XIII erected in the centre. In the late 18th century, while most of the nobility moved to the Faubourg Saint-Germain district, the square managed to keep some of its aristocratic owners until the Revolution. It was briefly renamed &quot;Place de la Fabrication-des-Armes&quot; (the place were weapons are produced) then in 1800, it was formally renamed to Place des Vosges in honor of the &quot;département&quot; of Vosges which was the first to pay taxes supporting a campaign of the Revolutionary army. From 1814 until 1830, and from 1852 until 1870, the name was changed back to the original by the Restoration monarchs. In 1830 the name was briefly switched to being &quot;Place de la République&quot;. Finally in 1870 the revolutionary name was restored.

Today the square is planted with a bosquet of mature lindens set in grass and gravel, surrounded by clipped lindens.
