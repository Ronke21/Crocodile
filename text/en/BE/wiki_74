<doc id="288215" wikidata="Q1186127" url="?curid=288215" title="Respect for the Aged Day">
<text>is a public holiday in Japan celebrated annually to honor elderly citizens. It started in 1966 as a national holiday and was held on every September 15. Since 2003, Respect for the Aged Day is held on the third Monday of September due to the Happy Monday System.

This national holiday traces its origins to 1947, when Nomadani-mura (later Yachiyo-cho, currently Taka-cho), Hyōgo Prefecture, proclaimed September 15 Old Folks&#x27; Day (Toshiyori no Hi). Its popularity spread nationwide, and in 1966 it took its present name and status. Annually, Japanese media take the opportunity to feature the elderly, reporting on the population and highlighting the oldest people in the country.

==Commemorative silver sake cups==
Since 1963, the Japanese government has given a commemorative silver sake cup to Japanese who reach the age of 100. In 1963, the number was 153, but with numbers increasing, the government decided to reduce the size of the cup to cut costs in 2009. In 2014, 29,357 received a cup. In 2017, Japan honored 32,097 people (27,461 women and 4,636 men) who turned 100 years old; they each received congratulatory letter and souvenir sake cup from the Prime Minister. According to this report the solid sterling silver cups were replaced with nickel alloy silver plated design which halved the per-unit cost, saving $1-million in the annual budget.

== Celebration ==
On this holiday, people return home to visit and pay respect to the elders. Some people volunteer in neighborhoods by making and distributing free lunch boxes to older citizens. Entertainment is sometimes provided by teenagers and children with various keirokai (events to celebrate elders) performances. Special television programs are also featured by Japanese media on this holiday.

As the birthplace of Respect for the Aged Day, Taka-Town in Hyōgo Prefecture created the Respect for the Aged Song, &quot;Kitto Arigatō&quot; (Thank You, Sure), through a public contest in 2013.

<text>In astronomy, a blue giant is a hot star with a luminosity class of III (giant) or II (bright giant). In the standard Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, these stars lie above and to the right of the main sequence.

The term applies to a variety of stars in different phases of development, all evolved stars that have moved from the main sequence but have little else in common, so blue giant simply refers to stars in a particular region of the HR diagram rather than a specific type of star. They are much rarer than red giants, because they only develop from more massive and less common stars, and because they have short lives in the blue giant stage.

Because O-type and B-type stars with a giant luminosity classification are often somewhat more luminous than their normal main-sequence counterparts of the same temperatures and because many of these stars are relatively nearby to Earth on the galactic scale of the Milky Way Galaxy, many of the bright stars in the night sky are examples of blue giants, including Beta Centauri (B1III); Mimosa (B0.5III); Bellatrix (B2III); Epsilon Canis Majoris (B2II); and Alpha Lupi (B1.5III) among others.

==Properties==

Blue giant is not a strictly defined term and it is applied to a wide variety of different types of stars. They have in common a moderate increase in size and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of the same mass or temperature, and are hot enough to be called blue, meaning spectral class O, B, and sometimes early A. Their temperatures exceed around 10,000 K, and they have zero age main sequence (ZAMS) masses greater than about twice the Sun (), and absolute magnitudes around 0 or brighter. These stars are only 5–10 times the radius of the Sun (), compared to red giants which are up to .

The coolest and least luminous stars referred to as blue giants are on the horizontal branch, intermediate-mass stars that have passed through a red giant phase and are now burning helium in their cores. Depending on mass and chemical composition these stars gradually move blue wards until they exhaust the helium in their cores and then they return redwards to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The RR Lyrae variable stars, usually with spectral types of A, lie across the middle of the horizontal branch. Horizontal-branch stars hotter than the RR Lyrae gap are generally considered to be blue giants, and sometimes the RR Lyrae stars themselves are called blue giants despite some of them being F class. The hottest stars, blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars, are called extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars and can be hotter than main-sequence stars of the same luminosity. In these cases they are called blue subdwarf (sdB) stars rather than blue giants, named for their position to the left of the main sequence on the HR diagram rather than for their increased luminosity and temperature compared to when they were themselves main-sequence stars.

There are no strict upper limits for giant stars, but early O types become increasingly difficult to classify separately from main sequence and supergiant stars, have almost identical sizes and temperatures to the main-sequence stars from which they develop, and very short lifetimes. A good example is Plaskett&#x27;s star, a close binary consisting of two O type giants both over , temperatures over 30,000 K, and more than 100,000 times the luminosity of the Sun (). Astronomers still differ over whether to classify at least one of the stars as a supergiant, based on subtle differences in the spectral lines.

==Evolution==
Stars found in the blue giant region of the HR diagram can be in very different stages of their lives, but all are evolved stars that have largely exhausted their core hydrogen supplies.

In the simplest case, a hot luminous star begins to expand as its core hydrogen is exhausted, and first becomes a blue subgiant then a blue giant, becoming both cooler and more luminous. Intermediate-mass stars will continue to expand and cool until they become red giants. Massive stars also continue to expand as hydrogen shell burning progresses, but they do so at approximately constant luminosity and move horizontally across the HR diagram. In this way they can quickly pass through blue giant, bright blue giant, blue supergiant, and yellow supergiant classes, until they become red supergiants. The luminosity class for such stars is determined from spectral lines that are sensitive to the surface gravity of the star, with more expanded and luminous stars being given I (supergiant) classifications while somewhat less expanded and more luminous stars are given luminosity II or III. Because they are massive stars with short lives, many blue giants are found in O–B associations, that are large collections of loosely bound young stars.

BHB stars are more evolved and have helium burning cores, although they still have an extensive hydrogen envelope. They also have moderate masses around so they are often much older than more massive blue giants. The BHB takes its name from the prominent horizontal grouping of stars seen on colour-magnitude diagrams for older clusters, where core helium burning stars of the same age are found at a variety of temperatures with roughly the same luminosity. These stars also evolve through the core helium burning stage at constant luminosity, first increasing in temperature then decreasing again as they move toward the AGB. However, at the blue end of the horizontal branch, it forms a &quot;blue tail&quot; of stars with lower luminosity, and occasionally a &quot;blue hook&quot; of even hotter stars.

There are other highly evolved hot stars not generally referred to as blue giants: Wolf–Rayet stars, highly luminous and distinguished by their extreme temperatures and prominent helium and nitrogen emission lines; post-AGB stars forming planetary nebulae, similar to Wolf–Rayet stars but smaller and less massive; blue stragglers, uncommon luminous blue stars observed apparently on the main sequence in clusters where main-sequence stars of their luminosity should have evolved into giants or supergiants; and the true blue supergiants, the most massive stars evolved beyond blue giants and identified by the effects of greater expansion on their spectra.

A purely theoretical group of stars may form when red dwarfs finally exhaust their core hydrogen trillions of years into the future. These stars are convective through their depth and are expected to very slowly increase both their temperature and luminosity as they accumulate more and more helium until eventually they cannot sustain fusion and they quickly collapse to white dwarfs. Although these stars can become hotter than the Sun, they will never become more luminous, so are hardly blue giants as we see them today.

<text>A blue supergiant (BSG) is a hot, luminous star, often referred to as an OB supergiant. They are usually considered to be those with luminosity class I and spectral class B9 or earlier, although sometimes A-class supergiants are also deemed blue supergiants.

Blue supergiants are found towards the top left of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, above and to the right of the main sequence. By analogy to the red giant branch for low-mass stars, this region is also called the blue giant branch. They are larger than the Sun but smaller than a red supergiant, with surface temperatures of 10,000–50,000 K and luminosities from about 10,000 to a million times that of the Sun. They are most often an evolutionary phase between high-mass, hydrogen-fusing main-sequence stars and helium-fusing red supergiants, although new research suggests they could be the result of stellar mergers. 

The majority of supergiants are also blue (B-type) supergiants; blue supergiants from classes O9.5 to B2 are even more common than their main sequence counterparts. More post-main-sequence blue supergiants are observed than what is expected from theoretical models, which expect blue supergiants to be short-lived. This results in the blue supergiant problem, although unusual stellar interiors (such as hotter blue supergiants having oversized hydrogen-fusing cores and cooler ones having undersized helium-fusing cores) may explain this.

==Formation==

It was once believed that blue supergiants originated from a &quot;feeding&quot; with the interstellar medium when stars passed through interstellar dust clouds, although the current consensus is that blue supergiants are evolved high-mass stars, a natural consequence of stellar evolution, larger and more luminous than main-sequence stars. O-type and early B-type stars with initial masses around evolve away from the main sequence in just a few million years as their hydrogen is consumed and heavy elements (with atomic numbers of 26 (Fe) and less) start to appear near the surface of the star. These stars usually become blue supergiants, although it is possible that some of them (particularly the more massive ones) evolve directly to Wolf–Rayet stars. Expansion into the supergiant stage occurs when hydrogen in the core of the star is depleted and hydrogen shell burning starts, but it may also be caused as heavy elements are dredged up to the surface by convection and mass loss due to radiation pressure increases.

Blue supergiants are newly evolved from the main sequence, have extremely high luminosities, high mass loss rates, and are generally unstable. Many of them become luminous blue variables (LBVs) with episodes of extreme mass loss. Lower mass blue supergiants continue to expand until they become red supergiants. In the process they must spend some time as yellow supergiants or yellow hypergiants, but this expansion occurs in just a few thousand years and so these stars are rare. Higher mass red supergiants blow away their outer atmospheres and evolve back to blue supergiants, and possibly onwards to Wolf–Rayet stars. Depending on the exact mass and composition of a red supergiant, it can execute a number of blue loops before either exploding as a type II supernova or finally dumping enough of its outer layers to become a blue supergiant again, less luminous than the first time but more unstable. If such a star can pass through the yellow evolutionary void it is expected that it becomes one of the lower luminosity LBVs.

The most massive blue supergiants are too luminous to retain an extensive atmosphere and they never expand into a red supergiant. The dividing line is approximately , although the coolest and largest red supergiants develop from stars with initial masses of . It is not clear whether more massive blue supergiants can lose enough mass to evolve safely into old age as a Wolf Rayet star and finally a white dwarf, or they reach the Wolf Rayet stage and explode as supernovae, or they explode as supernovae while blue supergiants.

Supernova progenitors are most commonly red supergiants and it was believed that only red supergiants could explode as supernovae. SN 1987A, however, forced astronomers to re-examine this theory, as its progenitor, Sanduleak -69° 202, was a B3 blue supergiant. Now it is known from observation that almost any class of evolved high-mass star, including blue and yellow supergiants, can explode as a supernova although theory still struggles to explain how in detail. While most supernovae are of the relatively homogeneous type II-P and are produced by red supergiants, blue supergiants are observed to produce supernovae with a wide range of luminosities, durations, and spectral types, sometimes sub-luminous like SN 1987A, sometimes super-luminous such as many type IIn supernovae.

==Properties==

Because of their extreme masses they have relatively short lifespans and are mainly observed in young cosmic structures such as open clusters, the arms of spiral galaxies, and in irregular galaxies. They are rarely observed in spiral galaxy cores, elliptical galaxies, or globular clusters, most of which are believed to be composed of older stars, although the core of the Milky Way has recently been found to be home to several massive open clusters and associated young hot stars.

The best known example is Rigel, the brightest star in the constellation of Orion. Its mass is about 20 times that of the Sun, and its luminosity is around 117,000 times greater. Despite their rarity and their short lives they are heavily represented among the stars visible to the naked eye; their immense brightness is more than enough to compensate for their scarcity.

Blue supergiants have fast stellar winds and the most luminous, called hypergiants, have spectra dominated by emission lines that indicate strong continuum driven mass loss. Blue supergiants show varying quantities of heavy elements in their spectra, depending on their age and the efficiency with which the products of nucleosynthesis in the core are convected up to the surface. Quickly rotating supergiants can be highly mixed and show high proportions of helium and even heavier elements while still burning hydrogen at the core; these stars show spectra very similar to a Wolf Rayet star.

Many blue supergiant stars are Alpha Cygni variables.

While the stellar wind from a red supergiant is dense and slow, the wind from a blue supergiant is fast but sparse. When a red supergiant becomes a blue supergiant, the faster wind it produces impacts the already emitted slow wind and causes the outflowing material to condense into a thin shell. In some cases, several concentric faint shells can be seen from successive episodes of mass loss, either previous blue loops from the red supergiant stage, or eruptions such as LBV outbursts.

<text>The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is a theorem in social choice theory. It was first conjectured by the philosopher Michael Dummett and the mathematician Robin Farquharson in 1961 and then proved independently by the philosopher Allan Gibbard in 1973 and economist Mark Satterthwaite in 1975. It deals with deterministic ordinal electoral systems that choose a single winner, and shows that for every voting rule of this form, at least one of the following three things must hold:

# The rule limits the possible outcomes to two alternatives only; or
# The rule is not straightforward, i.e. there is no single always-best strategy (one that does not depend on other voters&#x27; preferences or behavior).
Gibbard&#x27;s proof of the theorem is more general and covers processes of collective decision that may not be ordinal, such as cardinal voting. Gibbard&#x27;s 1978 theorem and Hylland&#x27;s theorem are even more general and extend these results to non-deterministic processes, where the outcome may depend partly on chance; the Duggan–Schwartz theorem extends these results to multiwinner electoral systems.

== Informal description ==
Consider three voters named Alice, Bob and Carol, who wish to select a winner among four candidates named formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4. Assume that they use the Borda count: each voter communicates his or her preference order over the candidates. For each ballot, 3 points are assigned to the top candidate, 2 points to the second candidate, 1 point to the third one and 0 points to the last one. Once all ballots have been counted, the candidate with the most points is declared the winner.

Assume that their preferences are as follows.
If the voters cast sincere ballots, then the scores are: formula_5. Hence, candidate formula_3 will be elected, with 7 points.

But Alice can vote strategically and change the result. Assume that she modifies her ballot, in order to produce the following situation.

Alice has strategically upgraded candidate formula_2 and downgraded candidate formula_3. Now, the scores are: formula_9. Hence, formula_2 is elected. Alice is satisfied by her ballot modification, because she prefers the outcome formula_2 to formula_3, which is the outcome she would obtain if she voted sincerely.

We say that the Borda count is &quot;manipulable&quot;: there exists situations where a sincere ballot does not defend a voter&#x27;s preferences best.

The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem states that every ranked-choice voting is manipulable, except possibly in two cases: if there is a distinguished voter who has a dictatorial power, or if the rule limits the possible outcomes to two options only.

== Formal statement ==
Let formula_13 be the set of &quot;alternatives&quot; (which is assumed finite), also called &quot;candidates&quot;, even if they are not necessarily persons: they can also be several possible decisions about a given issue. We denote by formula_14 the set of &quot;voters&quot;. Let formula_15 be the set of strict weak orders over formula_13: an element of this set can represent the preferences of a voter, where a voter may be indifferent regarding the ordering of some alternatives. A &quot;voting rule&quot; is a function formula_17. Its input is a profile of preferences formula_18 and it yields the identity of the winning candidate.

We say that formula_19 is &quot;manipulable&quot; if and only if there exists a profile formula_18 where some voter formula_21, by replacing her ballot formula_22 with another ballot formula_23, can get an outcome that she prefers (in the sense of formula_22).

We denote by formula_25 the image of formula_19, i.e. the set of &quot;possible outcomes&quot; for the election. For example, we say that formula_19 has at least three possible outcomes if and only if the cardinality of formula_25 is 3 or more.

We say that formula_19 is &quot;dictatorial&quot; if and only if there exists a voter formula_21 who is a &quot;dictator&quot;, in the sense that the winning alternative is always her most-liked one among the possible outcomes &quot;regardless of the preferences of other voters&quot;. If the dictator has several equally most-liked alternatives among the possible outcomes, then the winning alternative is simply one of them.

== Counterexamples and loopholes ==
A variety of &quot;counterexamples&quot; to the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem exist when the conditions of the theorem do not apply.

=== Cardinal voting ===
Consider a three-candidate election conducted by score voting. It is always optimal for a voter to give the best candidate the highest possible score, and the worst candidate the lowest possible score. Then, no matter which score the voter assigns to the middle candidate, it will always fall (non-strictly) between the first and last scores; this implies the voter&#x27;s score ballot will be weakly consistent with that voter&#x27;s honest ranking. However, the actual optimal score may depend on the other ballots cast, as indicated by Gibbard&#x27;s theorem.

=== Serial dictatorship ===
The &quot;serial dictatorship&quot; is defined as follows. If voter 1 has a unique most-liked candidate, then this candidate is elected. Otherwise, possible outcomes are restricted to the most-liked candidates, whereas the other candidates are eliminated. Then voter 2&#x27;s ballot is examined: if there is a unique best-liked candidate among the non-eliminated ones, then this candidate is elected. Otherwise, the list of possible outcomes is reduced again, etc. If there are still several non-eliminated candidates after all ballots have been examined, then an arbitrary tie-breaking rule is used.

This voting rule is not manipulable: a voter is always better off communicating his or her sincere preferences. It is also dictatorial, and its dictator is voter 1: the winning alternative is always that specific voter&#x27;s most-liked one or, if there are several most-liked alternatives, it is chosen among them.

=== Simple majority vote ===
If there are only 2 possible outcomes, a voting rule may be non-manipulable without being dictatorial. For example, it is the case of the simple majority vote: each voter assigns 1 point to her top alternative and 0 to the other, and the alternative with most points is declared the winner. (If both alternatives reach the same number of points, the tie is broken in an arbitrary but deterministic manner, e.g. outcome formula_1 wins.) This voting rule is not manipulable because a voter is always better off communicating his or her sincere preferences; and it is clearly not dictatorial. Many other rules are neither manipulable nor dictatorial: for example, assume that the alternative formula_1 wins if it gets two thirds of the votes, and formula_2 wins otherwise.

== Corollary ==
We now consider the case where by assumption, a voter cannot be indifferent between two candidates. We denote by formula_34 the set of strict total orders over formula_13 and we define a &quot;strict voting rule&quot; as a function formula_36. The definitions of &quot;possible outcomes&quot;, &quot;manipulable&quot;, &quot;dictatorial&quot; have natural adaptations to this framework.

For a strict voting rule, the converse of the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is true. Indeed, a strict voting rule is dictatorial if and only if it always selects the most-liked candidate of the dictator among the possible outcomes; in particular, it does not depend on the other voters&#x27; ballots. As a consequence, it is not manipulable: the dictator is perfectly defended by her sincere ballot, and the other voters have no impact on the outcome, hence they have no incentive to deviate from sincere voting. Thus, we obtain the following equivalence.

In the theorem, as well as in the corollary, it is not needed to assume that any alternative can be elected. It is only assumed that at least three of them can win, i.e. are &quot;possible outcomes&quot; of the voting rule. It is possible that some other alternatives can be elected in no circumstances: the theorem and the corollary still apply. However, the corollary is sometimes presented under a less general form: instead of assuming that the rule has at least three possible outcomes, it is sometimes assumed that formula_13 contains at least three elements and that the voting rule is &quot;onto&quot;, i.e. every alternative is a possible outcome. The assumption of being onto is sometimes even replaced with the assumption that the rule is &quot;unanimous&quot;, in the sense that if all voters prefer the same candidate, then she must be elected.

== Sketch of proof ==
The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem can be proved using Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem for social ranking functions. We give a sketch of proof in the simplified case where some voting rule formula_19 is assumed to be Pareto-efficient. 

It is possible to build a social ranking function formula_39, as follows: in order to decide whether formula_40, the formula_39 function creates new preferences in which formula_1 and formula_2 are moved to the top of all voters&#x27; preferences. Then, formula_39 examines whether formula_19 chooses formula_1 or formula_2.

It is possible to prove that, if formula_19 is non-manipulable and non-dictatorial, formula_39 satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives. Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem says that, when there are three or more alternatives, such a formula_39 function must be a dictatorship. Hence, such a voting rule formula_19 must also be a dictatorship.

Later authors have developed other variants of the proof.

==History==
The strategic aspect of voting is already noticed in 1876 by Charles Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, a pioneer in social choice theory. His quote (about a particular voting system) was made famous by Duncan Black:This principle of voting makes an election more of a game of skill than a real test of the wishes of the electors.During the 1950s, Robin Farquharson published influential articles on voting theory. In an article with Michael Dummett, he conjectures that deterministic voting rules with at least three outcomes are never straightforward tactical voting. This conjecture was later proven independently by Allan Gibbard and Mark Satterthwaite. In a 1973 article, Gibbard exploits Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem from 1951 to prove the result we now know as Gibbard&#x27;s theorem. Independently, Satterthwaite proved the same result in his PhD dissertation in 1973, then published it in a 1975 article. This proof is also based on Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem, but does not involve the more general version given by Gibbard&#x27;s theorem. 

== Related results ==
Gibbard&#x27;s theorem deals with processes of collective choice that may not be ordinal, i.e. where a voter&#x27;s action may not consist in communicating a preference order over the candidates. Gibbard&#x27;s 1978 theorem and Hylland&#x27;s theorem extend these results to non-deterministic mechanisms, i.e. where the outcome may not only depend on the ballots but may also involve a part of chance.

The Duggan–Schwartz theorem extend this result in another direction, by dealing with deterministic voting rules that choose multiple winners.

== Importance ==
The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is generally presented as a result about voting systems, but it can also be seen as an important result of mechanism design, which deals with a broader class of decision rules. Noam Nisan describes this relation:The GS theorem seems to quash any hope of designing incentive-compatible social-choice functions. The whole field of Mechanism Design attempts escaping from this impossibility result using various modifications in the model.The main idea of these &quot;escape routes&quot; is that they allow for a broader class of mechanisms than ranked voting, similarly to the escape routes from Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem.

<doc id="288233" wikidata="Q44860" url="?curid=288233" title="Model–view–controller">
<text>Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. These elements are:
* the [[model]], the internal representations of information
* the view, the interface that presents information to and accepts it from the user
* the controller, the software linking the two.

Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern.

==History==
One of the seminal insights in the early development of graphical user interfaces, MVC became one of the first approaches to describe and implement software constructs in terms of their responsibilities.

Trygve Reenskaug created MVC while working on Smalltalk-79 as a visiting scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the late 1970s. He wanted a pattern that could be used to structure any program where users interact with a large, convoluted data set. His design initially had four parts: Model, view, thing, and editor. After discussing it with the other Smalltalk developers, he and the rest of the group settled on model, view, and controller instead.

In their final design, a model represents some part of the program purely and intuitively. A view is a visual representation of a model, retrieving data from the model to display to the user and passing requests back and forth between the user and the model. A controller is an organizational part of the user interface that lays out and coordinates multiple Views on the screen, and which receives user input and sends the appropriate messages to its underlying Views. This design also includes an Editor as a specialized kind of controller used to modify a particular view, and which is created through that view.

Smalltalk-80 supports a version of MVC that evolved from this one. It provides abstract codice_1 and codice_2 classes as well as various concrete subclasses of each that represent different generic widgets. In this scheme, a codice_3 represents some way of displaying information to the user, and a codice_2 represents some way for the user to interact with a codice_1. A codice_1 is also coupled to a model object, but the structure of that object is left up to the application programmer. The Smalltalk-80 environment also includes an &quot;MVC Inspector&quot;, a development tool for viewing the structure of a given model, view, and controller side-by-side.

In 1988, an article in &quot;The Journal of Object Technology&quot; (JOT) by two ex-PARC employees presented MVC as a general &quot;programming paradigm and methodology&quot; for Smalltalk-80 developers. However, their scheme differed from both Reenskaug et al.&#x27;s and that presented by the Smalltalk-80 reference books. They defined a view as covering any graphical concern, with a controller being a more abstract, generally invisible object that receives user input and interacts with one or many views and only one model.

The MVC pattern subsequently evolved, giving rise to variants such as hierarchical model–view–controller (HMVC), model–view–adapter (MVA), model–view–presenter (MVP), model–view–viewmodel (MVVM), and others that adapted MVC to different contexts.

The use of the MVC pattern in web applications grew after the introduction of NeXT&#x27;s WebObjects in 1996, which was originally written in Objective-C (that borrowed heavily from Smalltalk) and helped enforce MVC principles. Later, the MVC pattern became popular with Java developers when WebObjects was ported to Java. Later frameworks for Java, such as Spring (released in October 2002), continued the strong bond between Java and MVC.

In 2003, Martin Fowler published &quot;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&quot;, which presented MVC as a pattern where an &quot;input controller&quot; receives a request, sends the appropriate messages to a model object, takes a response from the model object, and passes the response to the appropriate view for display. This is close to the approach taken by the Ruby on Rails web application framework (August 2004), which has the client send requests to the server via an in-browser view, these requests are handled by a controller on the server, and the controller communicates with the appropriate model objects. The Django framework (July 2005, for Python) put forward a similar &quot;model template view&quot; (MTV) take on the pattern, in which a view retrieves data from models and passes it to templates for display. Both Rails and Django debuted with a strong emphasis on rapid deployment, which increased MVC&#x27;s popularity outside the traditional enterprise environment in which it has long been popular.

==Components==

===Model===

The central component of the pattern. It is the application&#x27;s dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. In Smalltalk-80, the design of a model type is left entirely to the programmer. With WebObjects, Rails, and Django, a model type typically represents a table in the application&#x27;s database. The model is essential for keeping the data organized and consistent. It ensures that the application&#x27;s data behaves according to the defined rules and logic.

===View===
Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

In Smalltalk-80, a view is just a visual representation of a model, and does not handle user input. With WebObjects, a view represents a complete user interface element such as a menu or button, and does receive input from the user. In both Smalltalk-80 and WebObjects, however, views are meant to be general-purpose and composable.

With Rails and Django, the role of the view is played by HTML templates, so in their scheme a view specifies an in-browser user interface rather than representing a user interface widget directly. (Django opts to call this kind of object a &quot;template&quot; in light of this.) This approach puts relatively less emphasis on small, composable views; a typical Rails view has a one-to-one relationship with a controller action.

Smalltalk-80 views communicate with both a model and a controller, whereas with WebObjects, a view talks only to a controller, which then talks to a model. With Rails and Django, a view/template is used by a controller/view when preparing a response to the client.

===Controller===
Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

A Smalltalk-80 controller handles user input events, such as button presses or mouse movement. At any given time, each controller has one associated view and model, although one model object may hear from many different controllers. Only one controller, the &quot;active&quot; controller, receives user input at any given time; a global window manager object is responsible for setting the current active controller. If user input prompts a change in a model, the controller will signal the model to change, but the model is then responsible for telling its views to update.

In WebObjects, the views handle user input, and the controller mediates between the views and the models. There may be only one controller per application, or one controller per window. Much of the application-specific logic is found in the controller.

In Rails, requests arriving at the on-server application from the client are sent to a &quot;router&quot;, which maps the request to a specific method of a specific controller. Within that method, the controller interacts with the request data and any relevant model objects and prepares a response using a view. Conventionally, each view has an associated controller; for example, if the application had a codice_7 view, it would typically have an associated codice_8 controller as well. However, developers are free to make other kinds of controllers if they wish.

Django calls the object playing this role a &quot;view&quot; instead of a controller. A Django view is a function that receives a web request and returns a web response. It may use templates to create the response.

==Interactions==
In addition to dividing the application into a model, a view and a controller component, the MVC design pattern defines the interactions between these three components :
* The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.
* The view renders presentation of the model in a particular format.
* The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.

As with other software patterns, MVC expresses the &quot;core of the solution&quot; to a problem while allowing it to be adapted for each system. Particular MVC designs can vary significantly from the traditional description here.

== Motivation ==
As Alan Kay wrote in 2003, the original motivation behind the MVC was to allow creation of a graphical interface for any object. That was outlined in detail in Richard Pawson&#x27;s book &quot;Naked Objects&quot;.

Trygve Reenskaug, originator of MVC at PARC, has written that &quot;MVC was conceived as a general solution to the problem of users controlling a large and complex data set.&quot;

In their 1991 guide &quot;Inside Smalltalk&quot;, Carleton University computer science professors Wilf LaLonde and John Pugh described the advantages of Smalltalk-80-style MVC as:
* independence of presentation and data, e.g. multiple views on one model simultaneously,
* composable presentation widgets, e.g. one view used as a subview of another,
* switchable input modes, by swapping one controller out for another during runtime, and
* independence of input and output processing, via the separate responsibilities of controllers and views.

==Use in web applications==
Although originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as a design for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several web frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These software frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server. Early MVC frameworks took a thin client approach that placed almost the entire model, view and controller logic on the server. In this approach, the client sends hyperlink requests or form submissions to the controller and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on the server. Later frameworks have allowed the MVC components to execute partly on the client, using Ajax to synchronize data.

<doc id="288237" wikidata="Q688064" url="?curid=288237" title="List of lakes of Switzerland">
<text>This article contains a sortable table listing all major lakes of Switzerland. The table includes all still water bodies located either entirely or partly in Switzerland, both natural and artificial, that have a surface area of at least , regardless of water volume, maximum depth or other metric. These lakes are ranked by area, the table including also the elevation above sea level and maximum depth. They are either natural (type N), natural but used as reservoirs (NR) or fully artificial (A).

Along with the mountains, lakes constitute a major natural feature of Switzerland, with over of shores within the country. Lakes, large and small, can be found in almost all cantons and provide an important source of water, leisure opportunities, as well as suitable habitat for fish-eating birds. The two most extensive, Lake Geneva and Lake Constance, are amongst the largest in Europe and mark the border of the Swiss Plateau, along with the Alps and the Jura Mountains. The largest wholly Swiss lake is Lake Neuchâtel. The remaining lakes over are Lake Maggiore and Lake Lucerne. In total 103 lakes exist that are more than in surface area, and a considerable number of smaller lakes. All these lakes are found in the four major river basins of Switzerland: Rhine, Rhone, Po and Danube, at almost all elevations below the permanent snow line.

== Distribution ==
There are several thousand lakes in Switzerland, with estimations up to 7000, although those include very small water bodies, traditionally referred to as &quot;lakes&quot;. On this list, only the 103 largest lakes, which are over 30 hectares in area, are included. Among these, 58 are over 1.0 km2, 17 are over 10 km2, and just five are over 100 km2 in area. Of these lakes, 37 are natural, 21 are natural, but are used as reservoirs, and 45 are manmade reservoirs. These 103 lakes are shared among 21 cantons, out of the 26. Some of these lakes are also shared with neighboring France, Germany, Austria, and Italy (for simplicity purposes, only the total area of the lake is indicated). Four of the cantons (Grisons, Bern, Valais, and Ticino) have more than 10 of the lakes, apiece, and just over one-half of the cantons (14) have one or more lakes of over 100 km2 in area. Most of these lakes are either below 800 metres above sea level (mostly natural lakes), or above 1600 metres (mostly manmade lakes). A large majority of the lakes, 66, are located in the Rhine basin (partly via the Aare River); 17 in the Rhone basin (partly via the Doubs River); 14 in the Po River basin (mostly via the Ticino River); and six are in the Danube River basin (all via the Inn River).

<doc id="288238" wikidata="Q1143209" url="?curid=288238" title="27th G8 summit">
<text>The 27th G8 summit was held in Genoa, Italy, on 19–22 July 2001 and is remembered as a highpoint of the worldwide anti-globalization movement as well as for human rights violations against demonstrators.

==Overview==
The Group of Seven (G7) was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada starting in 1976. The G8, meeting for the first time in 1997, was formed with the addition of Russia. In addition, the President of the European Commission has been formally included in summits since 1981. The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France&#x27;s president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and West Germany&#x27;s chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.

The G8 summits during the 21st-century have inspired widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two-or three-day event becomes more than the sum of its parts, elevating the participants, the issues, and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.

==Leaders at the summit==
The 27th G8 summit was the first summit for Japanese Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi and US President George W. Bush.

===Participants===
These summit participants were the current &quot;core members&quot; of the international forum:


==Priorities==
Traditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi-national civil servants in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign.

==Issues==
The summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.

The overall theme of the summit was ways to reduce poverty. Topics discussed at the meeting included an evaluation of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative which involved debt forgiveness to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, the Global Health Fund, the global digital divide, the environment, and food security. Although the main summit was from 20 to 22 July, the summit was preceded by a meeting of the G8 foreign ministers on the 18th and 19th.

The summit was overshadowed by riots in the city after a crackdown by police targeting anti-globalisation groups and the death of 23-year-old Carlo Giuliani, leading some to talk of a deliberately followed strategy of tension.

Before the summit, significant controversies and ridicule among local people and media focused on the security plans (such as fences going through streets and inside houses) and image provisions (such as the prohibition to dry up the laundry).

==Citizens&#x27; responses and authorities&#x27; counter-responses==
=== Protests ===
The Genoa G8 Summit protest, 19 to 22 July 2001, was a dramatic protest, drawing an estimated 200,000 demonstrators. Dozens were hospitalized following clashes with police and night raids by security forces on two schools housing activists and independent journalists. People taken into custody after the raids have alleged severe abuse at the hands of police.

Demonstrators accused the police of brutality and denying them their right to non-violent protest. They believe that G8 summits are non-legitimate attempts by eight of the world&#x27;s most powerful governments to set the rules for the planet at large. Police and many politicians argued that attempting to blockade a meeting is in itself a violent event and an attempt to impede the workings of democratically elected governments..

The G8 meeting was held inside a &quot;Red Zone&quot; in the center of town that had been declared off-limits for non-residents and surrounded by a barricade, leaving protesters no chance to communicate with summit delegates. Fears of a terrorist attack at the time had also led to an air exclusion zone around the city, as well as the stationing of anti-aircraft missiles. Only one activist, Valérie Vie, secretary of a French branch of ATTAC, managed to publicly breach the Red Zone barrier, but was immediately arrested by police agents. There were also several border riots ahead of the summit, as police attempted to prevent suspected activists from entering Italy. The Italian government suspended freedom of movement entitled by the Schengen Treaty for the duration of the G8 summit, in order to monitor the movement of the many protesters arriving from across the European Union.

===Injuries and deaths===
Many demonstrators were injured and dozens more arrested over the course of the event. Most of those 329 arrested were charged with criminal conspiracy to commit destruction; but they were in most part released shortly thereafter because judges declared the charges invalid. Police continued to raid social centers, media centers, union buildings and legal offices across Italy after the summit as part of ongoing investigations. Over 400 protesters and about 100 among security forces were injured during the clashes.

On 20 July a 23-year-old activist Carlo Giuliani of Genoa, was shot dead by Mario Placanica, a Carabiniere, during clashes with police. Images show Giuliani picking up a fire extinguisher from the ground and approaching the carabinieri&#x27;s vehicle with it before he was shot and then run over twice by the Land Rover. Placanica was acquitted from any wrongdoing, as judges determined he fired in self-defence and to the sky but a flying stone deflected the bullet and killed Giuliani. The idea that the stone killed Giuliani has been however questioned on the basis of a security video and the stone being covered in blood while the balaclava through which it should have wounded Giuliani was intact. Videos and photos show that the stone was dipped in blood and placed beside Giuliani&#x27;s head minutes after his death suggesting an attempt to conceal the police responsibility. Later tribunals including the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that Giuliani was killed directly by the bullet. 

Activist Susanne Bendotti was struck by a vehicle and killed while attempting to cross the French-Italian border at Ventimiglia to get to the Genoa demonstration.

===Charges===
In December 2007, 25 demonstrators were condemned for property damage and looting.
Numerous police officers and local and national officials have been ordered to stand trial in connection with the event. In one trial, 28 police officials are standing trial on charges related to the two night raids, charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, use of excessive force and planting evidence. In other proceedings, 45 state officials, including prison guards, police and medics, are being tried for abusing detainees in their custody at Bolzaneto who were arrested during the raid. Detainees reported being spat at, verbally and physically humiliated, and threatened with rape.

Police conducted nighttime raids upon centers housing protesters and campsites, most notably the attacks on the Diaz-Pascoli and Diaz-Pertini schools shortly after midnight on 21 July. These were being used as sleeping quarters, and had also been set up as centers for those providing media, medical, and legal support work. Police baton attacks left three activists, including British journalist Mark Covell, in comas. At least one person has suffered brain damage, while another had both jaws and fourteen teeth broken. In total, over 60 were severely injured and a parliamentary inquiry was launched. It concluded no wrongdoing on the part of police.

Ninety-three people were arrested during the raids. In May 2003 Judge Anna Ivaldi concluded that they had put up no resistance whatsoever to the police and all charges were dropped against them. During the inquiry, Pietro Troiani, the deputy police chief in Genoa, admitted to being involved in the planting of Molotov cocktails in order to justify the Diaz School raids, as well as faking the stabbing of a police officer to frame activists.

In 2005, twenty-nine police officers were indicted for grievous bodily harm, planting evidence and wrongful arrest during a night-time raid on the Diaz School. The Molotov cocktails were reported in January 2007, during the trial of the policemen, to have disappeared.

In 2007, Romano Prodi&#x27;s left-wing &quot;L&#x27;Unione&quot; coalition voted to create a Parliamentary Commission on the Genoa events but this commission was refused by Senate&#x27;s vote.

On 14 July, 13 Italian Carabineri, GOMPI Mobile and prison police were convicted for abuse of authority, abuse of office and uniform. Other charges include abuse and negligence. Two medical staff were also convicted. None will go to jail due to statute of limitations.

On 13 November an Italian court cleared 16 of the most senior police officers of any wrongdoing in the incidents of the 2001 G8 summit. Thirteen police officers were convicted of their various crimes during the Diaz raid including Vincenzo Canterini (four years), the commander of the 7th Mobile unit. None will go to jail due to statute of limitations.

However, on appeal in 2010, many of the findings were overturned, and several more senior police officers received prison sentences and disqualifications from public office. Twenty-five of the 27 original defendants were finally convicted. In statements during the trial, the prosecution cited &quot;the terrible injuries inflicted on defenceless people, the premeditation, the covered faces, the falsification of statements by the 93 anti-globalisation protesters, the lies about their alleged resistance [to arrest].&quot;

The Italian government was later brought to trial in the European Court of Human Rights. In April 2017 the case for Bolzaneto station was dismissed as Italy and victims made an off-court refunding deal with the Italian government paying €45,000 per victim and acknowledging the extreme use of violence. In October 2017, the European Court issued two sentences against Italy, the first time declaring that torture was clearly used against the contestants on the Diaz school case, and the second time inflicting a penal fee to Italy for lacking a Torture Law in its penal code, meaning that the Genoa events could not be properly sentenced at the time as unmotivated violence leading to torture.

==Business opportunity==
For some, the G8 summit became a profit-generating event; as for example, the official &quot;G8 Summit&quot; magazines which have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998. Capitalizing on the publicity which attended the Genoa summit, the Commercial Office of the Italian embassies and the consulates joined others in promoting investment in southern Italy.

<text>A union station, union terminal, joint station, or joint-use station is a railway station at which the tracks and facilities are shared by two or more separate railway companies, allowing passengers to connect conveniently between them. The term &#x27;union station&#x27; is used in North America and &#x27;joint station&#x27; is used in Europe.

In the U.S., union stations are typically used by all the passenger trains serving a city, although exceptions exist. For example, in Chicago, the Illinois Central and Chicago &amp; North Western depots coexisted with Union Station, and although most Metra commuter trains (and all Amtrak services) continue to use Union Station today, some lines depart from other terminals, such as Ogilvie Transportation Center, LaSalle Street Station, or Millennium Station.

The busiest station to be named &quot;Union Station&quot; is Toronto Union Station, which serves over 72 million passengers annually. The first union station building was Columbus Union Station in 1851, though Indianapolis Union Station, planned in 1848 and built in 1853, had more elements of a cooperative union station.

== Europe ==
In most countries in Europe, throughout much of the 20th century, railways have been owned and operated by state enterprises. Where only one railway company exists, there is no need for a &quot;joint station&quot;. However, before nationalisation many companies existed and sometimes they had &quot;joint stations&quot;. In some cases this persists today. &quot;Joint stations&quot; are often found near borders where two state-owned railway companies meet.

=== Austria, Germany, and Switzerland ===
In German-speaking countries, the similar term &quot;Gemeinschaftsbahnhof&quot; is used in administrative language only; it applies for stations with joint facilities as well as for stations with side-by-side facilities; some border stations also fall under that term. The general public often call them &quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot; (main station), but this is a misnomer, as stations administratively classified as &quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot; need not be served by multiple operators.

Many major stations in Germany are served by various trains operated by incumbent Deutsche Bahn and other railways that operate local passenger trains, sometimes also by railway companies of neighbor states that operate trans-border connections; a special term like union station is usually not used. The stations are generally owned and operated by DB Station&amp;Service.

As another example, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof, the main station of Leipzig, originally consisted of side-by-side parts that were used by the Prussian and Saxonian Railways until the federal Deutsche Reichsbahn was founded in 1920, but were essentially two stations operated separately by the two neighbors.

=== Bohemia and Moravia ===
In Bohemia (part of the territory of the Czech Republic today) some stations were called the &quot;společné nádraží&quot; (the common station) before the state took over the private railway companies. &quot;Praha-Smíchov společné nádraží&quot; is to this day the functional name of the second station built in 1872 by the same investor near the first station Smíchov of the Pražská západní dráha (Prague Western Railroad). The new station served as the main marshalling yard of Prague. Three routes flowed into it: Pražská spojovací dráha (the Prague Connecting Railroad, 1872), the extension of Buštěhradská dráha from Hostivice (1872) and Pražsko-duchcovská dráha (the Railroad Prague – Duchcov, 1873). Nowadays the &quot;společné nádraží&quot; forms an unremarkable separate platform of the station Praha-Smíchov, known in timetables as &quot;Praha-Smíchov severní nástupiště&quot; (the northern platform).

&quot;Společné nádraží&quot; was built 1845–1848 at Brno.

&quot;Společné nádraží&quot; was at Železná Ruda as well, station at border Bavaria – Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was in operation 1878–1938.

Nowadays the largest stations are called &quot;hlavní nádraží&quot; (main station).

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, before the railways were nationalised in 1948, stations shared by multiple operators were referred to as &quot;joint stations&quot;, but is not as familiar or as well understood as &quot;union station&quot; is in the United States.

== Japan ==

In Japan, such a railway station is referred to as a . At railway junctions where two or more railway lines operated by different companies meet, the companies may reach an agreement to entrust one of the companies to manage the entire station, resulting in the establishment of a joint-use station. In contrast, an in Japan is where different sections of a station are managed by different companies at the same time.

Many joint-use stations in Japan are located at or near the boundary of two railway lines operated by different companies that operate through services to each other, such as Meinohama Station in Fukuoka, where JR Kyushu&#x27;s Chikuhi Line meets the Fukuoka City Subway&#x27;s Kūkō Line. Joint-use stations may also be built at places where railway lines operated by different companies share the same tracks, as is the case from Meguro Station to Shirokane-Takanawa Station in Tokyo, which is shared between the Tokyo Metro Namboku Line and the Toei Mita Line.

Depending on the extent of agreements reached by the different operators, joint-use stations may feature a unified paid area, where ticket gates are shared between all operators serving the station, or separate paid areas, where different operators have individual paid areas, thus requiring commuters to exit a paid area and then enter another to transfer between different operators.

== North America ==

In North America, a union station is usually owned by a separate corporation whose shares are owned by the different railways which use it, so that the costs and benefits of its operations are shared proportionately among them. This contrasts with the system of &quot;trackage rights&quot; or &quot;running rights&quot;, where one railway company owns a line or facility, but allows another company to share it under a contractual agreement. However, the company that owns the union station and associated trackage does assign trackage rights to the railroads that use it. Many of the jointly owned stations were built by terminal railroads. Examples include the Ogden Union Railway &amp; Depot Company, jointly owned by Southern Pacific and Union Pacific to manage the Ogden Union Station in Ogden, Utah; and the Denver Terminal Railway Company, representing the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western, Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy, Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, Colorado &amp; Southern and Chicago Rock Island &amp; Pacific and the Union Pacific railways, which managed the station in Denver, Colorado.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland (SMCM) is a public liberal arts college in St. Mary&#x27;s City, Maryland. Established in 1840, St. Mary&#x27;s College is an honors college that claims to &quot;offer an experience similar to that of an elite liberal arts college&quot;. With about 1,600 enrolled students, the institution offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 21 disciplines, as well as a master&#x27;s program and certification programs.
The college shares much of its campus with Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City, the site of Maryland&#x27;s first colony and capital. It is also the site of the fourth colony in British North America.
The Historical Archaeology Field School is jointly operated by St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland and Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City. The campus and the rest of St. Mary&#x27;s City combined are considered to be one of the premier archaeological sites in the United States.

==History==

St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland is located on the original site of Maryland&#x27;s first colony, St. Mary&#x27;s City, which was also the first capital of Maryland and is considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in America.

Colonial St. Mary&#x27;s City was actually only a town and at its peak had between 500 and 600 residents. However, as the colony quickly expanded and settlements spread throughout the Eastern part of what is now Maryland, the town remained the capital and representatives would travel from all over the colony to participate in the Maryland General Assembly, the colony&#x27;s first legislative body.

The Colony was founded under a mandate by the colonial proprietor, Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore of England, that the new settlers engage in religious tolerance of each other. The first settlers were both Protestant and Catholic during a time of persecution of Catholics. This mandate was unprecedented at the time, as England had been wracked by religious conflict for centuries.

The college&#x27;s name, St. Mary&#x27;s, commemorates Maryland&#x27;s first colony, &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s City&quot;, which once stood where the college stands now. It has been coeducational since 1949.

==Academics==
St. Mary&#x27;s College offers 21 majors (with 5 additional in development), 29 minors, seven pre-professional programs and it has a master&#x27;s program in education. It is a public honors college, one of only two such colleges in the United States. As such, it maintains a core honors-level curriculum that all of its students, regardless of major, must complete.

The college underwent its first ever large-scale program review or program prioritization process in February 2021, resulting in the discontinuation of several majors and minors.

It has an 81% overall graduation rate (including longer than four years). The college has a 70% four-year graduation rate, the highest of any public institution in Maryland and third highest in the United States among public colleges. 69% of students pursue dual concurrent degrees or dual minors, which may take longer than four years, in some cases. 10% of students transfer from St. Mary&#x27;s College to other institutions and 83% of students enroll for a second year.

79% of students are receiving financial aid, with 66% of students receiving grants or scholarships.

The school is a member of Phi Beta Kappa society.

===Tuition===
According to the Maryland Higher Education Commission, St. Mary&#x27;s College, despite being a public institution, competes mostly with elite private colleges. The commission reported in 2014 that the cost of obtaining a degree at St. Mary&#x27;s College is $30,000 less when compared to the average costs of the elite private colleges that it competes with.

==Campus==
==Accreditation and charter==

The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

Although it is a state-operated institution, St. Mary&#x27;s is independent of the University System of Maryland as it opted out of the system in 1992. However, in early 2006, St. Mary&#x27;s College joined the University of Maryland Academic Telecommunications System (UMATS), which interconnects the University System of Maryland with several other networks, including the Internet and Internet2 networks.

==Administration==
St. Mary&#x27;s College&#x27;s president, Tuajuanda Jordan, was appointed in 2014. She is the former dean of two other colleges and holds a PhD in biochemistry. She is the first black woman to become the president of St. Mary&#x27;s College.

The school has 150 full-time faculty, 14 of whom are current Fulbright scholars (the college faculty has earned 30 Fulbright research awards in the past 20 years). There is a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio, one of the lowest in the nation.

==Programs==

===Overseas programs===
Approximately 46% of St. Mary&#x27;s College students study abroad, half of them for a full semester or more. The Institute of International Education has recognized St. Mary&#x27;s College as being 17th in the nation (public and private schools combined) for the percentage of its undergraduate students who study abroad for at least one semester.

===Music===
The Fiske Guide to Colleges ranked St. Mary&#x27;s College as one of the best small universities/colleges in the U.S. for music study since 2003, and was the only public liberal arts college listed. St. Mary&#x27;s College removed the music major in 2021, however, and added a new Performing Arts major.

===Fulbright program===

St. Mary&#x27;s College has had many students and faculty win Fulbright awards. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the college had the second highest number of student Fulbright winners of any public liberal arts college in the nation.

In the 2011–2012 academic year, the college had the third highest number of faculty Fulbright winners in the United States among public and private baccalaureate colleges (undergraduate colleges).

==Historical studies==
Since 1840, the school has been charged by the state in various capacities in researching, interpreting and memorializing Maryland history at the site of Maryland&#x27;s first colony and capitol, St. Mary&#x27;s City, Maryland, which is also where the college is located.

===Historical Archaeology Field School===

In this capacity St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, in partnership with Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City, also runs the Historical Archaeology Field School which is an internationally recognized institution.

<doc id="288253" wikidata="Q939299" url="?curid=288253" title="Sodipodi">
<text>Sodipodi is a free and open-source vector graphics editor, superseded since 2003 by Inkscape, an independent Sodipodi fork.

==Development==
Sodipodi started as a fork of &quot;Gill&quot; (abbreviated from &quot;GNOME&quot; and &quot;illustration&quot;), a vector-graphics program written by Raph Levien. The main author is , a son of the famous Estonian writer and poet Jaan Kaplinski, and later there were several other people who also contributed to the project.

Sodipodi means &quot;mish mash&quot; or &quot;hodgepodge&quot; in Estonian child-speak.

The primary design goal of Sodipodi was to produce a usable vector graphics editor, and a drawing tool for artists. Although it used SVG as its native file format (including some extensions to hold metadata), it was not intended to be a full implementation of the SVG standard. Sodipodi imports and exports plain SVG data, and can also export raster graphics in PNG format. The user interface of Sodipodi is a Controlled Single Document Interface (CSDI) similar to GIMP.

Sodipodi was developed for Linux and Microsoft Windows. The last stable version is codice_1 released on February 11th 2004. Released under the GNU General Public License, Sodipodi is free software.

Even though there are no new releases since 2004, Lauris Kaplinski continued development of Sodipodi for years in a minor way, mostly contributing code refactoring and bug fixes. The latest commit for the codice_2 branch was pushed on September 12th 2023.

==Derivatives==
Sodipodi started a collection of SVG clip art containing symbols and flags from around the world. This work helped inspire the Open Clip Art Library.

In 2003 a group of Sodipodi developers decided to improve Sodipodi with different goals, including redesigning the interface and closer compliance with the SVG standard. The initial idea was to create a separate Sodipodi Hydra (codice_3) branch, planned to be merged into codice_2, but as it was difficult to make such a merge developers later decided to create an independent fork and named it Inkscape.

<text>Vitaliano Brancati (; 24 July 1907 – 25 September 1954) was an Italian novelist, dramatist, poet and screenwriter.

==Biography==
Born in Pachino, Syracuse, Brancati studied in Catania, where he graduated in letters and where he spent most of his life. While he started writing at a young age and at 25 years old he was already the author of six books, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and which were later rejected by the same Brancati, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories &quot;In search of a cause&quot;. Brancati got his first and probably major success in 1941, with the novel &quot;Don Giovanni in Sicilia&quot;, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament.

In 1944 he wrote the novel &quot;Gli anni perduti&quot; (&quot;The Lost Years&quot;), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s megalomania, and in 1946 &quot;Vecchio con gli stivali&quot; (&quot;Old Man in Boots&quot;), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of the Italian fascism which won the Vendemmia Award and which was adapted into a successful film, &quot;Difficult Years&quot; by Luigi Zampa. In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with one another well-known novel, &quot;Il bell&#x27;Antonio&quot; (&quot;The Handsome Antonio&quot;). He was one of the contributors of a cultural magazine, &quot;Omnibus&quot;.

He died in a clinic in Turin after a major surgery. He was married to actress Anna Proclemer and the couple had a daughter together.

<text>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is an Australian Government agency that is responsible for scientific research and its commercial and industrial applications.

CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world. From its headquarters in Canberra, CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States, employing about 5,500 people.

Federally funded scientific research in Australia began in 1916 with the creation of the Advisory Council of Science and Industry. However, the council struggled due to insufficient funding. In 1926, research efforts were revitalised with the establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding. CSIR grew rapidly, achieving significant early successes. In 1949, legislative changes led to the renaming of the organisation as Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy, essential components of the early Wi-Fi technology, development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote, the invention of the insect repellent Aerogard and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia, such as the introduction of myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus for the control of rabbit populations.

== Structure ==
CSIRO is governed by a board appointed by the Australian Government, currently chaired by Kathryn Fagg. There are eight directors inclusive of the chief executive, presently Doug Hilton, who are responsible for management of the organisation.

== Research and focus areas ==
CSIRO is structured into Research Business Units, National Facilities and Collections, and Services.

=== Research Business Units ===

As at 2023, CSIRO&#x27;s research areas are identified as &quot;Impact science&quot; and organised into the following Business Units:
* Agriculture and Food
* Health and Biosecurity
*Data61
* Energy
* Manufacturing
* Mineral Resources and
* Environment (being the amalgamation of the former Land and Water and Oceans &amp; Atmosphere BUs)

===National facilities and collections===
====National facilities====
CSIRO manages national research facilities and scientific infrastructure on behalf of the nation to assist with the delivery of research. The national facilities and specialised laboratories are available to both international and Australian users from industry and research. As at 2019, the following National Facilities are listed:
* Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP)
* Australia Telescope National Facility – radio telescopes included in the Facility include the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Parkes Observatory, Mopra Observatory and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder 
* Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex
* Energy Centre and National Solar Energy Centre
* Marine National Facility (R.V. &quot;Investigator&quot;)
* New Norcia ground station
* NovaSAR-1 satellite
* Pawsey Supercomputing Centre

====Collections====
CSIRO manages a number of collections of animal and plant specimens that contribute to national and international biological knowledge. The National Collections contribute to taxonomic, genetic, agricultural and ecological research. As at 2019, CSIRO&#x27;s Collections are listed as the following:
* Australian National Algae Culture Collection
* The Atlas of Living Australia
* Australian Tree Seed Centre
* Australian National Fish Collection
* Australian National Insect Collection
* Australian National Herbarium
* Australian National Soil Archive (managed through A&amp;F)
* Australian National Wildlife Collection
* Cape Grim Air Archive

=== Services ===

In 2019, CSIRO Services are itemised as follows:
* Materials and infrastructure services
* Agricultural and environmental analysis
* Environmental services
* Biological, food and medical science services
* Australian Animal Health Laboratory services

Other services are noted as including education, publishing, infrastructure technologies, Small and Medium Enterprise engagement and CSIRO Futures.

== History ==
===Evolution of the organisation===
A precursor to CSIRO, the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, was established in 1916 on the initiative of prime minister Billy Hughes. However, the advisory council struggled with insufficient funding during the First World War. In 1920 the council was renamed the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and was led by George Handley Knibbs (1921–26), but continued to struggle financially.

Implementing the 1923 Imperial Conference&#x27;s call for colonies to broaden their economic base, in 1926 the Australian Parliament modified the principal Act for national scientific research (the &quot;Institute of Science and Industry Act 1920&quot;) by passing &quot;The Science and Industry Research Act 1926&quot;. The same conference led to the creation of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in New Zealand.

The new Act replaced the institute with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). With encouragement from prime minister Stanley Bruce, strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding, CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. The council was structured to represent the federal structure of government in Australia, and had state-level committees and a central council. In addition to an improved structure, CSIR benefited from strong bureaucratic management under George Julius, David Rivett, and Arnold Richardson. Research focused on primary and secondary industries. Early in its existence, CSIR established divisions studying animal health and animal nutrition. After the Great Depression, research was extended into manufacturing and other secondary industries.

In 1949 the Act was changed again, and the entity name amended to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The amendment enlarged and reconstituted the organisation and its administrative structure. Under Ian Clunies Ross as chairman, CSIRO pursued new areas such as radio astronomy and industrial chemistry. CSIRO still operates under the provisions of the 1949 Act in a wide range of scientific inquiry.

Participation by women in CSIRO research was severely limited by the Australian government policy, in place until 1966, forcing women public servants out of their jobs when they married. Even unmarried women were considered a poor investment because they might eventually marry. Single women such as Helen Newton Turner nevertheless made major contributions.

Since 1949, CSIRO has expanded its activities to almost every field of primary, secondary and tertiary industry, including the environment, human nutrition, conservation, urban and rural planning, and water. It works with leading organisations around the world and maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States of America, employing about 5500 people.

In 2016 CSIRO launched its &quot;Innovation Catalyst&quot; Strategy which focused on solving Australia&#x27;s Innovation Dilemma, it generated $10,000,000,000 more social, economic, and environmental value than any prior strategy, and trained 3,500 researchers from across 32 Universities on the process of innovation, and became the first Australian entity of any kind to reach the Thomson Reuters Global Top 25 Innovators.

===Historic research===
CSIRO had a pioneering role in the scientific discovery of the universe through radio &quot;eyes&quot;. A team led by Paul Wild built and operated (from 1948) the world&#x27;s first solar radiospectrograph, and from 1967 the radioheliograph at Culgoora in New South Wales. For three decades, the Division of Radiophysics had a world-leading role in solar research, attracting prominent solar physicists from around the world.

CSIRO owned the first computer in Australia, CSIRAC, built as part of a project began in the Sydney Radiophysics Laboratory in 1947. The CSIR Mk 1 ran its first program in 1949, the fifth electronic computer in the world. It was over 1,000 times faster than the mechanical calculators available at the time. It was decommissioned in 1955 and recommissioned in Melbourne as CSIRAC in 1956 as a general purpose computing machine used by over 700 projects until 1964. The CSIRAC is the only surviving first-generation computer in the world.

Between 1965 and 1985, George Bornemissza of CSIRO&#x27;s Division of Entomology founded and led the Australian Dung Beetle Project. Bornemissza, upon settling in Australia from Hungary in 1951, noticed that the pastureland was covered in dry cattle dung pads which did not seem to be recycled into the soil and caused areas of rank pasture which were unpalatable to the cattle. He proposed that the reason for this was that native Australian dung beetles, which had co-evolved alongside the marsupials (which produce dung very different in its composition from cattle), were not adapted to utilise cattle dung for their nutrition and breeding since cattle had only relatively recently been introduced to the continent in the 1880s. The Australian Dung Beetle Project sought, therefore, to introduce species of dung beetle from South Africa and Europe (which had co-evolved alongside bovids) in order to improve the fertility and quality of cattle pastures. Twenty-three species were successfully introduced throughout the duration of the project and also had the effect of reducing the pestilent bush fly population by 90%.

===Domain name===
CSIRO was the first Australian organisation to start using the Internet and was able to register the second-level domain csiro.au (as opposed to csiro.org.au or csiro.com.au). Guidelines were introduced in 1996 to regulate the use of the .au domain.

==Governance and management==
When CSIR was formed in 1926, it was led initially by an executive committee of three people, two of whom were designated as the chairman and the chief executive. Since then the roles and responsibilities of the chair and chief executive have changed many times. From 1927 to 1986 the head of CSIR (and from 1949, CSIRO) was the chairman, who was responsible for the management of the organisation, supported by the chief executive. From 1 July 1959 to 4 December 1986 CSIRO had no chief executive; the chairman undertook both functions.

In 1986, when the Australian Government changed the structure of CSIRO to include a board of non-executive members plus the chief executive to lead CSIRO, the roles changed. The chief executive is now responsible for management of the organisation in accordance with the strategy, plans and policies approved by the CSIRO Board which, led by the chair of the board, is responsible to the Australian Government for the overall strategy, governance and performance of CSIRO.

As with its governance structure, the priorities and structure of CSIRO, and the teams and facilities that implement its research, have changed as Australia&#x27;s scientific challenges have evolved.

Numerous CSIRO scientists have gone onto distinguished careers in the university sector. Several have been appointed to the role of Vice-Chancellor/President. They include: Sir George Currie (UNZ 1952–62, Western Australia 1945–52), Paul Wellings CBE (Wollongong 2012–21, Lancaster 2002–12), Michael Barber AO (Flinders 2008–14), Mark Smith CBE (Southampton 2019–ff, Lancaster 2012–19), Annabelle Duncan (UNE 2014–19), Attila Brungs (UNSW 2021–ff, UTS 2014–21), Alex Zelinsky AO (Newcastle (2018–ff), Andrew Parfitt (UTS 2021–ff), Chris Moran (UNE 2023–ff).

==Controversies==
===Total Wellbeing Diet===
In 2005 the CSIRO gained worldwide attention, including some criticism, for promoting a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet of their own creation called &quot;Total Wellbeing Diet&quot;. The CSIRO published the diet in a book which sold over half a million copies in Australia and over 100,000 overseas. The diet was criticised in an editorial by &quot;Nature&quot; for giving scientific credence to a &quot;fashionable&quot; diet sponsored by meat and dairy industries.

===802.11 patent===
In the early 1990s, CSIRO radio astronomy scientists John O&#x27;Sullivan, Graham Daniels, Terence Percival, Diethelm Ostry and John Deane undertook research directed to finding a way to make wireless networks work as fast as wired networks within confined spaces such as office buildings. The technique they developed, involving a particular combination of forward error correction, frequency-domain interleaving, and multi-carrier modulation, became the subject of , which was granted on 23 January 1996.

In 1997 Macquarie University professor David Skellern and his colleague Neil Weste established the company Radiata, Inc., which took a nonexclusive licence to the CSIRO patent for the purpose of developing commercially viable integrated circuit devices implementing the patented technology.

During this period, the IEEE 802.11 Working Group was developing the 802.11a wireless LAN standard. CSIRO did not participate directly in the standards process, however David Skellern was an active participant as secretary of the Working Group, and representative of Radiata. In 1998 it became apparent that the CSIRO patent would be pertinent to the standard. In response to a request from Victor Hayes of Lucent Technologies, who was chair of the 802.11 Working Group, CSIRO confirmed its commitment to make non-exclusive licenses available to implementers of the standard on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

In 1999, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Broadcom Corporation each invested A$4 million in Radiata, representing an 11% stake for each investor and valuing the company at around A$36 million. In September 2000, Radiata demonstrated a chip set complying with the recently finalised IEEE 802.11a Wi-Fi standard, and capable of handling transmission rates of up to 54 Mbit/s, at a major international exhibition.

In November 2000, Cisco acquired Radiata in exchange for US$295 million in Cisco common stock with the intention of incorporating the Radiata Baseband Processor and Radio chips into its Aironet family of wireless LAN products. Cisco subsequently took a large write-down on the Radiata acquisition, following the 2001 telecoms crash, and in 2004 it shut down its internal development of wireless chipsets based on the Radiata technology in order to focus on software development and emerging new technologies.

Controversy over the CSIRO patent arose in 2006 after the organisation won an injunction against Buffalo Technology in an infringement suit filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas. The injunction was subsequently suspended on appeal, with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finding that the judge in Texas should have allowed a trial to proceed on Buffalo&#x27;s challenge to the validity of the CSIRO patent. In 2007, CSIRO declined to provide an assurance to the IEEE that it would not sue companies which refused to take a license for use in 802.11n-compliant devices, while at the same time continuing to defend legal challenges to the validity of the patent brought by Intel, Dell, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Netgear.

In April 2009, Hewlett-Packard broke ranks with the rest of the industry becoming the first to reach a settlement of its dispute with CSIRO. This agreement was followed quickly by settlements with Microsoft, Fujitsu and Asus and then Dell, Intel, Nintendo, Toshiba, Netgear, Buffalo, D-Link, Belkin, SMC, Accton, and 3Com.

The controversy grew after CSIRO sued US carriers AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile in 2010, with the organisation being accused of being &quot;Australia&#x27;s biggest patent troll&quot;, a wrathful &quot;patent bully&quot;, and of imposing a &quot;WiFi tax&quot; on American innovation.

Further fuel was added to the controversy after a settlement with the carriers, worth around $229 million, was announced in March 2012. Encouraged in part by an announcement by the Australian Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans, an article in Ars Technica portrayed CSIRO as a shadowy organisation responsible for US consumers being compelled to make &quot;a multimillion dollar donation&quot; on the basis of a questionable patent claiming &quot;decades old&quot; technology. The resulting debate became so heated that the author was compelled to follow up with a defence of the original article. An alternative view was also published on The Register, challenging a number of the assertions made in the Ars Technica piece.

Total income to CSIRO from the patent is currently estimated at nearly $430 million. On 14 June 2012, the CSIRO inventors received the European Patent Office (EPO) European Inventor Award (EIA), in the category of &quot;Non-European Countries&quot;.

===Genetically modified wheat trials===
On 14 July 2011, Greenpeace activists vandalised a crop of GM wheat, circumventing the scientific trials being undertaken. Greenpeace was forced to pay reparations to CSIRO of $280,000 for the criminal damage, and were accused by the sentencing judge, Justice Hilary Penfold, of cynically using junior members of the organisation with good standing to avoid custodial sentences, while the offenders were given 9-month suspended sentences.

Following the attack Greenpeace criticised CSIRO for a close relationship with industry that had led to an increase in genetically modified crops, even though a core aim of CSIRO is Cooperative Research &quot;working hand in hand with industry [to] build partnerships and engage with industry to generate impact&quot;.

===Climate change censorship: Clive Spash ===
On 25 November 2009, a debate was held in the Australian Senate concerning the alleged involvement of the CSIRO and the Labor government in censorship. The debate was called for by opposition parties after evidence came to light that a paper critical of carbon emissions trading was being suppressed. At the time, the Labor government was trying to get such a scheme through the Senate. After the debate, the Science Minister, Kim Carr, was forced to release the paper, but when doing so in the Senate he also delivered a letter from the CEO of the CSIRO, Megan Clark, which attacked the report&#x27;s author and threatened him with unspecified punishment. The author of the paper, Clive Spash, was cited in the press as having been bullied and harassed, and later gave a radio interview about this. In the midst of the affair, CSIRO management had considered releasing the paper with edits that Nature reported would be &quot;tiny&quot;. Spash claimed the changes actually demanded amounted to censorship and resigned. He later posted on his website a document detailing the text that CSIRO management demanded be deleted; by itself, this document forms a coherent set of statements criticising emissions trading without any additional wording needed. In subsequent Senate Estimates hearings during 2010, Senator Carr and Clark went on record claiming the paper was originally stopped from publication solely due to its low quality not meeting CSIRO standards. At the time of its attempted suppression, the paper had been accepted for publication in an academic journal, New Political Economy, which in 2010 had been ranked by the Australian Research Council as an &#x27;A class&#x27; publication. In an ABC radio interview, Spash called for a Senate enquiry into the affair and the role played by senior management and the Science Minister. After these events, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that &quot;Questions are being raised about the closeness of BHP Billiton and the CSIRO under its chief executive, Megan Clark&quot;. After his resignation, an unedited version of the paper was released by Spash as a discussion paper, and later published as an academic journal article.

===CSIRO–Novartis–DataTrace scandal===
On 11 April 2013, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; ran a story on how CSIRO had &quot;duped&quot; the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant Novartis into purchasing an anti-counterfeit technology for its vials of injectable Voltaren. The invention was marketed by a small Australian company called DataTrace DNA as a method of identifying fake vials, on the basis that a unique tracer code developed by CSIRO was embedded in the product. However, the code sold to Novartis for more than A$2M was apparently not unique, and was based on a &quot;cheap tracer ... bought in bulk from a Chinese distributor&quot;. Novartis was contractually bound not to reverse-engineer the tracer to verify its uniqueness. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; report alleges that this was done with the knowledge of key CSIRO personnel.

CSIRO has since conducted a full review of the allegations and found no evidence to support them.

===Alleged bullying, harassment and victimisation===
Around 2008–2012, CSIRO fell under the spotlight for allegedly exhibiting a culture of workplace bullying and harassment. Former CSIRO employees started to surface with experiences of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members. CSIRO took the allegations seriously and responded to the articles on a number of occasions.

The shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, Sophie Mirabella, wrote to the government requesting it establish an inquiry. Mirabella said she is aware of as many as 100 cases of alleged workplace harassment. On 20 July 2012 Comcare issued CSIRO with an Improvement Notice with regard to handling and management of workplace misconduct/code of conduct type investigations and allegations. On 24 June 2013 Mirabella advised the Australian House of Representatives that in relation to the worker&#x27;s compensation claim for psychological injuries of ex-CSIRO employee, Martin Williams, which was vigorously defended by Comcare on the advice of the CSIRO, that CSIRO officers had provided false testimony on no less than 128 occasions under oath when the matter went before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Mirabella stated, &quot;even in establishing the framework for this inquiry it is obvious there&#x27;s an inappropriate &#x27;hands on&#x27; approach by CSIRO.&quot;

In response to the allegations Clark commissioned Dennis Pearce, who is assisted by an investigation team from HWL Ebsworth Lawyers, to conduct an independent investigation into allegations of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour. Mirabella continued to question the independence of the investigation. The first stage of the investigation published its findings at the end of July 2013, and the final stage was scheduled to be complete by February 2014. Post the Pearce Report, CSIRO overhauled its relevant policies and put in place training and whistleblower procedures to address the situation.

===CSIRO and climate change===
In 2013, the Abbott government cuts $25,000,000 from CSIRO&#x27;s annual budget, and in 2014 CEO Megan Clarke makes &quot;almost a quarter of CSIRO&#x27;s scientists redundant&quot;

In 2014, Minister Greg Hunt created NESP, diverting $21,000,000 per year of CSIRO climate funding to competitive Universities

In 2015, Dr Larry Marshall becomes CEO and shifts CSIRO’s purpose to solving national challenges with science, launches “&quot;Innovation Catalyst Strategy”&quot;

In August 2015, the CSIRO discontinued its annual July and August survey, conducted over the previous five years, polling to create a long-term view of how Australians viewed global warming and their support for action. In the previous 2013 poll, 86 per cent agreed with the statement that climate change was occurring and only 7.6 per cent disagreed.

In 2016, Funding cuts of 2014 force 70 redundancies in climate science, Marshall says the argument about climate change is settled so its time to find a solution, compares emotion of debate to religion.

In &quot;an open letter to the Australian Government and CSIRO&quot;, 2,800 of the leading climate scientists from 60 countries say the announcement of cuts to the CSIRO&#x27;s Oceans and Atmosphere research program has alarmed the global climate research community. They say the decision shows a lack of insight and a misunderstanding of the importance of the depth and significance of Australian contributions to global and regional climate research.

Climate lobby, Greens &amp; Labor launch intense political campaign against Marshall – terminating the “&quot;failed Marshall plan&quot;” and “&quot;reversing the cuts&quot; &quot;and &quot;sacking Marshall&quot;&quot; become a focus of Labor’s 2016 election campaign. 

Labor loses election, value of CSIRO doubles, Marshall becomes longest serving CEO in CSIRO’s history.

In 2018, CSIRO creates 1st Net Zero plan for Australia, and demonstrates it by taking all 55 sites across Australia 80% of way to net zero, and doubling value of CSIRO at same time.

The CSIRO has been the target of successive funding cuts under the Morrison government, starting with cuts targeting climate science research initiated by Tony Abbott.

===Trademark dispute with Cisco===

In 2015, Cisco Systems filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against CSIRO, claiming that the colours and style of CSIRO&#x27;s logo were too similar to Cisco&#x27;s. An Australian court ruled in CSIRO&#x27;s favor and ordered Cisco to pay CSIRO&#x27;s court costs.

<text>Zhengzhou is the capital of Henan, China. Located in northern Henan, it is one of the nine national central cities in China, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.

The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China&#x27;s domestic and international transportation network; for example, it is connected to Europe and has an international airport. Zhengzhou is a and a State-list Famous Historical and Culture City. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China&#x27;s first futures exchange. Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China&#x27;s first Airport Economy Zone.

As of the 2020 Chinese census, the prefecture-level city of Zhengzhou had a population of 12,600,574 inhabitants, of whom 10,260,667 lived in its built-up (or metro) area made of 6 urban districts plus Zhongmu county, Xinzheng and Xingyang cities now largely being conurbated. The city had a total GDP of 1.014 trillion (RMB) in 2018. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.

Zhengzhou is a major city for scientific research, appearing among the world&#x27;s top 100 cities as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is home to several national key universities in China, notably Zhengzhou University, Henan University, Henan Agricultural University, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, and Henan University of Technology.
==History==
The Shang dynasty established Aodu () or Bodu () in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in 260 BC. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area around 1600 BC. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District.

The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111–771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named &quot;Guan&quot;. From this derives the name borne by the county (&quot;xian&quot;) since the late 6th century BC—Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named &quot;Guanzhou&quot;. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou—a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.

The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581–618), Tang (618–907), and early Song (960–1127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.

In 1903 the Beijing–Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east–west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi&#x27;an (Chang&#x27;an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers&#x27; strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On 10 June 1938, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.

Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city&#x27;s industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.

In July 2021, record breaking floods left over a million people displaced and at least 300 people dead.

==Geography==

Located just north of the province&#x27;s centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north–south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34° 16&#x27; ~ 34° 58 N latitude and 112° 42&#x27; ~ 114° 14&#x27; E longitude, covering a total area of , including the metropolitan area, which covers , and the city centre, which occupies .
A section of the Yellow River passes by the northern edges of the urban area, extending within Zhengzhou prefecture. However, Jialu River, a secondary tributary of the Huai River, is Zhengzhou&#x27;s main urban river and flood channel. The Jialu enters Zhengzhou from Xinmi to the southwest, and turns to the southeast within the city. Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.

===Climate===
Zhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwa&quot;), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of , with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from in January to in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to on 19 July 1966.

Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in January to 49 percent in April and May, the city receives 1,905 hours of sunshine per year, which is around 43% of the possible total.

In 2019, there were 177 good days in Zhengzhou, an increase of 9 days year-on-year, and 48.5% of the good days reached the standard. There were 24 days of heavy pollution, 9 days less than last year.

===2021 flood===
On 20 July 2021, &quot;The heaviest hour of rainfall ever reliably recorded in China crashed like a miles-wide waterfall over the city of Zhengzhou on 20 July, killing at least 300 people, including 14 who drowned in a subway tunnel.&quot; Although an emergency alert was issued the day before the flood, businesses and subways remained open. From 4pm to 5pm on 21 July, 7.95 inches of rain fell. A collapsed retaining wall allowed water to pour into subway tunnels. &quot;The Chinese government now appears to be acknowledging missteps by local officials, as well as the possibility that severe weather events will become increasingly common.&quot;

==Administration and demography==

Zhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. These subdivisions are likely to undergo significant changes in the near future due to increasingly rapid urban expansion and urban planning.

The municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and 6.35 million in its built up area made of 6 urban and suburban districts, Xingyang and Xinzheng cities and now Zhongmu county largely being urbanized, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province.
==Main sights==

Zhengzhou was the capital of China during the Shang dynasty. Parts of the Shang-era capital city wall that were built 3,600 years ago still remain in Downtown Zhengzhou (see Zhengzhou Shang City). Zhengzhou maintains abundant cultural heritages that reflect its history as well as the culture of Henan Province. Zhengzhou Confucius Temple, initially built during the Eastern Han dynasty 1900 years ago, is one of the oldest Confucian Temples in China. Other important architectural heritage sites in the city center include Town God Temple and Erqi Memorial Tower.

<doc id="288270" wikidata="Q2109761" url="?curid=288270" title="Uniformization theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the uniformization theorem states that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of three Riemann surfaces: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. The theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.

Since every Riemann surface has a universal cover which is a simply connected Riemann surface, the uniformization theorem leads to a classification of Riemann surfaces into three types: those that have the Riemann sphere as universal cover (&quot;elliptic&quot;), those with the plane as universal cover (&quot;parabolic&quot;) and those with the unit disk as universal cover (&quot;hyperbolic&quot;). It further follows that every Riemann surface admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature, where the curvature can be taken to be 1 in the elliptic, 0 in the parabolic and -1 in the hyperbolic case. 

The uniformization theorem also yields a similar classification of closed orientable Riemannian 2-manifolds into elliptic/parabolic/hyperbolic cases. Each such manifold has a conformally equivalent Riemannian metric with constant curvature, where the curvature can be taken to be 1 in the elliptic, 0 in the parabolic and -1 in the hyperbolic case. 

==History==

Felix and Henri conjectured the uniformization theorem for (the Riemann surfaces of) algebraic curves. extended this to arbitrary multivalued analytic functions and gave informal arguments in its favor. The first rigorous proofs of the general uniformization theorem were given by and . Paul Koebe later gave several more proofs and generalizations. The history is described in ; a complete account of uniformization up to the 1907 papers of Koebe and Poincaré is given with detailed proofs in (the Bourbaki-type pseudonym of the group of fifteen mathematicians who jointly produced this publication).

==Classification of connected Riemann surfaces==

Every Riemann surface is the quotient of the free, proper and holomorphic action of a discrete group on its universal covering and this universal covering, being a simply connected Riemann surface, is holomorphically isomorphic (one also says: &quot;conformally equivalent&quot; or &quot;biholomorphic&quot;) to one of the following:

#the Riemann sphere
#the complex plane
#the unit disk in the complex plane.
For compact Riemann surfaces, those with universal cover the unit disk are precisely the hyperbolic surfaces of genus greater than 1, all with non-abelian fundamental group; those with universal cover the complex plane are the Riemann surfaces of genus 1, namely the complex tori or elliptic curves with fundamental group ; and those with universal cover the Riemann sphere are those of genus zero, namely the Riemann sphere itself, with trivial fundamental group.

==Classification of closed oriented Riemannian 2-manifolds==
On an oriented 2-manifold, a Riemannian metric induces a complex structure using the passage to isothermal coordinates. If the Riemannian metric is given locally as

:formula_1

then in the complex coordinate &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + i&quot;y&quot;, it takes the form

:formula_2

where

:formula_3

so that &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;μ&quot; are smooth with &quot;λ&quot; &gt; 0 and |&quot;μ&quot;| &lt; 1. In isothermal coordinates (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) the metric should take the form

:formula_4

with &quot;ρ&quot; &gt; 0 smooth. The complex coordinate &quot;w&quot; = &quot;u&quot; + i &quot;v&quot; satisfies

:formula_5

so that the coordinates (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) will be isothermal locally provided the Beltrami equation

:formula_6

has a locally diffeomorphic solution, i.e. a solution with non-vanishing Jacobian.

These conditions can be phrased equivalently in terms of the exterior derivative and the Hodge star operator .
 and will be isothermal coordinates if , where is defined
on differentials by .
Let be the Laplace–Beltrami operator. By standard elliptic theory, can be chosen to be harmonic near a given point, i.e. , with non-vanishing. By the Poincaré lemma has a local solution exactly when . This condition is equivalent to , so can always be solved locally. Since is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is −1 on 1-forms, and must be linearly independent, so that and give local isothermal coordinates.

The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved by other methods, for example using the general theory of the Beltrami equation, as in , or by direct elementary methods, as in and .

From this correspondence with compact Riemann surfaces, a classification of closed orientable Riemannian 2-manifolds follows. Each such is conformally equivalent to a unique closed 2-manifold of constant curvature, so a quotient of one of the following by a free action of a discrete subgroup of an isometry group:

#the sphere (curvature +1)
#the Euclidean plane (curvature 0)
#the hyperbolic plane (curvature −1).

The first case gives the 2-sphere, the unique 2-manifold with constant positive curvature and hence positive Euler characteristic (equal to 2). The second gives all flat 2-manifolds, i.e. the tori, which have Euler characteristic 0. The third case covers all 2-manifolds of constant negative curvature, i.e. the &quot;hyperbolic&quot; 2-manifolds all of which have negative Euler characteristic. The classification is consistent with the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, which implies that for a closed surface with constant curvature, the sign of that curvature must match the sign of the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic is equal to 2 – 2&quot;g&quot;, where &quot;g&quot; is the genus of the 2-manifold, i.e. the number of &quot;holes&quot;.

==Methods of proof==
Many classical proofs of the uniformization theorem rely on constructing a real-valued harmonic function on the simply connected Riemann surface, possibly with a singularity at one or two points and often corresponding to a form of Green&#x27;s function. Four methods of constructing the harmonic function are widely employed: the Perron method; the Schwarz alternating method; Dirichlet&#x27;s principle; and Weyl&#x27;s method of orthogonal projection. In the context of closed Riemannian 2-manifolds, several modern proofs invoke nonlinear differential equations on the space of conformally equivalent metrics. These include the Beltrami equation from Teichmüller theory and an equivalent formulation in terms of harmonic maps; Liouville&#x27;s equation, already studied by Poincaré; and Ricci flow along with other nonlinear flows.

Rado&#x27;s theorem shows that every Riemann surface is automatically second-countable. Although Rado&#x27;s theorem is often used in proofs of the uniformization theorem, some proofs have been formulated so that Rado&#x27;s theorem becomes a consequence. Second countability is automatic for compact Riemann surfaces.

===Hilbert space methods===

In 1913 Hermann Weyl published his classic textbook &quot;Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche&quot; based on his Göttingen lectures from 1911 to 1912. It was the first book to present the theory of Riemann surfaces in a modern setting and through its three editions has remained influential. Dedicated to Felix Klein, the first edition incorporated Hilbert&#x27;s treatment of the Dirichlet problem using Hilbert space techniques; Brouwer&#x27;s contributions to topology; and Koebe&#x27;s proof of the uniformization theorem and its subsequent improvements. Much later developed his method of orthogonal projection which gave a streamlined approach to the Dirichlet problem, also based on Hilbert space; that theory, which included Weyl&#x27;s lemma on elliptic regularity, was related to Hodge&#x27;s theory of harmonic integrals; and both theories were subsumed into the modern theory of elliptic operators and Sobolev spaces. In the third edition of his book from 1955, translated into English in , Weyl adopted the modern definition of differential manifold, in preference to triangulations, but decided not to make use of his method of orthogonal projection. followed Weyl&#x27;s account of the uniformisation theorem, but used the method of orthogonal projection to treat the Dirichlet problem. describes the approach in Weyl&#x27;s book and also how to shorten it using the method of orthogonal projection. A related account can be found in .

===Nonlinear flows===
Richard S. Hamilton showed that the normalized Ricci flow on a closed surface uniformizes the metric (i.e., the flow converges to a constant curvature metric). However, his proof relied on the uniformization theorem. The missing step involved Ricci flow on the 2-sphere: a method for avoiding an appeal to the uniformization theorem (for genus 0) was provided by ; a short self-contained account of Ricci flow on the 2-sphere was given in .

==Generalizations==

Koebe proved the general uniformization theorem that if a Riemann surface is homeomorphic to an open subset of the complex sphere (or equivalently if every Jordan curve separates it), then it is conformally equivalent to an open subset of the complex sphere.

In 3 dimensions, there are 8 geometries, called the eight Thurston geometries. Not every 3-manifold admits a geometry, but Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture proved by Grigori Perelman states that every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable.

The simultaneous uniformization theorem of Lipman Bers shows that it is possible to simultaneously uniformize two compact Riemann surfaces of the same genus &gt;1 with the same quasi-Fuchsian group.

The measurable Riemann mapping theorem shows more generally that the map to an open subset of the complex sphere in the uniformization theorem can be chosen to be a quasiconformal map with any given bounded measurable Beltrami coefficient.

<text>Kingdom Come is a Germany-based hard rock band formed in 1987. The band was originally fronted by Lenny Wolf (born Frank Wöllschlager in Hamburg), until their hiatus in 2016. While there have been no constant Kingdom Come members throughout the band&#x27;s history, their most recent lineup features three original members who, along with drummer James Kottak, left the band in 1989 and returned in 2018. Wolf was replaced by Keith St. John in 2018, and he remained until 2024, when Ezekiel &quot;Zeke&quot; Kaplan replaced him. Kottak remained in Kingdom Come until his death in January of the same year and was replaced by Matt Muckle. The band&#x27;s 1988 debut album, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, is to date their most internationally popular and biggest selling recording and features their most notable hit &quot;Get It On&quot;.

== History ==
The group was formed in 1987 in Hamburg, West Germany, after the breakup of Wolf&#x27;s moderately successful rock project Stone Fury. Wolf recruited Italian-born bassist/keyboardist Johnny B. Frank and American musicians Danny Stag (lead guitar), Rick Steier (rhythm guitar) and James Kottak (drums). Stag and Frank had previously been members of the bands Industrials (CBS Int&#x27;l), WWIII and Population 5, which included bassist Prescott Niles (The Knack) and drummer Matt Sorum (The Cult, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver). Frank was also at one point the keyboard player for Josie Cotton. Kingdom Come marked the first band where Wolf sang without playing guitar. The frontman later admitted that, for a while, it was a very awkward adjustment.

In 1988, the band released its debut album, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Get It On&quot;, was a big enough hit on AOR stations (most requested song for six weeks), that the band&#x27;s eponymous debut went gold the day it was shipped (610,000 units sold). Their second single/video for the power ballad &quot;What Love Can Be&quot; received much airplay on US radio and MTV. By the time the single/video &quot;Loving You&quot; was released, the album had sold to platinum status in the United States, Germany and Canada, among other music markets. The band was chosen to open for the North American Monsters of Rock Tour 1988, supporting Dokken, Scorpions, Metallica and Van Halen. Following that, they were tapped to support Scorpions on their North American &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; tour. In 1989, Kingdom Come released their second album &quot;In Your Face&quot;. It had sold a hardly modest 486,000 units, only 14,000 short of achieving their second gold-certified album, when the band abruptly broke up for personal reasons in August 1989.

Around 1990, Wolf reformed Kingdom Come with a new lineup, which made one more international release on PolyGram, an album entitled &quot;Hands of Time&quot; (released in 1991), co-writing with harpist/songwriter Carol Tatum (Angels of Venice), which was recorded with several session guitarists and drummers, including future Poison guitarist Blues Saraceno and former Dancer drummer Bam Bamm Shibley, with Lenny Wolf himself playing the bass. By 1993, Wolf had returned to Germany to regroup. With a new, mostly German lineup, Kingdom Come remained active with several subsequent releases and tours in Europe under their collective belt. The band had kept recording albums and touring since then. In early 2013, Kingdom Come released studio album no. 13 &quot;Outlier&quot;, which was produced by Lenny Wolf in his home recording studio. He also planned to tour again in 2013.

In 1992, Stag joined forces with onetime Foreigner vocalist Johnny Edwards, former Krokus drummer Jeff Klaven and bassist David Seaton to form Royal Jelly, which got the attention of A&amp;R man Denny Cordell at Island Records in 1993. Cordell signed Stag and Royal Jelly to a recording contract. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Ceiling&quot;, reached number 22 with a bullet on the FM airplay charts before the band was lost in the shuffle of Cordell&#x27;s death from lymphoma and the purchase and restructuring of Island by PolyGram. In 1995, after the demise of the band, a disillusioned Stag went back to Pittsburgh and immersed himself in the blues, to get back in touch with the source of his inspiration. Steier and Kottak went back to Kentucky and assembled the short-lived Wild Horses, who released an album on Atlantic Records. Both would later resurface in Warrant. James Kottak did not go unnoticed by Scorpions and eventually earned a place as their permanent drummer.

In 2014, the band reunited once again with guitarist Danny Stag, bassist Johnny B. Frank and drummer Hendrik Thiesbrummel for a series of concerts worldwide.

On 11 August 2016, Lenny Wolf stated that Kingdom Come was over. However, in June 2018, the original lineup of the band (minus Wolf) announced plans to tour that year and in 2019 by celebrating the 30th anniversaries of their self-titled debut album and its follow-up &quot;In Your Face&quot;; filling in for Wolf is Keith St. John, leaving no constant members throughout the band&#x27;s existence. When asked in July 2018 on the &quot;Rock Talk with Mitch Lafon&quot; podcast about Wolf&#x27;s absence, drummer James Kottak stated, &quot;He&#x27;s just kind of done. He wants to retire. He&#x27;s got his life.&quot; In the same interview, Kottak expressed his desire to work on new material with Kingdom Come and added, &quot;maybe Lenny will contribute some music towards it.&quot; Kottak later stated that Kingdom Come was not expected to release new music before 2021. In an April 2021 interview with MetalAsylum.net, vocalist Keith St. John stated that the group might consider releasing new material under a different name, due to yet-to-be solved issues with Wolf. Kottak died on 9 January 2024 at the age of 61.

A month after Kottak&#x27;s death, it was announced that St. John had left Kingdom Come in order to focus on other projects, and the band revealed Ezekiel &quot;Zeke&quot; Kaplan and Matt Muckle as the respective replacements of St. John and Kottak. The new lineup also announced plans for 2024 that include &quot;a new album, and a brand-new live tour.&quot;

== Comparisons with Led Zeppelin ==
The musical style on Kingdom Come&#x27;s debut album was very close to the early blues-rock style of English rock band Led Zeppelin, to the point that some listeners initially thought that Kingdom Come was actually a Led Zeppelin reunion. With a sound that was thought by many to be highly derivative of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s, there was a backlash from critics, with the band being dubbed &quot;Kingdom Clone&quot; in the press.

Irish rock guitarist Gary Moore went one step further, with the track &quot;Led Clones&quot; from his &quot;After the War&quot; album. Moore, with Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals, pokes fun at bands such as Kingdom Come on the track, criticizing their blatant use of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s sound and image.

Vocalist Lenny Wolf further inflamed the situation in an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine where he alleged to have never heard of Led Zeppelin. Wolf has been adamant that his and Kingdom Come&#x27;s greatest influences were The Beatles and AC/DC, particularly the Bon Scott era. Danny Stag is on record as having said that his biggest influence was Jimi Hendrix. These claims are backed up by the cover of the Beatles classic &quot;Across the Universe&quot; from &quot;Ain&#x27;t Crying for the Moon&quot; and the hard rocking tribute &quot;Bon Scott&quot; (in honor of the late AC/DC frontman) from the same album. However, drummer James Kottak has stated that John Bonham was an influence on him and has &quot;embraced the Led Zeppelin comparison anytime it came up.&quot; Kottak has also disputed Wolf&#x27;s alleged claim that he had never heard of Led Zeppelin: &quot;Of course he was kidding, but sarcasm doesn&#x27;t translate well to print. I remember that quote was used as the headline and most people would see that and didn&#x27;t bother reading the article.&quot; In a February 2024 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Wolf rejected his and Stag&#x27;s alleged claims that they had never heard of Led Zeppelin, recalling, &quot;Danny got so tired of hearing about the Zeppelin issue that he just blurted out: &#x27;Who&#x27;s Jimmy Page? Never heard of him.&#x27; Which of course was meant ironically, it&#x27;s so obvious. But some writer picked up on it, and then other idiots jumped on the bandwagon, writing the same bullshit. And that&#x27;s when the shit started.&quot;

Years later, Wolf would say that the comparisons were &quot;unjustified&quot;, yet &quot;we took it as a compliment and were excited&quot;.

<doc id="288274" wikidata="Q576704" url="?curid=288274" title="Lake Annecy">
<text>Lake Annecy (, ) is a perialpine lake in Haute-Savoie in France. It is named after the city of Annecy, which marks the start of the Thiou, Lake Annecy&#x27;s outflow river.

It is the third-largest lake in France, after the Lac du Bourget and Lac de Grand-Lieu, if the French part of Lake Geneva, which is shared between Switzerland and France, is excluded. It is a popular tourist destination known for its swimming and water sports.

The lake was formed about 18,000 years ago, at the time the large alpine glaciers melted. It is fed by many small rivers from the surrounding mountains (Ire, Eau morte, Laudon, Bornette and Biolon) and a powerful underwater source, the Boubioz, at an 82-metre depth (269 ft).

==Cities and towns around the lake==
* Annecy
* Veyrier-du-Lac
* Menthon-Saint-Bernard
* Talloires
* Doussard
* Duingt
* Saint-Jorioz
* Sévrier

A cycle path goes partially around Lake Annecy past Sevrier and St Jorioz to Ugine. It has an aim to reach Albertville. The lake is around 14 km long.

<text>Usability can be described as the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience. In software engineering, usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use.

The object of use can be a software application, website, book, tool, machine, process, vehicle, or anything a human interacts with. A usability study may be conducted as a primary job function by a &quot;usability analyst&quot; or as a secondary job function by designers, technical writers, marketing personnel, and others. It is widely used in consumer electronics, communication, and knowledge transfer objects (such as a cookbook, a document or online help) and mechanical objects such as a door handle or a hammer.

Usability includes methods of measuring usability, such as needs analysis and the study of the principles behind an object&#x27;s perceived efficiency or elegance. In human-computer interaction and computer science, usability studies the elegance and clarity with which the interaction with a computer program or a web site (web usability) is designed. Usability considers user satisfaction and utility as quality components, and aims to improve user experience through iterative design.

==Introduction==
The primary notion of usability is that an object designed with a generalized users&#x27; psychology and physiology in mind is, for example:
* More efficient to use—takes less time to accomplish a particular task
* Easier to learn—operation can be learned by observing the object
* More satisfying to use

Complex computer systems find their way into everyday life, and at the same time the market is saturated with competing brands. This has made usability more popular and widely recognized in recent years, as companies see the benefits of researching and developing their products with user-oriented methods instead of technology-oriented methods. By understanding and researching the interaction between product and user, the &quot;usability expert&quot; can also provide insight that is unattainable by traditional company-oriented market research. For example, after observing and interviewing users, the usability expert may identify needed functionality or design flaws that were not anticipated. A method called &quot;contextual inquiry&quot; does this in the naturally occurring context of the users own environment. In the user-centered design paradigm, the product is designed with its intended users in mind at all times. In the user-driven or participatory design paradigm, some of the users become actual or de facto members of the design team.

The term &quot;user friendly&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;usable&quot;, though it may also refer to accessibility. Usability describes the quality of user experience across websites, software, products, and environments. There is no consensus about the relation of the terms ergonomics (or human factors) and usability. Some think of usability as the software specialization of the larger topic of ergonomics. Others view these topics as tangential, with ergonomics focusing on physiological matters (e.g., turning a door handle) and usability focusing on psychological matters (e.g., recognizing that a door can be opened by turning its handle). Usability is also important in website development (web usability). According to Jakob Nielsen, &quot;Studies of user behavior on the Web find a low tolerance for difficult designs or slow sites. People don&#x27;t want to wait. And they don&#x27;t want to learn how to use a home page. There&#x27;s no such thing as a training class or a manual for a Web site. People have to be able to grasp the functioning of the site immediately after scanning the home page—for a few seconds at most.&quot; Otherwise, most casual users simply leave the site and browse or shop elsewhere.

Usability can also include the concept of prototypicality, which is how much a particular thing conforms to the expected shared norm, for instance, in website design, users prefer sites that conform to recognised design norms.

==Definition==
ISO defines usability as &quot;The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.&quot; The word &quot;usability&quot; also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process. Usability consultant Jakob Nielsen and computer science professor Ben Shneiderman have written (separately) about a framework of system acceptability, where usability is a part of &quot;usefulness&quot; and is composed of:
* Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
* Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
* Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re-establish proficiency?
* Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
* Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?

Usability is often associated with the functionalities of the product (cf. ISO definition, below), in addition to being solely a characteristic of the user interface (cf. framework of system acceptability, also below, which separates &quot;usefulness&quot; into &quot;usability&quot; and &quot;utility&quot;). For example, in the context of mainstream consumer products, an automobile lacking a reverse gear could be considered &quot;unusable&quot; according to the former view, and &quot;lacking in utility&quot; according to the latter view. When evaluating user interfaces for usability, the definition can be as simple as &quot;the perception of a target user of the effectiveness (fit for purpose) and efficiency (work or time required to use) of the Interface&quot;. Each component may be measured subjectively against criteria, e.g., Principles of User Interface Design, to provide a metric, often expressed as a percentage. It is important to distinguish between usability testing and usability engineering. Usability testing is the measurement of ease of use of a product or piece of software. In contrast, usability engineering (UE) is the research and design process that ensures a product with good usability. Usability is a non-functional requirement. As with other non-functional requirements, usability cannot be directly measured but must be quantified by means of indirect measures or attributes such as, for example, the number of reported problems with ease-of-use of a system.

===Intuitive interaction or intuitive use===

The term intuitive is often listed as a desirable trait in usable interfaces, sometimes used as a synonym for learnable. In the past, Jef Raskin discouraged using this term in user interface design, claiming that easy to use interfaces are often easy because of the user&#x27;s exposure to previous similar systems, thus the term &#x27;familiar&#x27; should be preferred. As an example: Two vertical lines &quot;||&quot; on media player buttons do not intuitively mean &quot;pause&quot;—they do so by convention. This association between intuitive use and familiarity has since been empirically demonstrated in multiple studies by a range of researchers across the world, and intuitive interaction is accepted in the research community as being use of an interface based on past experience with similar interfaces or something else, often not fully conscious, and sometimes involving a feeling of &quot;magic&quot; since the course of the knowledge itself may not be consciously available to the user . Researchers have also investigated intuitive interaction for older people, people living with dementia, and children.

Some have argued that aiming for &quot;intuitive&quot; interfaces (based on reusing existing skills with interaction systems) could lead designers to discard a better design solution only because it would require a novel approach and to stick with boring designs. However, applying familiar features into a new interface has been shown not to result in boring design if designers use creative approaches rather than simple copying. The throwaway remark that &quot;the only intuitive interface is the nipple; everything else is learned.&quot; is still occasionally mentioned. Any breastfeeding mother or lactation consultant will tell you this is inaccurate and the nipple does in fact require learning on both sides. In 1992, Bruce Tognazzini even denied the existence of &quot;intuitive&quot; interfaces, since such interfaces must be able to intuit, i.e., &quot;perceive the patterns of the user&#x27;s behavior and draw inferences.&quot; Instead, he advocated the term &quot;intuitable,&quot; i.e., &quot;that users could intuit the workings of an application by seeing it and using it&quot;. However, the term intuitive interaction has become well accepted in the research community over the past 20 or so years and, although not perfect, it should probably be accepted and used.

==ISO standards==

===ISO/TR 16982:2002 standard===
ISO/TR 16982:2002 (&quot;Ergonomics of human-system interaction—Usability methods supporting human-centered design&quot;) is an International Standards Organization (ISO) standard that provides information on human-centered usability methods that can be used for design and evaluation. It details the advantages, disadvantages, and other factors relevant to using each usability method. It explains the implications of the stage of the life cycle and the individual project characteristics for the selection of usability methods and provides examples of usability methods in context. The main users of ISO/TR 16982:2002 are project managers. It therefore addresses technical human factors and ergonomics issues only to the extent necessary to allow managers to understand their relevance and importance in the design process as a whole. The guidance in ISO/TR 16982:2002 can be tailored for specific design situations by using the lists of issues characterizing the context of use of the product to be delivered. Selection of appropriate usability methods should also take account of the relevant life-cycle process. ISO/TR 16982:2002 is restricted to methods that are widely used by usability specialists and project managers. It does &quot;not&quot; specify the details of how to implement or carry out the usability methods described.

===ISO 9241 standard===
ISO 9241 is a multi-part standard that covers a number of aspects of people working with computers. Although originally titled &quot;Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs)&quot;, it has been retitled to the more generic &quot;Ergonomics of Human System Interaction&quot;. As part of this change, ISO is renumbering some parts of the standard so that it can cover more topics, e.g. tactile and haptic interaction. The first part to be renumbered was part 10 in 2006, now part 110.

===IEC 62366===
IEC 62366-1:2015 + COR1:2016 &amp; IEC/TR 62366-2 provide guidance on usability engineering specific to a medical device.

==Designing for usability==
Any system or device designed for use by people should be easy to use, easy to learn, easy to remember (the instructions), and helpful to users. John Gould and Clayton Lewis recommend that designers striving for usability follow these three design principles

* Early focus on end users and the tasks they need the system/device to do
* Empirical measurement using quantitative or qualitative measures
* Iterative design, in which the designers work in a series of stages, improving the design each time

===Early focus on users and tasks===
The design team should be user-driven and it should be in direct contact with potential users. Several evaluation methods, including personas, cognitive modeling, inspection, inquiry, prototyping, and testing methods may contribute to understanding potential users and their perceptions of how well the product or process works. Usability considerations, such as who the users are and their experience with similar systems must be examined. As part of understanding users, this knowledge must &quot;...be played against the tasks that the users will be expected to perform.&quot; This includes the analysis of what tasks the users will perform, which are most important, and what decisions the users will make while using your system. Designers must understand how cognitive and emotional characteristics of users will relate to a proposed system. One way to stress the importance of these issues in the designers&#x27; minds is to use personas, which are made-up representative users. See below for further discussion of personas. Another more expensive but more insightful method is to have a panel of potential users work closely with the design team from the early stages.

===Empirical measurement===
Test the system early on, and test the system on real users using behavioral measurements. This includes testing the system for both learnability and usability. (See Evaluation Methods). It is important in this stage to use quantitative usability specifications such as time and errors to complete tasks and number of users to test, as well as examine performance and attitudes of the users testing the system. Finally, &quot;reviewing or demonstrating&quot; a system before the user tests it can result in misleading results. The emphasis of empirical measurement is on measurement, both informal and formal, which can be carried out through a variety of evaluation methods.

===Iterative design===
Iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. The key requirements for Iterative Design are: identification of required changes, an ability to make changes, and a willingness to make changes. When a problem is encountered, there is no set method to determine the correct solution. Rather, there are empirical methods that can be used during system development or after the system is delivered, usually a more inopportune time. Ultimately, iterative design works towards meeting goals such as making the system user friendly, easy to use, easy to operate, simple, etc.

==Evaluation methods==
There are a variety of usability evaluation methods. Certain methods use data from users, while others rely on usability experts. There are usability evaluation methods for all stages of design and development, from product definition to final design modifications. When choosing a method, consider cost, time constraints, and appropriateness. For a brief overview of methods, see Comparison of usability evaluation methods or continue reading below. Usability methods can be further classified into the subcategories below.

===Cognitive modeling methods===
Cognitive modeling involves creating a computational model to estimate how long it takes people to perform a given task. Models are based on psychological principles and experimental studies to determine times for cognitive processing and motor movements. Cognitive models can be used to improve user interfaces or predict problem errors and pitfalls during the design process. A few examples of cognitive models include:

====Parallel design====
With parallel design, several people create an initial design from the same set of requirements. Each person works independently, and when finished, shares concepts with the group. The design team considers each solution, and each designer uses the best ideas to further improve their own solution. This process helps generate many different, diverse ideas, and ensures that the best ideas from each design are integrated into the final concept. This process can be repeated several times until the team is satisfied with the final concept.

====GOMS====

&quot;GOMS&quot; stands for &quot;goals, operators, methods, and selection rules&quot;. It is a family of techniques that analyzes the user complexity of interactive systems. Goals are what the user must accomplish. An operator is an action performed in pursuit of a goal. A method is a sequence of operators that accomplish a goal. Selection rules specify which method satisfies a given goal, based on context.

====Human processor model====

Sometimes it is useful to break a task down and analyze each individual aspect separately. This helps the tester locate specific areas for improvement. To do this, it is necessary to understand how the human brain processes information. A model of the human processor is shown below.

Many studies have been done to estimate the cycle times, decay times, and capacities of each of these processors. Variables that affect these can include subject age, aptitudes, ability, and the surrounding environment. For a younger adult, reasonable estimates are:

Long-term memory is believed to have an infinite capacity and decay time.

====Keystroke level modeling====

Keystroke level modeling is essentially a less comprehensive version of GOMS that makes simplifying assumptions in order to reduce calculation time and complexity.

===Inspection methods===

These usability evaluation methods involve observation of users by an experimenter, or the testing and evaluation of a program by an expert reviewer. They provide more quantitative data as tasks can be timed and recorded.

====Card sorts====
Card sorting is a way to involve users in grouping information for a website&#x27;s usability review. Participants in a card sorting session are asked to organize the content from a Web site in a way that makes sense to them. Participants review items from a Web site and then group these items into categories. Card sorting helps to learn how users think about the content and how they would organize the information on the Web site. Card sorting helps to build the structure for a Web site, decide what to put on the home page, and label the home page categories. It also helps to ensure that information is organized on the site in a way that is logical to users.

====Tree tests====
Tree testing is a way to evaluate the effectiveness of a website&#x27;s top-down organization. Participants are given &quot;find it&quot; tasks, then asked to drill down through successive text lists of topics and subtopics to find a suitable answer. Tree testing evaluates the findability and labeling of topics in a site, separate from its navigation controls or visual design.

====Ethnography====
Ethnographic analysis is derived from anthropology. Field observations are taken at a site of a possible user, which track the artifacts of work such as Post-It notes, items on desktop, shortcuts, and items in trash bins. These observations also gather the sequence of work and interruptions that determine the user&#x27;s typical day.

====Heuristic evaluation====
Heuristic evaluation is a usability engineering method for finding and assessing usability problems in a user interface design as part of an iterative design process. It involves having a small set of evaluators examining the interface and using recognized usability principles (the &quot;heuristics&quot;). It is the most popular of the usability inspection methods, as it is quick, cheap, and easy. Heuristic evaluation was developed to aid in the design of computer user-interface design. It relies on expert reviewers to discover usability problems and then categorize and rate them by a set of principles (heuristics.) It is widely used based on its speed and cost-effectiveness. Jakob Nielsen&#x27;s list of ten heuristics is the most commonly used in industry. These are ten general principles for user interface design. They are called &quot;heuristics&quot; because they are more in the nature of rules of thumb than specific usability guidelines.
*&quot;Visibility of system status&quot;: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
*&quot;Match between system and the real world&quot;: The system should speak the users&#x27; language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
*&quot;User control and freedom&quot;: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &quot;emergency exit&quot; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
*&quot;Consistency and standards&quot;: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
*&quot;Error prevention&quot;: Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
*&quot;Recognition rather than recall&quot;: Minimize the user&#x27;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
*&quot;Flexibility and efficiency of use&quot;: Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
*&quot;Aesthetic and minimalist design&quot;: Dialogues should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
*&quot;Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors&quot;: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
*&quot;Help and documentation&quot;: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user&#x27;s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

Thus, by determining which guidelines are violated, the usability of a device can be determined.

====Usability inspection====
Usability inspection is a review of a system based on a set of guidelines. The review is conducted by a group of experts who are deeply familiar with the concepts of usability in design. The experts focus on a list of areas in design that have been shown to be troublesome for users.

====Pluralistic inspection====
Pluralistic Inspections are meetings where users, developers, and human factors people meet together to discuss and evaluate step by step of a task scenario. As more people inspect the scenario for problems, the higher the probability to find problems. In addition, the more interaction in the team, the faster the usability issues are resolved.

====Consistency inspection====
In consistency inspection, expert designers review products or projects to ensure consistency across multiple products to look if it does things in the same way as their own designs.

====Activity Analysis====
Activity analysis is a usability method used in preliminary stages of development to get a sense of situation. It involves an investigator observing users as they work in the field. Also referred to as user observation, it is useful for specifying user requirements and studying currently used tasks and subtasks. The data collected are qualitative and useful for defining the problem. It should be used when you wish to frame what is needed, or &quot;What do we want to know?&quot;

===Inquiry methods===
The following usability evaluation methods involve collecting qualitative data from users. Although the data collected is subjective, it provides valuable information on what the user wants.

====Task analysis====
Task analysis means learning about users&#x27; goals and users&#x27; ways of working. Task analysis can also mean figuring out what more specific tasks users must do to meet those goals and what steps they must take to accomplish those tasks. Along with user and task analysis, a third analysis is often used: understanding users&#x27; environments (physical, social, cultural, and technological environments).

====Focus groups====
A focus group is a focused discussion where a moderator leads a group of participants through a set of questions on a particular topic. Although typically used as a marketing tool, focus groups are sometimes used to evaluate usability. Used in the product definition stage, a group of 6 to 10 users are gathered to discuss what they desire in a product. An experienced focus group facilitator is hired to guide the discussion to areas of interest for the developers. Focus groups are typically videotaped to help get verbatim quotes, and clips are often used to summarize opinions. The data gathered is not usually quantitative, but can help get an idea of a target group&#x27;s opinion.

====Questionnaires/surveys====
Surveys have the advantages of being inexpensive, require no testing equipment, and results reflect the users&#x27; opinions. When written carefully and given to actual users who have experience with the product and knowledge of design, surveys provide useful feedback on the strong and weak areas of the usability of a design. This is a very common method and often does not appear to be a survey, but just a warranty card.

===Prototyping methods===
It is often very difficult for designers to conduct usability tests with the exact system being designed. Cost constraints, size, and design constraints usually lead the designer to creating a prototype of the system. Instead of creating the complete final system, the designer may test different sections of the system, thus making several small models of each component of the system. Prototyping is an attitude and an output, as it is a process for generating and reflecting on tangible ideas by allowing failure to occur early. prototyping helps people to see what could be of communicating a shared vision, and of giving shape to the future. The types of usability prototypes may vary from using paper models, index cards, hand drawn models, or storyboards. Prototypes are able to be modified quickly, often are faster and easier to create with less time invested by designers and are more apt to change design; although sometimes are not an adequate representation of the whole system, are often not durable and testing results may not be parallel to those of the actual system.

==== The Tool Kit Approach ====
This tool kit is a wide library of methods that used the traditional programming language and it is primarily developed for computer programmers. The code created for testing in the tool kit approach can be used in the final product. However, to get the highest benefit from the tool, the user must be an expert programmer.

==== The Parts Kit Approach ====
The two elements of this approach include a parts library and a method used for identifying the connection between the parts.  This approach can be used by almost anyone and it is a great asset for designers with repetitive tasks.

==== Animation Language Metaphor ====
This approach is a combination of the tool kit approach and the part kit approach. Both the dialogue designers and the programmers are able to interact with this prototyping tool.

=== Rapid prototyping ===
Rapid prototyping is a method used in early stages of development to validate and refine the usability of a system. It can be used to quickly and cheaply evaluate user-interface designs without the need for an expensive working model. This can help remove hesitation to change the design, since it is implemented before any real programming begins. One such method of rapid prototyping is paper prototyping.

===Testing methods===

These usability evaluation methods involve testing of subjects for the most quantitative data. Usually recorded on video, they provide task completion time and allow for observation of attitude. Regardless to how carefully a system is designed, all theories must be tested using usability tests. Usability tests involve typical users using the system (or product) in a realistic environment [see simulation]. Observation of the user&#x27;s behavior, emotions, and difficulties while performing different tasks, often identify areas of improvement for the system.

====Metrics====
While conducting usability tests, designers must use usability metrics to identify what it is they are going to measure, or the usability metrics. These metrics are often variable, and change in conjunction with the scope and goals of the project. The number of subjects being tested can also affect usability metrics, as it is often easier to focus on specific demographics. Qualitative design phases, such as general usability (can the task be accomplished?), and user satisfaction are also typically done with smaller groups of subjects. Using inexpensive prototypes on small user groups provides more detailed information, because of the more interactive atmosphere, and the designer&#x27;s ability to focus more on the individual user.

As the designs become more complex, the testing must become more formalized. Testing equipment will become more sophisticated and testing metrics become more quantitative. With a more refined prototype, designers often test effectiveness, efficiency, and subjective satisfaction, by asking the user to complete various tasks. These categories are measured by the percent that complete the task, how long it takes to complete the tasks, ratios of success to failure to complete the task, time spent on errors, the number of errors, rating scale of satisfactions, number of times user seems frustrated, etc. Additional observations of the users give designers insight on navigation difficulties, controls, conceptual models, etc. The ultimate goal of analyzing these metrics is to find/create a prototype design that users like and use to successfully perform given tasks. After conducting usability tests, it is important for a designer to record what was observed, in addition to why such behavior occurred and modify the model according to the results. Often it is quite difficult to distinguish the source of the design errors, and what the user did wrong. However, effective usability tests will not generate a solution to the problems, but provide modified design guidelines for continued testing.

====Remote usability testing====
Remote usability testing (also known as unmoderated or asynchronous usability testing) involves the use of a specially modified online survey, allowing the quantification of user testing studies by providing the ability to generate large sample sizes, or a deep qualitative analysis without the need for dedicated facilities. Additionally, this style of user testing also provides an opportunity to segment feedback by demographic, attitudinal and behavioral type. The tests are carried out in the user&#x27;s own environment (rather than labs) helping further simulate real-life scenario testing. This approach also provides a vehicle to easily solicit feedback from users in remote areas. There are two types, quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative use large sample sized and task based surveys. These types of studies are useful for validating suspected usability issues. Qualitative studies are best used as exploratory research, in small sample sizes but frequent, even daily iterations. Qualitative usually allows for observing respondent&#x27;s screens and verbal think aloud commentary (Screen Recording Video, SRV), and for a richer level of insight also include the webcam view of the respondent (Video-in-Video, ViV, sometimes referred to as Picture-in-Picture, PiP)

====Remote usability testing for mobile devices====
The growth in mobile and associated platforms and services (e.g.: Mobile gaming has experienced 20x growth in 2010–2012) has generated a need for unmoderated remote usability testing on mobile devices, both for websites but especially for app interactions. One methodology consists of shipping cameras and special camera holding fixtures to dedicated testers, and having them record the screens of the mobile smart-phone or tablet device, usually using an HD camera. A drawback of this approach is that the finger movements of the respondent can obscure the view of the screen, in addition to the bias and logistical issues inherent in shipping special hardware to selected respondents. A newer approach uses a wireless projection of the mobile device screen onto the computer desktop screen of the respondent, who can then be recorded through their webcam, and thus a combined Video-in-Video view of the participant and the screen interactions viewed simultaneously while incorporating the verbal think aloud commentary of the respondents.

====Thinking aloud====
The Think aloud protocol is a method of gathering data that is used in both usability and psychology studies. It involves getting a user to verbalize their thought processes (i.e. expressing their opinions, thoughts, anticipations, and actions) as they perform a task or set of tasks. As a widespread method of usability testing, think aloud provides the researchers with the ability to discover what user really think during task performance and completion.

Often an instructor is present to prompt the user into being more vocal as they work. Similar to the Subjects-in-Tandem method, it is useful in pinpointing problems and is relatively simple to set up. Additionally, it can provide insight into the user&#x27;s attitude, which can not usually be discerned from a survey or questionnaire.

====RITE method====
Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE) is an iterative usability method similar to traditional &quot;discount&quot; usability testing. The tester and team must define a target population for testing, schedule participants to come into the lab, decide on how the users behaviors will be measured, construct a test script and have participants engage in a verbal protocol (e.g., think aloud). However it differs from these methods in that it advocates that changes to the user interface are made as soon as a problem is identified and a solution is clear. Sometimes this can occur after observing as few as 1 participant. Once the data for a participant has been collected the usability engineer and team decide if they will be making any changes to the prototype prior to the next participant. The changed interface is then tested with the remaining users.

====Subjects-in-tandem or co-discovery====

Subjects-in-tandem (also called co-discovery) is the pairing of subjects in a usability test to gather important information on the ease of use of a product. Subjects tend to discuss the tasks they have to accomplish out loud and through these discussions observers learn where the problem areas of a design are. To encourage co-operative problem-solving between the two subjects, and the attendant discussions leading to it, the tests can be designed to make the subjects dependent on each other by assigning them complementary areas of responsibility (e.g. for testing of software, one subject may be put in charge of the mouse and the other of the keyboard.)

====Component-based usability testing====
Component-based usability testing is an approach which aims to test the usability of elementary units of an interaction system, referred to as interaction components. The approach includes component-specific quantitative measures based on user interaction recorded in log files, and component-based usability questionnaires.

===Other methods===
====Cognitive walkthrough====

Cognitive walkthrough is a method of evaluating the user interaction of a working prototype or final product. It is used to evaluate the system&#x27;s ease of learning. Cognitive walkthrough is useful to understand the user&#x27;s thought processes and decision making when interacting with a system, specially for first-time or infrequent users.

====Benchmarking====
Benchmarking creates standardized test materials for a specific type of design. Four key characteristics are considered when establishing a benchmark: time to do the core task, time to fix errors, time to learn applications, and the functionality of the system. Once there is a benchmark, other designs can be compared to it to determine the usability of the system. Many of the common objectives of usability studies, such as trying to understand user behavior or exploring alternative designs, must be put aside. Unlike many other usability methods or types of labs studies, benchmark studies more closely resemble true experimental psychology lab studies, with greater attention to detail on methodology, study protocol and data analysis.

====Meta-analysis====
Meta-analysis is a statistical procedure to combine results across studies to integrate the findings. This phrase was coined in 1976 as a quantitative literature review. This type of evaluation is very powerful for determining the usability of a device because it combines multiple studies to provide very accurate quantitative support.

====Persona====
Personas are fictitious characters created to represent a site or product&#x27;s different user types and their associated demographics and technographics. Alan Cooper introduced the concept of using personas as a part of interactive design in 1998 in his book &quot;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum&quot;, but had used this concept since as early as 1975. Personas are a usability evaluation method that can be used at various design stages. The most typical time to create personas is at the beginning of designing so that designers have a tangible idea of who the users of their product will be. Personas are the archetypes that represent actual groups of users and their needs, which can be a general description of person, context, or usage scenario. This technique turns marketing data on target user population into a few physical concepts of users to create empathy among the design team, with the final aim of tailoring a product more closely to how the personas will use it. To gather the marketing data that personas require, several tools can be used, including online surveys, web analytics, customer feedback forms, and usability tests, and interviews with customer-service representatives.

==Benefits ==
The key benefits of usability are:
* Higher revenues through increased sales
* Increased user efficiency and user satisfaction
* Reduced development costs
* Reduced support costs

===Corporate integration===
An increase in usability generally positively affects several facets of a company&#x27;s output quality. In particular, the benefits fall into several common areas:
* Increased productivity
* Decreased training and support costs
* Increased sales and revenues
* Reduced development time and costs
* Reduced maintenance costs
* Increased customer satisfaction

Increased usability in the workplace fosters several responses from employees: &quot;Workers who enjoy their work do it better, stay longer in the face of temptation, and contribute ideas and enthusiasm to the evolution of enhanced productivity.&quot; To create standards, companies often implement experimental design techniques that create baseline levels. Areas of concern in an office environment include (though are not necessarily limited to):
* Working posture
* Design of workstation furniture
* Screen displays
* Input devices
* Organization issues
* Office environment
* Software interface

By working to improve said factors, corporations can achieve their goals of increased output at lower costs, while potentially creating optimal levels of customer satisfaction. There are numerous reasons why each of these factors correlates to overall improvement. For example, making software user interfaces easier to understand reduces the need for extensive training. The improved interface tends to lower the time needed to perform tasks, and so would both raise the productivity levels for employees and reduce development time (and thus costs). Each of the aforementioned factors are not mutually exclusive; rather they should be understood to work in conjunction to form the overall workplace environment. In the 2010s, usability is recognized as an important software quality attribute, earning its place among more traditional attributes such as performance, robustness and aesthetic appearance. Various academic programs focus on usability. Several usability consultancy companies have emerged, and traditional consultancy and design firms offer similar services.

There is some resistance to integrating usability work in organisations. Usability is seen as a vague concept, it is difficult to measure and other areas are prioritised when IT projects run out of time or money.

==Professional development==
Usability practitioners are sometimes trained as industrial engineers, psychologists, kinesiologists, systems design engineers, or with a degree in information architecture, information or library science, or Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). More often though they are people who are trained in specific applied fields who have taken on a usability focus within their organization. Anyone who aims to make tools easier to use and more effective for their desired function within the context of work or everyday living can benefit from studying usability principles and guidelines. For those seeking to extend their training, the User Experience Professionals&#x27; Association offers online resources, reference lists, courses, conferences, and local chapter meetings. The UXPA also sponsors World Usability Day each November. Related professional organizations include the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) and the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s special interest groups in Computer Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Design of Communication (SIGDOC) and Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH). The Society for Technical Communication also has a special interest group on Usability and User Experience (UUX). They publish a quarterly newsletter called &quot;Usability Interface&quot;.

<text>Astral projection (also known as astral travel, soul journey, soul wandering, spiritual journey, spiritual travel) is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience (OBE) that assumes the existence of a subtle body, known as the astral body or body of light, through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the astral plane.

The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The term &quot;astral projection&quot; was coined and promoted by 19th-century Theosophists. It is sometimes associated with dreams and forms of meditation. Some individuals have reported perceptions similar to descriptions of astral projection that were induced through various hallucinogenic and hypnotic means (including self-hypnosis). There is no scientific evidence that there is a consciousness whose embodied functions are separate from normal neural activity or that one can consciously leave the body and make observations of the physical universe. As a result, astral projection has been characterized as a pseudoscience.

==Accounts==
===Ancient Egyptian===
Similar concepts of soul travel appear in various other religious traditions. For example, ancient Egyptian teachings present the soul (&quot;ba&quot;) as having the ability to hover outside the physical body via the &quot;ka&quot;, or subtle body.

===Indigenous traditions===

====Amazon====
The &quot;yaskomo&quot; of the Waiwai is believed to have the ability to perform a soul flight that can serve several functions, such as healing; flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the Moon or the Brother of the Moon) to obtain a name for a newborn baby; flying to the cave of peccaries&#x27; mountains to ask the father of peccaries for abundance of game; or flying deep down into a river to seek the aid of other beings.

====Inuit====
In some Inuit groups, individuals with special capabilities, known as angakkuq, are said to be able to travel to (mythological) remote places, and report their experiences and important matters back to their community. Those abilities would be unavailable to individuals with normal capabilities. Among other things, an angakkuq was said to have the ability to stop bad hunting luck or heal a sick person.

===Hindu===
Similar ideas such as the Liṅga Śarīra are found in ancient Hindu scriptures such as the &quot;Yogavashishta-Maharamayana of Valmiki&quot;. Modern Indians who have vouched for astral projection include Paramahansa Yogananda who witnessed Swami Pranabananda doing a miracle through a possible astral projection.

The Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba described one&#x27;s use of astral projection:

Astral projection is one of the &quot;siddhis&quot; (&#x27;magical powers&#x27;) considered achievable by yoga practitioners through self-disciplined practice. In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Drona leaves his physical body to see if his son is alive.

===Japanese===
In Japanese mythology, an is a manifestation of the soul of a living person separately from their body. Traditionally, if someone holds a sufficient grudge against another person, it is believed that a part or the whole of their soul can temporarily leave their body and appear before the target of their hate in order to curse or otherwise harm them, similar to an evil eye. Souls are also believed to leave a living body when the body is extremely sick or comatose; but such are not malevolent.

===Taoist===
Taoist alchemical practice involves creation of an energy body by breathing meditations, drawing energy into a &#x27;pearl&#x27; that is then circulated.

===Judaic and Christian===
Carrington, Muldoon, Peterson, and Williams say that the subtle body is attached to the physical body by means of a psychic silver cord. The final chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes is often cited in this respect: &quot;Before the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain, or the wheel be broken at the cistern.&quot; Rabbi Nosson Scherman, however, contends that the context points to this being merely a metaphor, comparing the body to a machine, with the silver cord referring to the spine.

James Hankins argues that Paul&#x27;s Second Epistle to the Corinthians refers to the astral planes: &quot;I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows.&quot;

===Western esotericism===

According to the classical, medieval, renaissance Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and later Theosophist and Rosicrucian thought, the &#x27;astral body&#x27; is an intermediate body of light linking the rational soul to the physical body while the astral plane is an intermediate world of light between Heaven and Earth, composed of the spheres of the planets and stars. These astral spheres were held to be populated by angels, demons, and spirits.

In the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, for example, the individual is a microcosm (&quot;small world&quot;) of the universe (the macrocosm or &quot;great world&quot;). &quot;The rational soul...is akin to the great Soul of the World&quot; while &quot;the material universe, like the body, is made as a faded image of the Intelligible&quot;. Each succeeding plane of manifestation is causal to the next, a world-view known as emanationism; &quot;from the One proceeds Intellect, from Intellect Soul, and from Soul—in its lower phase, or that of Nature—the material universe&quot;. The idea of the astral figured prominently in the work of the nineteenth-century French occultist Eliphas Levi, whence it was adopted and developed further by Theosophy, and used afterwards by other esoteric movements.

The subtle bodies, and their associated planes of existence, form an essential part of some esoteric systems that deal with astral phenomena. Often these bodies and their planes of existence are depicted as a series of concentric circles or nested spheres, with a separate body traversing each realm.

==Terminology==
The expression &quot;astral projection&quot; came to be used in two different ways. For the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and some Theosophists, it retained the classical and medieval philosophers&#x27; meaning of journeying to other worlds, heavens, hells, the astrological spheres and other landscapes in the body of light; but outside these circles the term was increasingly applied to non-physical travel around the physical world.

Though this usage continues to be widespread, the term, &quot;etheric travel&quot;, used by some later Theosophists, offers a useful distinction. Some experimenters say they visit different times and/or places: &quot;etheric&quot;, then, is used to represent the sense of being out of the body in the physical world; whereas &quot;astral&quot; may connote some alteration in time-perception. Robert Monroe describes the former type of projection as &quot;Locale I&quot; or the &quot;Here-Now&quot;, involving people and places that exist: Robert Bruce calls it the &quot;Real Time Zone&quot; (RTZ) and describes it as the non-physical dimension-level closest to the physical. This etheric body is usually, though not always, invisible but is often perceived by the experient as connected to the physical body during separation by a silver cord. Some link falling dreams with projection.

According to Max Heindel, the etheric double serves as a medium between the astral and physical realms. In his system the ether, also called &quot;prana&quot;, is the vital force that empowers the physical forms to change. From his descriptions it can be inferred that, to him, when one views the physical during an out-of-body experience, one is not technically in the astral realm at all.

Other experiments may describe a domain that has no parallel to any known physical setting. Environments may be populated or unpopulated, artificial, natural or abstract, and the experience may be beatific, horrific or neutral. A common Theosophical belief is that one may access a compendium of mystical knowledge called the Akashic records. In many accounts the experiencer correlates the astral world with the world of dreams. Some even report seeing other dreamers enacting dream scenarios unaware of their wider environment.

The astral environment may also be divided into &quot;levels&quot; or &quot;sub-planes&quot; by theorists, but there are many different views in various traditions concerning the overall structure of the astral planes: they may include heavens and hells and other after-death spheres, transcendent environments, or other less-easily characterized states.

==Scientific reception==
There is no known scientific evidence that astral projection as an objective phenomenon exists, although there are cases of patients having experiences suggestive of astral projection from brain stimulation treatments and hallucinogenic drugs, such as ketamine, phencyclidine, and DMT. Subjects in parapsychological experiments have attempted to project their astral bodies to distant rooms and see what was happening. However, such experiments have not produced clear results.

Psychologist Donovan Rawcliffe wrote that astral projection can be explained by delusion, hallucination, and vivid dreams. Arthur W. Wiggins wrote that purported evidence of the ability to astrally travel great distances and give descriptions of places visited is predominantly anecdotal and considers astral travel an illusion. He looks to neuroanatomy, prior knowledge, and human belief and imagination to provide prosaic explanations for those who experience it. Robert Todd Carroll writes that the main evidence to support claims of astral travel is anecdotal and comes &quot;in the form of testimonials of those who claim to have experienced being out of their bodies when they may have been out of their minds.&quot;

==Notable practitioners==
Emanuel Swedenborg was one of the first practitioners to write extensively about the out-of-body experience, in his &quot;Spiritual Diary&quot; (1747–1765). In her book, &quot;My Religion&quot;, Helen Keller tells of her beliefs in Swedenborgianism and how she once traveled astrally to Athens: 

In occult traditions, practices range from inducing trance states to the mental construction of a second body, called the &quot;body of light&quot; by Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), through visualization and controlled breathing, followed by the transfer of consciousness to the secondary body by a mental act of will.

There are many 20th-century publications on astral projection, although only a few writers continue to be cited. These include Edgar Cayce (1877–1945), Hereward Carrington (1880–1958), Oliver Fox (1885–1949), Sylvan Muldoon (1903–1969), and Robert Monroe (1915–1995).

Robert Monroe&#x27;s accounts of journeys to other realms (1971–1994) popularized the term &quot;OBE&quot; and were translated into a large number of languages. Though his books themselves only placed secondary importance on descriptions of method, Monroe also founded an institute dedicated to research, exploration and non-profit dissemination of auditory technology for assisting others in achieving projection and related altered states of consciousness.

Carlos Castaneda (1925–1998) discusses his teacher Don Juan&#x27;s beliefs about &quot;the double&quot; and its abilities in his books &quot;Tales of Power&quot; (1974), &quot;The Second Ring of Power&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Art of Dreaming&quot; (1993). Florinda Donner, a student of Castaneda, further describes methods of using the double to access the physical world while dreaming and access the dream world while in a waking dream state in her 1992 book, &quot;Being-in-Dreaming&quot;.

Michael Crichton (1942–2008) gives lengthy and detailed explanations and experience of astral projection in his 1988 non-fiction book &quot;Travels&quot;. Robert Bruce, William Buhlman, Marilynn Hughes, and Albert Taylor have discussed their theories and findings on the syndicated show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; several times.

<text>André Sainte-Laguë (, 20 April 1882, Saint-Martin-Curton – 18 January 1950) was a French mathematician who was a pioneer in the area of graph theory.
His research on seat allocation methods (published in 1910) led to one being named after him, the Sainte-Laguë method. Also named after him is the Sainte-Laguë Index for measuring the proportionality of an electoral outcome.

He is also notable for his informal calculation that supposedly demonstrated that a bumblebee could not fly, referred to in the introduction of &#x27;Le Vol des Insectes&#x27; (Hermann and Cle, Paris, 1934) by the entomologist Antoine Magnan. This casual calculation was based on a comparison between an aeroplane and a bee, making the wrong assumption that bees&#x27; wings were smooth and flat. He, and others, soon corrected this assumption, but the story of the scientist who demonstrated that bee flight was impossible persists to this day.

He published several popular math texts, including &quot;From the known to the unknown&quot; (foreword by biologist Jean Rostand) which has been translated into several languages.

==Biography==

Born in Casteljaloux (Lot-et-Garonne) in 1882, Sainte-Laguë was admitted at once, at the age of 20 years at the Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole Normale Superieure. He chose the latter and became a professor in the provinces, then in Paris. During World War I, having been wounded three times, he was attached to the Department of Inventions of the Normal School from 1917 to 1919, studied long-range artillery shells, and thereafter, the flight of birds and matters relating to aviation (theory test fish).

After the First World War, as a professor in the schools of Paris, he became a lecturer in mathematics at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers. Then he received in 1938, the Chair of Applied Mathematics. He trained generations of engineers and technicians. He was the organizer and host of the Mathematics Section of the Palais de la Découverte (Palace of Discovery) and its famous &quot;Pi Room&quot;, 
where his encyclopedic mind is still present.

Besides his academic career, he led a life of an activist, especially the Confederation of Intellectual Workers, of which he was president in 1929. From the earliest days of the occupation, he took an important part in the resistance and was even imprisoned for a while. He resumed his duties at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers after the Liberation and had a growing number of students. At his death he was teaching three courses totaling two thousand five hundred students.

Officer of the Legion of Honour, Croix de Guerre and Medal of the Resistance, a professor at the School of Special Public Works, chairman of the International Confederation Intellectual of Workers, Vice-President of the Confederation of the Middle Class, former president of the Society of Fellows, former vice-president of National Economic Council, former member of the General Council of the Banque de France, former Deputy Provisional Consultative Assembly.(...)

His sudden death came at the very moment he had just accepted the chairmanship of the Committee of the League of Friends of the Psychic Institute, where he was vice president in 1949 and member since 1934. &quot;(R. Warcollier, Vice- President of IMI, January–February–March 1950)

<doc id="288291" wikidata="Q1361396" url="?curid=288291" title="Ricci flow">
<text>In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and geometric analysis, the Ricci flow ( , ), sometimes also referred to as Hamilton&#x27;s Ricci flow, is a certain partial differential equation for a Riemannian metric. It is often said to be analogous to the diffusion of heat and the heat equation, due to formal similarities in the mathematical structure of the equation. However, it is nonlinear and exhibits many phenomena not present in the study of the heat equation.

The Ricci flow, so named for the presence of the Ricci tensor in its definition, was introduced by Richard Hamilton, who used it through the 1980s to prove striking new results in Riemannian geometry. Later extensions of Hamilton&#x27;s methods by various authors resulted in new applications to geometry, including the resolution of the differentiable sphere conjecture by Simon Brendle and Richard Schoen.

Following the possibility that the singularities of solutions of the Ricci flow could identify the topological data predicted by William Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, Hamilton produced a number of results in the 1990s which were directed towards the conjecture&#x27;s resolution. In 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman presented a number of fundamental new results about the Ricci flow, including a novel variant of some technical aspects of Hamilton&#x27;s program. Perelman&#x27;s work is now widely regarded as forming the proof of the Thurston conjecture and the Poincaré conjecture, regarded as a special case of the former. It should be emphasized that the Poincare conjecture has been a well-known open problem in the field of geometric topology since 1904. These results by Hamilton and Perelman are considered as a milestone in the fields of geometry and topology.

== Mathematical definition ==
On a smooth manifold , a smooth Riemannian metric automatically determines the Ricci tensor . For each element of , by definition is a positive-definite inner product on the tangent space at . If given a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics , one may then consider the derivative , which then assigns to each particular value of and a symmetric bilinear form on . Since the Ricci tensor of a Riemannian metric also assigns to each a symmetric bilinear form on , the following definition is meaningful.
* Given a smooth manifold and an open real interval , a Ricci flow assigns, to each in the interval , a Riemannian metric on such that .
The Ricci tensor is often thought of as an average value of the sectional curvatures, or as an algebraic trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. However, for the analysis of existence and uniqueness of Ricci flows, it is extremely significant that the Ricci tensor can be defined, in local coordinates, by a formula involving the first and second derivatives of the metric tensor. This makes the Ricci flow into a geometrically-defined partial differential equation. The analysis of the ellipticity of the local coordinate formula provides the foundation for the existence of Ricci flows; see the following section for the corresponding result.

Let be a nonzero number. Given a Ricci flow on an interval , consider for between and . Then . So, with this very trivial change of parameters, the number −2 appearing in the definition of the Ricci flow could be replaced by any other nonzero number. For this reason, the use of −2 can be regarded as an arbitrary convention, albeit one which essentially every paper and exposition on Ricci flow follows. The only significant difference is that if −2 were replaced by a positive number, then the existence theorem discussed in the following section would become a theorem which produces a Ricci flow that moves backwards (rather than forwards) in parameter values from initial data.

The parameter is usually called , although this is only as part of standard informal terminology in the mathematical field of partial differential equations. It is not physically meaningful terminology. In fact, in the standard quantum field theoretic interpretation of the Ricci flow in terms of the renormalization group, the parameter corresponds to length or energy, rather than time.

===Normalized Ricci flow===
Suppose that is a compact smooth manifold, and let be a Ricci flow for in the interval . Define so that each of the Riemannian metrics has volume 1; this is possible since is compact. (More generally, it would be possible if each Riemannian metric had finite volume.) Then define to be the antiderivative of which vanishes at . Since is positive-valued, is a bijection onto its image . Now the Riemannian metrics , defined for parameters , satisfy
formula_1
Here denotes scalar curvature. This is called the normalized Ricci flow equation. Thus, with an explicitly defined change of scale and a reparametrization of the parameter values, a Ricci flow can be converted into a normalized Ricci flow. The converse also holds, by reversing the above calculations.

The primary reason for considering the normalized Ricci flow is that it allows a convenient statement of the major convergence theorems for Ricci flow. However, it is not essential to do so, and for virtually all purposes it suffices to consider Ricci flow in its standard form. Moreover, the normalized Ricci flow is not generally meaningful on noncompact manifolds.

==Existence and uniqueness==
Let formula_2 be a smooth closed manifold, and let formula_3 be any smooth Riemannian metric on formula_2. Making use of the Nash–Moser implicit function theorem, showed the following existence theorem:
* There exists a positive number formula_5 and a Ricci flow formula_6 parametrized by formula_7 such that formula_6 converges to formula_3 in the formula_10 topology as formula_11 decreases to 0.
He showed the following uniqueness theorem:
* If formula_12 and formula_13 are two Ricci flows as in the above existence theorem, then formula_14 for all formula_15
The existence theorem provides a one-parameter family of smooth Riemannian metrics. In fact, any such one-parameter family also depends smoothly on the parameter. Precisely, this says that relative to any smooth coordinate chart formula_16 on formula_2, the function formula_18 is smooth for any formula_19.

Dennis DeTurck subsequently gave a proof of the above results which uses the Banach implicit function theorem instead. His work is essentially a simpler Riemannian version of Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat&#x27;s well-known proof and interpretation of well-posedness for the Einstein equations in Lorentzian geometry.

As a consequence of Hamilton&#x27;s existence and uniqueness theorem, when given the data formula_20, one may speak unambiguously of &quot;the&quot; Ricci flow on formula_2 with initial data formula_3, and one may select formula_5 to take on its maximal possible value, which could be infinite. The principle behind virtually all major applications of Ricci flow, in particular in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture and geometrization conjecture, is that, as formula_11 approaches this maximal value, the behavior of the metrics formula_6 can reveal and reflect deep information about formula_2.

==Convergence theorems==
Complete expositions of the following convergence theorems are given in and .

The three-dimensional result is due to . Hamilton&#x27;s proof, inspired by and loosely modeled upon James Eells and Joseph Sampson&#x27;s epochal 1964 paper on convergence of the harmonic map heat flow, included many novel features, such as an extension of the maximum principle to the setting of symmetric 2-tensors. His paper (together with that of Eells−Sampson) is among the most widely cited in the field of differential geometry. There is an exposition of his result in .

In terms of the proof, the two-dimensional case is properly viewed as a collection of three different results, one for each of the cases in which the Euler characteristic of is positive, zero, or negative. As demonstrated by , the negative case is handled by the maximum principle, while the zero case is handled by integral estimates; the positive case is more subtle, and Hamilton dealt with the subcase in which has positive curvature by combining a straightforward adaptation of Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s gradient estimate to the Ricci flow together with an innovative &quot;entropy estimate&quot;. The full positive case was demonstrated by Bennett , in an extension of Hamilton&#x27;s techniques. Since any Ricci flow on a two-dimensional manifold is confined to a single conformal class, it can be recast as a partial differential equation for a scalar function on the fixed Riemannian manifold . As such, the Ricci flow in this setting can also be studied by purely analytic methods; correspondingly, there are alternative non-geometric proofs of the two-dimensional convergence theorem.

The higher-dimensional case has a longer history. Soon after Hamilton&#x27;s breakthrough result, Gerhard Huisken extended his methods to higher dimensions, showing that if almost has constant positive curvature (in the sense of smallness of certain components of the Ricci decomposition), then the normalized Ricci flow converges smoothly to constant curvature. found a novel formulation of the maximum principle in terms of trapping by convex sets, which led to a general criterion relating convergence of the Ricci flow of positively curved metrics to the existence of &quot;pinching sets&quot; for a certain multidimensional ordinary differential equation. As a consequence, he was able to settle the case in which is four-dimensional and has positive curvature operator. Twenty years later, Christoph Böhm and Burkhard Wilking found a new algebraic method of constructing &quot;pinching sets&quot;, thereby removing the assumption of four-dimensionality from Hamilton&#x27;s result (). Simon Brendle and Richard Schoen showed that positivity of the isotropic curvature is preserved by the Ricci flow on a closed manifold; by applying Böhm and Wilking&#x27;s method, they were able to derive a new Ricci flow convergence theorem (). Their convergence theorem included as a special case the resolution of the differentiable sphere theorem, which at the time had been a long-standing conjecture. The convergence theorem given above is due to , which subsumes the earlier higher-dimensional convergence results of Huisken, Hamilton, Böhm &amp; Wilking, and Brendle &amp; Schoen.

===Corollaries===
The results in dimensions three and higher show that any smooth closed manifold which admits a metric of the given type must be a space form of positive curvature. Since these space forms are largely understood by work of Élie Cartan and others, one may draw corollaries such as
* Suppose that is a smooth closed 3-dimensional manifold which admits a smooth Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature. If is simply-connected then it must be diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere.
So if one could show directly that any smooth closed simply-connected 3-dimensional manifold admits a smooth Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature, then the Poincaré conjecture would immediately follow. However, as matters are understood at present, this result is only known as a (trivial) corollary of the Poincaré conjecture, rather than vice versa.

===Possible extensions===
Given any larger than two, there exist many closed -dimensional smooth manifolds which do not have any smooth Riemannian metrics of constant curvature. So one cannot hope to be able to simply drop the curvature conditions from the above convergence theorems. It could be possible to replace the curvature conditions by some alternatives, but the existence of compact manifolds such as complex projective space, which has a metric of nonnegative curvature operator (the Fubini-Study metric) but no metric of constant curvature, makes it unclear how much these conditions could be pushed. Likewise, the possibility of formulating analogous convergence results for negatively curved Riemannian metrics is complicated by the existence of closed Riemannian manifolds whose curvature is arbitrarily close to constant and yet admit no metrics of constant curvature.

==Li–Yau inequalities==
Making use of a technique pioneered by Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau for parabolic differential equations on Riemannian manifolds, proved the following &quot;Li–Yau inequality&quot;.
* Let formula_2 be a smooth manifold, and let formula_6 be a solution of the Ricci flow with formula_7 such that each formula_6 is complete with bounded curvature. Furthermore, suppose that each formula_6 has nonnegative curvature operator. Then, for any curve formula_32 with formula_33, one has formula_34
 showed the following alternative Li–Yau inequality.
* Let formula_2 be a smooth closed formula_36-manifold, and let formula_6 be a solution of the Ricci flow. Consider the backwards heat equation for formula_36-forms, i.e. formula_39; given formula_40 and formula_41, consider the particular solution which, upon integration, converges weakly to the Dirac delta measure as formula_11 increases to formula_43. Then, for any curve formula_32 with formula_33, one has formula_46 where formula_47.
Both of these remarkable inequalities are of profound importance for the proof of the Poincaré conjecture and geometrization conjecture. The terms on the right hand side of Perelman&#x27;s Li–Yau inequality motivates the definition of his &quot;reduced length&quot; functional, the analysis of which leads to his &quot;noncollapsing theorem&quot;. The noncollapsing theorem allows application of Hamilton&#x27;s compactness theorem (Hamilton 1995) to construct &quot;singularity models&quot;, which are Ricci flows on new three-dimensional manifolds. Owing to the Hamilton–Ivey estimate, these new Ricci flows have nonnegative curvature. Hamilton&#x27;s Li–Yau inequality can then be applied to see that the scalar curvature is, at each point, a nondecreasing (nonnegative) function of time. This is a powerful result that allows many further arguments to go through. In the end, Perelman shows that any of his singularity models is asymptotically like a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, which are completely classified; see the previous section.

See for details on Hamilton&#x27;s Li–Yau inequality; the books and contain expositions of both inequalities above.

==Examples==

===Constant-curvature and Einstein metrics===
Let formula_48 be a Riemannian manifold which is Einstein, meaning that there is a number formula_49 such that formula_50. Then formula_51 is a Ricci flow with formula_52, since then
:formula_53
If formula_2 is closed, then according to Hamilton&#x27;s uniqueness theorem above, this is the only Ricci flow with initial data formula_55. One sees, in particular, that:
* if formula_49 is positive, then the Ricci flow &quot;contracts&quot; formula_55 since the scale factor formula_58 is less than 1 for positive formula_11; furthermore, one sees that formula_11 can only be less than formula_61, in order that formula_6 is a Riemannian metric. This is the simplest examples of a &quot;finite-time singularity&quot;. 
* if formula_49 is zero, which is synonymous with formula_55 being Ricci-flat, then formula_6 is independent of time, and so the maximal interval of existence is the entire real line.
* if formula_49 is negative, then the Ricci flow &quot;expands&quot; formula_55 since the scale factor formula_58 is greater than 1 for all positive formula_11; furthermore one sees that formula_11 can be taken arbitrarily large. One says that the Ricci flow, for this initial metric, is &quot;immortal&quot;.
In each case, since the Riemannian metrics assigned to different values of formula_11 differ only by a constant scale factor, one can see that the normalized Ricci flow formula_72 exists for all time and is constant in formula_73; in particular, it converges smoothly (to its constant value) as formula_74.

The Einstein condition has as a special case that of constant curvature; hence the particular examples of the sphere (with its standard metric) and hyperbolic space appear as special cases of the above.

===Ricci solitons===
Ricci solitons are Ricci flows that may change their size but not their shape up to diffeomorphisms.
* Cylinders S&quot;k&quot; × R&quot;l&quot; (for &quot;k&quot; ≥ 2) shrink self similarly under the Ricci flow up to diffeomorphisms
*A significant 2-dimensional example is the cigar soliton, which is given by the metric (&quot;dx&quot;2 + &quot;dy&quot;2)/(&quot;e&quot;4&quot;t&quot; + &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2) on the Euclidean plane. Although this metric shrinks under the Ricci flow, its geometry remains the same. Such solutions are called steady Ricci solitons.
* An example of a 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton is the Bryant soliton, which is rotationally symmetric, has positive curvature, and is obtained by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A similar construction works in arbitrary dimension.
* There exist numerous families of Kähler manifolds, invariant under a &quot;U&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) action and birational to &quot;Cn&quot;, which are Ricci solitons. These examples were constructed by Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf. (Chow-Knopf 2004)
* A 4-dimensional example exhibiting only torus symmetry was recently discovered by Bamler-Cifarelli-Conlon-Deruelle. 
A gradient shrinking Ricci soliton consists of a smooth Riemannian manifold (&quot;M&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) and &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;) such that
:formula_75
One of the major achievements of was to show that, if &quot;M&quot; is a closed three-dimensional smooth manifold, then finite-time singularities of the Ricci flow on &quot;M&quot; are modeled on complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons (possibly on underlying manifolds distinct from &quot;M&quot;). In 2008, Huai-Dong Cao, Bing-Long Chen, and Xi-Ping Zhu completed the classification of these solitons, showing:
* Suppose (&quot;M&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) is a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with dim(&quot;M&quot;) = 3. If &quot;M&quot; is simply-connected then the Riemannian manifold (&quot;M&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) is isometric to formula_76, formula_77, or formula_78, each with their standard Riemannian metrics. This was originally shown by with some extra conditional assumptions. Note that if &quot;M&quot; is not simply-connected, then one may consider the universal cover formula_79 and then the above theorem applies to formula_80

There is not yet a good understanding of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons in any higher dimensions.

== Relationship to uniformization and geometrization ==
Hamilton&#x27;s first work on Ricci flow was published at the same time as William Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, which concerns the topological classification of three-dimensional smooth manifolds. Hamilton&#x27;s idea was to define a kind of nonlinear diffusion equation which would tend to smooth out irregularities in the metric. Suitable canonical forms had already been identified by Thurston; the possibilities, called Thurston model geometries, include the three-sphere S3, three-dimensional Euclidean space E3, three-dimensional hyperbolic space H3, which are homogeneous and isotropic, and five slightly more exotic Riemannian manifolds, which are homogeneous but not isotropic. (This list is closely related to, but not identical with, the Bianchi classification of the three-dimensional real Lie algebras into nine classes.)

Hamilton succeeded in proving that any smooth closed three-manifold which admits a metric of &quot;positive&quot; Ricci curvature also admits a unique Thurston geometry, namely a spherical metric, which does indeed act like an attracting fixed point under the Ricci flow, renormalized to preserve volume. (Under the unrenormalized Ricci flow, the manifold collapses to a point in finite time.) However, this doesn&#x27;t prove the full geometrization conjecture, because of the restrictive assumption on curvature.

Indeed, a triumph of nineteenth-century geometry was the proof of the uniformization theorem, the analogous topological classification of smooth two-manifolds, where Hamilton showed that the Ricci flow does indeed evolve a negatively curved two-manifold into a two-dimensional multi-holed torus which is locally isometric to the hyperbolic plane. This topic is closely related to important topics in analysis, number theory, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, and even cosmology.

Note that the term &quot;uniformization&quot; suggests a kind of smoothing away of irregularities in the geometry, while the term &quot;geometrization&quot; suggests placing a geometry on a smooth manifold. &quot;Geometry&quot; is being used here in a precise manner akin to Klein&#x27;s notion of geometry (see Geometrization conjecture for further details). In particular, the result of geometrization may be a geometry that is not isotropic. In most cases including the cases of constant curvature, the geometry is unique. An important theme in this area is the interplay between real and complex formulations. In particular, many discussions of uniformization speak of complex curves rather than real two-manifolds.

==Singularities==
Hamilton showed that a compact Riemannian manifold always admits a short-time Ricci flow solution. Later Shi generalized the short-time existence result to complete manifolds of bounded curvature. In general, however, due to the highly non-linear nature of the Ricci flow equation, singularities form in finite time. These singularities are curvature singularities, which means that as one approaches the singular time the norm of the curvature tensor formula_81 blows up to infinity in the region of the singularity. A fundamental problem in Ricci flow is to understand all the possible geometries of singularities. When successful, this can lead to insights into the topology of manifolds. For instance, analyzing the geometry of singular regions that may develop in 3d Ricci flow, is the crucial ingredient in Perelman&#x27;s proof of the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures.

===Blow-up limits of singularities===

To study the formation of singularities it is useful, as in the study of other non-linear differential equations, to consider blow-ups limits. Intuitively speaking, one zooms into the singular region of the Ricci flow by rescaling time and space. Under certain assumptions, the zoomed in flow tends to a limiting Ricci flow formula_82, called a singularity model. Singularity models are ancient Ricci flows, i.e. they can be extended infinitely into the past. Understanding the possible singularity models in Ricci flow is an active research endeavor.

Below, we sketch the blow-up procedure in more detail: Let formula_83 be a Ricci flow that develops a singularity as formula_84. Let formula_85 be a sequence of points in spacetime such that 
:formula_86
as formula_87. Then one considers the parabolically rescaled metrics
:formula_88
Due to the symmetry of the Ricci flow equation under parabolic dilations, the metrics formula_89 are also solutions to the Ricci flow equation. In the case that
:formula_90
i.e. up to time formula_91 the maximum of the curvature is attained at formula_92, then the pointed sequence of Ricci flows formula_93 subsequentially converges smoothly to a limiting ancient Ricci flow formula_94. Note that in general formula_95 is not diffeomorphic to formula_2.

===Type I and Type II singularities===
Hamilton distinguishes between Type I and Type II singularities in Ricci flow. In particular, one says a Ricci flow formula_97, encountering a singularity a time formula_5 is of Type I if
:formula_99.
Otherwise the singularity is of Type II. It is known that the blow-up limits of Type I singularities are gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. In the Type II case it is an open question whether the singularity model must be a steady Ricci soliton—so far all known examples are.

===Singularities in 3d Ricci flow===
In 3d the possible blow-up limits of Ricci flow singularities are well-understood. From the work of Hamilton, Perelman and Brendle, blowing up at points of maximum curvature leads to one of the following three singularity models:
* The shrinking round spherical space form formula_100
* The shrinking round cylinder formula_101 
* The Bryant soliton
The first two singularity models arise from Type I singularities, whereas the last one arises from a Type II singularity.

===Singularities in 4d Ricci flow===
In four dimensions very little is known about the possible singularities, other than that the possibilities are far more numerous than in three dimensions. To date the following singularity models are known
*formula_102
*formula_103
*The 4d Bryant soliton
*Compact Einstein manifold of positive scalar curvature
*Compact gradient Kahler–Ricci shrinking soliton
*The FIK shrinker (discovered by M. Feldman, T. Ilmanen, D. Knopf) 
*The BCCD shrinker (discovered by Richard Bamler, Charles Cifarelli, Ronan Conlon, and Alix Deruelle) 
Note that the first three examples are generalizations of 3d singularity models. The FIK shrinker models the collapse of an embedded sphere with self-intersection number −1.

== Relation to diffusion ==
To see why the evolution equation defining the Ricci flow is indeed a kind of nonlinear diffusion equation, we can consider the special case of (real) two-manifolds in more detail. Any metric tensor on a two-manifold can be written with respect to an exponential isothermal coordinate chart in the form
:formula_104
(These coordinates provide an example of a conformal coordinate chart, because angles, but not distances, are correctly represented.)

The easiest way to compute the Ricci tensor and Laplace-Beltrami operator for our Riemannian two-manifold is to use the differential forms method of Élie Cartan. Take the coframe field
:formula_105
so that metric tensor becomes
:formula_106

Next, given an arbitrary smooth function formula_107, compute the exterior derivative
:formula_108
Take the Hodge dual
:formula_109
Take another exterior derivative
:formula_110
(where we used the anti-commutative property of the exterior product). That is,
:formula_111
Taking another Hodge dual gives
:formula_112
which gives the desired expression for the Laplace/Beltrami operator
:formula_113

To compute the curvature tensor, we take the exterior derivative of the covector fields making up our coframe:
:formula_114
:formula_115
From these expressions, we can read off the only independent spin connection one-form
:formula_116
where we have taken advantage of the anti-symmetric property of the connection (formula_117). Take another exterior derivative
:formula_118
This gives the curvature two-form
:formula_119
from which we can read off the only linearly independent component of the Riemann tensor using
:formula_120
Namely
:formula_121
from which the only nonzero components of the Ricci tensor are
:formula_122
From this, we find components with respect to the coordinate cobasis, namely
:formula_123

But the metric tensor is also diagonal, with
:formula_124
and after some elementary manipulation, we obtain an elegant expression for the Ricci flow:
:formula_125
This is manifestly analogous to the best known of all diffusion equations, the heat equation
:formula_126
where now formula_127 is the usual Laplacian on the Euclidean plane.
The reader may object that the heat equation is of course a linear partial differential equation—where is the promised &quot;nonlinearity&quot; in the p.d.e. defining the Ricci flow?

The answer is that nonlinearity enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking formula_128. So if formula_129 is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out the same way that heat can be carried off &quot;to infinity&quot; in an infinite flat plate. But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to &quot;homogenize&quot; the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero. In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not to turn it into a flat Euclidean geometry.

==Recent developments==

The Ricci flow has been intensively studied since 1981. Some recent work has focused on the question of precisely how higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds evolve under the Ricci flow, and in particular, what types of parametric singularities may form. For instance, a certain class of solutions to the Ricci flow demonstrates that neckpinch singularities will form on an evolving formula_36-dimensional metric Riemannian manifold having a certain topological property (positive Euler characteristic), as the flow approaches some characteristic time formula_131. In certain cases, such neckpinches will produce manifolds called Ricci solitons.

For a 3-dimensional manifold, Perelman showed how to continue past the singularities using surgery on the manifold.

Kähler metrics remain Kähler under Ricci flow, and so Ricci flow has also been studied in this setting, where it is called Kähler–Ricci flow.

<text>Neuropsychology is a branch of psychology concerned with how a person&#x27;s cognition and behavior are related to the brain and the rest of the nervous system. Professionals in this branch of psychology focus on how injuries or illnesses of the brain affect cognitive and behavioral functions.

It is both an experimental and clinical field of patient-focused psychology. Thus aiming to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain function. It is also concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the pathology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind through the study of neurological patients. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term &quot;neuropsychology&quot; has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied in efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients).

In practice, neuropsychologists tend to work in research settings (universities, laboratories, or research institutions), clinical settings (medical hospitals or rehabilitation settings, often involved in assessing or treating patients with neuropsychological problems), and forensic settings or industry (often as clinical-trial consultants where CNS function is a concern).

== History ==
Neuropsychology is a relatively new discipline within the field of psychology. The first textbook defining the field, &quot;Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology&quot;, was initially published by Kolb and Whishaw in 1980. However, the history of its development can be traced back to the Third Dynasty in ancient Egypt, perhaps even earlier. There is much debate as to when societies started considering the functions of different organs. For many centuries, the brain was thought useless and was often discarded during burial processes and autopsies. As the field of medicine developed its understanding of human anatomy and physiology, different theories were developed as to why the body functioned the way it did. Many times, bodily functions were approached from a religious point of view, and abnormalities were blamed on bad spirits and the gods. The brain has not always been considered the center of the functioning body. It has taken hundreds of years to develop our understanding of the brain and how it affects our behaviors.

=== Ancient Egypt ===
In ancient Egypt, writings on medicine date from the time of the priest Imhotep. They took a more scientific approach to medicine and disease, describing the brain, trauma, abnormalities, and remedies for reference for future physicians. Despite this, Egyptians saw the heart, not the brain, as the seat of the soul.

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle reinforced this focus on the heart which originated in Egypt. He believed the heart to be in control of mental processes, and looked on the brain, due to its inert nature, as a mechanism for cooling the heat generated by the heart. He drew his conclusions based on the empirical study of animals. He found that while their brains were cold to the touch and that such contact did not trigger any movements, the heart was warm and active, accelerating and slowing dependent on mood. Such beliefs were upheld by many for years to come, persisting through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period until they began to falter in the 17th century due to further research. The influence of Aristotle in the development of neuropsychology is evident within language used in modern day, since we &quot;follow our hearts&quot; and &quot;learn by the heart.&quot; 

=== Hippocrates ===
Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of the soul. He drew a connection between the brain and behaviors of the body, writing: &quot;The brain exercises the greatest power in the man.&quot; Apart from moving the focus from the heart as the &quot;seat of the soul&quot; to the brain, Hippocrates did not go into much detail about its actual functioning. However, by switching the attention of the medical community to the brain, his theory led to more scientific discovery of the organ responsible for our behaviors. For years to come, scientists were inspired to explore the functions of the body and to find concrete explanations for both normal and abnormal behaviors. Scientific discovery led them to believe that there were natural and organically occurring reasons to explain various functions of the body, and it could all be traced back to the brain. Hippocrates introduced the concept of the mind – which was widely seen as a separate function apart from the actual brain organ.

=== René Descartes ===
Philosopher René Descartes expanded upon this idea and is most widely known for his work on the mind–body problem. Often Descartes&#x27;s ideas were looked upon as overly philosophical and lacking in sufficient scientific foundation. Descartes focused much of his anatomical experimentation on the brain, paying special attention to the pineal gland – which he argued was the actual &quot;seat of the soul.&quot; Still deeply rooted in a spiritual outlook towards the scientific world, the body was said to be mortal, and the soul immortal. The pineal gland was then thought to be the very place at which the mind would interact with the mortal and machine-like body. At the time, Descartes was convinced the mind had control over the behaviors of the body (controlling the person) – but also that the body could have influence over the mind, which is referred to as dualism. This idea that the mind essentially had control over the body, but the body could resist or even influence other behaviors, was a major turning point in the way many physiologists would look at the brain. The capabilities of the mind were observed to do much more than simply react, but also to be rational and function in organized, thoughtful ways – much more complex than he thought the animal world to be. These ideas, although disregarded by many and cast aside for years led the medical community to expand their own ideas of the brain and begin to understand in new ways just how intricate the workings of the brain really were, and the complete effects it had on daily life, as well as which treatments would be the most beneficial to helping those people living with a dysfunctional mind. The mind–body problem, spurred by René Descartes, continues to this day with many philosophical arguments both for and against his ideas. However controversial they were and remain today, the fresh and well-thought-out perspective Descartes presented has had long-lasting effects on the various disciplines of medicine, psychology, and much more, especially in putting an emphasis on separating the mind from the body in order to explain observable behaviors.

=== Thomas Willis ===

It was in the mid-17th century that another major contributor to the field of neuropsychology emerged. Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words &#x27;hemisphere&#x27; and &#x27;lobe&#x27; when referring to the brain. He was one of the earliest to use the words &#x27;neurology&#x27; and &#x27;psychology&#x27;. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses. He was particularly interested in people with manic disorders and hysteria. His research constituted some of the first times that psychiatry and neurology came together to study individuals. Through his in-depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats, and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, and led the way for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came to looking at disorders and dysfunctions in the brain.

=== Franz Joseph Gall ===
Neuroanatomist and physiologist Franz Joseph Gall made major progress in understanding the brain. He theorized that personality was directly related to features and structures within the brain. However, Gall&#x27;s major contribution within the field of neuroscience is his invention of phrenology. This new discipline looked at the brain as an organ of the mind, where the shape of the skull could ultimately determine one&#x27;s intelligence and personality. This theory was like many circulating at the time, as many scientists were taking into account physical features of the face and body, head size, anatomical structure, and levels of intelligence; only Gall looked primarily at the brain. There was much debate over the validity of Gall&#x27;s claims however, because he was often found to be wrong in his predictions. He was once sent a cast of René Descartes&#x27; skull, and through his method of phrenology claimed the subject must have had a limited capacity for reasoning and higher cognition. As controversial and false as many of Gall&#x27;s claims were, his contributions to understanding cortical regions of the brain and localized activity continued to advance understanding of the brain, personality, and behavior. His work is considered crucial to having laid a firm foundation in the field of neuropsychology, which would flourish over the next few decades.

=== Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud ===

Towards the late 19th century, the belief that the size of ones skull could determine their level of intelligence was discarded as science and medicine moved forward. A physician by the name of Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud expanded upon the ideas of Gall and took a closer look at the idea of distinct cortical regions of the brain each having their own independent function. Bouillaud was specifically interested in speech and wrote many publications on the anterior region of the brain being responsible for carrying out the act of ones speech, a discovery that had stemmed from the research of Gall. He was also one of the first to use larger samples for research although it took many years for that method to be accepted. By looking at over a hundred different case studies, Bouillaud came to discover that it was through different areas of the brain that speech is completed and understood. By observing people with brain damage, his theory was made more concrete. Bouillaud, along with many other pioneers of the time made great advances within the field of neurology, especially when it came to localization of function. There are many arguable debates as to who deserves the most credit for such discoveries, and often, people remain unmentioned, but Paul Broca is perhaps one of the most famous and well known contributors to neuropsychology – often referred to as &quot;the father&quot; of the discipline.

=== Paul Broca ===
Inspired by the advances being made in the area of localized function within the brain, Paul Broca committed much of his study to the phenomena of how speech is understood and produced. Through his study, it was discovered and expanded upon that we articulate via the left hemisphere. Broca&#x27;s observations and methods are widely considered to be where neuropsychology really takes form as a recognizable and respected discipline. Armed with the understanding that specific, independent areas of the brain are responsible for articulation and understanding of speech, the brains abilities were finally being acknowledged as the complex and highly intricate organ that it is. Broca was essentially the first to fully break away from the ideas of phrenology and delve deeper into a more scientific and psychological view of the brain.

=== Carl Wernicke ===
Carl Wernicke was an influential nineteenth century neuropsychiatrist specifically interested in understanding how abnormalities could be localized to specific brain regions. Previously held theories attributed brain function as one singular process but Wernicke was one of the first to attribute brain function to different regions of the brain based on sensory and motor function. In 1873, Wernicke observed a patient presenting with poor language comprehension despite maintaining intact speech and hearing following a severe stroke. Post-morbid analysis revealed a lesion near the auditory region of the brain in the parietal-temporal region of the left hemisphere. Originally named sensory aphasia, this region later became known as Wernicke&#x27;s area. Individuals with damage to this area present with fluent but receptive aphasia characterized by the inability to comprehend or express written or spoken language while maintaining intact speech and auditory processes. Along with Paul Broca, Wernicke&#x27;s contributions greatly expanded the present knowledge of language development and localization of left hemispheric function.

=== Karl Spencer Lashley ===

Lashley&#x27;s works and theories that follow are summarized in his book Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence. Lashley&#x27;s theory of the Engram was the driving force for much of his research. An engram was believed to be a part of the brain where a specific memory was stored. He continued to use the training/ablation method that Franz had taught him. He would train a rat to learn a maze and then use systematic lesions and removed sections of cortical tissue to see if the rat forgot what it had learned.

Through his research with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent on the amount of tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this &quot;mass action&quot; and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that mass action was a misinterpretation of his empirical results, because in order to run a maze the rats required multiple cortical areas. Cutting into small individual parts alone will not impair the rats&#x27; brains much, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time, affecting various functions such as sight, motor coordination, and memory, making the animal unable to run a maze properly.

Lashley also proposed that a portion of a functional area could carry out the role of the entire area, even when the rest of the area has been removed. He called this phenomenon &quot;equipotentiality&quot;. We know now that he was seeing evidence of plasticity in the brain: within certain constraints the brain has the ability for certain areas to take over the functions of other areas if those areas should fail or be removed – although not to the extent initially argued by Lashley.

== Approaches ==
Experimental neuropsychology is an approach that uses methods from experimental psychology to uncover the relationship between the nervous system and cognitive function. The majority of work involves studying healthy humans in a laboratory setting, although a minority of researchers may conduct animal experiments. Human work in this area often takes advantage of specific features of our nervous system (for example that visual information presented to a specific visual field is preferentially processed by the cortical hemisphere on the opposite side) to make links between neuroanatomy and psychological function.

Clinical neuropsychology is the application of neuropsychological knowledge to the assessment (see neuropsychological test and neuropsychological assessment), management, and rehabilitation of people who have experienced illness or injury (particularly to the brain) which has caused neurocognitive problems. In particular they bring a psychological viewpoint to treatment, to understand how such illness and injury may affect and be affected by psychological factors. They also can offer an opinion as to whether a person is demonstrating difficulties due to brain pathology or as a consequence of an emotional or another (potentially) reversible cause or both. For example, a test might show that both patients X and Y are unable to name items that they have been previously exposed to within the past 20 minutes (indicating possible dementia). If patient Y can name some of them with further prompting (e.g. given a categorical clue such as being told that the item they could not name is a fruit), this allows a more specific diagnosis than simply dementia (Y appears to have the vascular type which is due to brain pathology but is usually at least somewhat reversible). Clinical neuropsychologists often work in hospital settings in an interdisciplinary medical team; others work in private practice and may provide expert input into medico-legal proceedings.
Current research into biological science of memory bridges multiple scales, from the molecular to
the neuropsychological (Moscovitch et al., 2016). Memory needs specific details on the specifics of
synaptic dynamism and also requires an explanation of the comprehension procedures and memory
structures having neurobiological capabilities.

Cognitive neuropsychology is a relatively new development and has emerged as a distillation of the complementary approaches of both experimental and clinical neuropsychology. It seeks to understand the mind and brain by studying people with brain injuries or neurological illnesses. One model of neuropsychological functioning is known as functional localization. This is based on the principle that if a specific cognitive problem can be found after an injury to a specific area of the brain, it is possible that this part of the brain is in some way involved. However, there may be reason to believe that the link between mental functions and neural regions is not so simple. An alternative model of the link between mind and brain, such as parallel processing, may have more explanatory power for the workings and dysfunction of the human brain. Yet another approach investigates how the pattern of errors produced by brain-damaged individuals can constrain our understanding of mental representations and processes without reference to the underlying neural structure. A more recent but related approach is cognitive neuropsychiatry which seeks to understand the normal function of mind and brain by studying psychiatric or mental illness.

Connectionism is the use of artificial neural networks to model specific cognitive processes using what are considered to be simplified but plausible models of how neurons operate. Once trained to perform a specific cognitive task these networks are often damaged or &#x27;lesioned&#x27; to simulate brain injury or impairment in an attempt to understand and compare the results to the effects of brain injury in humans.

Functional neuroimaging uses specific neuroimaging technologies to take readings from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In particular, the growth of methodologies to employ cognitive testing within established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to study brain-behavior relations is having a notable influence on neuropsychological research.

In practice these approaches are not mutually exclusive and most neuropsychologists select the best approach or approaches for the task to be completed.

== Methods and tools ==
=== Standardized neuropsychological tests ===

These tasks have been designed so the performance on the task can be linked to specific neurocognitive processes. These tests are typically standardized, meaning that they have been administered to a specific group (or groups) of individuals before being used in individual clinical cases. The data resulting from standardization are known as normative data. After these data have been collected and analyzed, they are used as the comparative standard against which individual performances can be compared. Examples of neuropsychological tests include: the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Boston Naming Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association. When interpreting neuropsychological testing it is important that the diagnosis is empirically informed in order to determine if the cognitive deficits presented are legitimate. Successful malingering and symptom exaggeration can result in substantial benefits for the individual including but not limited to significant financial compensation, injury litigation, disability claims, and criminal sentencing. Due to the nature of these potential benefits, it is imperative that malingering is identified in neuropsychological tests in order to avoid making an invalid diagnosis. The Slick, Sherman, and Iverson (1999) criteria for Malingered Neurocognitive Dysfunction (MND) has pioneered the ability to detect malingering in a variety of performance validity tests (PVT) and symptom validity tests (SVT) across multiple neuropsychological contexts and disorders. These tests detect malingering by identifying performance that is below the level of probability for neuropsychological dysfunction.

=== Brain scans ===
The use of brain scans to investigate the structure or function of the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high resolution pictures, or by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and positron emission tomography (PET), which yields data related to functioning, as well as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), computed axial tomography (CAT or CT), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which yields structural data.

=== Global Brain Project ===
Brain models based on mice and monkeys have been developed based on theoretical neuroscience involving working memory and attention, while mapping brain activity based on time constants validated by measurements of neuronal activity in various layers of the brain. These methods also map to decision states of behavior in simple tasks that involve binary outcomes.

=== Electrophysiology ===

The use of electrophysiological measures designed to measure the activation of the brain by measuring the electrical or magnetic field produced by the nervous system. This may include electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG).

=== Experimental tasks ===
The use of designed experimental tasks, often controlled by computer and typically measuring reaction time and accuracy on a particular tasks thought to be related to a specific neurocognitive process. An example of this is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) or CNS Vital Signs (CNSVS).

<doc id="288299" wikidata="Q374762" url="?curid=288299" title="John Hoeven">
<text>John Henry Hoeven III ( ; born March 13, 1957) is an American banker and politician serving as the senior U.S. senator from North Dakota, a seat he has held since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, Hoeven served as the 31st governor of North Dakota from 2000 to 2010.

In 2010, Hoeven was elected to the U.S. Senate, succeeding Senator Byron Dorgan, who chose not to seek reelection. Hoeven became North Dakota&#x27;s senior senator in 2013 after Kent Conrad retired and was succeeded by Heidi Heitkamp, who was once Hoeven&#x27;s opponent for the governor&#x27;s office.

Before being elected governor, Hoeven was a banker who served in numerous executive roles at various banks, most notably as president of the nation&#x27;s only state-owned bank, the Bank of North Dakota, from 1993 to 2000. He is on the board of directors at First Western Bank &amp; Trust and has an estimated net worth of $45 million, making him one of the wealthiest U.S. senators. He is the dean of North Dakota&#x27;s congressional delegation.

==Early life and education==
Hoeven was born in Bismarck, North Dakota, the son of Patricia &quot;Trish&quot; (née Chapman) and John Henry &quot;Jack&quot; Hoeven, Jr. His father owned a bank in Minot, North Dakota, where he worked as the president and chairman. Hoeven&#x27;s ancestry is Dutch, Swedish, and English.

Hoeven studied at Dartmouth College, which his father also attended. Hoeven belonged to the Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity and graduated with honors with a B.A. in 1979. While there, he played on the men&#x27;s golf team.

After Dartmouth, Hoeven attended the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, graduating with an MBA in 1981.

== Banking career ==
From 1986 to 1993, Hoeven was executive vice president of First Western Bank &amp; Trust, an institution his father bought in 1970. At one time, he owned 39% of the bank’s parent company, Westbrand, Inc. From 1993 to 2000, he was the president and CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, under governor Ed Schafer.

==Governor of North Dakota==

=== Elections ===

==== 2000 ====

In 2000 Hoeven ran for governor of North Dakota as a Republican and won, defeating Democratic NPL nominee Heidi Heitkamp, 55% to 45%.

==== 2004 ====

Hoeven was reelected over Democratic-NPL nominee Joe Satrom with 71% of the vote.

==== 2008 ====

On November 13, 2007, Hoeven announced his candidacy for a third term and kicked off his campaign with stops in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck and Minot. He was reelected with 74% of the vote over Democratic-NPL nominee Tim Mathern. It was the first time in North Dakota history that a governor won three four-year terms in office, though the record for serving is still maintained by Bill Guy, who served 12 years.

===Tenure===
Hoeven&#x27;s governorship included the expansion and diversification of the state&#x27;s economy, which led to a 49.5% increase in the state&#x27;s real gross domestic product. Beginning in 2000, he directed the development of a multi-resource energy program for the state with incentives in each energy sector, making North Dakota one of the country&#x27;s largest energy-producing and exporting states. The state gained nearly 40,000 new jobs during his tenure. Wages and personal incomes grew faster than the national average. For a few years, the state led the nation in export growth. In late 2006, the state&#x27;s reserve rose past $600 million, and it is now over $700 million.

In December 2009, Hoeven was the country&#x27;s most popular governor. His approval rating stood at 87% with only 10% disapproving. In January 2007, Hoeven became the nation&#x27;s most senior governor, having been inaugurated on December 15, 2000, as established by the North Dakota Constitution.

==Political positions==
Hoeven was briefly a member of the Democratic-NPL Party before becoming active in the Republican Party as a district chair and volunteer. He has walked a conservative line on some issues and a moderate one on others, including increasing education funding, ethics reform, compensation for teachers, as well as increased funding on infrastructure. On August 10, 2021, Hoeven was one of 19 Senate Republicans to vote with the Democratic caucus in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

===Crime===
Hoeven supports decreasing access to parole for violent offenders. He believes that drug control policy should be a state issue, not a federal one.

===Economy and employment===
Hoeven opposed the Employee Free Choice Act, which included a card check provision.

===Energy and environment===
Hoeven believes that alternative fuels are a long-term solution but that increased oil drilling is required in the short term. He has been a vocal advocate for the Keystone Pipeline, falsely asserting that it has never leaked and claiming that environmental risks have been exaggerated. The Keystone Pipeline has in fact leaked twice, in 2010 and in 2016.

In 2015, Hoeven submitted an amendment asserting that climate change is real and that humans are contributing to it but also that the Keystone Pipeline would not contribute to climate change. His League of Conservation Voters score for 2018 was 7%.

===Gun policy===
Hoeven consistently votes for pro-gun legislation and has earned an A+ rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF). The NRA-PVF has endorsed him repeatedly, including during his campaigns for governor in 2008 and senator in 2010.

In June 2016, Hoeven voted on four gun control proposals that were developed as a result of the Orlando nightclub shooting. He voted for Chuck Grassley&#x27;s expansion of background checks and provision of funding to research the cause of mass shootings, and for John Cornyn&#x27;s 72-hour wait period for purchases of guns by people on the terrorist watchlist. He voted against Chris Murphy&#x27;s proposal to require background checks for every gun sale, including online sales and at gun shows, and against Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s proposal to ban anyone on the terrorist watchlist from buying a gun. Hoeven voted against the latter bill due to its lack of &quot;judicial oversight or due process&quot;.

=== Women&#x27;s Issues ===
Hoeven identifies as pro-life, opposing abortion in all cases except for rape, incest, or threat to the mother&#x27;s life. He opposes government funding for elective abortions and supports the Hyde Amendment, which permits federal funding for abortion services only under the above stated exceptions. Hoeven voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in 2012.

=== Israel Anti-Boycott Act ===

In April 2017, Hoeven co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would bar federal contractors from participating in boycotts against Israel or Israeli settlements.

===Immigration===
In 2013, Hoeven voted for the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013.

===LGBT rights===
In 2013, Hoeven voted against banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. He opposes same-sex marriage. In 2022, he voted against federal protections for same-sex married couples.

===January 6th===
On May 28, 2021, Hoeven voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

===Taxes===
Hoeven supported investment tax credits for farm investments until 2025, when he switched his stance in support of a GOP budget that limits farm aid.

<text>S.C. Automobile Dacia S.A., commonly known as Dacia (), is a Romanian car manufacturer that takes its name from the historical region that constitutes present-day Romania. The company was established in 1966. In 1999, after 33 years, the Romanian government sold Dacia to the French car manufacturer Groupe Renault. It is Romania&#x27;s largest company by revenue and the largest exporter, constituting 8% of the country&#x27;s total exports in 2018. In 2021, the Dacia marque sold 537,074 passenger and commercial vehicles.

From January 2021 onwards the Dacia company became part of Renault&#x27;s Dacia-Lada business unit. In May 2022, Renault sold Lada&#x27;s parent company AvtoVAZ to Russian state-owned institute NAMI.

==History==
The first facility in the area was built between 1942 and 1945, as an extension of the IAR aircraft manufacturer. The new factory, built in the Colibași-Pitești area under the order of Marshal Ion Antonescu (&quot;conducător&quot; of Romania during World War II), was scheduled to produce up to 600 aircraft engines per month. The building work was completed in 1945. After the war, the facility was taken over by the Romanian Railways, later generating the Dacia plants.

===Founding===
The Dacia automobile company was founded in 1966 under the name (UAP). The main Dacia factory was inaugurated in 1968, in Colibași (now called Mioveni), near Pitești. Dacia acquired the tooling and basic designs of the Renault 12. However, until the tooling was ready it was decided to produce the Renault 8 under licence; it was known as the Dacia 1100. From 1968 to 1972, 37,546 cars of model 1100 were produced, with a very minor cosmetic change to the front in early 1970. Also produced in very limited numbers was the &quot;1100S&quot;, with twin headlamps and a more powerful engine, used by the police and in motor racing.

The first Dacia 1300 left the assembly line ready for the 23 August parade in 1969, and was exhibited at the Paris and Bucharest shows of that year. Romanians were delighted with the modernity and reliability of the car, and waiting lists were always lengthy. By 1970, there were two variants: the standard &quot;1300&quot; and the &quot;1300L&quot; (for Lux); in 1974 the &quot;1301 Lux Super&quot; was introduced, which had novelties such as a heated rear screen, a radio, wing mirrors on both sides and a more luxurious trim. This was reserved for the Communist Party nomenklatura.

Changes soon followed as export markets opened up. In 1973, the estate variant, &quot;1300 Break&quot;, was produced. There were &quot;1300F&quot; (estate with no rear seats, for carrying goods) and &quot;1300S&quot; (ambulance) variants, and in 1975 the Dacia 1302 pick-up was developed. 2,000 units were made until 1982.

Dacia also produced the &quot;Estafette&quot;, a complete knock-down version of the Renault Estafette van, in limited numbers, but given the competition of the Bucharest-made T.V. van, numbers were very limited. In the very early 1980s, the Renault 20 was also assembled as the &quot;Dacia 2000&quot;; because of the exclusivity of this model numbers were always very limited. The &quot;2000&quot; was only available in dark blue or black, and was reserved for the Party elite. In 1978 plans were revealed for the Renault 18 to be assembled by Dacia, but the Renault contract lapsed and Dacia went its own way.

At the Bucharest show in 1979, the restyled 1310 models were presented. These had quad lamps at the front, larger lamps at the rear, re-profiled bumpers, and a new interior. The changes were heavily inspired by Renault&#x27;s own restyling of its 12 in 1975. After a brief series of &quot;crossover&quot; cars in 1981 (for example, there were no more rectangular headlights available for the &quot;1300&quot;, so the last models used the quad lamps of the &quot;1310&quot;), the &quot;1310&quot; hit the Romanian market in late 1981. In the UK, where it was known as the &quot;Dacia Denem&quot;, the top of the range model included such luxuries as a five-speed gearbox, alloy wheels and electric windows. The advertising slogan used for the car was &quot;The Very Acceptable Dacia Denem&quot;. Sales were very limited, and the number surviving are not thought to exceed ten, although the Romanian Embassy in South Kensington kept a fleet running until the mid-1990s. Sales of the pick-up version, known as the &quot;Shifter&quot;, continued until the 1990s, and the ARO 10 was also sold as the &quot;Dacia Duster&quot;. Production was stopped in late 1982.

At the same time the &quot;Sport&quot; model was produced. At the 1980 Bucharest international trade fair, crowds admired the &quot;Brașovia&quot;, a prototype of a sports coupé based on the &quot;1310&quot; and developed at a service station in Brașov. The go-ahead was given for a prestige model, and so from 1983 the two-door Dacia &quot;1310 Sport&quot; (and later the &quot;1410 Sport&quot;), was available for general consumption. These were popular for rallies, and racing drivers such as Nicu Grigoraș tuned them to extract extraordinary power from the old Renault engine.

===1980s===
The designers were still coming up with fresh ideas, many of them shrouded in secrecy. Prototypes such as the 500cc Mini-Dacia, as well as Dacia &quot;1310&quot; variants, were designed; some, such as the Dacia &quot;1310 Maxi Break&quot;, are still on the road. These cars are eagerly prized by Dacia enthusiasts, and Dacia web forums are full of evidence about the rarities and oddities produced by Dacia during the 1980s. The Maxi Break was an eight-seater version of the station wagon (also available as an ambulance), stretched by about a half a metre between the doors. 10–12 such cars were actually built, by Dacia Service Pitesti.

In 1982, after the &quot;1302&quot; was dropped, the Dacia &quot;1304&quot; Pick-up and Drop-side models were introduced. Actually, they had been launched from 1981. These were a commercial success and remained in production, gradually being modified along with the rest of the range, until December 2006. In 1985 were added the &quot;1410&quot; was available as a larger-engined variant, while the relatively short-lived &quot;1210&quot; was the economy variant until about 1992.
For the 1984 model year, the de luxe MS and MLS models presented slight modifications on the 1310 platform, with a new spoiler and chunkier, rubber mouldings around the front grille and headlamps. In 1985, the rear vent was changed from a narrow horizontal aperture to a rhomboid aperture, much like that of the Renault 12 phase 2. From late 1985 all models had the large rubber mouldings around the front grille and headlamps, plus a spoiler: the line-up was changed to TX ( 1289 cmc engine and 4 speeds gearbox ) and TLX(1397 cmc engine, 5 speedsgearbox) though other designations were occasionally seen. A five-speed gearbox also became an option. Models destined for Canada (initially called GTL) sported twin fuel tanks. In parallel, work was developing on the &quot;1320 CN1&quot; model, which was a hatchback based on the &quot;1310&quot;.

The new front end seen on the &quot;1320&quot; also appeared on the top-of-the-range and special-order models from about 1986; these cars were distinguishable by two large headlights, a much plusher interior clad in blue plastic and a new dashboard known as the CN1, and – occasionally – faired-in door handles. Many were owned by senior officials in the Communist Central Committee. While the &quot;1320&quot; was the most expensive model in the Dacia range when it appeared in 1988, many were used as taxis. The &quot;1320&quot; did not last long, however; as early as 1989 there were prototypes using the front of the &quot;1320&quot; and a new rear, with wrap-around tail lights and other relatively modern features.

===1990s===
The &quot;1320&quot; model was replaced in 1991 by the Dacia &quot;1325 Liberta&quot; (after the 1989 revolution, themes of liberty were very much in fashion) and stayed in production until 1996. The last of the quad-lamped models were produced in 1992, and all the Dacia range received the new front end of the &quot;1320&quot;, called CN1. An effort was made to rejuvenate the model range: the Sport was dropped, due to lack of sales, and new commercial vehicles were introduced. The &quot;1307&quot; was a double-cabbed pick-up; the &quot;1309&quot; was an estate with a tarpaulin instead of a boot; the car was a cross-over between estate and pick-up and sold very well on the Chinese market. There were also several prototypes, including:
*the &quot;1610&quot; diesel estate, powered by Volkswagen, with about 150 units sold
*the Dacia &quot;Star&quot;, with curved side windows
*the &quot;1308 Jumbo&quot;, a camper-van, and several attempts to give the &quot;1310&quot; a more modern look by grafting the front of contemporary cars such as the Nissan Primera onto it.

The cars of 1992 to 1994 are curiosities: although efforts were obviously being made to renew the model range, there were numerous stylistic hangovers from the quad-lamped models. Thus, the last of the 1983-designed dashboards were seen in 1994 although a new dashboard had been seen on some model ranges since 1987. Similarly, although the CN1 restyling eliminated anachronisms such as a kink upwards at the C-pillar and a rubber rear spoiler, it was not applied consistently.

The 1994 facelift was known within the industry as CN2. A reprojected front end was distinguished by a horizontal metal line in the grille. There were new headlamps, a new radiator grille, and front and rear bumpers. Inside, there was a new dashboard for the base models, while the top-of-the-range cars had luxuries such as body-coloured bumpers, rear head restraints, a radio-cassette, hubcaps, and the ever-present CN1 dashboard, this time in black plastic. This model was not to stay in production for very long; in 1995 the CN3 type was introduced. Practically the only differences were those of trim level and the radiator grille.

From late 1994 little attention was paid to the improvement of the 1310 range, as Dacia launched a new model, the &quot;Dacia Nova&quot;. This was a compact saloon/sedan or hatchback with a three-box design. The design was rather outdated, because development work had started in 1983. The &quot;Nova&quot; started after the end of any French involvement in Dacia. The model was unpopular, due to reliability and rustproofing issues. However, after improvements in 1996, the &quot;Nova&quot; became more often seen on Romanian roads. In 1998 a seven-seater prototype was produced using the panels and windows from the standard &quot;Nova&quot; saloon.

In 1998, the anniversary year of three decades of production since the first Dacia rolled off the assembly line, vehicle number 2,000,000 emerged from the plant; this year saw the last restyling of the 1310. It was known as CN4 and involved a comprehensive restyling of the front end, new door handles, and a lightly restyled rear view mirror. The estate version was fitted with larger tail lights. Even though the model was over thirty years old, it sold exceptionally well due to a starting price of about 4,200 euros and high availability of parts. &quot;Goodies&quot; such as a fuel-injection also helped keep the model relatively modern.

In 1999, a special edition was produced for the first time, known as Dacia &quot;Dedicație&quot;. This luxury version of the saloon and estate had alloy wheels, body-coloured bumpers, power steering, electric windows, and a far better level of finish. The models were all painted two-tone silver, and sold at a significantly higher price. From 2002, the cars became known as Berlina and Break, with the 1310 lettering being relegated to an insignificant position underneath the side light.

On 21 July 2004, the last models of the 1300 series rolled out the gates of the Mioveni production facility, one month before their 35th anniversary. The last Dacia 1310 (saloon version), number 1,979,730, will be kept in the Dacia Museum.

On 8 December 2006, the utility Dacia Pick-Up suffered the same fate. Although many improvements had been made in recent years, such as four-wheel drive, the introduction of a 1.9 diesel engine, the dashboard from the Dacia Solenza (also seen on the last 1310s) and wheels fastened by five studs as opposed to three, Romania&#x27;s entry to the European Union effectively prevented the continued production of the old models. The assembly lines were remodelled and expanded to increase production of the Dacia Logan.

In over 34 years of production, and more than 2.5 million units produced, the Dacia &quot;1300/1310&quot; easily became the most common car on Romanian roads. A large number of people had become adept at carrying out repairs or home-made modifications. For example, many older cars had newer front ends grafted onto them to make them seem more modern, or purely because newer parts were easier to get. Consequently, original early 1300s are quite rare, with prices steadily increasing for the best-preserved models. Tuning of Dacias is also a popular pastime, although the home-made nature of much of the work casts doubt on the level of quality, safety and reliability of the finished product.

According to popular belief, during the Communist era, in the plant where Dacias were made, there were two assembly lines: one line producing Dacias intended for sale in Romania and the other line producing the same car (albeit from superior parts, and assembled with greater care) for export. Romanians living near the border would commonly purchase their Dacia in neighbouring countries expecting a higher level of quality.

===Acquisition by Renault===

Meanwhile, work was continuing on the other Dacia models. In September 1999, Dacia became the third brand of the Renault group, with a view to making Romania its hub of automobile development in Central and Eastern Europe, and investment was consequently increased. The first sign of this came in 2000, with the introduction of the SupeRNova, an improved version of the &quot;Nova&quot; with engine and transmission from Renault. The top-of-the range version had air conditioning, electric windows and a CD player. Sales were very good, although the outdatedness of the concept was striking. Dacia sold 53,000 vehicles in 2002, an almost 50 per cent market share in Romania.

In 2003, a restyled version replaced the SupeRNova with Dacia Solenza, featuring a new interior, the options for an airbag. This was, however, only meant to be a stopgap model filling the need for a saloon model before the introduction of the all-important Dacia Logan, as well as to familiarise workers with the demands of manufacturing a model acceptable to Western European markets. Production was stopped in 2005.

===2004–2011===

The Dacia Logan is the most successful model since the original &quot;1300&quot;. It was introduced after considerable media interest in August 2004, and despite design-related criticism, it became one of the top-selling cars in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Russia. The Logan is sold in many countries, occasionally under the Renault brand. It was awarded 3 (out of 5) stars in NCAP crash testing. It remains by far the best-selling car in Romania, comprising a 43% share of Dacia&#x27;s total Romanian sales in 2015. A diesel version was also introduced in 2005. Before its launch, it was known as the 5000-Euro car due to its projected launch price. This was never quite the case, although it is one of the cheapest cars for its size on the market.

In 2006, the prototype Logan Steppe was exhibited. This showed a speculative 4×4 estate version of the Logan. The estate version was launched in late 2006. The van, basically an estate with the rear windows filled in and a separate cabin for the driver, was launched in February 2007 after the stopping production of the classic utility vehicle, the Dacia Pick-Up.

The Renault Technologie Roumanie engineering centre was set up in 2006, in Bucharest, Romania. Employing approximately 2,500 engineers, its main fields of activity are the development, testing and design of the new vehicles in the Dacia range, as well as the marketing and technical support. The following year, the company also set up a styling office, Renault Design Central Europe.

A pick-up model and the Logan-based hatchback Sandero were launched in 2008, the latter at the Geneva Motor Show. This also marked a point of rebranding for the company, which adopted a new logo and later the same year launched the facelifted Logan model.

In 2009, a new concept called the Dacia Duster was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show, signaling manufacturer&#x27;s intentions of releasing an SUV model. This was reportedly the inauguration of the platform that would be used for the second generation of the Logan and Sandero models, released in 2012.

In 2010, the Dacia Duster was exhibited at the Geneva Motor Show. It is the first crossover SUV built by Dacia since the Renault acquisition, in 4×2 and 4×4 versions. It was revealed on 8 December 2009, and became available in Europe on 18 March 2010.

In September 2010, a testing center was opened in Titu, Romania, as part of Renault Technologie Roumanie. It is intended for developing and optimizing the new vehicles in the Dacia range and has nine types of track with a total length of 32 kilometres and around 100 test benches, used to test the resistance of vehicles and replacement parts to cold, heat and rain.

===2012–2020===
In 2012, Dacia Lodgy, a new compact MPV, was revealed at the Geneva Motor Show. It is based on a new platform and is manufactured at an all-new Renault factory in Tangier, Morocco.

The Dokker, released in June 2012, is a slightly smaller leisure activity vehicle, also manufactured in Tangier, sharing the same platform with the Lodgy, available in passenger and panel van variants.

In September 2012, the second generations of the Logan and Sandero were revealed at the Paris Motor Show. They feature a common front end design and come with improved standard safety features, a new engine and other new comfort equipment.
The following year, the facelifted Duster was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It received mild modifications to the front and rear ends, the new interior introduced on the new Logan and Sandero models, as well as a new turbocharged petrol engine.

At the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show, the second generation Duster model was introduced, bringing new comfort and technical improvements, but retaining similar dimensions and engines.

According to reports, in September 2018, Automobile Dacia gained the 14th place in Top 500 CEE companies.

Dacia&#x27;s CEO from April 2016 until May 2018 was Yves Caracatzanis. He was replaced by Antoine Doucerain, who left after only four months due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;. After a brief stint by interim manager Jerome Olive, the position was filled by Christophe Dridi in December 2018.

In 2020, Dacia announced that they would be releasing an electric car which they showcased in March 2020 with the Dacia Spring Electric concept. The Dacia Spring is said to be based on the Renault City K-ZE and is set to become the cheapest electric car in Europe with the price being estimated by Romanian media at around €15,000 to €20,000.

===2021–present===
In January 2021, Denis Le Vot became the CEO of the Dacia-Lada business unit. As part of a company revamp, Renault said it would integrate the Dacia and the Lada marques into a new business unit. It also unveiled a new Dacia logo and a product offensive for the Dacia marque, widening its market segments coverage.

In March 2021, the production version of the Dacia Spring EV was shown at the Renault eWays event by Groupe Renault Executive Denis Le Vot. The Spring will be sold in left-hand drive areas of Europe, alongside updated Sandero and Logan models (announced at the end of 2020) and will have a car-sharing version called the Spring Business.

==Facilities==
The company&#x27;s single plant is located in Mioveni, Romania, together with its headquarters, and has a production capacity of 350,000 vehicles per year. It is divided into several sections, such as bodywork, painting, assembly, mechanical and chassis, foundry etc. It works in conjunction with the Renault Technologie Roumanie engineering centre, located in Bucharest and set up in 2006, which also comprises a styling office, Renault Design Central Europe, and with the testing centre located in Titu that was opened in 2010.

A large logistical centre was also set near the plant in March 2005, the International Logistic Network, from where complete knock down (CKD) kits are exported to other Renault production sites in Russia, Morocco, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Iran and India. It is reportedly the biggest logistic centre of its kind not only in the Renault Group, but in the global automotive industry. In 2012, the total equivalent of the kits sent worldwide from the centre was 920,646 vehicles.

===Overseas===
Two of the Dacia models, the Lodgy and the Dokker vans, were manufactured at the Renault factory in Tangier, Morocco. The Logan and the Sandero are also manufactured in Casablanca, Morocco, the latter also in Tangier.

==Innovation==
Faced with the growing demand for automatic gearboxes in Europe and significant demand in Russia, South America and India, Renault has decided to develop a specific automatic gearbox, called Easy-R. Innovative, it replaces hydroelectric technologies (hydraulics controlled by electronics) with electromechanical elements. The result is a more reliable and more affordable automatic transmission. Dacia is indeed offering this equipment from 2015 in Europe at a price of 600 euros, which is at least half the price of the competition. The number of parts has been reduced by a quarter, ensuring better reliability and simplified maintenance. Four modes are available on the Easy-R controlled gearbox, also indicated on the dashboard: D/Drive, N/Neutral, R/Rear and M/Manual impulse. This Easy-R gearbox keeps fuel consumption identical to that of the manual gearbox, while offering the advantages of a traditional automatic gearbox.

==Sales==
The Dacia brand is marketed in most of the Western and Eastern European countries, as well as in some Northern African countries, such as Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. Western European exports began in the late 1970s, entering markets like Belgium and the Netherlands in 1978. Its models have also been produced by Renault in its production sites on other continents (in Russia, Iran, India, South Africa, Colombia and Brazil) and sold under its own brand or other specific local brands (such as Mahindra, Lada or Nissan for example ).
In 2012, Dacia sold a total of 359,822 vehicles, of which approximately 230,000 were exported to Western Europe, the most of them in France and in Germany. Besides the domestic market, its other key markets have been Algeria, Turkey, Italy and Spain.

For 2014 the company sold 511,465 vehicles in 43 countries, thus breaking another record and exceeding the 500,000 threshold. On the 6th of May 2014, the main Dacia plant Mioveni produced its five millionth car, approximately the three millionth car since Renault owned the brand.

The 3.5 millionth Dacia car, since the Dacia brand revival ten years before, was sold in the UK in November 2015.

In 2015, the company set a new sales record, with a total of 550,920 units marketed.

Dacia cars sales exceeded 700,000 units in 2018 (7% more than in the previous year).

<text>The Ohlone ( ), formerly known as Costanoans (from Spanish meaning &#x27;coast dweller&#x27;), are a Native American people of the Northern California coast. When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the lower Salinas Valley. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The Ohlone languages make up a sub-family of the Utian language family. Older proposals place Utian within the Penutian language phylum, while newer proposals group it as Yok-Utian.

In pre-colonial times, the Ohlone lived in more than 50 distinct landholding groups, and did not view themselves as a single unified group. They lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical ethnographic California pattern. The members of these various bands interacted freely with one another. The Ohlone people practiced the Kuksu religion. Prior to the Gold Rush, the northern California region was one of the most densely populated regions north of Mexico.

However, the arrival of Spanish colonizers to the area in 1769 vastly changed tribal life forever. The Spanish constructed missions along the California coast with the objective of Christianizing the native people and culture. Between the years 1769 and 1834, the number of Indigenous Californians dropped from 300,000 to 250,000. After California entered into the Union in 1850, the Ohlone were subject to the larger California genocide. Recent years have seen a renewed push for cultural and historical recognition of their tribe and what they have gone through and had taken from them.

The Ohlone living today belong to various geographically distinct groups, most of which are still in their original home territory, though not all; none are currently federally recognized tribes. Members of the Tamien Nation are direct lineal descendants from Tamien speaking villages of the Santa Clara Valley. The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of documented descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried Rumsen Costanoan and Esselen speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The tribe are descendants of Mutsun Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California. These groups and others with smaller memberships (&quot;See groups listed under &quot;Present day&quot; below&quot;) are separately petitioning the federal government for tribal recognition.

==Name==
British ethnologist Robert Gordon Latham originally used the term &quot;Costanoan&quot; to refer to the linguistically similar but ethnically diverse Native American tribes in the San Francisco Bay Area. The term was based on the name of a group of Ramaytush speakers in the area of Mission Dolores first mentioned in 1850 as &quot;&quot;Olhones&quot; or &quot;Costanos&quot;&quot;. Based on the former, American anthropologist Clinton Hart Merriam referred to the Costanoan groups as &quot;Olhonean&quot; in the early 20th century in his posthumously published field notes, and eventually, the term &quot;Ohlone&quot; has been adopted by most ethnographers, historians, and writers of popular literature.

==Culture==
=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===
The Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like acorns and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to northern region of Big Sur, and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Diablo Range in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, Santa Clara Valley, Santa Cruz Mountains, Monterey Bay area, as well as present-day Alameda County, Contra Costa County and the Salinas Valley. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50 different &quot;nations or tribes&quot; with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50 distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some conflict. Cultural arts included basket-weaving skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female tattoos, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.

The Ohlone subsisted mainly as hunter-gatherers and in some ways harvesters. &quot;A rough husbandry of the land was practiced, mainly by annually setting of fires to burn-off the old growth in order to get a better yield of seeds—or so the Ohlone told early explorers in San Mateo County.&quot; Their staple diet consisted of crushed acorns, nuts, grass seeds, and berries, although other vegetation, hunted and trapped game, fish and seafood (including mussels and abalone from the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean), were also important to their diet. These food sources were abundant in earlier times and maintained by careful work, and through active management of all the natural resources at hand. Animals in their mild climate included the grizzly bear, elk (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), pronghorn, and deer. The streams held salmon, trout, steelhead, perch, and stickleback. Birds included plentiful ducks, geese, quail, great horned owls, red-shafted flickers, downy woodpeckers, goldfinches, and yellow-billed magpies. Waterfowl were the most important birds in the people&#x27;s diet, which were captured with nets and decoys. The Chochenyo traditional narratives refer to ducks as food, and Juan Crespí observed in his journal that geese were stuffed and dried &quot;to use as decoys in hunting others&quot;.

Along the ocean shore and bays, there were also otters, whales, and at one time thousands of sea lions. In fact, there were so many sea lions that according to Crespi it &quot;looked like a pavement&quot; to the incoming Spanish.

In general, along the bayshore and valleys, the Ohlone constructed dome-shaped houses of woven or bundled mats of tules, 6 to 20 feet (1.8 to 6 m) in diameter. In hills where redwood trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the sweat lodge was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built boats of tule to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.

Generally, men did not wear clothing in warm weather. In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, tule skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes. Both wore ornamentation of necklaces, shell beads and abalone pendants, and bone wood earrings with shells and beads. The ornamentation often indicated status within their community.

===Ethnobotany===
A full list of their ethnobotany can be found in the Native American Ethnobiology Database They use the roots of many species of Carex for basketry.

===Kuksu Religion===

Researchers are sensitive to limitations in historical knowledge, and careful not to place the spiritual and religious beliefs of all Ohlone people into a single unified worldview. Due to the displacement of Indian people in the Missions between 1769 and 1833, cultural groups are working as ethnographers to discover for themselves their ancestral history, and what that information tells about them as a cultural group. Their religion is different depending on the band referred to, although they share components of their worldview.

The pre-contact spiritual beliefs of the Ohlone were not recorded in detail by missionaries. The Ohlone probably practiced &quot;Kuksu&quot;, a form of shamanism shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty rites of passage, intervention with the spirit world and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.

Kuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the Miwok and Esselen, also Maidu, Pomo, and northernmost Yokuts. However Kroeber observed less &quot;specialized cosmogony&quot; in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the &quot;southern Kuksu-dancing groups&quot;, in comparison to the Maidu and groups in the Sacramento Valley; he noted &quot;if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.&quot;

The conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to Catholicism, while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and &quot;external&quot;.
It is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe. Some of these people healed through the use of herbs, and some were shamans who were believed to heal through their ability to contact the spirit world. Some shamans typically engaged in more ritualistic healing in the form of dancing, ceremony, and singing. Some shamans were also believed to be able to tell and influence the future, therefore they were equally able to bring about fortune and misfortune among the community.

====Indian Canyon: village houses / sweat lodges for ceremony and purification====

Additionally, some Ohlone bands built prayer houses, also called sweat lodges, for ceremonial and spiritual purification purposes. These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to &quot;cleanse, purify, and empower themselves&quot; for a task like hunting and spirit dancing. Today, there is a place located in Hollister called Indian Canyon, where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities. Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions. Indian Canyon is also home to many Ohlone people, specifically of the Mutsun band, and serves as an educational, cultural, and spiritual environment for all visitors. Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.

===Sacred narratives and mythology===

The storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as &quot;professional consultants&quot; for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories. The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.

Therefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.

Ohlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian culture heroes of the Coyote trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu). The Coyote spirit was clever, wily, lustful, greedy, and irresponsible. He often competed with Hummingbird, who despite his small size regularly got the better of him. Ohlone creation stories mention that the world was covered entirely in water, apart from a single peak &quot;Pico Blanco&quot; near Big Sur (or Mount Diablo in the northern Ohlone&#x27;s version) on which Coyote, Hummingbird, and Eagle stood. Humans were the descendants of Coyote.

==History==
=== Pre-Columbian era ===
The predominant theory regarding the settlement of the Americas date the original migrations from Asia to around 20,000 years ago across the Bering Strait land bridge, but one anthropologist, Otto von Sadovszky, claims that the Ohlone and some other northern California tribes descend from Siberians who arrived in California by sea around 3,000 years ago.

Some anthropologists think that these people migrated from the San Joaquin–Sacramento River system and arrived into the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Areas in about the 6th century CE, displacing or assimilating earlier Hokan-speaking populations of which the Esselen in the south represent a remnant. Datings of ancient shell mounds in Emeryville and in Newark and suggest the villages at those locations were established about 4000 BCE.

Through shell mound dating, scholars noted three periods of ancient Bay Area history, as described by F.M. Stanger in : &quot;Careful study of artifacts found in central California mounds has resulted in the discovery of three distinguishable epochs or cultural &#x27;horizons&#x27; in their history. In terms of our time-counting system, the first or &#x27;Early Horizon&#x27; extends from about 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE in the Bay Area and to about 2000 BCE in the Central Valley. The second or Middle Horizon was from these dates to 700 CE, while the third or Late Horizon, was from 700 CE to the coming of the Spaniards in the 1770s.&quot; 

===Mission era (1769–1833)===

The arrival of missionaries and Spanish colonizers in the mid-1700s had a negative impact on the Ohlone people who inhabited Northern California. The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.

The Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of missions and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno reached and named the area that is now Monterey in December of that year. Despite Vizcaíno&#x27;s positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by Gaspar de Portolà. This time, the military expedition was accompanied by Franciscan missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father Junípero Serra, the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.

Spanish mission culture soon disrupted and undermined the Ohlone social structures and way of life. Under Father Serra&#x27;s leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: Mission San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo (founded in 1770), Mission San Francisco de Asís (founded in 1776), Mission Santa Clara de Asís (founded in 1777), Mission Santa Cruz (founded in 1791), Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad (founded in 1791), Mission San José (founded in 1797), and Mission San Juan Bautista (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called Mission Indians, and also &quot;neophytes.&quot; They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the Coast Miwok transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San José.

Spanish military presence was established at two Presidios, the Presidio of Monterey, and the Presidio of San Francisco, and mission outposts, such as San Pedro y San Pablo Asistencia founded in 1786. The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were baptized and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway &quot;Christians&quot; from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.

Indians did not thrive when the missions expanded both their populations and operations in their geographical areas. &quot;A total of 81,000 Indians were baptized and 60,000 deaths were recorded&quot;. The cause of death varied, but most were the result of European diseases such as smallpox, measles, and diphtheria against which the Indians had no natural immunity. Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.

====Land and property disputes====

Under Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of San Jose: There were &quot;heated debates&quot; between &quot;the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies&quot; over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the &quot;Missions Indians&quot; owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the &quot;Indians&#x27; crops&quot; were being damaged by the San Jose settlers&#x27; livestock and also mentioned settlers &quot;getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.&quot; They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: &quot;Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.&quot; &quot;By law&quot;, the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.

===Secularization===
In 1834, the Mexican government ordered all Californian missions to be secularized and all mission land and property (administered by the Franciscans) turned over to the government for redistribution. At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of Alta California, but with the new régime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and &quot;vaqueros&quot; (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.

===Survival===

The Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the Coast Miwok, Bay Miwok, Plains Miwok, Patwin, Yokuts, and Esselen languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at &quot;Alisal Rancheria&quot; in Pleasanton, and &quot;El Molino&quot; in Niles. Communities of mission survivors also formed in Sunol, Monterey and San Juan Bautista. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.

The Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. Peter Hardeman Burnett, the state&#x27;s first governor, was an open advocate of exterminating local California Indian tribes. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864–1,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually entirely gone, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the Carmel Valley. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist Helen Hunt Jackson published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.

Considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language, Rumsien-speaker Isabel Meadows died in 1939 at the age of 92. Descendants are reviving Rumsien, Mutsun, and Chochenyo.

==Burial practices==

===Sacred sites and importance===
The arrival of the Spanish in the 1776 decelerated the culture, sovereignty, religion, and language of the Ohlone. Before the Spanish invasion, the Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as &quot;middens,&quot; or &quot;kitchen midden&quot; meaning an accumulation of refuse.

One theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound. Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation&#x27;s largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay. The Emeryville Shellmound is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.

The Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.

===Present day burial and sacred sites===

West Berkeley Shellmound

The West Berkeley Shellmound, located in Berkeley, California, is thought to be the site of the earliest known habitation in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was mostly removed by the early 20th century, but human remains and artifacts are still found in the area during construction projects. Local Ohlone groups have fought to have a portion of it protected and returned to their use.

Glen Cove (Sogorea Te&#x27;)

The City of Vallejo, California built Glen Cove Waterfront Park after years of protests from Ohlone people and their allies that the location was a sacred site known as Sogorea Te&#x27;, one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that had escaped urban development.

Santa Cruz

A 6,000-year-old grave site was found at a KB Home construction site in the city of Santa Cruz. Protestors have picketed at the front gate of the Branciforte Creek construction site, holding signs, handing out flyers and engaging passersby to call attention to the site.

San Jose

Ohlone remains were discovered in 1973 near Highway 87 during housing development. Some remains were removed during the construction of the highway.

Mount Umunhum (Dove Mountain) is the physical foundation of Tamien Nation oral narrative of the Great Flood - Tamien Nation&#x27;s most sacred landscape.

Fremont

Construction crews at a Van Daele Homes luxury housing development unearthed 32 sets of Ohlone remains in 2017. The remains were reburied on-site under the supervision of a native consultant.

===Revitalizing and reclaiming heritage===

The determination and passion to preserve sacred ground is largely influenced by the desire to revive and preserve the Ohlone cultural heritage. Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court. Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.

Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site

The Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to &quot;recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people&quot;. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769 and 1833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports. One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500 and 2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains. In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with &quot;braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks&quot;. There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.

Although the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was using known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as &quot;moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,&quot; animals were &quot;dream helpers,&quot; or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of &quot;sacred deity-like figures&quot;.

===Indian People Organizing for Change===
Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone organization members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.

==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====

The Sogorea Te Land Trust is a land trust founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally Chochenyo and Karkin lands in the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land. It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on. The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or Internal Revenue Service, but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions donations) as it asserts indigenous sovereignty.

==Etymology==
Costanoan is an externally applied name (exonym). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the &quot;Costeños&quot; (the &quot;coastal people&quot;) circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later Anglicized the word &quot;Costeños&quot; into the name of &quot;Costanoans.&quot; (The suffix &quot;-an&quot; is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.

Since the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name &quot;Costanoan.&quot; &quot;Ohlone&quot; might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called &quot;Oljon&quot;, and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near Pescadero Creek. Teixeira traced the name &quot;Ohlone&quot; through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;Native Races&quot;, and Frederick Beechey&#x27;s Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826–27. &quot;Oljone&quot;, &quot;Olchones&quot; and &quot;Alchones&quot; are spelling variations of &quot;Ohlone&quot; found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the &quot;Muwekma&quot;. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: &quot;A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.&quot; Milliken states the name came from: &quot;A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast&quot;.

==Divisions==

Linguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:

*Karkin (&quot;also called Carquin&quot;): The Karkin resided on the south side of the Carquinez Strait. The name of the Carquinez Strait derives from their name. Karkin was a dialect quite divergent from the rest of the family.
*Chochenyo (&quot;also called Chocheño, Chocenyo and East Bay Costanoan&quot;): The Chochenyo speaking tribal groups resided in the East Bay, primarily in what is now Alameda County and the western (bayshore) portion of Contra Costa County.
*Ramaytush (&quot;also called San Francisco Costanoan&quot;): The Ramaytush resided between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific, in the area which is now San Francisco and San Mateo Counties. The Yelamu grouping of the Ramaytush included the villages surrounding Mission Dolores, Sitlintac and Chutchui on Mission Creek, Amuctac and Tubsinte in Visitation Valley, Petlenuc from near the Presidio, and to the southwest, the villages of Timigtac on Calera Creek and Pruristac on San Pedro Creek in modern-day Pacifica.
*Tamyen (&quot;also called Tamien, Thamien, and Santa Clara Costanoan&quot;): The Tamyen resided on Coyote Creek and Calaveras Creek, and the language was spoken in the Santa Clara Valley. (Linguistically, Chochenyo, Tamyen and Ramaytush were very close, perhaps to the point of being dialects of a single language.) The Tamyen village was near the original site of the first Mission Santa Clara located on the Guadalupe River; Father Pena mentioned in a letter to Junípero Serra that the area around the mission was called Thamien by the Ohlone. 
*Awaswas (&quot;also called Santa Cruz Costanoan&quot;): Local bands of Awaswas speakers resided on the Santa Cruz coast and adjacent Santa Cruz Mountains between Point Año Nuevo and the Pajaro Rivers (Davenport and Aptos).
*Mutsun (&quot;also called Mutsen, San Juan Bautista Costanoan&quot;): A number of distinct local territorial tribes of Mutsun speakers lived in the Hollister Valley (along the lower San Benito River, middle Pajaro River, and San Felipe Creek) and along nearby creeks of the eastern Coast Range valleys (including San Luis and Ortigalita creeks).
*Rumsien (&quot;also called Rumsen, Carmel or Carmeleno&quot;): A few independent Rumsien-speaking local territorial tribes resided from the Pajaro River to Point Sur, and the lower courses of the Pajaro, as well as the lower Salinas, Sur and Carmel Rivers (San Carlos, Carmel, and Monterey Counties).
*Chalon (&quot;also called Soledad&quot;): Local bands of Chalon speakers resided along the upper course of the San Benito River and farther east in the Coast Range valleys of Silver and Cantua creeks. Kroeber also mapped them on the middle course of the Salinas River, but some recent studies give that area to the Esselen people.

These division designations are mostly derived from selected local tribe names. They were first offered in 1974 as direct substitutes for Kroeber&#x27;s earlier designations based upon the names of local Spanish missions. The spellings are anglicized from forms first written down (often with a variety of spellings) by Spanish missionaries and soldiers who were trying to capture the sounds of languages foreign to them.

Within the divisions there were over 50 Ohlone tribes and villages who spoke the Ohlone-Costanoan languages in 1769, before being absorbed into the Spanish Missions by 1806.

== Loss of recognition ==
In 1925, Alfred Kroeber, then director of the Hearst Museum of Anthropology, declared the tribe extinct, which directly led to its losing federal recognition and land rights.

==Present day==
The Mutsun (of Hollister and Watsonville), The Lisjan Ohlone, The Tamien Nation, Ramaytush Ohlone and the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe (of the San Francisco Bay Area) are among the surviving groups of Ohlone today. The Esselen Nation also describes itself as Ohlone/Costanoan, although they historically spoke both the southern Costanoan (Rumsien) and an entirely different Hokan language Esselen.

===Contemporary Ohlone groups===
Ohlone tribes with petitions for Federal Recognition pending with the Bureau of Indian Affairs are:

*Tamien Nation, Southern San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Santa Clara County
:All enrolled Tamien Nation citizens have &quot;direct&quot; lineages from historic Tamien villages verified by a certified genealogist and are direct lineal dependents of/or are on the California Judgment Fund Rolls (CJFR) of 1953 and 1972, and have Certificates of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Tamien Nation elders were also subject to the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 (also known as Public Law 959) implemented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Tamien Nation citizens are &quot;living Indians&quot; who continue to hunt, fish, gather Indigenous foods, process and eat acorns and participate in their religious ceremonies.

* Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, San Francisco Bay Area:
:With 397 enrolled members in 2000, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe comprises &quot;all of the known surviving Native American lineages aboriginal to the San Francisco Bay region who trace their ancestry through the Missions Dolores, Santa Clara and San Jose&quot; and who descend from members of the historic Federally Recognized Verona Band of Alameda County. On 21 September 2006, they received a favorable opinion from the U.S. District in Washington, D.C., of their court case to expedite the reaffirmation of the tribe as a federally recognized tribe. The Advisory Council on California Indian Policy has assisted in their case. They lost the case in 2011, and have filed an appeal.

* Amah Mutsun Band of Ohlone/Costanoan Indians, Woodside:
:The band has over 500 enrolled members and comprises &quot;various surviving lineages who spoke the Hoomontwash or Mutsun Ohlone language.&quot; The majority descend from the native people baptized at Mission San Juan Bautista.

*Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, Monterey and San Benito Counties:
:The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation has approximately 500 enrolled members. Their tribal council claims enrolled membership is currently at approximately 500 people from thirteen core lineages that trace direct descendancy to the Missions San Carlos and Soledad. The tribe was formerly federally recognized as the &quot;Monterey Band of Monterey County&quot; (1906–1908). Approximately 60% reside in Monterey and San Benito Counties.

* Costanoan Band of Carmel Mission Indians, Monrovia.
* Costanoan Ohlone Rumsen-Mutsen Tribe, Watsonville.
* Costanoan-Rumsen Carmel Tribe, Pomona/Chino Offices, from Carmel, Monterey Bay Area.
* Indian Canyon Mutsun Band of Costanoan, Mutsun Indians, Chalon, South of Hollister, San Benito County, Only federally recognized &quot;Indian Country&quot; between Sonoma and Santa Barbara along central coastal California. &quot;Indian Country&quot;, land held in trust recognizing Indian People

==Population==


Published estimates of the pre-contact Ohlone population in 1769 range between 7,000 and 26,000 combined with Salinans. Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire population of Native California. However, modern researchers believe that American anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber&#x27;s projection of 7,000 Ohlone &quot;Costanoans&quot; was much too low. Later researchers such as Richard Levy estimated &quot;10,000 or more&quot; Ohlone.

The highest estimate comes from Sherburne F. Cook, who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the &quot;Northern Mission Area&quot;. Per Cook, the &quot;Northern Mission Area&quot; means &quot;the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.&quot; In this model, the Ohlone people&#x27;s territory was one half of the &quot;Northern Mission Area&quot;. It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: &quot;The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.&quot; We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of &quot;Northern Mission Area&quot;), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.

The Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, &quot;The Population of the California Indians, 1769–1970.&quot; Cook states in part: &quot;Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.&quot; The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.

The population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.

==Language==

The Ohlone language family is commonly called &quot;Costanoan&quot;, sometimes &quot;Ohlone&quot;. Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label Utian. The controversial Penutian language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single Yok-Utian language family.

Eight dialects or languages of Ohlone have been recorded: Awaswas, Chalon, Chochenyo (aka Chocheño), Karkin, Mutsun, Ramaytush, Rumsen, and Tamyen. Of these, Chochenyo, Mutsun, and Rumsen are seeing revival by Ohlone tribes.

==Salvaging records==
The chroniclers, ethnohistorians, and linguists of the Ohlone population began with: Alfred L. Kroeber who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and C. Hart Merriam who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by John P. Harrington who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and Sherburne F. Cook, to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to chronicle and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.

There was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the &quot;Editor&#x27;s Introduction&quot; to &quot;Merriam (1979)&quot;, Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam&#x27;s work) states &quot;both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.&quot; Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was &quot;not willing to share his findings with Kroeber ... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber&#x27;s &#x27;muscling in.

Recent Ohlone historians who have published new research are Lauren Teixeira, Randall Milliken and Lowell J. Bean. They all note the availability of mission records which allows for continual research and understanding.

==Notable Ohlone people==

* 1777: Xigmacse, chief of the local Yelamu tribe at the time of the establishment of the Mission San Francisco, and thus the earliest known San Francisco leader.
* 1779: Baltazar, baptized from the Rumsen village of Ichxenta in 1775, he became the first Indian &quot;alcalde&quot; of Mission San Carlos in 1778. After his wife and child died, he fled to the Big Sur coast in 1780 to lead the first extensive Ohlone resistance to colonization.
* 1791: Charquin, a chief of the Quiroste tribe, began leading an active resistance against the mission system soon after being baptized. After his capture in 1793, the Quirostes continued their resistance, ultimately launching the only direct attack on a Spanish mission in that December. Charquin escaped in 1795 and then was recaptured in 1796 and sent to the San Diego Presidio where he died two years later.
* 1807: Hilarion and George (their baptismal names) were two Ohlone men from the village Pruristac who served as &quot;alcaldes&quot; (mayors) of the Mission San Francisco in 1807. As such, they were at the beginning of a long line of Mayors of San Francisco.
* 1877: Lorenzo Asisara was a Mission Santa Cruz man who provided three surviving narratives about life at the mission, primarily from stories told to him by his own father.
* 1913: Barbara Solorsano, died 1913, Mutsun linguistic consultant to C. Hart Merriam 1902–04, from San Juan Bautista.
* 1930: Ascencion Solorsano de Cervantes, died 1930, renowned Mutsun doctor, principal linguistic and cultural informant to J. P. Harrington.
* 1934: Jose Guzman, died 1934, he was one of the principal Chochenyo linguistic and cultural consultants to J. P. Harrington.
* 1939: Isabel Meadows, died 1939, the last fluent speaker of Rumsen and a primary Rumsen consultant to J.P. Harrington.
* 2006: Ralph Allan Espinoza, Director and founder of the only non-profit, Native American affiliated food bank in the U.S., &quot;God Provides - Pomona Valley Food Bank&quot; located in Pomona, California.
* 2016: Ann Marie Sayers, Mustun Ohlone leader, tribal chair of Indian Canyon, California, the only federally recognized Indian country from Sonoma to Santa Barbara.
* 2022: Tommy Guerrero, San Francisco musician, composer, and professional skateboarder.

<text>X2 (also marketed as X2: X-Men United, and internationally as X-Men 2) is a 2003 American superhero film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter, from a story by Singer, Hayter and Zak Penn. The film is based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the sequel to &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000), as well as the second installment in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, and features an ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Kelly Hu, and Anna Paquin. The plot, inspired by the graphic novel &quot;God Loves, Man Kills&quot;, concerns the genocidal Colonel William Stryker leading an assault on Professor Xavier&#x27;s school to build his own version of Xavier&#x27;s mutant-tracking computer, Cerebro, in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the Brotherhood of Mutants to stop Stryker and save the mutant race.

Development on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released on July 14, 2000, by 20th Century Fox. David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of Beast, Angel, and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns from Fox. The film&#x27;s premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines &quot;Return to Weapon X&quot; and &quot;God Loves, Man Kills&quot;. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film.

&quot;X2&quot; was released in the United States on May 2, 2003, by 20th Century Fox, and received positive reviews for its storyline, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed $407million worldwide, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2003, and received eight Saturn Awards nominations. A sequel, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, was released on May 26, 2006. Jackman and Stanford reprised their roles as Wolverine and Pyro, respectively, in the 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Plot==
At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attacks the President of the United States, wounding many agents; he is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, Logan explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean Grey has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Logan returns to Professor Xavier&#x27;s school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go to question the imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while Grey and Storm retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the President and receives approval to investigate Xavier&#x27;s mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker&#x27;s forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker&#x27;s assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack, Logan confronts Stryker, who addresses him as &quot;Wolverine&quot; and seems to know about his past.

The shape-shifting Mystique gathers information about Magneto&#x27;s prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman&#x27;s parents and brother in Boston. Iceman&#x27;s parents do not accept that he is a mutant. His brother secretly goes upstairs and calls the police to their house. The police arrive and surround the house. An impulsive officer shoots Logan in the head after feeling threatened by his claws, Pyro refuses to surrender and takes matters into his own hands by attacking and fending off the police with his pyrokinesis. Logan regenerates from the gunshot shortly before Storm, Grey, and Nightcrawler arrive in their jet to pick up the group. The X-Jet is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it and Xavier to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker&#x27;s son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, whom Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason&#x27;s powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler&#x27;s attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier&#x27;s mansion. Magneto also tells Logan that Stryker was the man who grafted adamantium onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Grey reads Nightcrawler&#x27;s mind and determines that Stryker&#x27;s base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.

Disguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker&#x27;s base, letting the rest of the mutants in while she and Magneto head to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Grey fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Logan finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Logan fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter&#x27;s wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on humans. The two subsequently use Stryker&#x27;s helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro, who has been swayed to Magneto&#x27;s views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason&#x27;s concentration and free Xavier from his control.

The X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Grey sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her. The X-Men give Stryker&#x27;s files to the President, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Logan remember Grey, and Xavier begins to hold a class. Meanwhile, a Phoenix-like shape rises from the flooded Alkali Lake.

==Cast==
* Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier: A powerful telepathic mutant confined to a wheelchair who founded a School for &quot;Gifted Youngsters&quot;, Xavier is a pacifist who believes humans and mutants can live together in harmony. He uses the Cerebro device, designed by Magneto and himself, to track and locate mutants across the world. A natural genius, Xavier is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation.
* Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine: A mysterious mutant who suffers from amnesia and has little to no recollection of his past life before he was grafted with an indestructible adamantium skeleton. Wolverine is a gruff loner, but is in love with Jean Grey and acts as a father figure to Rogue. He wields six highly durable adamantium blades that come out of each of his fists, has keen animal-like senses, has the ability to heal rapidly from virtually any injury, and is a ruthless and aggressive fighter.
* Ian McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto: Once Xavier&#x27;s ally, Magneto now believes mutants are superior to humans and that a genetic war is coming. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, as well as the power to create magnetic fields and fly. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier&#x27;s powers and all related telepathic powers. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information about Cerebro and the Xavier Institute, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering. The character&#x27;s helmet was slightly redesigned as McKellen found wearing it uncomfortable in &quot;X-Men&quot;.
* Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe / Storm: An African mutant and teacher at Xavier&#x27;s School who can control the weather with her mind. Storm befriends Nightcrawler. Berry dropped out of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s role in &quot;Gigli&quot; to reprise the role.
* Famke Janssen as Jean Grey: A teacher at Xavier&#x27;s school and the X-Mansion&#x27;s doctor, Jean has begun to experience a growth in her telepathy and telekinetic powers since the X-Men&#x27;s battle with Magneto. She is Cyclops&#x27; fiancée, even though she is attracted to Wolverine.
* James Marsden as Scott Summers / Cyclops: The field leader of the X-Men, and a teacher at Xavier&#x27;s Institute, he shoots uncontrollable beams of concussive force from his eyes and wears a visor to control them. He is engaged to Jean. Cyclops is taken prisoner and brainwashed by Stryker.
* Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique: Magneto&#x27;s shapeshifting henchwoman, Mystique is blue, covered in scales, and acts as a spy. She injects a prison guard with metal, with which Magneto makes his escape, and also sexually tempts Wolverine. Romijn&#x27;s makeup previously took nine hours to apply during the filming of &quot;X-Men&quot;, but the make-up department was able to bring it down to six hours for &quot;X2&quot;.
* Brian Cox as Colonel William Stryker: A military scientist who plans a worldwide genocide of mutants using Xavier and Cerebro. Stryker has experimented on mutants in the past, including Wolverine, and uses a serum to control them—using his own son as the test subject. Singer opted to cast Cox in the role as he was a fan of his performance as Hannibal Lecter in &quot;Manhunter&quot;.
* Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler: A kindly German mutant with a strong Catholic faith, yet ironically he has the appearance of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. On his body are many tattoos, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer&#x27;s choice for the role, but Cumming could not accept the part due to scheduling conflicts. Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role, but the film labored in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting Cumming since he is fluent in German. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler&#x27;s makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.
* Bruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly: Although Kelly was killed in the first film, Davison reprised the role for scenes where Mystique uses his persona to infiltrate the government.
* Shawn Ashmore as Bobby Drake / Iceman: Rogue&#x27;s boyfriend, he can freeze objects and create ice. His family is unaware that he is a mutant and simply believes he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he is, much to his brother&#x27;s derision.
* Aaron Stanford as John Allerdyce / Pyro: A friend of Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies and can control (although not create) fire. The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were impressed with his performance in &quot;Tadpole&quot;.
* Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oyama / Deathstrike: A mutant with a healing ability like Wolverine&#x27;s and who is controlled by Stryker. She wields long adamantium fingernails. Only her first name is mentioned in the dialogue.
* Anna Paquin as Marie / Rogue: A girl who can absorb any person&#x27;s memories and abilities by touching them. As she cannot control this power, Rogue can easily kill anyone and thus is unable to be close to people.

Additionally, Daniel Cudmore portrayed Peter Rasputin / Colossus: a mutant with the ability to turn his body into metal, the character&#x27;s importance was reduced to a cameo, Michael Reid MacKay portrayed Jason 143, William Stryker&#x27;s son who could create illusions. Keely Purvis portrayed the little girl whom Jason used as an avatar when controlling Xavier. Cotter Smith portrayed US President McKenna, and Ty Olsson portrayed Mitchell Laurio, the security guard for Magneto&#x27;s prison cell. Cameo appearances include Katie Stuart as Kitty Pryde, Bryce Hodgson as Artie, Kea Wong as Jubilation Lee / Jubilee, Steve Bacic as Dr. Hank McCoy, Shauna Kain as Theresa Rourke / Siryn, and Chiara Zanni, who voiced Jubilee in the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; animated series, as a White House tour guide at the start of the film. Gambit&#x27;s cameo was shot, but the footage was not used in the final cut. Also in the final scene with Xavier, a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket, as well as a blond-haired boy dressed in blue, played by Layke Anderson. These were confirmed to be Danielle Moonstar and Douglas Ramsey.&lt;ref name=&quot;writers/producers&quot;&gt;Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris, David Hayter, Lauren Shuler Donner, Ralph Winter, DVD audio commentary, 2003, 20th Century Fox&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, the film&#x27;s writers, cameo in scenes of Wolverine&#x27;s Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons.

==Production==

===Writing===
The financial and critical success of &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000) persuaded 20th Century Fox to immediately commission a sequel. Starting in November 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;second/uncanny&quot;&gt;&quot;The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men: Making X2&quot; Documentary, 2003, 20th Century Fox&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Singer researched various storylines (one of them being the Legacy Virus) of the &quot;X-Men&quot; comic book series. Singer wanted to study, &quot;the human perspective, the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism,&quot; citing a need for a &quot;human villain&quot;. Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned &quot;X2&quot; as the film series&#x27; equivalent to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise&#x27;s &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), in that the characters are &quot;all split apart, and then dissected, and revelations occur that are significant... the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen&quot;. Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date, while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts. Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Singer and Hayter worked on another script, finishing in October 2001. Penn was partially hired when he convinced Singer to not adapt &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; storyline for the film, feeling that the franchise&#x27;s universe should be established much more before &quot;going cosmic&quot;. Instead, in what he feels was his major contribution to the project, Penn based the film&#x27;s outline on Chris Claremont&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills&quot; (1982) before leaving to work on another movie.
Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn&#x27;s script in February 2002, turning down the opportunity to write &quot;Urban Legends: Bloody Mary&quot; (2005). they turned in hundreds of drafts to Singer. Angel and Beast appeared in early drafts, but were deleted because there were too many characters. Dr. Hank McCoy can be seen on a television interview in one scene. Beast&#x27;s appearance was to resemble Jim Lee&#x27;s 1991 artwork of the character in the series &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;. Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by William Stryker, transforming into Archangel. A reference to Dougherty&#x27;s and Harris&#x27;s efforts to include Angel remains in the form of an X-ray on display in one of Stryker&#x27;s labs. Tyler Mane was to reprise as Sabretooth before the character was deleted. In Hayter&#x27;s script, the role eventually filled by Lady Deathstrike was Anne Reynolds, a character who appears in &quot;God Loves, Man Kills&quot; as Stryker&#x27;s personal assistant/assassin. Singer changed her to Deathstrike, citing a need for &quot;another kick-ass mutant&quot;. There was to be more development on Cyclops and Professor X being brainwashed by Stryker. The scenes were shot, but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications. Hayter was disappointed, feeling that James Marsden deserved more screentime.

Rewrites were commissioned once more, specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time. This was because of her recent popularity in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; (2002), earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped. Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, &quot;The control room [of the Danger Room] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up [in that control room] and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room. The idea for the traveling is that if it&#x27;s a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can&#x27;t connect.&quot;

===Production===
Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had hoped to start filming in March 2002, but production did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. While filming the scene where Xavier and Lehnsherr play chess, Stewart and McKellen had no clue how to play chess so a Canadian grandmaster was called on set for a day. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers. James Bamford worked as Hugh Jackman&#x27;s stunt double for rehearsals until he suffered an injury; due to Bamford&#x27;s looks, Singer asked him to play the role of Gambit for a cameo appearance, but Gambit&#x27;s scene was deleted from the film&#x27;s final cut. According to Alan Cumming, Singer began berating the cast which lead to Halle Berry saying to Singer &quot;you can kiss my black ass&quot;. Cumming would also later say that working on the film was a &quot;bad experience&quot;.

John Ottman composed the score. Ottman established a new title theme, as well as themes specifically for Magneto, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Mystique, and Pyro.

===Design and visual effects===
Singer and Sigel credited &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002) as a visual influence. Though Sigel shot the first &quot;X-Men&quot; in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot &quot;X2&quot; in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, &quot;If you think about it, every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it. They&#x27;ll never be as good as the spherical lenses that they emulate.&quot; Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, as well as an Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments.

The Blackbird was redesigned and increased in virtual size from 60 feet to 85 feet. John Myhre served as the production designer on the first film, but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for &quot;X2&quot;, which was his first film as a production designer. For scenes involving Stryker&#x27;s Alkali Base, Vancouver Film Studios, the largest sound stage in North America, was reserved.

Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink was not satisfied with his work on the previous film, despite the fact it nearly received an Academy Award nomination. Up to 520 shots were created for &quot;X-Men&quot;, while &quot;X2&quot; commissioned roughly 800. A new computer program was created by Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios (R&amp;H) for the dogfight tornado scene. Cinesite was in charge of scenes concerning Cerebro, enlisting a 20-man crew. The Alkali Lake Dam miniature was high and wide. Cinesite created 300 visual effects shots, focusing on character animation, while Rhythm and Hues created over 100. Janssen would later admit that she was not a fan working with green screen on set of the film.

===Post-production===
The first cut of &quot;X2&quot; was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, due to violent shots with Logan when Stryker&#x27;s army storms the X-Mansion. A few seconds were cut to secure a PG-13 rating.

==Release==
The film premiered in London on April 24, 2003, and then had the widest release ever, opening on May 2, 2003, in 93 markets, on 7,316 screens overseas and in 3,741 theaters in the United States and Canada.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;X2&quot; opened May 2, 2003, accumulating $85.6million on its opening weekend in 3,749 theaters in the United States and Canada. Overseas, it grossed $69.27million in its first five days, including previews. The film exceeded &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; in terms of number of screenings. &quot;X2&quot; would hold this record until the following year, when it was taken by &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. It surpassed &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; for having the highest opening weekend for a 20th Century Fox film. For two weeks, it stayed in the number 1 spot before being displaced by &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; all became the first five films to cross the $200-million mark at the box office in one summer season. The film grossed $214.9million in the United States and Canada, the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2003, earning $192.8million overseas, for a worldwide total of $407.7million, the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2003. It earned $107million in its first five days when released on DVD.

===Critical response===
&quot;X2&quot; received positive reviews, with praise aimed at the acting, action, and story. The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that of critics gave the film a positive review, based on reviews with an average score of . The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Tightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot; is bigger and better than its predecessor—and a benchmark for comic sequels in general.&quot; Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert was impressed by how Singer was able to handle so many characters in one film, but felt &quot;the storyline did not live up to its potential&quot;. In addition, Ebert wrote that the film&#x27;s closing was perfect for a future installment, giving &quot;X2&quot; three out of four stars. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than its predecessor. Turan observed that the film carried emotional themes that are present in the world today and commented that &quot;the acting was better than usual [for a superhero film]&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance, concluding &quot;&quot;X2&quot; is a summer firecracker. It&#x27;s also a tribute to outcasts, teens, gays, minorities, even Dixie Chicks.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; called &quot;X2&quot; the best comic book movie of all time in 2006, while &quot;Wizard&quot; named the film&#x27;s ending as the 22nd greatest cliffhanger of all time. In May 2007, Rotten Tomatoes listed &quot;X2&quot; as the fifth greatest comic book film of all time.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; was critical of the storyline, special effects and action scenes. Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; specifically referred to the film as &quot;fast-paced, slow-witted&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; argued that Singer depended too much on seriousness and that he did not have enough sensibilities to communicate to an audience.

===Accolades===
The film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. In addition, Bryan Singer (Direction), Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty (Writing), and John Ottman (Music) all received nominations. It also received nominations for its costumes, makeup, special effects and DVD release, amounting to a total of eight nominations. The Political Film Society honored &quot;X2&quot; in the categories of Human Rights and Peace, while the film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form).

==Music==

The film&#x27;s score was composed by John Ottman, a regular collaborator with film director Bryan Singer. The soundtrack album &quot;X2: Original Motion Picture Score&quot; was released on April 29, 2003. Ottman used a sample of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; as the basis for the music in scenes featuring Nightcrawler. As well as the music on the album, tracks by Conjure One and &#x27;N Sync also featured in the film.

On July 19, 2012, La-La Land Records and Fox Music issued an expanded version of Ottman&#x27;s score, including the specially recorded version of Alfred Newman&#x27;s 20th Century Fox fanfare incorporating Ottman&#x27;s film theme.

<doc id="288307" wikidata="Q13634051" url="?curid=288307" title="Replica plating">
<text>Replica plating is a microbiological technique in which one or more secondary Petri plates containing different solid (agar-based) selective growth media (lacking nutrients or containing chemical growth inhibitors such as antibiotics) are inoculated with the same colonies of microorganisms from a primary plate (or master dish), reproducing the original spatial pattern of colonies. The technique involves pressing a velveteen-covered disk, and then imprinting secondary plates with cells in colonies removed from the original plate by the material. Generally, large numbers of colonies (roughly 30-300) are replica plated due to the difficulty in streaking each out individually onto a separate plate. 
The purpose of replica plating is to be able to compare the master plate and any secondary plates, typically to screen for a desired phenotype. For example, when a colony that was present on the primary plate (or master dish), fails to appear on a secondary plate, it shows that the colony was sensitive to a substance on that particular secondary plate. Common screenable phenotypes include auxotrophy and antibiotic resistance.

Replica plating is especially useful for &quot;negative selection&quot;. However, it is more correct to refer to &quot;negative screening&quot; instead of using the term &#x27;selection&#x27;. For example, if one wanted to select colonies that were sensitive to ampicillin, the primary plate could be replica plated on a secondary Amp+ agar plate. The sensitive colonies on the secondary plate would die but the colonies could still be deduced from the primary plate since the two have the same spatial patterns from ampicillin resistant colonies. The sensitive colonies could then be picked off from the primary plate. Frequently the last plate will be non-selective. In the figure, a nonselective plate will be replica plated after the Amp+ plate to confirm that the absence of growth on the selective plate is due to the selection itself and not a problem with transferring cells. If one sees growth on the third (nonselective) plate but not the second one, the selective agent is responsible for the lack of growth. If the non-selective plate shows no growth, one cannot say whether viable cells were transferred at all, and no conclusions can be made about the presence or absence of growth on selective media. This is particularly useful if there are questions about the age or viability of the cells on the original plate. 

By increasing the variety of secondary plates with different selective growth media, it is possible to rapidly screen a large number of individual isolated colonies for as many phenotypes as there are secondary plates. 

The development of replica plating required two steps. The first step was to define the problem: a method of identifiably duplicating colonies. The second step was to devise a means to reliably implement the first step. Replica plating was first described by Esther Lederberg and Joshua Lederberg in 1952.One of the nutrient agar plate will have antibiotic resistance. Lederberg sought to use a fabric that was able to be sterilized, and had a vertical fabric pile, akin to a 2D analog &quot;wire brush&quot; of that had been classically used to transfer colonies. Paper was unsatisfactory as &quot;its lateral capillarity and its compression of the colonies distorted and broke up the original growth pattern.&quot;, and nylon velvet was too expensive and its stiffer fibers caused problems, leading to the choice and eventual standardization on cotton velveteen. While first demonstrated with bacteria, velveteen based replica plating has also become a standard technique in the microbiology of eukaryotes, such as yeast.

<text>A web application (or web app) is application software that is created with web technologies and runs via a web browser. Web applications emerged during the late 1990s and allowed for the server to dynamically build a response to the request, in contrast to static web pages.

Web applications are commonly distributed via a web server. There are several different tier systems that web applications use to communicate between the web browsers, the client interface, and server data. Each system has their own uses as they function in different ways. However, there are many security risks that developers must be aware of during development; proper measures to protect user data is vital.

Web applications are often constructed with the use of a web application framework. Single-page and progressive are two approaches for a website to seem more like a native app.

==History==
The concept of a &quot;web application&quot; was first introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2, which was released in 1999. At that time, both JavaScript and XML had already been developed, but the XMLHttpRequest object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.[&quot;&quot;] Beginning around the early 2000s, applications such as &quot;Myspace (2003), Gmail (2004), Digg (2004), [and] Google Maps (2005),&quot; started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page. The practice became known as Ajax in 2005.

In earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on each user&#x27;s personal computer. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity. Additionally, both the client and server components of the application were bound tightly to a particular computer architecture and operating system, which made porting them to other systems prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications.

Later, in 1995, Netscape introduced the client-side scripting language called JavaScript, which allowed programmers to add dynamic elements to the user interface that ran on the client side. Essentially, instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.

&quot;Progressive web apps&quot;, the term coined by designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell in 2015, refers to apps taking advantage of new features supported by modern browsers, which initially run inside a web browser tab but later can run completely offline and can be launched without entering the app URL in the browser.

==Structure==

Traditional PC applications are typically single-tiered, residing solely on the client machine. In contrast, web applications inherently facilitate a multi-tiered architecture. Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the three-tiered application. In its most common form, the three tiers are called &quot;presentation&quot;, &quot;application&quot; and &quot;storage&quot;. The first tier, presentation, refers to a web browser itself. The second tier refers to any engine using dynamic web content technology (such as ASP, CGI, ColdFusion, Dart, JSP/Java, Node.js, PHP, Python or Ruby on Rails). The third tier refers to a database that stores data and determines the structure of a user interface. Essentially, when using the three-tiered system, the web browser sends requests to the engine, which then services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.

The 3-tier solution may fall short when dealing with more complex applications, and may need to be replaced with the n-tiered approach; the greatest benefit of which is how business logic (which resides on the application tier) is broken down into a more fine-grained model. Another benefit would be to add an integration tier, which separates the data tier and provides an easy-to-use interface to access the data. For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a &quot;list_clients()&quot; function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers.

There are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a &quot;smart&quot; client that performs all the work and queries a &quot;dumb&quot; server, or a &quot;dumb&quot; client that relies on a &quot;smart&quot; server. The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both. While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still does not allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model.

==Security==
Security breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application, and there are some key operational areas that must be included in the development process. This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning is sometimes more effective and less disruptive in the long run.

==Development==
Writing web applications is simplified with the use of web application frameworks. These frameworks facilitate rapid application development by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management.

In addition, there is potential for the development of applications on Internet operating systems, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model.

<text>Instinct is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behaviour, containing innate (inborn) elements. The simplest example of an instinctive behaviour is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a corresponding clearly defined stimulus. 
Any behaviour is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience (that is, in the absence of learning), and is therefore an expression of innate biological factors. Sea turtles, newly hatched on a beach, will instinctively move toward the ocean. A marsupial climbs into its mother&#x27;s pouch upon being born. Other examples include animal fighting, animal courtship behaviour, internal escape functions, and the building of nests. Though an instinct is defined by its invariant innate characteristics, details of its performance can be changed by experience; for example, a dog can improve its listening skills by practice.

Instincts are inborn complex patterns of behaviour that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from reflexes, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.

Instinctual behaviour in humans has been studied.

==Early theorists==
=== Jean Henri Fabre ===
Jean Henri Fabre (1823–1915) is said to be the first person to study small animals (other than birds) and insects, and he specifically specialized in the instincts of insects. Fabre considered an instinct to be a linked set of behaviours that an organism undergoes unconsciously in response to external conditions.

==== Insect and animal behaviour ====
Fabre concluded a significant difference between humans and other animals is that most animals cannot reason. He came to this conclusion after observing how insects and wild birds continued to repeat a certain behaviour in response to a novel situation. While these instinctive behaviours appeared complex, the insects and animals did not adjust their behaviour despite it not helping them in that novel situation.

The following are some insect and animal behaviours that Fabre observed and labelled &quot;instinctive&quot;, for they do not involve reasoning:
* Maternal instincts
* Metamorphosis
* Mimicry
* Molting
* Playing dead
* Taxis

==== Fixed patterns ====
Fabre believed instincts were &quot;fixed patterns&quot;, meaning these linked sets of behaviours do not change in response to novel environmental situations. One specific example that helped him arrive at this conclusion is his study of various wasp species. All of the wasp species he studied performed a certain pattern of behaviour when catching their prey, which Fabre called a fixed pattern. Then Fabre intervened in the wasps&#x27; process of catching prey, and only one of the species adjusted their behaviour in response to this unfamiliar interception. Fabre explained this contradiction by arguing that any individuals which stray from the norms of their species are merely an exception, while also admitting that there could be some room for growth within a species&#x27; instincts.

Fabre&#x27;s belief that instincts are fixed opposes the theory of evolution. He rejected that one species could evolve into another, and also rejected that human consciousness could be achieved through the evolution of unconscious traits.

=== Wilhelm Wundt ===
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) is known for founding the first psychology laboratory, which occurred in 1879 at the University of Leipzig. He was able to draw conclusions about instinct from his careful observations of both animal and human behaviour.

==== Unconscious processes ====
Wundt believed unconscious processes (which he called &quot;instinctive movements&quot;) were the result of sensations and emotions, and these unconscious processes were building blocks towards consciousness.

==== Facial expressions ====
An example of what Wundt studied to arrive at his conclusions regarding unconscious processes includes the facial expressions babies made in response to the sensations of sweet, sour, and bitter tastes. He concluded these facial expressions were the result of the babies trying to avoid unpleasant emotions because there was something unpleasant in their mouths, and that these instincts (which he uses interchangeably with reflexive movements) only became innate because past generations learned it and it benefited their survival.

==== Natural selection ====
The process by which Wundt explained the existence of instincts is natural selection. More specifically, his research suggests natural selection causes small changes in the nervous system over time. These changes bring about hereditary drives in organisms, which are then responsible for any unconscious processes. Another thing to note is that Wundt used the terms &quot;unconscious processes&quot;, &quot;reflexive movements&quot;, and &quot;instinctive movements&quot; interchangeably, often grouping them together.

=== Sigmund Freud ===
Sigmund Freud considered that mental images of bodily needs, expressed in the form of mental desires, are called instincts.

=== William McDougall ===
In the early 20th century, there was recognized a &quot;union of instinct and emotion&quot;. William McDougall held that many instincts have their respective associated specific emotions. As research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an explanation for human behaviour became less common. In 1932, McDougall argued that the word &quot;instinct&quot; is more suitable for describing animal behaviour, while he recommended the word &quot;&quot; for goal-directed combinations of the many innate human abilities, which are loosely and variably linked, in a way that shows strong plasticity.

=== Abraham Maslow ===
In the 1950s, the psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong &quot;drives&quot;. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.

=== Konrad Lorenz ===
An interest in innate behaviours arose again in the 1950s with Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen, who made the distinction between instinct and learned behaviours. Our modern understanding of instinctual behaviour in animals owes much to their work. For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots. This suggests that the identity of the goose&#x27;s mother was learned, but the goose&#x27;s behaviour towards what it perceived as its mother was instinctive.

=== Frank Beach ===
In a conference in 1960, chaired by Frank Beach, a pioneer in comparative psychology, and attended by luminaries in the field, the term &quot;instinct&quot; was restricted in its application. During the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks still contained some discussion of instincts in reference to human behaviour. By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best selling textbooks in introductory psychology revealed only one reference to instincts, and that was in regard to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s referral to the &quot;id&quot; instincts. In this sense, the term &quot;instinct&quot; appeared to have become outmoded for introductory textbooks on human psychology.

The book &quot;Instinct: An Enduring Problem in Psychology&quot; (1961) selected a range of writings about the topic.

=== Richard Herrnstein ===
In a classic paper published in 1972, the psychologist Richard Herrnstein wrote: &quot;A comparison of McDougall&#x27;s theory of instinct and Skinner&#x27;s reinforcement theory—representing nature and nurture—shows remarkable, and largely unrecognized, similarities between the contending sides in the nature–nurture debate as applied to the analysis of behavior.&quot;

F. B. Mandal proposed a set of criteria by which a behaviour might be considered instinctual: (a) be automatic, (b) be irresistible, (c) occur at some point in development, (d) be triggered by some event in the environment, (e) occur in every member of the species, (f) be unmodifiable, and (g) govern behaviour for which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from experience and to that degree the behaviour is modifiable).

In &quot;Information Behavior: An Evolutionary Instinct&quot; (2010, pp. 35–42), Amanda Spink notes that &quot;currently in the behavioral sciences instinct is generally understood as the innate part of behavior that emerges without any training or education in humans.&quot; She claims that the viewpoint that information behaviour has an instinctive basis is grounded in the latest thinking on human behaviour. Furthermore, she notes that &quot;behaviors such as cooperation, sexual behavior, child rearing and aesthetics are [also] seen as &#x27;evolved psychological mechanisms&#x27; with an instinctive basis.&quot; Spink adds that Steven Pinker similarly asserts that language acquisition is instinctive in humans in his book &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; (1994). In 1908, William McDougall wrote about the &quot;instinct of curiosity&quot; and its associated &quot;emotion of wonder&quot;, though Spink&#x27;s book does not mention this.

M. S. Blumberg in 2017 examined the use of the word instinct, and found it varied significantly.

==In humans==

Among possible examples of instinct-influenced behaviour in humans are the following.

# Congenital preparedness for developing fear of snakes and spiders was found in six-month-old babies.
# Infant cry is believed to be a manifestation of instinct. The infant cannot otherwise protect itself for survival during its long period of maturation. The maternal and paternal bond manifest particularly in response to the infant cry. Its mechanism has been partly elucidated by observations with functional MRI of the parent&#x27;s brain.
# The herd instinct is found in human children and chimpanzee infants, but is apparently absent in the young orangutans.
#Hormones are linked to specific forms of human behaviour, such as sexuality. High levels of testosterone are often associated in a person (male or female) with aggressiveness. Decrease in testosterone level after the birth of a child was found among fathers.
# Hygiene behaviour in humans was suggested to be partly instinctive, based on emotions such as disgust.
# Maternal bond or maternal instinct is when a mother develops a relationship to a child to provide for its well-being. Maternal oxytocin is the hormone and neuropeptide thought to be responsible for predisposing women to showing bonding behavior and bonding.
# Self-preservation in people generally is when they have the instinct to survive.
# Fight-or-flight response in human beings has been said to be a particular response to the arising harmful event, attack or threat to survival.
# Cooperation behavior or social instinct has been postulated as an instinct necessary for the future survival of people.
# Resistance towards change is the difficulty experienced by a person when they are trying to push against the suggestions made to change behavior or accept certain treatments regardless of whether it will improve their condition or not.
# Adaptive behaviour to environment is an inherited innate phenotypic characteristic, whether inherited as instincts intricately, or as a neuropsychological capacity that furthers learning. Examples are mating, searching for food, situational awareness, establishing the pecking order and vocalizations.

==Reflexes==

Examples of behaviours that do not require thought include many reflexes. The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the reflex arc. Reflexes are similar to fixed action patterns in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a fixed action pattern. However, a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male stickleback&#x27;s instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example. Examples of instinctive behaviours in humans include many of the primitive reflexes, such as rooting and suckling, behaviours which are present in mammals. In rats, it has been observed that innate responses are related to specific chemicals, and these chemicals are detected by two organs located in the nose: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE).

==Maturational==
Some instinctive behaviours depend on maturational processes to appear. For instance, we commonly refer to birds &quot;learning&quot; to fly. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning.

==In evolution==
Imprinting provides one example of instinct. This complex response may involve visual, auditory, and olfactory cues in the environment surrounding an organism. In some cases, imprinting attaches an offspring to its parent, which is a reproductive benefit to offspring survival. If an offspring has attachment to a parent, it is more likely to stay nearby under parental protection. Attached offspring are also more likely to learn from a parental figure when interacting closely. (Reproductive benefits are a driving force behind natural selection.)

Environment is an important factor in the evolution of innate behaviour. A hypothesis of Michael McCollough, a positive psychologist, explains that environment plays a key role in human behaviours such as forgiveness and revenge. This hypothesis theorizes that various social environments cause either forgiveness or revenge to prevail. McCollough relates his theory to game theory. In a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperation and retaliation are comparable to forgiveness and revenge. The choice between the two can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on what the partner-organism chooses. Though this psychological example of game theory does not have such directly measurable results, it provides an interesting theory of unique thought. From a more biological standpoint, the brain&#x27;s limbic system operates as the main control-area for response to certain stimuli, including a variety of instinctual behaviour. The limbic system processes external stimuli related to emotions, social activity, and motivation, which propagates a behavioural response. Some behaviours include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social hierarchy. These behaviours are influenced by sensory input — sight, sound, touch, and smell.

Within the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For example, many rodents have receptors in the vomeronasal organ that respond explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a response of defense or fear. Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the olfactory system, detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then travel to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized and specific. Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this complex process.

Instinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles: genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit behaviours without learning them.

<doc id="288321" wikidata="Q3241045" url="?curid=288321" title="Disease outbreak">
<text>In epidemiology, an outbreak is a sudden increase in occurrences of a disease when cases are in excess of normal expectancy for the location or season. It may affect a small and localized group or impact upon thousands of people across an entire continent. The number of cases varies according to the disease-causing agent, and the size and type of previous and existing exposure to the agent. Outbreaks include many epidemics, which term is normally only for infectious diseases, as well as diseases with an environmental origin, such as a water or foodborne disease. They may affect a region in a country or a group of countries. Pandemics are near-global disease outbreaks when multiple and various countries around the Earth are soon infected.

==Definition==
The terms &quot;outbreak&quot; and &quot;epidemic&quot; have often been used interchangeably. Researchers Manfred S. Green and colleagues propose that the latter term be restricted to larger events, pointing out that &quot;Chambers Concise Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Stedman&#x27;s Medical Dictionary&quot; acknowledge this distinction.

==Outbreak investigation== 

When investigating disease outbreaks, the epidemiology profession has developed a number of widely accepted steps. As described by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these include the following:
* Identify the existence of the outbreak (Is the group of ill persons normal for the time of year, geographic area, etc.?)
* Verify the diagnosis related to the outbreak
* Create a case definition to define who/what is included as a case
* Map the spread of the outbreak using Information technology as diagnosis is reported to insurance
* Develop a hypothesis (What appears to be causing the outbreak?)
* Study hypotheses (collect data and perform analysis)
* Refine hypothesis and carry out further study
* Develop and implement control and prevention systems
* Release findings to greater communities

The order of the above steps and relative amount of effort and resources used in each varies from outbreak to outbreak. For example, prevention and control measures are usually implemented very early in the investigation, often before the causative agent is known. In many situations, promoting good hygiene and hand-washing is one of the first things recommended. Other interventions may be added as the investigation moves forward and more information is obtained. Waiting until the end of an investigation to implement prevention and control measures is a sure way to lose ones job. In outbreaks identified through notifiable disease surveillance, reports are often linked to laboratory results and verifying the diagnosis is straight forward. In outbreaks of unknown etiology, determining and verifying the diagnosis can be a significant part of the investigation with respect to time and resources. Several steps are usually going on at any point in time during the investigation. Steps may be repeated. For example, initial case definitions are often established to be intentionally broad but later refined as more is learned about the outbreak. The above list has 9 steps, others have more. Implementing active surveillance to identify additional cases is often added.
Outbreak debriefing and review has also been recognized as an additional final step and iterative process by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

==Types==
There are several outbreak patterns, which can be useful in identifying the transmission method or source, and predicting the future rate of infection. Each has a distinctive epidemic curve, or histogram of case infections and deaths.
* Common source – All victims acquire the infection from the same source (e.g. a contaminated water supply).
** Continuous source – Common source outbreak where the exposure occurs over multiple incubation periods
** Point source – Common source outbreak where the exposure occurs in less than one incubation period
* Propagated – Transmission occurs from person to person.

Outbreaks can also be:
* Behavioral risk related (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases, increased risk due to malnutrition)
* Zoonotic – The infectious agent is endemic to an animal population, infection is transferred to humans.

Patterns of occurrence are:
* Endemic – a communicable disease, such as influenza, measles, mumps, pneumonia, colds, viruses, and smallpox, which is characteristic of a particular place, or among a particular group, or area of interest or activity.
* Epidemic – when this disease is found to infect a significantly larger number of people at the same time than is common at that time, and among that population, and may spread through one or several communities.
* Pandemic – occurs when an epidemic spreads worldwide.

== Condition for declaring an outbreak over ==
By convention, a communicable disease outbreak is declared over when a period of twice the incubation period of the infectious disease has elapsed without identification of any new case, however, for organisms with a short incubation period (e.g. fewer than ten days), a period of three times the incubation period is preferred.

==Outbreak legislation==
Outbreak legislation is still in its infancy and not many countries have had a direct and complete set of the provisions.
However, some countries do manage the outbreaks using relevant acts, such as public health law.
World Health Organization member states are obligated by International Health Regulations to report outbreaks. WHO member states are holding a special session in November 2021 to consider the International Treaty for Pandemic Preparedness and Response to establish further legal obligations in managing disease outbreaks.

<text>The Philippine Independent Church (; ), officially referred to by its Philippine Spanish name  (IFI) and colloquially called the Aglipayan Church, is an independent Christian denomination, in the form of a nationalist church, in the Philippines. Its revolutionary nationalist schism from the Roman Catholic Church was proclaimed during the American colonial period in 1902, following the end of the Philippine–American War, by members of the country&#x27;s first labor union federation, the &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina&quot;, as a response to the pronounced mistreatment of Filipinos by Spanish priests and partly influenced by the unjust executions of José Rizal and Filipino priests and prominent secularization movement figures Mariano Gomez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, during earlier Spanish colonial rule when Roman Catholicism was the state religion in the country.

Prolific Filipino historian Teodoro Agoncillo described the Philippine Independent Church as &quot;the only living and tangible result of the Philippine Revolution.&quot; Ever since its inception, the IFI Aglipayanism is widely characterized as a schismatic, rather than a heretical movement, although the church itself and its congregation distance themselves from the &quot;schismatic&quot; description and prefers the term &quot;independence&quot; instead. Despite not being in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church, the Philippine Independent Church universally maintains and adheres to the core set of beliefs and practices of broader catholicity.

The Philippine Independent Church is the country&#x27;s first and oldest wholly Filipino-led independent Christian church. Its central office is located at the National Cathedral of the Holy Child in Ermita, Manila. At present, it is ecumenically in full communion with the worldwide Anglican Communion, the third largest Christian communion in the world, while still maintaining its independence as per their and does not require from either the acceptance of all doctrinal opinions. Although marked with Anglican influence, the Philippine Independent Church had come to develop its own liturgy, traditions, and theology distinct from Anglicanism. Originally professing to Trinitarianism, the Philippine Independent Church unofficially shifted to a Unitarian theological doctrine during its earliest years but has reverted to Trinitarinism since 1947 to present.

The Philippine Independent Church has historically been involved in social and political issues in the Philippines, advocating for workers&#x27; rights, social justice, and nationalism. It has supported movements for land reform, sustainable development, indigenous rights, and workers&#x27; rights, making it one of the more socially active churches in the country.

==History==
===Gregorio Aglipay and the Philippine Revolution===
Gregorio Aglipay was an activist and Roman Catholic priest from Ilocos Norte, who would later be excommunicated by then Archbishop of Manila, Bernardino Nozaleda, for &quot;usurpation of ecclesiastical jurisdiction&quot; by joining Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s libertarian movement and suspicion in possibly fomenting schism with the Pope (then Pope Leo XIII) in 1899 at the height of the Philippine–American War.

During the earlier Philippine Revolution, Aglipay and his former college schoolmate and fellow anti-friar Isabelo de los Reyes (also known as &quot;Don Belong&quot;), an &quot;ilustrado&quot; author, journalist, and labour activist who was in exile in Spain at the time, acted to reform the Filipino Catholic clergy which was then dominated and controlled by Spanish friars (&quot;frailocracy&quot;) as Roman Catholicism was the state religion at the time of the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. At the time, almost all native Filipino priests were already prohibited from administering a parish since 1870 and were just coadjutors or assistants to the Spanish friars. Native priests were also denied consecration to the episcopacy. Then-President Emilio Aguinaldo persuaded Aglipay to head the native Filipino clergy by appointing him military vicar general of the Philippine Revolution in 1898, wishing to overthrow the spiritual power of the Spanish friar-bishops.

Aglipay was a member of the Malolos Congress, the lone member coming from the religious sector, although he also represented his home province, as well.

Aglipay was also a guerrilla leader during the Philippine–American War, with the rank of lieutenant-general. He was also the convener of the Filipino Ecclesiastical Council (Paniqui Assembly) on October 23, 1899, months following his excommunication, in response to the manifesto of former Prime Minister Apolinario Mabini, who first came up with the idea of urging the Filipino clergy to organize a &quot;Filipino national church&quot; as inspired by the secularization movement, but not necessarily a schism from Rome. The idea received support from Aguinaldo. The assembly was attended by 28 native Filipino priests, thus, the short-lived national church was materialized. However, it was disestablished in 1901 following the dissolution of the First Philippine Republic.

===Post-excommunication and establishment of the Church by Isabelo de los Reyes and the &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática&quot;===

Following the end of the Philippine–American War, Isabelo de los Reyes, together with the members of &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina&quot;, formally founded and publicly proclaimed the commencement of the (abbreviated as IFI and translated to &quot;Philippine Independent Church&quot; in English) on August 3, 1902, at the &quot;Centro de Bellas Artes&quot; in Quiapo, Manila. The new church faced opposition from the colonial government, which sought to maintain the status quo. The church was later incorporated with the then-Insular Government of the Philippines as a religious corporation sole in 1904. The new church rejected the spiritual authority and infallibility of the Pope and abolished the celibacy requirement for priests, allowing them to marry. At that time, even before Aglipay joined the movement, all of its clergy were former Roman Catholic priests, mostly from the Ilocos Region, with some of whom became the church&#x27;s first ever nominated and elected bishops by its earliest batch of clergy and laity who mostly belong to various political parties in Manila. Among the first elected bishops was former Roman Catholic priest and vicar forane Pedro Brillantes. The elected bishops then formed the church&#x27;s first Supreme Council of Bishops. De los Reyes also formed an Executive Committee for the church from the staff of the &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina&quot; who drafted the church&#x27;s early first two Fundamental Epistles, which were later approved by the Supreme Council of Bishops. The elected bishops were then consecrated by the other priests as justified in accordance with the Fundamental Epistles. The first ever bishop to be consecrated in the IFI was Pedro Brillantes, whose consecration took place on October 20, 1902, and proclaimed Bacarra, Ilocos Norte as his episcopal seat. All of the former Roman Catholic clergy who joined the movement were later declared excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church.

Isabelo de los Reyes was the chief initiator of the separation and suggested that Gregorio Aglipay, knowing that he was influential with the Filipino clergy, should be the founding head, or &quot;Obispo Maximo&quot; (Supreme Bishop), of the church which was unanimously agreed by the members present in the proclamation. De los Reyes&#x27; desire to form a new church was conceptualized upon his repatriation to the Philippines from Spain in 1901 after his talks in 1899 with Giuseppe Francica-Nava de Bontifè, then the Apostolic Nuncio to Spain, to request the Holy See in looking into the conditions of the Philippines had failed. By then, the country had changed from Spanish rule to American. Although the American concept of separation of church and state was introduced in the Philippine Constitution of 1899, Spanish friars were still in control of the parishes all throughout the country, and de los Reyes feared that American clergy would sooner or later replace the Spanish, instead of native Filipinos. Along with the American colonization was the arrival of the American Protestant missionaries in the Philippines starting in 1901. De los Reyes envisioned the new church as a significant move towards Filipino sovereignty, not just politically but also spiritually.

De los Reyes managed to rally enough people from his organization, &quot;Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina&quot;, the first modern labor union federation in the country wherein he was its first president, to materialize an independent and purely Filipino-led church &quot;&quot;conserving all that is good in the Roman Church and eliminating all the deceptions which the Romanists had introduced to corrupt the moral purity and sacredness of the doctrines of Christ&quot;.&quot; At the time, he had the necessary logistics and resources needed to form a new Filipino-led church, but one: an equipped and empowered bishop to head it.

At first, the already-excommunicated Aglipay was reluctant, as he was initially against a schism and was faithful to the magisterium. He believed that all means of reaching an understanding with Rome should be exhausted first before declaring any schism. Doubting that Aglipay might not take the leadership, the church elected its first batch of bishops, with Pedro Brillantes as the first ever to be consecrated. However, after Aglipay&#x27;s talks with Jesuit and American Protestant leaders quickly backfired when both were dismissive and would not allow native Filipino priests to lead their respective churches, he eventually accepted de los Reyes&#x27; offer to head the independent church and was proclaimed as a bishop by the Supreme Council of Bishops of the newly-formed church on September 6, 1902, while also serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;supreme bishop&quot; until he was finally consecrated to the position by his fellow other bishops on January 18, 1903. Thus, the denomination also became known as the &quot;Aglipayan Church&quot;, after its first supreme bishop.

Aglipay celebrated his first mass as the &quot;de facto&quot; Supreme Bishop on October 26, 1902 in the IFI&#x27;s first central church at Calle Lemery in Tondo, Manila. During his first mass, Apolinario Mabini, who was in exile at the time and in bad health condition, sent a letter of encouragement to the new church. Isabelo de los Reyes himself would later be formally excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1903. De los Reyes assumed the role of the &quot;de facto&quot; principal theologian, as well as a lay leader, in the church. On October 1, 1902, Aglipay headed the signatories, approval, and promulgation of the very first and short-lived temporary Constitution of the . Subsequently, Aglipay also formally signed the third up to the sixth and last Fundamental Epistles. In late 1902, the church opened a seminary which was later renamed &quot;Seminario Central de Mabini&quot; (predecessor of present-day Aglipay Central Theological Seminary), named after Apolinario Mabini, at Nancamaliran West, Urdaneta, Pangasinan. With its nationwide campaign, the IFI was able to gain roughly three to five million followers all over the country on its first year of separation from the Roman Catholic Church. All of which are former Roman Catholics, including priests.
Immediately after accepting the post, Aglipay demanded both then Governor-General William Howard Taft and Roman Catholic Church authorities to turn-over the church buildings to him on September 27, 1902, starting with the Manila Cathedral, but got rejected. A five-year campaign resulted in the acquisition of nearly one-half of Roman Catholic Church properties in the country by Aglipay&#x27;s followers. However, in 1906, the then-conservative Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that all property that had been occupied by Aglipay&#x27;s followers had to be returned to the Roman Catholic Church. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the decision in 1909. The Aglipayan Church was then forced to move to makeshift quarters, with only a handful of followers able to retain the occupied buildings.

===Developing early theology===
On October 28, 1903, the IFI adopted the &quot;Doctrina y Reglas Constitucionales&quot; (DRC), which replaced the Fundamental Epistles as the doctrinal foundation and governing rules of the Church, with slight revisions in 1918 and 1940.

Aglipay, like José Rizal, later became a Freemason in May 1918. Although not a Mason himself, de los Reyes — who created a distinct doctrine, liturgy, and organization for the Philippine Independent Church — drew on aspects of their theology and worship, which was then approved formally by Aglipay. De los Reyes was supported by Miguel Morayta, Grand Master of the Spanish Orient Lodge of Freemasonry in Madrid. The Jesuit historian John N. Schumacher contended that Morayta and other non-Filipino Masons and secular laymen pushed Aglipay and de los Reyes towards schism from the Roman Catholic Church because of their resentment towards the activities of Catholic religious orders in the Philippines, rather than any simple admiration and encouragement for Filipino nationalism. Aglipay in 1929 titled de los Reyes, who remained a layman, as an &quot;Obispo Honorario&quot; (Honorary Bishop).
From 1902 to 1907, the Church was Trinitarian and largely followed Catholic forms of worship. It reformed the Latin Tridentine liturgy, and the Mass in its earliest days was said both in Spanish and the vernacular. Aglipay and de los Reyes later amended their theology, coming to reject the divinity of Jesus and the Holy Trinity, becoming theologically (though not officially) Unitarian in 1907. Aglipay and de los Reyes&#x27; Unitarian, rationalist, and progressive theological views were already evident in the church&#x27;s &quot;Catecismo de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot; (1905), &quot;Oficio Divino&quot; (1906), and subsequently the novena, &quot;Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak&quot; (1925), as well as its English translation, &quot;Novenary of the Motherland&quot; (1926). However, a significant number of the Church&#x27;s population refused to accept the new Unitarian theology, and continued to profess Trinitarianism.

De los Reyes held the position of Honorary Bishop until his death on October 10, 1938. There were claims that he allegedly recanted and returned to the Catholic Church two years before his death. However, his son, Isabelo de los Reyes Jr., who later became Supreme Bishop, vehemently denied the claims. Aglipay, meanwhile, was Supreme Bishop until his own death on September 1, 1940.

===Ecumenism, factionalism, and schism into offshoot &quot;Aglipayan&quot; sects===
From its early years, two principal factions coexisted uneasily within the IFI and had become even more apparent after Isabelo Sr. and Aglipay&#x27;s death: one Unitarian (led by Aglipay&#x27;s successor and former personal secretary, cleric-turned-politician, and second supreme bishop, Santiago Fonacier – who was elected after Aglipay&#x27;s death in accordance with the constitution of the church and was faithful to Aglipay and Isabelo Sr.&#x27;s theology), and the other, Trinitarian (led by Isabelo de los Reyes Jr. – the church&#x27;s then-general secretary who was elected the fourth supreme bishop in 1946).

Before being elected, Fonacier initially committed to steer the IFI back to Trinitarism, however during his tenure, his theological and doctrinal stance was evidently still leaning towards his predecessor&#x27;s Unitarian beliefs. On January 21, 1946, Fonacier was ousted from his position after a unanimous decree by the church&#x27;s Supreme Council of Bishops due to controversies regarding certain decisions he imposed, which were deemed allegedly unconstitutional. A schism developed at the tail-end of Fonacier&#x27;s term, and the Unitarian faction, which included bishop Juan V. Jamias (Aglipay&#x27;s brother-in-law and brother of Aglipay&#x27;s wife Pilar Jamias), left the church, claiming the right to the name and possession of church properties. Gerardo Bayaca served as interim supreme bishop until he was succeeded by Isabelo de los Reyes Jr. Under Isabelo Jr.&#x27;s leadership, the church&#x27;s affiliation with revolutionary movements were severed and abrogated, coupled with his pursuit for ecumenism.

On August 4, 1947, a year after the granting of full independence of the Philippines from the United States, the IFI General Assembly under Isabelo Jr. petitioned the House of Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, one of the member churches of the Anglican Communion, to bestow the IFI with valid apostolic succession. Although a significant number of native Filipino Roman Catholic priests have joined the IFI during its inception, however, there were no bishops who joined the movement since the Roman Catholic Church had consecrated no native Filipino bishops before and by the time the IFI broke away, therefore the church lost the historic episcopate of apostolic succession. The Roman Catholic Church started consecrating Filipinos in 1906, correspondingly as enticement for the rest of the Filipino clergy not to affiliate with the movement. Before his death, first supreme bishop Gregorio Aglipay had previously sought bestowal of apostolic succession from other denominations abroad for years, but failed due to his Unitarian theological beliefs and past revolutionary activities. Historically, IFI Bishops prior to the bestowal of apostolic succession were generally addressed and referenced only as &quot;Monsignors&quot; and their &quot;bishop&quot; consecration and designation only served as a title or position as high-ranking clergy whose roles were to head certain dioceses.
On August 5, 1947, the IFI Church officially adopted both a new Constitution and Canons and Declaration of Faith and Articles of Religion that were Trinitarian. According to the latter document, &quot;the Doctrine and Constitutional Rules of the Philippine Independent Church, adopted on October 28, 1903, and subsequently amended, and the Fundamental Epistles of the Philippine Independent Church, are henceforth not to be held as binding either upon the clergy or laity of the church in matters of doctrine, discipline or order, wherein they differ in substance contained from the new Declaration of Faith or the Articles of Religion. They are, however, to be valued as historical documents promulgated by the founders of the church when they were seeking to interpret the Catholic faith in a manner understood by the people. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the church has sought to eradicate such errors of judgement and doctrine as crept into its life and official documents in times past&quot;.

The House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America then granted the IFI petition during their meeting in November 1947. On April 7, 1948, at the Episcopal Pro-Cathedral of Saint Luke in Manila, the Trinitarian IFI had its bishops, namely: de los Reyes Jr., Manuel Aguilar, and Gerardo Bayaca (third supreme bishop), reconsecrated and bestowed upon the historic apostolic succession from the Anglican line by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America led by then Missionary Bishop Norman S. Binsted, acting for the Presiding Bishop, and assisted by fellow Episcopal Church bishops Robert F. Wilner and Harry S. Kennedy. Former President Emilio Aguinaldo acted as a sponsor for the three IFI bishops. The Trinitarian IFI then sued the Unitarian faction for sole rights to the name and property of the original IFI.
After prolonged litigation, in 1955, the more dominant Trinitarian faction was finally awarded by the Supreme Court the right to the name and possessions of the original IFI. The IFI then entered into full communion with the entire Anglican Communion in 1961 through the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. The Episcopal Church assisted in coming up with the IFI liturgical books with a Filipino missal. The missal shows a marked Anglican influence while retaining the form of the Catholic Mass. Consequently, the IFI officially published &quot;The Filipino Missal&quot; and &quot;The Filipino Ritual&quot; in 1961, replacing the &quot;Oficio Divino&quot; which was first published in 1906. The church later signed a of full communion with the Church of England in October 1963, the Scottish Episcopal Church in December 1963, and the Old Catholic Union of Utrecht in 1965. Fonacier and Jamias&#x27;s group, on the other hand, remained Unitarian, and eventually became known as the &quot;Independent Church of Filipino Christians&quot; (ICFC) which would later become a member of the International Association for Religious Freedom (IARF). However, they would soon fragment into other minor groups.

In the late 1960s, the church youth sector had begun criticizing the complacency of church leaders especially about making a clear stand regarding the semi-feudal and semi-colonial conditions of the Philippine society. As a result, Supreme Bishop de los Reyes Jr. recognized the youth&#x27;s clamor to reclaim the church&#x27;s nationalist heritage by allowing the organization of the first ever National Youth Assembly in 1969, marking the beginning of youth activism and reawakening of revolutionary nationalism, while still asserting their role to promote ecumenism.
On October 10, 1971, the 33rd death anniversary of Isabelo de los Reyes Sr., his son and then-supreme bishop Isabelo Jr. died of a heart attack, aged 71, while officiating a mass in the María Clara Christ Church in Santa Cruz, Manila. He was buried at the María Clara Christ Church on October 17 after having lain in state for one full week at the Iglesia Filipina Independiente National Cathedral which he had built in Taft Avenue, Manila. De los Reyes was succeeded in office by the church&#x27;s then-general secretary, Macario V. Ga.

In 1973, the first reunification attempt between the IFI and ICFC was initiated during the administrations of Macario V. Ga (IFI&#x27;s fifth supreme bishop) and Vicente K. Pasetes (ICFC&#x27;s supreme bishop at that time). Although Santiago Fonacier, who served as ICFC consultant and bishop emeritus already at the time, was not physically part of the whole negotiation due to old age, he was represented by his son Anos J. Fonacier, a lawyer and entrepreneur. The said reunification attempt failed when the majority of the ICFC clergy, including Fonacier&#x27;s legal counsel and son-in-law Rizalino R. Pablo, did not conform to the agreement of reconciliation due to their firm adherence to their Unitarian beliefs. In 1974, Pasetes finally reconciled with the IFI and brought with him four other ICFC bishops and a fair number of priests to the IFI fold which culminated in a memorandum of agreement that was signed between IFI&#x27;s Ga and Pasetes himself. However, a segment of ICFC clergy refused to recognize the agreement. With the return of Pasetes to IFI, the remaining ICFC clergy elected a new ICFC supreme bishop in 1975.

In October 1977, the IFI Church adopted a new set of Constitution and Canons, as approved by the General Assembly held in May of the same year, wherein the supreme bishop shall only be elected for a term of six years without immediate re-election starting in 1981. Then in 1981, a faction of the church called the &quot;Iglesia Catolica Filipina Independiente&quot; or the &quot;Philippine Independent Catholic Church&quot; (ICFI/PICC) was formed — led by then-supreme bishop Macario V. Ga (who was on his 9th year in office) and priest Armando L. de la Cruz, whose faction claimed to have maintained the &quot;original catholic ethos and doctrine of the original nationalist independent church&quot;.

Ga was a known staunch supporter of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos which caused tension to a number of bishops and laity who were critical of Marcos and his dictatorship, thus marking the rekindling of the aforementioned clergymen&#x27;s revolutionary nationalist roots. The opposing faction of clergy and laity rallied the election of Abdias R. de la Cruz, then the Bishop of Aklan and Capiz and concurrent general secretary, as the new supreme bishop in the 1981 General Assembly. Ga, refusing to step down, then filed a petition at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an attempt to nullify the election of de la Cruz. Ga also questioned the authenticity of the adopted 1977 Constitution and Canons, albeit a few years past from its approval. However, even after a motion for reconsideration, both the SEC and the Court of Appeals executed the decision in favor of de la Cruz and the 1977 Constitution and Canons in 1985 and 1987, respectively.

Ga&#x27;s faction subsequently got their name registered separately in the SEC. The IFI later responded by asking the Court to prevent the faction from using the name &quot;Iglesia Catolica Filipina Independiente&quot;, an exact same name in one of the former&#x27;s SEC-registered legally recognized alternative names. The SEC reviewed and later revoked the certificate of incorporation of the ICFI and ordered to change its name to avoid confusion with the IFI and all of its dioceses, who had registered the &quot;Iglesia Catolica Filipina Independiente&quot; name first, years before Ga&#x27;s faction, therefore deemed the rightful owner of the name.

The ICFI/PICC appealed and the case reached the Supreme Court. However, because of technicalities, the latter ruled to close and terminate the case. Eventually, in a compromise agreement to avoid further conflict with the IFI, the ICFI/PICC and its chapters/dioceses registered once again in the SEC in a different name in 2014, albeit only with a slight modification and variation from the previous one; as well as with their Visayas archdiocese correspondingly changing their diocesan name in the SEC to &quot;&quot;Eastern Visayas Independent Catholic Church&quot; (EVICC), headed by their metropolitan archbishop Valiant O. Dayagbil, a former IFI priest himself. Ultimately later, in 2019, the entire group has since been formally known as the &quot;International Conference of Philippine Independent Catholic Churches of Jesus Christ&quot;&quot;, which has been in concordat with the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), a non-member province of the Anglican Communion, since 2020.

In the latter half of the 1990s, Ga voluntarily reconciled with the IFI, which led to the signing of a memorandum of agreement that paved the way for the mass return of a fair number of congregation and clergy in the Ilocos Norte and Cotabato areas. However, Armando de la Cruz, who was already the ICFI/PICC&#x27;s duly elected supreme metropolitan archbishop, was adamant on the reunification. Unlike the IFI wherein the Supreme Bishop is only allowed to have a non-consecutive six-year term, Armando de la Cruz of the ICFI/PICC has a lifetime term as supreme metropolitan archbishop. Ga&#x27;s return to the IFI resulted in another breakaway group from the ICFI/PICC that was established in 1995 under the name &quot;Aglipayan Christian Church Inc. (Legion of Mary)&quot;, which is based in Davao City.

In 1995, the concordat of full communion between the IFI and the Church of Sweden was signed. On February 17, 1997, the IFI also signed a concordat of full communion with the then newly-autonomous Episcopal Church in the Philippines (ECP).

===Present day activities===
IFI congregations are also found throughout the Philippine diaspora in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. The World Council of Churches and the church itself recorded to have a number of roughly 6 to 7 million adherents. According to some sources, the church is the second-largest single Trinitarian Christian denomination in the Philippines, after the Roman Catholic Church (some 80.2% of the population), comprising about 6.7% of the total population of the Philippines. By contrast, the 2010, 2015, and 2020 Philippine Census recorded only 916,639; 756,225; and 1,458,992 members in the country, respectively, or about 1% of the population. Winning large numbers of adherents in its early years because of its nationalist roots, Aglipayan numbers gradually dwindled through the years due to factionalism and doctrinal disagreements. At present, there are at least 30 splinter groups and more — who broke away from and not in communion with the IFI (mainstream Aglipayan) — still bearing and carrying the &quot;Aglipayan&quot; name and tradition.

Unlike the Roman Catholic Church and several other Christian denominations, the church does not discourage its members from joining Freemasonry. Some of the members of the church, like the founders de los Reyes and Aglipay, are political activists, often involved in progressive groups and advocating nationalism, anti-imperialism, social justice, democracy, labor rights, as well as opposing extrajudicial killings. They have often been victims of enforced disappearances and been branded as leftists by the government for being aligned with progressive groups, specifically after Alberto Ramento, the ninth supreme bishop, was killed in 2006 for being an anti-government critic.

The church then created the &quot;&quot;Ramento Project for Rights Defenders&quot; (RPRD), the IFI&#x27;s human rights advocacy and service arm for South–Central Luzon, in Ramento&#x27;s honor. The church also has another development institution called the &quot;Visayas-Mindanao Regional Office for Development&quot;&quot; (VIMROD). As per the 1947 Declaration of Faith and Articles of Religion (DFAR), the church itself claims to be &quot;not an ally with any particular school of political thought or with any political party, asserting that its members are politically free&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the rule on the separation of church and state in the Philippines does not necessarily mean that the IFI Church is prohibited in human rights advocacies. The church has also managed to build schools from pre-school to college, notably the Episcopal–IFI jointly funded Trinity University of Asia, and cemeteries in some areas of the country managed by its respective dioceses.

While people outside the IFI Church collectively refer to the members as &quot;&quot;Aglipayans&quot;, members of the church themselves recently prefer to collectively refer to themselves as &quot;Filipinistas&quot;, &quot;Pilipinhons&quot;, &quot;IFIans&quot;, and &quot;Independientes&quot;&quot;. They would sometimes brand themselves as the &quot;Native Filipino Catholic Church&quot; to distinguish themselves from adherents of the Roman Catholic Church. The members prefer to refer every August 3 of the year as their &quot;proclamation anniversary&quot; of independence from Rome rather than founding anniversary as they claim to continue adhering to the concept of catholicity, indicating continuity of faith and practice from Early Christianity, despite separating from the authority of the See of Rome. They also refer to Isabelo de los Reyes as &quot;proclaimer&quot; and Gregorio Aglipay as the &quot;first supreme bishop&quot;, rather than founders.

==Doctrine and practice==

===Worship and liturgy===
The main Sunday liturgy is the Eucharist or the Holy Mass, which is spoken and celebrated in the vernacular. The Eucharistic liturgy of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente resembles that of the Roman Missal, with elements taken from the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, such as the Collect for Purity, the positioning of the Sign of Peace before the Offertory, the Eucharistic Prayers, and the Prayer of Humble Access. Just like the Roman Catholic Church, the IFI Church does the sign of the cross in left to right motion. The church professes both the Apostles&#x27; Creed and Nicene Creed, but uses the latter most of the time. The church also believes and administers the seven sacraments. The IFI Church declares that the Four Marks of the Church (&quot;one, holy, catholic, and apostolic&quot;) is present within their church, thus claiming to be an independent jurisdiction of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. Orders of service and ceremonies are contained in &quot;The Filipino Ritual&quot; and &quot;The Filipino Missal&quot;. Although not officially accepted by the church&#x27;s biblical canon, the seven deuterocanonical books are regarded by the IFI as &quot;worthy of veneration and source of wisdom&quot;. The church does not adhere to &quot;sola scriptura&quot;. The church generally affirms the authority of both Scripture and Tradition and believes that faith and reason are equal. Clergy celebrants are assisted by young male and female altar servers (locally referred as &quot;sacristan&quot;) and acolytes. The church does not have a prescribed dress code for mass attendees but encourages everyone to dress appropriately. The church also does not hold a moral prohibition on clergy members wearing piercings and tattoos. The church follows the yearly IFI Liturgical Ordo Calendar wherein the liturgical seasons, observances, and traditions closely resemble to that of the Roman Catholic Church.

Aglipayans strongly adhere in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and communion is distributed under both kinds through intinction. However, they are non-committal in belief regarding transubstantiation, consubstantiation, and sacramental union. Aglipayans maintain that the belief in the real presence does not imply a claim to know how Jesus Christ is present in the Eucharistic species (the consecrated bread and wine) and is left to mystery. Moreover, belief in the real presence does not imply belief that the consecrated Eucharistic species cease to be bread and wine. Church members are also taught that the Eucharistic species do not necessarily change into the actual body and blood of Christ only during consecration but Christ&#x27;s body and blood become really present and are really given in the entire Eucharistic liturgy. Furthermore, Aglipayans believe that one receives the body and blood of Christ by faith, asserting instead that Christ is present in the Eucharist in a &quot;heavenly and spiritual manner&quot;. Nonetheless, Aglipayans have never formally questioned the theological doctrine of transubstantiation, consubstantiation, and sacramental union.

The IFI Church incorporates a strong nationalist element. Being a nationalist church, Aglipayans employ Filipino national symbols in their liturgical practices, such as the use of national colors and motifs, the singing of the national anthem, and the displaying of the national flag in the sanctuary since 1907. During the American occupation, the Flag Law of 1907 or Act No.1696 — an act to prohibit the display of flags, banners, emblems, or devices used in the Philippine islands for the purpose of rebellion or insurrection against the authorities of the United States and the display of Katipunan flags, banners, emblems, or devices and for other purposes — was passed on September 6, 1907, by the Philippine Commission. At the time, the United States flag used to be the official flag of the Philippines until October 1919 when the law was repealed by the Philippine Legislature. By the time that the Flag Act was enacted, as an act of protest, the IFI clergy led by Gregorio Aglipay designed their clerical vestments with images and colors of the Philippine Flag and used it during their mass celebrations. Subsequently, the clerical vestment designs inspired by the Philippine Flag colors and symbols are still practiced up to this day by the IFI in honor to its nationalist and revolutionary heritage. At present, since the implementation of the Republic Act No. 8491 or the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines in 1998, there has been no recorded or documented reports of violations made by the IFI in the Section 34 of the aforementioned law.

Although not widely known, Aglipayans are also adherents to praying the rosary, but do not celebrate October as the Month of the Rosary. October is instead celebrated by the church as the Month of the Laity. Aglipayans also practice house church. The church does not hold as dogmas the Immaculate Conception (the church rather celebrates its feast simply as the &quot;Feast Day of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;), the Assumption (August 15 is instead celebrated as the Feast Day of the Solemnity of the Blessed Virgin Mary), or the Perpetual virginity of Mary (maintaining that Jesus had siblings from Mary and Joseph); but these may be believed by the faithfuls privately. The IFI practices infant baptism. The IFI&#x27;s tradition of celebration surrounding First Communion varies from the Roman Catholic Church. Whereas the Roman Catholic Church hold a special ceremony when the child receives their first communion, the IFI commonly allows infant first communion in a regular mass depending on the parents&#x27; discretion and the infant&#x27;s physiological tolerance coupled with introductory/early basic catechism from the parents or the Church before receiving such. Nevertheless, the Church is also tolerant when one conventionally receives their first communion at the age of 7 or 8, which is generally considered the age of reason, preferably after a session/s of necessary &quot;religious instructions&quot; or catechism. All communicants are required to have undergone baptism administered through the Trinitarian formula first and be regular church goers before receiving their first communion. The Sacrament of Confirmation on the other hand can only be administered by bishops to baptized individuals starting from the age of 12 which is considered the &quot;age of Christian maturity&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the IFI also administers the Sacrament of Penance, although auricular confession is rarely practiced since not all priests can administer it – only those who are authorized by their bishops the faculties to hear confession. Albeit not required, Aglipayans, at their discretion, may confess their sins individually only through an authorized priest at the altar rail, in a reconciliation room within the church, or in sight of others waiting in the row for the same purpose (but at some distance to not break the seal of confession), instead of a confessional box. By practice, Aglipayans usually join general/public confession &quot;directly to God&quot; during the Eucharist or Holy Mass. Aglipayans also repudiate the traditional concept of purgatory. The purgatory as a physical place that the IFI believes in is on Earth. The IFI also has their own process of exorcism, but is not considered a sacrament and has no specific prescribed formula, nor an &quot;office of exorcist&quot;. Unlike the Roman Catholic Church, wherein a priest has to undergo specialized training and authority, all ordained IFI priests with &quot;strong spiritual discernment&quot; can perform exorcism, as long as they consulted their respective diocesan bishops and after a careful medical examination to exclude the possibility of mental illness, and should only be done as a . Although not mandatorily coercive, the church also highly encourages its members to practice tithing as the minimum standard form of &quot;Christian &quot;giving back&quot;&quot;. The church does not prescribe a standard amount during the collection of alms (offerings) in the Holy Mass.

The IFI Church places a strong emphasis on the participation of the laity in worship, liturgy, and policy-making. Laypeople are often involved in leading prayers, reading scripture, and serving as Eucharistic ministers.

The Iglesia Filipina Independiente views their history of liberation from the Roman Catholic Church during the colonial era in the Philippines as comparable to that of the story of Exodus which can be found in the religious book of the same name in the Bible.

===Apostolic succession===
The Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI) rejects the exclusive right to valid apostolic succession by the Petrine Papacy. The IFI believes that apostolic succession emphasizes the collective authority of all the apostles, not just Peter. Therefore, the IFI strongly suggests that the succession of authority in the Early Church did not derive solely from Peter but from all the apostles.

Bishops of the IFI derive their unbroken line of apostolic succession from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (TEC) of the Anglican line, which was first bestowed upon them on April 7, 1948. The Anglican line traces its succession from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Moreover, the Old Catholic Churches recognizes the validity of Anglican orders through the 1931 Bonn Agreement wherein a full communion was established between the Old Catholic Churches and to all churches of the Anglican Communion to which TEC is a member of. Additionally, some Eastern Orthodox churches also affirms the validity of Anglican orders.

The Old Catholic Church subsequently began co-consecrating bishops of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente after a full communion was established between the two churches on their own right on September 21, 1965, therefore, the IFI also traces their succession from the Old Catholic lineage. According to the principle of &quot;ex opere operato&quot;, certain ordinations of and by Old Catholic bishops are still recognised as being valid and has never been formally questioned by the Holy See.

===Priesthood and ministry===
The Iglesia Filipina Independiente maintains the historic threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons. The aforementioned three orders of ministers have distinct vestments from one another. Their vestment varies according to the liturgy being celebrated.

Clerical celibacy is optional. It allows its priests to marry, rejecting mandatory clerical celibacy while committing to marital chastity. Priests may also remain unmarried.

Priests are also sometimes referred to as &quot;presbyters&quot;. An aspiring priest is required to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Theology from one of the church&#x27;s officially organized seminaries.

The Iglesia Filipina Independiente has two classification of deacons — the Transitional Deacon (one who is waiting to be ordained for priesthood), and the Permanent (Perpetual) or Vocational Deacon (one who has specialized ministry and not necessarily be ordained to priesthood).

Priests and deacons (except for Permanent/Vocational Deacons) are not allowed to accept salaries from employment or appointment in an office outside the church without the written permission of their diocesan bishops. Bishops as well are not allowed to do such endeavors without the written permission of the Executive Commission. Spouses of the aforementioned clergy are not subject to such policy and are given liberty to earn income on their own. The vow of poverty is not stated in the Constitution and Canons, although priests are strictly mandated to always put their ministry on top priority wherein it should not be compromised when permitted to have an occupation outside the church.

Albeit controversial, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente also allows the ordination of women. In February 1997, Rosalina V. Rabaria of the Diocese of Aklan and Capiz became the first woman to be officially ordained priest in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente. On May 5, 2019, Emelyn Dacuycuy of the Diocese of Batac became the first woman to be consecrated bishop in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, further asserting their belief in women&#x27;s inclusion and breaking the tradition of patriarchy in the clergy. The date and venue of Dacuycuy&#x27;s consecration coincided with Gregorio Aglipay&#x27;s date and place of birth. The church as a whole also refers to itself using female pronouns.

Unlike the Roman Catholic Church and most Anglican churches, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente currently does not have nuns or religious sisters. Some members of the Women of the Philippine Independent Church (WOPIC) in certain dioceses wear veils and religious habits similar to that of the religious sisters, during mass, as a &quot;sign of reverence&quot;. During Lenten season, a group of WOPIC members in certain dioceses called &quot;nobisyas&quot; (literally translated to novice in English) render 40-day church services as their &quot;pamamanata&quot; (act of penance) and wear veil as &quot;an honorable way to imitate Mary, mother of Jesus&quot;, same thing with the seven women &quot;&quot;. The IFI used to have nuns when the Episcopal Sisters of St. Anne in Mindanao and the Episcopal Sisters of Mary the Virgin in Luzon accepted IFI women into their religious orders for sisterhood training in the 1960s. The IFI sisters later established their own order: the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus in the 1970s, having their base at the Episcopalian St. Andrew&#x27;s Theological Seminary, and unlike its priests wherein clerical celibacy is optional, the IFI nuns adhere to the vow of chastity in celibacy; as well as the other traditional vows of poverty and obedience. However, due to insufficient institutional patronage, the congregation eventually disbanded, with some of them joining back to the Episcopalian sisters in Luzon.

The Iglesia Filipina Independiente has priests who are military chaplains of the Philippine Army Chaplain Service, and has also launched a ministry for seafarers and their families, the Mission to Seafarers PH.

A clergy member cannot be in political office or be involved in political election while continuing ministry as ordained. The clergy member must seek the approval of his/her bishop at least two months before the filing of candidacy. A clergy member upon applying his/her certificate of candidacy is considered resigned. An ordained who had joined an electoral contest, being an official candidate and lost, may be admitted again to the ministry and apply for a reinstatement to the Supreme Council of Bishops (subject for approval) as long as he/she completes a one-year refresher course in one of the IFI&#x27;s seminaries. On the other hand, an ordained who won an election may also be admitted again to the ministry and apply for a reinstatement to the Supreme Council of Bishops, after he/she officially ends his/her political tenure and must not concurrently hold a government position, as long as he/she also completes a one-year refresher course.

A male priest of the regular clergy is commonly addressed with the honorific title &quot;The Reverend Father&quot; (contracted to The Rev./Rev&#x27;d. Fr.) while a woman priest is addressed simply with &quot;The Reverend&quot; (contracted to &quot;Rev&quot; or &quot;Reb&quot; or &quot;Padi&quot; in spoken and reference style). Deacons, regardless of sex and gender, are addressed as &quot;The Reverend Deacon&quot; (contracted to The Rev./Rev&#x27;d. Dcn.).

Minor orders in the church include subdeacons and acolytes. Furthermore, the church has non-ordained commissioned lectors (commentators), and lay readers/lay ministers/or lay preachers in every diocese.

===Saints===
In the most general sense, all of the church&#x27;s faithful deceased in &quot;Heaven&quot; are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation.

Just like the Roman Catholic Church, IFI members are Marian devotees and devotees of saints, especially Biblical (New Testament) saints and Catholic saints. Although the IFI Church do not officially claim to be a &quot;Marian-centric church&quot;, Mary, mother of Jesus is honored by the Church to be the most prominent among the saints being the &quot;theotokos&quot;. Nevertheless, several Catholic saints canonized by Rome after the 1902 schism are not recognized by the Church and its members. Meanwhile, Popes (or Bishops of Rome) universally canonized as saints before the 1902 schism are widely acknowledged by the IFI Church. The IFI Church also celebrates All Saints&#x27; Day and All Souls&#x27; Day every November 1 and 2, respectively. While veneration of saints is formally practiced, deification of saints on the other hand is condemned by the Church as blasphemy.

In the liturgical calendar of the IFI, the Monday after All Saints&#x27; Day is designated as &quot;Commemoration Day for the Martyrs and Confessors of the IFI&quot;.

During the early days of the schism particularly in September 1903, the church, led by Aglipay together with a number of bishops, canonized José Rizal and the Gomburza priests in a closed-door conference. However, the church has since revoked their sainthood in the 1950s and already ceased to recognize them as saints up to this day since it was &quot;done during the nationalistic phase of the church&quot;, although they still recognize them as foremost national heroes and early IFI martyrs.

===Contraception===
Aglipayan bishops joined public demonstrations in support of the &quot;Reproductive Health Bill&quot;, a legislation advocating for contraception and sex education to reduce the rate of abortion and control rapid population growth that the Roman Catholic Church and several other Christian denominations objected to on moral grounds.

===Stance on abortion===
Although supportive of the &quot;Reproductive Health Bill&quot;, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente strongly opposes non-&quot;medically necessary&quot; induced abortion.

===LGBTQ rights===

In 2017, the church&#x27;s position on the LGBTQ+ community changed to an extent wherein the church leadership acknowledged, apologized, and released a statement in which it states, among other things, that the IFI has, for many times, &quot;shown indifference, and have made the LGBTQ+ people feel less human, discriminated against, and stigmatized.&quot; The statement – dubbed &quot;Our Common Humanity, Our Shared Dignity&quot; – stresses the church&#x27;s position that it &quot;must openly embrace God&#x27;s people of all sexes, sexual orientations, gender identities, and expressions (SSOGIE).&quot; Moreover, although the church is still opposed to the holy matrimony of same-sex couples, the statement stresses that the IFI is &quot;offering their Church as a community where LGBTIQ+ people can freely and responsibly express themselves, pronouncing God&#x27;s all-inclusive love.&quot;

This apology statement&#x27;s groundwork first came up in 2014, when a gay member articulated during the church plenary his query about the church&#x27;s plans for sexual minorities. This led to discussions among the newly-elected set of national youth officers, led by an openly gay president and a lesbian executive vice-president, which would later be succeeded by another openly gay president. The church&#x27;s position on LGBTQ+ persons was approved by the Supreme Council of Bishops and officially adopted by the entire church in February 2017. The church has now fully committed to accepting LGBTQ+ people as part of their congregation, and their ministry.

On February 24, 2023, the church ordained Wylard &quot;Wowa&quot; Ledama, a trans woman and registered nurse-turned-seminarian, to the diaconate as the church&#x27;s and country&#x27;s first ordained trans clergy. She was assigned at the National Cathedral. This move by the church was met with mixed reactions from other denominations.

===Views on divorce===
Although no official statement yet from the Church as a whole, a number of church officials, especially those from Mindanao, expressed openness to the passage of the &quot;Divorce Bill&quot; in the Philippines. However, they clarified that it should not be misconstrued as a disregard to the &quot;sanctity of marriage&quot;, but as a matter of practicality. They further stated that while they believe that couples are duty-bound to keep their marriage vows, divorce may be used as a , when psychological and incompatibility problems make it difficult for both partners to live together.

According to the officials, the IFI&#x27;s stance on the controversial subject stems from its teachings that emphasize the &quot;people&#x27;s rights for freedom, dignity, and integrity, which also means encouraging the society to be responsive to the realities of time and to recognize that there have been unions that were wrong&quot;. They further clarified that the church will still &quot;guide&quot; couples on not resorting to divorce, if possible.

===Response to red-tagging===
Several church officials are advocates against the culture of impunity and as a result, a number of advocates have been recipients of accusations by government personnel tagging them as alleged enablers and sympathizers of insurgents and terrorists (&quot;red-tagging&quot;). The church released a statement strongly condemning such allegations. A number of church officials also urged Congress to probe the red-tagging incidents and conduct an impartial investigation.

==Organization==

The &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot; is an episcopally-led, synodically-governed church. The General Assembly is the highest policy-making body while the Executive Commission is the highest policy-making body in the absence of the General Assembly. The church leadership is autocephalous and is led by the Supreme Bishop, similar to a presiding bishop in other denominations. The Supreme Bishop heads the Executive Commission. The 14th and current Supreme Bishop is Joel Porlares, who was elected on May 9, 2023.

The church has three predominant clergy and laity councils: the Supreme Council of Bishops (SCB), the Council of Priests (COP), and the National Lay Council (NCL).

There are three mandated major sectoral organizations of the laity (lay organizations) in the church under the National Lay Council: the Youth of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (YIFI), the Women of the Philippine Independent Church (WOPIC), and the Laymen of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (LIFI).

Meanwhile, the priests also have their own sectoral organization: the National Priests Organization (NPO). Other sectoral organizations in the church include, the Clergy Spouses Organization (CSO), and the nonsanctioned Clergy Children Organization (CCO). Just like the Roman Catholic Church, the IFI also have pious associations.

The Philippine Independent Church is primarily organized into dioceses which are considered as the &quot;local churches&quot;. In every diocese, there is a cathedral containing the &quot;cathedra&quot; of a bishop. A diocese is composed of parishes and missions. A parish and mission may have outstations. Parishes and missions in every diocese are geographically grouped into vicariates.
The official flag of the church is a horizontal bicolor flag with equal bands of royal blue and crimson red, with the initials IFI in color white text inscribed at the center. The red color of the flag shall be at the right side, while the color blue shall be on the left side, thus, when the flag is hoist in a pole, the red color shall be in the upper part, which symbolizes its revolutionary heritage and paying homage to its historical revolutionary nationalist roots, hence debunking claims and accusations of inciting insurgency.

===Names===
 is the official and full legal name of the Philippine Independent Church, while the latter is its English translation as specified in the church&#x27;s Constitution and Canons. The early members used Spanish for the church&#x27;s official name since Spanish was the sole official language of the Philippines throughout its more than three centuries of Spanish rule, from the late 16th century to 1898, and then a co-official language (with English) under its American rule.

Aside from the previously disputed &quot;Iglesia Catolica Filipina Independiente&quot;, or Philippine Independent Catholic Church in its English translation, other legally recognized names in which the denomination may alternatively be known are: &quot;Iglesia Catolica Apostolica Filipina Independiente&quot; or Philippine Independent Catholic Apostolic Church, &quot;Iglesia Aglipayana&quot; or Aglipayan Church, &quot;Iglesia Catolica Aglipayana&quot; or Aglipayan Catholic Church, and &quot;Iglesia Independiente Aglipayana&quot; or Aglipayan Independent Church.
All aforementioned names are duly registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission with SEC Registration No. PW-611, as a religious corporation sole, originally incorporated in 1904 at the Department of Commerce during the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands period and got registered at the SEC in 1936, which was the same year when the SEC was created. The names , Philippine Independent Church, and Aglipayan Church are much more commonly used.

== Notable churches ==

Owing to its roots in the Roman Catholic tradition, the structure of the church buildings, as well as the outstation chapels, of the Philippine Independent Church do not differ significantly from Roman Catholic church buildings in the Philippines.

=== Cathedral of the Holy Child (National Cathedral) ===
Located along Taft Avenue, the Cathedral of the Holy Child in Ermita, Manila, is the National Cathedral of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente and the seat of the supreme bishop. Designed by architect Carlos Arguelles, construction of the church began in 1964 and was inaugurated on May 8, 1969, to commemorate the 109th birth anniversary of its first supreme bishop, Gregorio Aglipay. The church is made largely of bare concrete and wood and has been noted for having a suspended block with sloping trapezoidal walls and textured with horizontal grooves all throughout, suspended with a triangular block.

=== María Clara Parish Church ===

Named after the main heroine in Rizal&#x27;s , the María Clara Parish Church (formerly the María Clara Christ Church) in Santa Cruz, Manila, was originally built as a wooden structure in 1923 before it was expanded and rebuilt as a concrete structure in the 1950s. When the original national cathedral of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente in Tondo was destroyed during World War II, the María Clara Parish Church became the temporary office of the supreme bishop before relocating in 1969 to the present-day Cathedral of the Holy Child. The original statue of the Virgin of Balintawak is housed in the María Clara Parish Church. While the administration of the parish is under the Diocese of Greater Manila Area, the physical property and church building itself is owned by the de los Reyes family. The current resident and parish bishop of the church is semi-retired bishop Gregorio de los Reyes, son of Isabelo Jr. and grandson of Isabelo Sr.

==Seminaries==

The Aglipay Central Theological Seminary (ACTS) in Urdaneta City, Pangasinan is the regional seminary of the church serving the North-Central and South-Central Luzon Dioceses. ACTS offers Bachelor of Theology and Divinity programs for members who aspire to enter the ordained ministry. These are four-year study programs with curriculum focusing on biblical, theological, historical, and pastoral studies, with reference to parish management and development, and cultural and social context.

The St. Paul&#x27;s Theological Seminary (SPTS) in Jordan, Guimaras is the regional seminary of the Church serving the Visayas and Mindanao Dioceses.
The St. Andrew&#x27;s Theological Seminary (SATS) in Quezon City is run by the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, serving both its church and the Iglesia Filipina Independiente.

Another seminary is planned to be established at Cabadbaran City in Mindanao.

==Relationship with other Christian denominations==
===Churches in communion===

The church enjoys full communion with the Protestant Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States since September 22, 1961.

Other churches the IFI is in full communion with include (mostly members of the Anglican Communion): the Church of England, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Union of Utrecht, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, the Church in the Province of the West Indies, the Church of the Province of Central Africa, the Church of the Province of West Africa, the Anglican Church of Kenya, the Anglican Church of Tanzania, the Church of North India, the Church of South India, the Church of Pakistan, the Church of the Province of Myanmar, the Church of Ceylon (&quot;extra-provincial&quot;), the &quot;Nippon Sei Ko Kai&quot;, the Church of Ireland, the Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church (&quot;extra-provincial&quot;), the Anglican Church of Canada, the Church of Uganda, the Anglican Church of Rwanda, the Anglican Church of Burundi, the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church (&quot;extra-provincial&quot;), the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, the Old Catholic Church of Austria, the Old Catholic Church of the Czech Republic, the Old Catholic Church of Germany, the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, the Polish National Catholic Church of America, the Old Catholic Church of Croatia, the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, and the Church of Sweden.

===Current ecumenical relations with the Roman Catholic Church===
The Iglesia Filipina Independiente has been in an ongoing interreligious dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church since the latter part of the 20th century and their &quot;joint statements&quot; were eventually made official in 2021.

On August 3, 2021, during the IFI&#x27;s 119th Proclamation Anniversary and as part of celebrating 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines, Roman Catholic Church leaders from the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) signed two documents with the IFI &quot;for more ecumenical cooperation amidst .&quot; Although the IFI still remains to be independent from the Holy See, in the first joint statement, both IFI and Roman Catholic Church leaders &quot;ask and pray for mutual forgiveness for any injuries inflicted in the past&quot; and &quot;strive for the healing and purification of memories among its members&quot;. In addition, the first statement also notes that the IFI as well, &quot;strives to reach out for healing and reconciliation with other separated Churches founded in the Aglipayan tradition&quot;.
The second joint statement, on the other hand, is an expression of mutual recognition by both churches, emphasizing the &quot;mutual recognition of baptisms&quot; between the IFI and the Roman Catholic Church. The Trinitarian baptismal formula of the IFI has already been recognized by the Roman Catholic Church in its list of validly administered baptisms by other Christian churches. For years, IFI officials had been seeking the recognition of their baptismal rites by the Roman Catholic Church, notably the blessing of Pope Francis during his state visit to the Philippines in 2015, in order to ease inter-denominational marriages, so that Aglipayans will not be obliged anymore to be baptized as Roman Catholics before they could marry Roman Catholics.

Then-IFI Supreme Bishop Rhee Timbang gave a copy of the IFI&#x27;s liturgical book and directory to CBCP Secretary-General Msgr. Bernardo Pantin during the liturgical launching of the two documents at the IFI National Cathedral.

Further, the IFI accepts baptized individuals from the Roman Catholic Church who wanted to join their church without the requirement of performing another baptism from their end. They are being accepted through the IFI Rite of Reception officiated by the bishop or in his/her absence, by the priest or deacon, after a necessary catechism course to be taken.

===Other ecumenical relations===
The IFI is a member of inter-church associations such as the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP), Christian Conference of Asia (CCA), Council of Churches of East Asia (CCEA), United Society Partners in the Gospel (USPG), and the World Council of Churches (WCC). The church maintains ecumenical ties with other denominations who are also conciliar members of the aforementioned organizations, such as the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) which is an IFI covenant church partner (&quot;partnership covenant&quot;).

<text>Weetabix Limited, trading as Weetabix Food Company, is a food processing company that is responsible for the production of breakfast cereal brands, including Weetabix, Alpen, Crunchy Bran and Ready Brek. The company also produces Puffins cereal and Snackimals snacks through their Barbara&#x27;s Bakery division.

==History==
:&quot;See History of Weet-Bix&quot;

The food product was originally invented in Australia in the 1920s by Bennison Osborne. Osborne and his friend Malcolm MacFarlane successfully launched Weet-Biscs in Australia and New Zealand under the sponsorship of the owner of Grain Products Ltd., who soon sold the Australasian rights to the Australasian Conference Association Limited Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company.

Osborne and MacFarlane decided to expand into South Africa and while there, they began the establishment of the British &amp; African Cereal Company, Ltd., a Private Company, to start a venture in England under the Companies Act 1929 (Company No. 267687), where they became joint managing directors until MacFarlane left the Company in 1932/1933, after which Osborne became the sole managing director until 1936, when he left the Company for the United States. The first Directors of the company were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm MacFarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton. Frank George, who had offered them the use of a disused flour mill in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, subsequently requested and was granted shares in the company and was offered a place on the Board.

The company held a royal warrant from Queen Elizabeth II. In January 2025, a new Royal Warrant was appointed by King Charles III.

For the purpose of differentiating between the various countries, it was decided that the product, when introduced into the United Kingdom, should be known as &quot;Weetabix&quot;. On 13 August 1936, with the approval of the Board of Trade, the Company name was changed to &quot;Weetabix Limited&quot;.

Alpen was invented in 1971, when a company executive was on holiday in Switzerland and tasted a local delicacy.

In November 2003, the company was bought from Weetabix Limited, by the American private equity firm HM Capital of Dallas. From 29 January 2004, it was owned by Lion Capital LLP, until 3 May 2012 when the Chinese company Bright Food bought a 60% controlling stake, valuing the company at £1.2bn ($1.9bn).

In 2012 the company was bought by the Chinese Government through the state-run Bright Food, and the equity firm Baring Private Equity Asia, with Bright Food having the controlling interest.

In July 2017, the American company Post Holdings bought the company for £1.4 billion.

The company does not have the rights to the product in Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. In these countries, the brand is still known as Weet-Bix and is still made by Sanitarium Health Food Company in Australia and New Zealand and Bokomo in South Africa.

In 2019, Weetabix was fined £140,000 by the Environment Agency for leaking thousands of litres of diesel fuel into the River Ise. The clean-up cost the company £500,000.

In 2021, Weetabix faced strike action over a decision to make workers redundant and re-employ them on lower wages, a practice known as fire-and-rehire. Workers at two of the company&#x27;s factories went on a four-day strike in November 2021 over wages and working conditions.

Several of Weetabix&#x27;s PR campaigns have attracted attention online, sparking debates about the creation of a new county called &#x27;Weetabixshire&#x27;, and the &quot;correct way to eat your bix&quot; in 2023.

In April 2023, Weetabix announced that it had achieved its goal of 100% recyclable packaging two years ahead of schedule. According to the company, the move to all paper packaging would reduce its carbon footprint by 648.4 tons per year.

In December 2023, Weetabix acquired Deeside Cereals, based in North Wales, from Wholebake.

===Awards===
It has won three Queen&#x27;s Awards for Export, lastly in 2004.

==Company structure==
The company is headquartered in Burton Latimer, Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, and its site is between two A14 junctions; with the A509 and the A6. It also has a factory in Ashton-under-Lyne. The company produces 3 billion Weetabix breakfast biscuits every year from its Kettering site.
Weetabix is also one of the major manufacturers of generic cereals for the major supermarkets.

Weetabix has factories in Europe, East Africa and North America. It is the largest producer of breakfast cereals in the UK. It exports to eighty countries. As of 2012 it employed around 2,000 people.

The company&#x27;s managing director is Sally Abbott.

== Brands ==

* Alpen
* Barbara&#x27;s Bakery: The California-based natural-foods company was purchased by Weetabix in 1986, eventually moving operations to Marlborough, Massachusetts. They are particularly well known for their Puffins Cereal line. In 2019–2020 the packaging for Barbara&#x27;s Bakery cereals was revamped, and on the new packaging all references to &quot;The Weetabix Company, Inc.&quot; have been replaced with references to &quot;Three Sisters Cereal&quot;.
* Crunchy Bran
* GrainShop: Sold primarily in the North American market, the GrainShop brand has two cereals, High Fibre Crisp and Honey Almond Crunch. High Fibre Crisp is a blend of four grains, wheat and corn, bran and oats, while Honey Almond Crunch is a combination of crunchy oats, flakes, almonds and honey.
* Oatibix: Products in the Oatibix range are made from oats, as opposed to the company&#x27;s preference to wheat-based food. The original Oatibix cereal is physically very similar to the company&#x27;s flagship Weetabix; only made of whole grain oats. Oatibix Bitesize is a variant of Oatibix with smaller biscuits and is available as Oatibix Bitesize Sultana &amp; Apple or Oatibix Bitesize Chocolate &amp; Raisin in addition to the original flavour.
* Oatibix Flakes
* Ready Brek: an oat-based breakfast cereal that is intended to be served hot, and comes in three varieties; &#x27;Original&#x27;, &#x27;Chocolate&#x27; and &#x27;Seriously Oaty&#x27;. A butterscotch flavour was marketed during the 1970s.
* Weetabix: a whole grain wheat breakfast cereal that comes in the form of palm-sized biscuits. It is Weetabix Food Company&#x27;s flagship product, introduced in 1932 and is officially the top-selling breakfast cereal in the United Kingdom, accounting for 8% of the country&#x27;s total cereal sales. The cereal, which is manufactured in facilities in Kettering, England and Canada, is exported to 80 countries and has annual sales worth over £95 million. Weetabix Bitesize is essentially a smaller &quot;bite-sized&quot; version of Weetabix that can be easily poured into a bowl, more like a traditional breakfast cereal. Weetabix Minis are sweeter variant of the Weetabix Bitesize, with various additions depending upon the variety; Chocolate Crisp, Banana Crisp, Fruit &amp; Nut Crisp, and Honey &amp; Nut Crisp. Outside of the UK, Weetabix Minis has been re-launched and renamed at least twice in a relatively short period of time following their launch. Previously, they were known as Fruitibix, Bananabix, and Chocobix (depending upon the additions), then as Minibix.
* Weetaflakes
* Weetos

==Sponsorship==
Weetabix was the title sponsor of the Women&#x27;s British Open between 1987 and 2006. It has also previously sponsored Northamptonshire Police, providing a mobile police station in 2004. It was one of the sponsors of the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. Weetabix was the main sponsor of the first BMX World Championships held in the UK in 1986. These Championships were held at Slough in Berkshire, attracting over 2,000 racers from across the world.

<doc id="288328" wikidata="Q221174" url="?curid=288328" title="Topiramate">
<text>Topiramate, sold under the brand name Topamax among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy and prevent migraines. It has also been used for alcohol dependence and essential tremor. For epilepsy, this includes treatment for generalized or focal seizures. It is taken orally (by mouth).
Common side effects include tingling, feeling tired, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss, and decreased cognitive function such as trouble concentrating. Serious side effects may include suicide, increased ammonia levels resulting in encephalopathy, and kidney stones. Topiramate can cause birth defects, including cleft lip and palate. Risks/benefits should be carefully discussed with the full treatment team. Topiramate is considered &quot;probably compatible&quot; with lactation and is not contraindicated for breastfeeding, though monitoring of the infant for diarrhea or poor weight gain may be considered. The mechanism of action is unclear.
Topiramate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 84th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Topiramate is used to treat epilepsy in children and adults, and it was originally used as an anticonvulsant. In children, it is indicated for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delay. It is most frequently prescribed for the prevention of migraines, as it decreases the frequency of attacks. Topiramate is used to treat medication overuse headache and is recommended by the European Federation of Neurological Societies as one of the few medications showing effectiveness for this indication.

===Pain===
A 2018 review found topiramate of no use in chronic low back pain. Topiramate has not been shown to work as a pain medicine in diabetic neuropathy, the only neuropathic condition for which it has been adequately tested.

===Other===
One common off-label use for topiramate is in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A review published in 2010 suggested a benefit of topiramate in the treatment of symptoms of borderline personality disorder; however, the authors noted that this was based only on one randomized controlled trial and requires replication.

Topiramate has been used as a treatment for alcoholism. The U.S. Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense 2015 guidelines on substance use disorders list topiramate as a &quot;strong for&quot; in its recommendations for alcohol use disorder.

Other uses include treatment of obesity and binge eating disorder, and off-setting weight gain induced by taking antipsychotic medications. In 2012, the combination of phentermine/topiramate was approved in the United States for weight loss.

==Adverse effects==
People taking topiramate should be aware of the following risks: 
*Avoid activities requiring mental alertness and coordination until drug effects are realized.
*Topiramate may impair heat regulation, especially in children. Use caution with activities leading to an increased core temperature, such as strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, or dehydration.
*Topiramate may cause visual field defects.
*Topiramate may decrease the effectiveness of oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
*Taking topiramate in the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of cleft lip/cleft palate in infants.
*As is the case for all antiepileptic drugs, it is advisable not to suddenly discontinue topiramate, as there is a theoretical risk of rebound seizures.
*Some studies have attributed loss of appetite and upper respiratory tract infection to topiramate, but studies have concluded these adverse events are not difficult to tolerate for most individuals.

===Frequency===
Adverse effects by incidence:

Very common (&gt;10% incidence) adverse effects include:
Rarely, the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may be strong enough to cause metabolic acidosis of clinical importance.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified prescribers that topiramate can cause acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma in a small subset of people who take topiramate regularly. The symptoms, which typically begin in the first month of use, include blurred vision and eye pain. Discontinuation of topiramate may halt the progression of the ocular damage and may reverse the visual impairment.

Preliminary data suggests that, as with several other anti-epileptic drugs, topiramate carries an increased risk of congenital malformations. This might be particularly important for women who take topiramate to prevent migraine attacks. In March 2011, the FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of an increased risk of development of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) in infants born to women treated with Topamax (topiramate) during pregnancy and placed it in Pregnancy Category D.

Cognitive and word-finding difficulties, which may occur in some patients, may respond to piracetam.

Carbonation dysgeusia (distortion of the sense of taste-sensation of carbonation) may respond to and/or be prevented with zinc.

Topiramate has been associated with a statistically significant increase in suicidality, and &quot;suicidal thoughts or actions&quot; is now listed as one of the possible side effects of the drug &quot;in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500.&quot;

==Overdose==
Symptoms of acute and acute on chronic exposure to topiramate range from asymptomatic to status epilepticus, including in patients with no seizure history. In children, overdose may also result in hallucinations. Topiramate has been deemed the primary substance that led to fatal overdoses in cases that were complicated by polydrug exposure. The most common signs of overdose are dilated pupils, somnolence, dizziness, psychomotor agitation, and abnormal, uncoordinated body movements.

== Interactions ==

Topiramate has many drug-drug interactions. Some of the most common are listed below:
* As topiramate inhibits carbonic anhydrase, use with other inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (e.g. acetazolamide) increases the risk of kidney stones.
* Enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) can increase the elimination of topiramate, possibly necessitating dose escalations of topiramate.
* Topiramate may increase the plasma levels of phenytoin.
* Topiramate itself is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 and induces CYP3A4; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and digoxin has been noted during topiramate therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills); use of alternative birth control methods is recommended. Neither intrauterine devices (IUDs) nor Depo-Provera are affected by topiramate.
* Alcohol may cause increased sedation or drowsiness, and increase the risk of having a seizure.
* As topiramate may result in acidosis, other treatments that also do so may worsen this effect.
* Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia were reported in post-marketing reports about topiramate; antimuscarinic drugs (like trospium) can aggravate these disorders.

==Pharmacology==

The topiramate molecule is a sulfamate modified sugar – more specifically, fructose diacetonide, an unusual chemical structure for a pharmaceutical.

Topiramate is quickly absorbed after oral use. It has a half-life of 21 hours and a steady state of the drug is reached in 4 days in patients with normal renal function. Most of the drug (70%) is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remainder is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose.

Several cellular targets have been proposed to be relevant to the therapeutic activity of topiramate. These include (1) voltage-gated sodium channels; (2) high-voltage-activated calcium channels; (3) GABA-A receptors; (4) AMPA/kainate receptors; and (5) carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes. There is evidence that topiramate may alter the activity of its targets by modifying their phosphorylation state instead of by direct action. The effect on sodium channels could be of particular relevance for seizure protection. Although topiramate does inhibit high-voltage-activated calcium channels, its relevance to clinical activity is uncertain. Effects on specific GABA-A receptor isoforms could also contribute to the antiseizure activity of the drug. Topiramate selectively inhibits cytosolic (type II) and membrane-associated (type IV) forms of carbonic anhydrase. Its action on carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes may contribute to the drug&#x27;s side effects, including its propensity to cause metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate kidney stones.

Topiramate inhibits maximal seizure activity in electroconvulsive therapy and in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures as well as partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the kindling model, findings predictive of a broad spectrum of activities clinically. Its action on mitochondrial permeability transition pores has been proposed as a mechanism.

While many anticonvulsants have been associated with apoptosis in young animals, animal experiments have found that topiramate is one of the very few anticonvulsants [see: levetiracetam, carbamazepine, lamotrigine] that do not induce apoptosis in young animals at doses needed to produce an anticonvulsant effect.

===Detection in body fluids===
Blood, serum, or plasma topiramate concentrations may be measured using immunoassay or chromatographic methods to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 10 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 10 to 150 mg/L in overdose victims.

==History==
Topiramate was discovered in 1979 by Bruce E. Maryanoff and Joseph F. Gardocki during their research work at McNeil Pharmaceuticals. Topiramate was first sold
in 1996. Mylan Pharmaceuticals was granted final approval by the FDA for the sale of generic topiramate in the United States and the generic version was made available in September 2006. The last patent for topiramate in the U.S. was for use in children and expired on 28 February 2009.

== Research ==
Topiramate is being studied as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

There is some evidence for the use of topiramate in the management of cravings related to withdrawal from dextromethorphan.

A 2023 systematic review of seizure treatment for infants aged 1 to 36 months identified three studies that evaluated the use of topiramate. Though its adverse effects, including upper respiratory tract infection and loss of appetite, were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group, its effectiveness in reducing seizures was inconclusive. The available research suffers from small sample sizes, inconsistent findings, and inadequate comparison groups.

<doc id="288329" wikidata="Q757292" url="?curid=288329" title="Border checkpoint">
<text>A border checkpoint is a location on an international border where travelers or goods are inspected and allowed (or denied) passage through. Authorization often is required to enter a country through its borders. Access-controlled borders often have a limited number of checkpoints where they can be crossed without legal sanctions. Arrangements or treaties may be formed to allow or mandate less restrained crossings (e.g. the Schengen Agreement). Land border checkpoints (land ports of entry) can be contrasted with the customs and immigration facilities at seaports, international airports, and other ports of entry.

Checkpoints generally serve two purposes:
* To prevent entrance of individuals who are either undesirable (e.g. criminals or others who pose threats) or simply unauthorized to enter.
* To prevent entrance of goods that are illegal or subject to restriction, or to collect tariffs.

Checkpoints are usually staffed by a uniformed service (sometimes referred to as customs service or border patrol agents).

In some countries (e.g. China) there are border checkpoints for both those entering and those exiting the country, while in others (e.g. U.S. and Canada), there are border checkpoints only when entering the country. (There are also United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints.)

== Definitions in European Union (Schengen) law ==
The &quot;Schengen &quot;Borders Code&quot;&quot;, which forms part of the law of the European Union, defines some terms as follows (particularities with respect to the EU are left out, in order to emphasize general usability of those definitions): 
*&quot;Border crossing point&quot; means any crossing point authorized by the competent authorities for the crossing of external borders (Article 2 sec. 8 of the Schengen Borders Code);
*&quot;Border control&quot; means the activity carried out at a border, [...] in response exclusively to an intention to cross or the act of crossing that border, regardless of any other consideration, consisting of border checks and border surveillance (Article 2 sec. 9 of the Schengen Borders Code);
*&quot;Border checks&quot; means the checks carried out at border crossing points, to ensure that persons, including their means of transport and the objects in their possession, may be authorised to enter the territory [...] or authorised to leave it (Article 2 sec. 10 of the Schengen Borders Code);
*&quot;Border surveillance&quot; means the surveillance of borders between border crossing points and the surveillance of border crossing points outside the fixed opening hours, in order to prevent persons from circumventing border checks (Article 2 sec. 10 of the Schengen Borders Code).
*&quot;Second line check&quot; means a further check which may be carried out in a special location away from the location at which all persons are checked (first line)
These definitions mean that a place where a road crosses an internal Schengen border is legally not a &quot;border crossing point&quot;.

==Busiest checkpoints in the world==
===Land===
This is a list of the busiest land border checkpoints in the world, handling more than 35 million travelers in both directions annually. These travelers (or individual crossings) comprise pedestrians, drivers and vehicle passengers. International border checkpoints are in green.

Notes:
* As the United States does not have border checkpoints for outgoing traffic, incoming traffic figures are doubled to give a fair comparison. See detailed notes in table.
* El Paso Port of Entry has been excluded, as its total represents the sum of six individual checkpoints at the end of six separate bridges, with no single checkpoint meeting the minimum number of crossings required for this list.

===Air===

This is a list of the busiest airports in the world, by international passenger traffic, as of 2018. Airports serving international passengers are effectively checkpoints, and have the proper customs, immigration and quarantine facilities. Airports Council International&#x27;s (January–December) preliminary figures are as follows.
===Sea===
This is a list of the busiest seaports in the world, with proper customs, immigration and quarantine facilities to be deemed as maritime checkpoints. Although figures simply represent total passenger traffic, most (if not, all) of the passengers served at these ports are bound for other countries and have to pass through checkpoint (i.e. the port is not a domestic one). This list only includes ports that handle more than 4 million passengers annually.

Note:
* The four passenger ports in China, Hong Kong and Macau in this list operate services to and from each other. These passenger ports are effectively checkpoints, as they have the proper customs, immigration and quarantine facilities.

<doc id="288331" wikidata="Q376278" url="?curid=288331" title="Julian Tuwim">
<text>Julian Tuwim (13 September 1894 – 27 December 1953), known also under the pseudonym Oldlen as a lyricist, was a Polish poet, born in Łódź, then part of the Russian Partition. He was educated in Łódź and in Warsaw where he studied law and philosophy at Warsaw University. After Poland&#x27;s return to independence in 1918, Tuwim co-founded the Skamander group of experimental poets with Antoni Słonimski and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. He was a major figure in Polish literature, admired also for his contribution to children&#x27;s literature. He was a recipient of the prestigious Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1935.

==Life and work==
Tuwim was born into a family of assimilated Jews. The surname comes from the Hebrew &quot;tovim&quot; () meaning &quot;good ones&quot;. His parents, Izydor and Adela, provided Julian with a comfortable middle-class upbringing. He was not a particularly diligent student and had to repeat the sixth grade. In 1905 the family had to flee from Łódź to Wrocław (Breslau) in order to escape possible repercussions following Izydor&#x27;s involvement in the Revolution of 1905.

Initially, Tuwim&#x27;s poetry, even more than that of the other Skamandrites, represented a decisive break with turn-of-the-20th-century mannerism. It was characterized by an expression of vitality, optimism, in praise of urban life. His poems celebrated everyday life in the city, with its triviality and vulgarity. Tuwim often used vernacular language in his work, along with slang as well as poetic dialogue.

His collections &quot;Czyhanie na Boga&quot; (&quot;In Lurking for God&quot;; 1918), &quot;Sokrates tańczący&quot; (&quot;Dancing Socrates&quot;; 1920), &quot;Siódma jesień&quot; (&quot;Seventh Autumn&quot;; 1922), and &quot;Wierszy tom czwarty&quot; (&quot;Poems, Volume Four&quot;; 1923) are typical of his early work. In his later collections – &quot;Słowa we krwi&quot; (&quot;Words in the Blood&quot;; 1926), &quot;Rzecz Czarnoleska&quot; (&quot;The Czarnolas Matter&quot;; 1929), &quot;Biblia cygańska&quot; (&quot;The Gypsy Bible&quot;; 1933) and &quot;Treść gorejąca&quot; (&quot;A Burning Matter&quot;; 1933) – Tuwim became restless and bitter, and wrote with fervour and vehemence about the emptiness of urban existence. He also drew more heavily from the romantic and classicist traditions, while perfecting his form and style, and becoming a virtuoso wordsmith.
From the very beginning and throughout his artistic career, Tuwim was satirically inclined. He supplied sketches and monologues to numerous cabarets. In his poetry and articles, he derided obscurantism and bureaucracy as well as militaristic and nationalistic trends in politics. His burlesque &quot;Bal w Operze&quot; (&quot;The Ball at the Opera&quot;; 1936) is regarded as his best satirical poem.

In 1918, Tuwim co-founded the cabaret (comedy troupe) named Picador and worked as a writer or artistic director with many other comedy troupes, such as Czarny Kot (1917–1919), Quid pro Quo (1919–1932), Banda, Stara Banda (1932–1935), and finally Cyrulik Warszawski (1935–1939). Since 1924, Tuwim was a staff writer at &quot;Wiadomości Literackie&quot; where he wrote a weekly column titled &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;. He also wrote for the satirical magazine &quot;Szpilki&quot;.

Tuwim displayed his caustic sense of humour and unyielding individuality in works such as &quot;Poem in which the author politely but firmly implores the vast hosts of his brethren to kiss his arse.&quot; Here, Tuwim systematically enumerates and caricatures various personalities of the European social scene of the mid-1930s -- &#x27;perfumed café intellectuals&#x27;, &#x27;drab socialists&#x27;, &#x27;fascist jocks&#x27;, &#x27;Zionist doctors&#x27;, &#x27;repressed Catholics&#x27; and so on, and ends every stanza by asking each to perform the action indicated in the title. The poem ends with a note to the would-be censor who would surely be tempted to expunge all mention of this piece for its breach of &#x27;public standards.&#x27;

His poem &quot;Do prostego człowieka&quot; (&quot;To the Common Man&quot;), first published on 7 October 1929 in &quot;Robotnik&quot;, provoked a storm of attacks on Tuwim both from left-wing circles, which criticized the poem&#x27;s &quot;bourgeois expression of pacifist sentiment&quot;, and from right-wing groups which accused Tuwim of calling for the disarmament of the young state.

Julian&#x27;s aunt was married to Adam Czerniaków, and his uncle from his mother&#x27;s side was Arthur Rubinstein.

==World War II and after==
In 1939, at the beginning of World War II and the German occupation of Poland, Tuwim emigrated through Romania first to France, and after France&#x27;s capitulation, to Brazil, by way of Portugal, and finally to the US, where he settled in 1942. In 1939–1941, he collaborated with the émigré weekly &quot;Wiadomości Polskie&quot;, but broke off the collaboration due to differences in views on the attitude towards the Soviet Union. In 1942–1946, he worked with the monthly &quot;Nowa Polska&quot; published in London, and with leftist Polish-American newspapers. He was affiliated with the Polish section of the International Workers Organization from 1942. He was also a member of the Association of Writers From Poland (a member of the board in 1943).


During this time he wrote &quot;Kwiaty Polskie&quot; (&quot;Polish Flowers&quot;), an epic poem in which he remembers with nostalgia his early childhood in Łódź. In April 1944 he published a manifesto, entitled &quot;My, Żydzi Polscy&quot; (&quot;We, Polish Jews&quot;).

Tuwim returned to Poland after the war in 1946 but did not produce much in Stalinist Poland. He died in 1953 at the age of 59 in Zakopane. Although Tuwim was well known for serious poetry, he also wrote satirical works and children&#x27;s poems, for example &quot;Lokomotywa&quot; (&quot;&quot;; 1938, tr. 1940), translated into many languages. He also wrote well-regarded translations of Pushkin and other Russian poets.

Russian Soviet poet Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya translated most of Tuwim&#x27;s children&#x27;s poetry into Russian.

<doc id="288333" wikidata="Q2117481" url="?curid=288333" title="Puerto Morelos">
<text>Puerto Morelos () is a municipality, town, and seaport in Quintana Roo, Mexico&#x27;s easternmost state, on the Yucatán Peninsula. The town is located in the northeast of the state, about south of the resort city of Cancún, and about north of the city of Playa del Carmen.

Puerto Morelos merged with the village of Leona Vicario on December 6, 2015, to form the municipality of Puerto Morelos, the 11th municipality in Quintana Roo, separating from its former municipality of Benito Juárez.

==History==
It has historically been the main port between the mainland of Quintana Roo and the island of Cozumel, and an automobile ferry used to run from Puerto Morelos to Cozumel. The town is named after Independence leader José María Morelos.

Resorts are abundant in the Puerto Morelos region along the Riviera Maya and attractions, such as the Crococun Crocodile Zoo, the Botanical Garden, and a host of cenotes are also increasing in number. Recently new smaller inns have been built which offers an evening programs of Talks on local history, marine biology, and healthy living practices.

One hundred meters off shore lies the Puerto Morelos portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, designated as a National Marine Park in 1998 due to local environmental activists.

==Geography==
Puerto Morelos is divided by a highway and a mangrove swamp into three sections. The section west of the highway is known as &quot;Colonia Joaquin Zetina Gazca&quot;. The section east of the highway is called &quot;Colonia Pescadores&quot;. The section on the coast east of the mangrove swamp is &quot;Puerto&quot; or &quot;Antiguo (old) Puerto Morelos&quot;. This original coastal fishing village is now a quiet, mixed-use neighborhood of private homes, hotels, condominiums, restaurants, and tourist shops.

The second part is about 2 km. inland and adjacent to Highway 307, on the western side. The inland portion is mainly single level dwellings for local workers. New residential developments have sprung up in recent years adding to the housing mix. There are now multi-story apartment buildings, and private residential developments between the highway and the mangrove where one can buy lots and build a house of one&#x27;s own design.

===Climate===
Classified by Köppen-Geiger system as tropical wet and dry climate (Aw), because its driest month has less than of precipitation and also less than &quot;100 − (total annual precipitation [mm]/25)&quot;, also because each month has a mean average above .

==Demographics==
Puerto Morelos has grown rapidly with the development of tourism and as of the 2010 census is the home to 9,188 people. 
==Infrastructure==
The marine terminal at Puerto Morelos is equipped to handle containers and is an important seaport in the state of Quintana Roo. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Puerto Morelos amounted to 41.2 thousand metric tons in 2019.

In addition, there is a Tren Maya station that opened to the public on 15 March 2024 just outside Puerto Morelos.

<text>Michael Garrett Shanks (born December 15, 1970) is a Canadian actor. He is best known for his role as Daniel Jackson in the long-running military science fiction television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and as Dr Charles Harris in the Canadian medical drama &quot;Saving Hope&quot;. He is also known for his work on low budget genre work filmed in Canada.

==Early life==
Shanks was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and grew up in Kamloops. After witnessing Richard Dean Anderson prepare for a scene of &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Shanks &quot;decided to pursue [acting] a little further&quot;, opting to attend the University of British Columbia&#x27;s fine arts program until 1994. He later appeared in several stage productions while serving a two-year apprenticeship with the prestigious Stratford Festival in Ontario.&quot;&quot; His television career began with guest appearances on shows including &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Commish&quot;.&quot;&quot; Parts in the television movies &quot;A Family Divided&quot; and &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; preceded his casting in his breakthrough role as Daniel Jackson in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

==Career==

=== &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise ===
Shanks played archaeologist Dr Daniel Jackson throughout the first five seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; before leaving the show at the end of its fifth season, citing creative differences concerning the under-use of his character and the direction of the show as a whole. He made several guest appearances throughout the sixth season playing his own character, as well as voicing the Asgard character Thor. Shanks returned for the seventh and subsequent seasons, winning the Leo Award for Best Lead Performance By A Male in a Dramatic Series in 2004 for the seventh season episode &quot;Lifeboat&quot;. During the series&#x27; tenth and final season, he signed up for 16 of the 20 episodes, taking some time off in March 2006 for the birth of his third child (second with wife and occasional co-star Lexa Doig).

He appeared in both direct-to-DVD &quot;Stargate&quot; films released in 2008, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and won the 2009 Leo Award for Lead Performance by a Male in a Feature Length Drama for &quot;Continuum&quot;.

In 2004, Shanks made a crossover appearance (as Daniel Jackson) in the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; pilot, &quot;Rising&quot;. He also appeared in the tenth and eleventh episodes of &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ fifth and final season, and made a cameo appearance in the pilot of the third Stargate series &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. He also appeared in the episodes &quot;Human&quot; and &quot;Subversion&quot;.

===Other appearances===
In 2001, Shanks guest starred in the episode &quot;Star-Crossed&quot; in the Sci-Fi series &quot;Andromeda&quot;, during which he met his future wife, Lexa Doig. Coincidentally, they played two androids who fell in love with each other. In 2002, Shanks starred in the German/UK/South African co-production &quot;Sumuru&quot;, a science fiction B-movie, as astronaut Adam Wade. He also auditioned for the role of Shinzon in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.

In 2007, Shanks joined the Fox Network series &quot;24&quot;, guest-starring as lobbyist Mark Bishop in a three-episode arc for season 6. In 2008–2009, Shanks had a recurring role on the second season of the USA Network spy series &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, playing Victor Stecker-Epps, a fellow burned spy and maniacal counterpoint to series lead Jeffrey Donovan&#x27;s character. In 2008, Shanks had a guest starring role in one episode of the SciFi Channel series &quot;Eureka&quot;, as an alchemist somewhat responsible for the near destruction of the town due to a student&#x27;s mixing chemicals in his lab and thereby creating the &quot;Alchemist curse&quot;. He appeared in the episode &quot;All That Glitters...&quot;, with a mention of his character in the episode &quot;A Night At Global Dynamics&quot;.

Shanks was featured in a lead role in the SciFi Channel&#x27;s adventure film, &quot;The Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon&quot; as Jacob Thain opposite &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Charmed&quot; alumna Shannen Doherty. The film premiered on the cable network on December 20, 2008. In 2010, Shanks appeared in an episode of &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, which stars fellow &quot;Stargate&quot; actor Amanda Tapping. In the same year he starred in the film &quot;Arctic Blast&quot;, a disaster film, as physicist Jack Tate.

Shanks&#x27; had a guest role as archaeologist Carter Hall, DC Comics&#x27; superhero Hawkman, in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Absolute Justice&quot;. He later reprised the role in the final episode of the ninth season.

Shanks then appeared in guest spots during the &quot;Smallville&quot; tenth season episodes &quot;Shield&quot; and &quot;Icarus&quot; as well as appearing in &quot;Supernatural&quot; season 5 episode &quot;99 Problems&quot;.

Shanks stars in the Canadian thriller &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot;.

Shanks has also starred in the Fox comedy &quot;The Good Guys&quot; as the pompous leader of the Strike Force. In 2011, Shanks was the guest star in the third episode of the Showcase show &quot;Endgame&quot;, where he plays an amnesiac.

In 2012, Shanks returned to primetime as Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Harris on &quot;Saving Hope&quot;, reuniting with &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star Erica Durance.

In 2019, Shanks played the role of Horace Axley on the second season of the Netflix science-fiction series &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Shanks has a daughter from his relationship with model and actress Vaitiare Bandera, who portrayed Sha&#x27;re, his character&#x27;s wife on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

On August 2, 2003, Shanks married actress Lexa Doig, whom he met in 2001 while guest-starring on the series &quot;Andromeda&quot;. (They would also work together on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, when Doig was cast as Dr Carolyn Lam, a recurring character in seasons nine and ten). They have two children.

Shanks enjoys playing ice hockey, and once considered playing professionally. He was on the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; hockey team, competing against the teams of other Vancouver-based productions such as &quot;Smallville&quot;, and also displayed his aptitude for the sport in the 2006 television film &quot;Under the Mistletoe&quot;, in which he played the part of a school hockey coach. This aptitude was also highlighted in his 2013 role as the title character in the television film &quot;Mr. Hockey: The Gordie Howe Story&quot;.

<doc id="288337" wikidata="Q4411083" url="?curid=288337" title="Free Church of England">
<text>The Free Church of England (FCE) is an Episcopal Church based in England. The church was founded when a number of congregations separated from the established Church of England in the middle of the 19th century.

The doctrinal basis of the FCE, together with its Episcopal structures, organisation, worship, ministry and ethos are recognisably Anglican although it is not a member of the Anglican Communion. Its worship style follows that of the Book of Common Prayer or conservative modern-language forms that belong to the Anglican tradition.

The Church of England acknowledges the FCE as a church with valid orders and its canons permit a range of shared liturgical and ministerial activities.

==History==
The Free Church of England was founded principally by Evangelical Low Church clergy and congregations in response to what were perceived as attempts (inspired by the Oxford Movement) to re-introduce traditional Catholic practices into the Church of England, England&#x27;s established church. The first congregation was formed by the Reverend James Shore at St John&#x27;s Church Bridgetown, Totnes, Devon, in 1844.

In the early years, clergy were often provided by the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion which had its origins in the 18th-century Evangelical Revival. By the middle of the 19th century, the Connexion still retained many Anglican features such as the use of the surplice and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

The first Bishop was Benjamin Price, who initially had oversight of all the new congregations.

In 1874 the FCE made contact with the newly organised Reformed Episcopal Church in North America.

In 1956, the FCE published a revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; to form the primary text of the denomination&#x27;s liturgy. The stated intention of the revision was to remove or explain &quot;particular phrases and expressions&quot; from the Church of England&#x27;s 1662 edition of the prayer book that &quot;afford at least plausible ground for the teaching and practice of the Sacerdotal and Romanising Party&quot;.

In 2003, due to differences in theology and practice, two Bishops and ten congregations split from the main Church and formed the Evangelical Connexion of the Free Church of England. Despite its name, the body is not part of the official denomination. Three of these congregations returned to the FCE – those in Exeter (which subsequently left the FCE again in April 2023), Middlesbrough (which eventually closed in 2021) and Oswaldtwistle. Leigh-on-Sea returned to the FCE in 2023. Two churches in Farnham and Teddington having become independent altogether, the ECFCE currently has four churches in Fleetwood, Leeds, Tuebrook (Liverpool) and Workington.

==Ordained ministry==
The Church holds a threefold ministry of deacons, presbyters and bishops and only ordains men. Its orders have been recognised as valid by the Church of England since 2013.

==Organisation==
The provision of contemporary language liturgies has been approved by Convocation and a process of drafting and authorisation has begun. The church has continued to ordain bishops in the apostolic succession, with Moravian, Church of England and Malabar Independent Syrian Church bishops taking part on occasion.

==Dioceses==
The united Church enjoyed modest growth in the first part of the 20th century, having at one point 90 congregations, but after the Second World War, like most other denominations in the UK, suffered a decline in numbers, though there has been a modest increase in the number of congregations in recent years. The UK churches are located across two dioceses, the Northern Diocese and the Southern Diocese.

=== Northern Diocese ===

The current Bishop of the Northern Diocese is John Fenwick. Dr Fenwick also acts as Bishop Primus, an office that is elected annually at Convocation.

Churches in the Northern Diocese are located in the northern half of England, alongside Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man, with a majority of these congregations in the Lancashire area. These churches include a congregation which worships in Farsi.

===Southern Diocese===

The current Bishop of the Southern Diocese is Paul Hunt.

Churches in the Southern Diocese are located in the southern half of England.

==Recognition of orders==
In January 2013 it was announced that the Church of England had recognised the holy orders of the Free Church of England. This move followed approximately three years of contact between the bishops of the Free Church of England, the Council for Christian Unity and the Faith and Order Commission. The recognition was approved by the Council for Christian Unity and the Faith and Order Advisory Commission, and endorsed by the standing committee of the House of Bishops. John McLean, the then Bishop Primus of the Free Church of England, said: &quot;We are grateful to the archbishops for this recognition of our common episcopal heritage. I pray that it will not be an end in itself, but will lead to new opportunities for proclaiming the Gospel.&quot; Christopher Hill, Bishop of Guildford and chair of the Church of England&#x27;s Council for Christian Unity, said: &quot;I hope there will be good relations between us and especially in those places where there is a Free Church of England congregation.&quot;

Recognition of the orders of the Free Church of England under the Overseas and Other Clergy (Ministry and Ordination) Measure 1967 (No. 3) means that FCE clergy are eligible to be given permission under that measure to officiate in the Church of England, subject to such procedures and authorisations as may be required. A number have been so authorised while remaining clergy of the FCE in good standing. The measure also permits FCE bishops to ordain and perform other episcopal functions at the request of the bishop of a diocese in the provinces of Canterbury and York, subject to the consent of the relevant archbishop.

==Relationships==
The FCE is in communion with the Reformed Episcopal Church, which itself is now a subjurisdiction of the Anglican Church in North America. Within the UK the FCE is a member of the Free Churches Group and Churches Together in England. From 1992 to 1997 the FCE was in official dialogue with the Church of England, which the 1998 Lambeth Conference saw as a sign of hope. It is a Designated Church under the Church of England&#x27;s Ecumenical Relations Measure 1988.

FCE bishops have attended the enthronements of George Carey, Rowan Williams and Justin Welby as Archbishops of Canterbury. Since 2013, the Free Church of England has been in dialogue with the conservative Old Catholics of the Union of Scranton; former FCE Deacon Calvin Robinson sought ordination in the Union of Scranton&#x27;s Nordic Catholic Church while minister-in-charge at the FCE&#x27;s Christ Church, Harlesden.

==Anglican realignment==

The FCE has been involved in the realignments within the Anglican Communion. In 2009 the church was represented at the launch of the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (UK and Ireland), the local expression of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) movement inaugurated the previous year in Jerusalem. The FCE has been represented at the subsequent GAFCON Conferences – Nairobi (2013), Jerusalem (2018) and Kigali (2023). Its bishops are members of the GAFCON GBE Bishops’ Forum and the Bishop Primus is a member of the GAFCON GBE Regional Council.

In February 2016, Foley Beach, Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America, signed an Instrument declaring the Anglican Church in North America to be in full communion with the Free Church of England, and recognising &quot;their congregations, clergy, and sacraments, while pledging to work together for the proclamation of the Good News of Jesus Christ and the making of his disciples throughout the world&quot;. Archbishop Beach&#x27;s declaration was ratified by the provincial council of the ACNA in June 2016.

<text>The University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover (, TiHo) is a university in Hanover and one of the five facilities for veterinary medicine in Germany, and the only one that remains independent. It is often referred to as TiHo by its staff and students.

According to the website, there are currently about 2,400 university students, 2,000 of which study veterinary medicine, and 50 study biology. The staff has 1000 members, for example 63 professors and 250 other scientific assistants. The rest is mostly engaged in the 5 clinics and 13 institutes for pretty much every field of veterinary medicine. The clinics have an average of 49,000 patients a year (hospitalized, outpatient and polyclinical care), and of course, there are a lot of apprentices in related professions.

The school also maintains a botanical garden specializing in medicinal and poisonous plants, the Heil- und Giftpflanzengarten der Tierärztlichen Hochschule Hannover.

==History==
The TiHo was founded in 1778 under the regency of George III and originally named &quot;Roß-Arzney-Schule&quot;. This university is also one of the oldest of its kind. The first lecturer was Johann Adam Kersting from Kassel.

<text>Arjan Singh Āulakh (born August 12, 1974), known by the stage name Arj Barker, is an American comedian and actor from San Anselmo, California. He has toured in North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. He was born to an engineer father and artist mother. His father is of Indian Punjabi Sikh descent and his mother is of European descent.

==Career==
Barker started his career in comedy after graduating from high school in 1989. His first gigs were at a café called Caffe Nuvo in downtown San Anselmo where he hosted stand-up night every Sunday throughout the early 1990s. Barker appeared on &quot;Premium Blend&quot; in 1997, followed by appearances on the shows &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Glass House&quot;. He twice hosted &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot;, first on September 20, 2000, and again on March 31, 2006. Barker was featured in Comedy Central&#x27;s animated series Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties. He appeared on the Australian show &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; on October 18, 2006, September 19, 2007, and June 17, 2009.

Barker co-wrote and performed in &quot;The Marijuana-Logues&quot;, an Off-Broadway show in New York City, with Doug Benson and Tony Camin. The title of the show was a parody of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. NBC gave Barker the lead role for sitcom &quot;Nearly Nirvana&quot;, originally scheduled for 2004. However, Barker was replaced in the lead role by the show&#x27;s creator, Ajay Sahgal, and the show never aired.

Barker appeared in the HBO sitcom &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;, playing Dave. Barker has been successful in Australia for a number of years since first appearing at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2000, and presently resides there. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, he won Best Comedy Release for &quot;Organic&quot;.

During the 2024 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Barker attracted widespread media attention in Australia for, while on stage in front of a live audience, demanding a mother breastfeeding her 7-month-old baby to leave and have her ticket refunded. Barker claimed the baby was interrupting his train of thought.

==&quot;Arj and Poopy&quot;==
Barker also has his own Flash series, &quot;Arj and Poopy&quot;, based on some of his stand-up material, that stars him and his cat, Poopy, who talks by farting. The series was animated by Bernard Derriman, and has been syndicated to AtomFilms.

The episode &quot;Unlucky in Love&quot; won the Annecy International Animated Film Festival Internet Selection in 2006.
