<text>Eleusis is a shedding-type card game where one player chooses a secret rule to determine which cards can be played on top of others, and the other players attempt to determine the rule using inductive logic.

The game was invented by Robert Abbott in 1956, and was first published by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine in June 1959. A revised version appeared in Gardner&#x27;s July 1977 column.

Eleusis is sometimes considered an analogy to the problems of scientific method. It can be compared with the card game Mao, which also has secret rules that can be learned inductively. The games of Penultima and commercially produced Zendo also feature players attempting to discover inductively a secret rule or rules thought of by a &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;spectators&quot; who declare plays legal or illegal on the basis of the rules.

==Rules==

The game is played by creating a row of cards in sequence. At the start of the game the dealer (known as &quot;God&quot;) invents a secret constraint for how these cards must progress: for example, &quot;each card played must be higher than the last, unless the last card was a face card, in which case any numeral card may be played&quot;.

Two decks of cards are shuffled and 14 cards dealt to each player except the dealer. One card is dealt face-up to start the row and a random player chosen to start.

On a player&#x27;s turn they must add one or more cards from their hand to the row, in sequence. The dealer judges this play: if the entire play fits the dealer&#x27;s rule, the cards are left in place as part of the row. Otherwise, they are removed from the row and &quot;sidelined&quot;, as to be put below the card that they attempted to follow, and the player is dealt a number of penalty cards equal to twice the number of cards they attempted to play that turn. If the play had multiple cards and only some were incorrect, the entire play is declared invalid, without the dealer specifying the invalid cards.

One player may elect to be a &quot;prophet&quot;. A player who believes they have worked out the rule may request to become one at the end of their turn, if there is not already a prophet among the players, by placing a black marker on the card they just played. The prophet puts down their hand and skips their turns during their time as prophet. The prophet takes on the role of judging valid and invalid moves; if the dealer catches them making a mistake, the prophet is overthrown and receives five penalty cards (with the player who made the play receiving no penalty cards for that turn, if the play was invalid). An overthrown prophet takes their hand back up, takes all black markers off the row, and becomes a regular player again.

If at any time a player thinks they cannot play a legitimate card, they may declare a &quot;no play&quot;, and show their hand to everybody. If the dealer confirms that no cards in that hand can be played, the player discards the hand and draws a new hand four cards smaller. If the player&#x27;s call was incorrect, the dealer plays the correct card for them and gives the player five penalty cards.

A white marker is placed on each tenth card played, and a black marker on each tenth card after a prophet&#x27;s marker. After the fourth black or white marker is placed, any invalid plays result in that player being eliminated from the game, and their hand remains intact for scoring. If both white and black markers are present, the black markers take precedence.

A round ends when a player empties their hand, or when all players (excluding the prophet, if any) have been eliminated. Players score 1 point for each card in the hand of the player with most cards, minus the number of cards in their own hand. If a player has an empty hand they gain a further 4 points. If there is a prophet at the end of the game, they receive an additional 1 point for each card in the row following their first black marker, and 2 points for each sidelined card following that marker. The dealer&#x27;s score equals the highest score of any player, unless there was an active prophet. If there is a prophet, count the cards (right and wrong) played up to and including the card with the prophet marker and double this number. Dealer&#x27;s score is the smaller of the high count and the doubled card total. The winner is determined by the total of all rounds, and if the game ended before all players have had a chance to deal, every player who has never dealt get 10 more points in compensation.

==Eleusis Express==
In 2006, John Golden developed a streamlined version of the game, intended to assist elementary school teachers in explaining the scientific method to students. It has the following differences:

* The game starts with 12 cards in each player&#x27;s hand, not 14.
* The game has no prophet, instead allowing players to openly guess the rule whenever they make a valid play.
* A &quot;no play&quot; hand results in a 1 card penalty if incorrect, or a redrawing of a hand one card smaller if correct.
* The game is played until a player empties their hand or makes a correct guess: at that point, each player scores 12 minus the number of cards left in their hand, with a 6-point bonus for correctly guessing the rule and a 3-point bonus for emptying one&#x27;s hand. The dealer scores the same as the highest-scoring player.

Abbott himself considered the variant a &quot;great game&quot;, and referred to it as &quot;Eleusis Express&quot;.

<text>Patricia Kathleen Page, (23 November 1916 – 14 January 2010) was a Canadian poet, though the citation as she was inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada reads &quot;poet, novelist, script writer, playwright, essayist, journalist, librettist, teacher and artist.&quot; She was the author of more than 30 published books that include poetry, fiction, travel diaries, essays, children&#x27;s books, and an autobiography.

As a visual artist, she exhibited her work as P.K. Irwin at a number of venues in Canada and abroad. Her works are in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Burnaby Art Gallery.

By special resolution of the United Nations, in 2001 Page&#x27;s poem &quot;Planet Earth&quot; was read simultaneously in New York, the Antarctic, and the South Pacific to celebrate the International Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations.

==Life==
P.K. Page was born in Swanage, Dorset, England, and moved with her family to Canada in 1919. Page&#x27;s parents moved with her to Red Deer, Alberta in 1919, when she was only 3, and later to Calgary and Winnipeg. Her father was Lionel Frank Page, a Canadian Army officer. Page said her parents were creative, encouraging non-conformists who loved the arts, recited poetry and read to her. She credited her early interest in poetry to the rhythms she unconsciously imbibed as a child. A year in England when she was 17 opened her eyes to galleries, ballets and concerts.

Page &quot;later moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where she worked as a shop assistant and radio actress during the late 1930s.&quot;

In 1941 Page moved to Montreal and came into contact with the Montreal Group of poets, which included A. M. Klein and F. R. Scott.

She became a founding member of Patrick Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Preview&quot; magazine in 1942, and of its successor, &quot;Northern Review,&quot; in 1945. Some of her poetry appeared in the modernist anthology, &quot;Unit of Five,&quot; in 1944, along with poems by Louis Dudek, Ronald Hambleton, Raymond Souster, and James Wreford.

In 1944 she published a romantic novel, &quot;The Sun and the Moon,&quot; under the pseudonym Judith Cape. The novel was reprinted in 1973, along with some of her short stories from the 1940s, as &quot;The Sun and the Moon and Other Fictions&quot;.

Later she became a scriptwriter at Canada&#x27;s National Film Board, where she met W. Arthur Irwin, a former editor of Maclean&#x27;s magazine, whom she married in 1950. Following her marriage, &quot;Page devoted her time to writing the poetry collection &quot;The Metal and the Flower&quot; (1954), for which she received a Governor General&#x27;s Award.&quot;

Page travelled with her husband on his diplomatic postings to Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Guatemala. In Brazil and Mexico, not hearing the rhythms of spoken English, she said, &quot;I had a long dry spell, so I started painting and keeping a journal,&quot; published as &quot;Brazilian Journal&quot; and illustrated with her own paintings. She began writing poetry again following her return to Canada in the mid-1960s.

Her visual art, under her married name as P. K. Irwin, is in galleries and private collections, including the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa.

She remained an active cultural collaborator and wrote steadily throughout the last years of her life in Oak Bay, British Columbia.

==Writing==
Page&#x27;s career can be divided into two periods: the first being the 1940s and 1950s, and the second starting with her return to Canada in the 1960s.

Her early poems &quot;were inward-looking, imaginary biographies,&quot; which &quot;rely heavily on suggestive imagery and the detailed depiction of concrete situations to express social concerns and transcendental themes ... such poems as &#x27;The Stenographers&#x27; and &#x27;The Landlady&#x27; focus on isolated individuals who futilely search for meaning and a sense of belonging. &#x27;Photos of a Salt Mine&#x27; considered one of Page&#x27;s best early poems, examines how art both conceals and reveals reality.&quot;

Northrop Frye wrote about her 1954 volume, &quot;The Metal and the Flower&quot;, that &quot;if there is anything such as &#x27;pure poetry,&#x27; this must be it: a lively mind seizing on almost any experience and turning it into witty verse... Miss Page&#x27;s work has a competent elegance about it that makes even the undistinguished poems still satisfying to look at.&quot;

Her later works showed &quot;a new austerity in form and a reduction in the number of images presented.&quot; As well, there is a difference in type of image: &quot;her later poems are often set abroad and suggest a path of liberation for the isolated, alienated individual... Such poems as &#x27;Bark Drawing&#x27; and &#x27;Cook&#x27;s Mountains&#x27; contain images outside the self as does &#x27;Cry Ararat!&#x27; — a poem concerning the reconciliation of internal and external worlds, in which Mount Ararat symbolizes a place of rest [in] between.&quot;

Critic George Woodcock has said that Page&#x27;s &quot;most recent poems are more sharply and intensely visual than ever in their sensuous evocation of shape and color and space; their imagery takes us magically beyond any ordinary seeing into a realm of imagining in which the normal world is shaken like a vast kaleidoscope and revealed in unexpected and luminous relationships.&quot;

Page&#x27;s 1972 apocalyptic tale of climate change, &quot;Unless the Eye Catch Fire&quot;, appeared in the literary journal &quot;The Malahat Review&quot; in the late 1970s and, in 1981, as the only prose piece in her poetry collection &quot;Evening Dance of the Grey Flies&quot;. Created later as a one-woman play by actor Joy Coghill and flautist Robert Cram at the Banff Centre for the Arts, it was performed in 1994 as part of the British Empire Games Festival in Victoria, B.C. and, in 2002, at the National Arts Centre, Ottawa, and Trent University. A performance directed by David Duke was part of the Vancouver International Writers Festival in October 2009. Composer Gavin Bryers wrote music for a film version of Page&#x27;s story by Anna Tchermakova, produced by Hilary Jones-Farrow for CBC Television. The June 1999 concert of Bryers&#x27; score, presented by The May Street Group and CBC Radio Two, was recorded for future broadcast.

==Recognition==

Page won the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1954 for &quot;The Metal and the Flower&quot;, and the Canadian Authors Association Award in 1985 for &quot;The Glass Air.&quot;

In 1977 she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion of the Order in 1998. In 2003, she was made a member of the Order of British Columbia.

BC Lt. Gov. Iona Campagnolo awarded her the first Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for Literary Excellence in 2004, calling Page &quot;a true Renaissance woman.&quot; Page was also the recipient of the 2004 Terasen Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2006, she was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. She held honorary degrees from University of Victoria (1985), University of Calgary (1989), University of Guelph (1990), Simon Fraser University (1990), University of Toronto (1998), University of Winnipeg (2001), Trent University (2004) and the University of British Columbia (2005).

Artworks by Mimmo Paladino inspired by and incorporating her poetry were installed with Page&#x27;s calligraphy text panels for exhibits in Toronto (Istituto Italiano di Cultura/Italian Government Cultural Office, October 1998), in Victoria, B.C. (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, October 1999) and in Winnipeg (Winnipeg Art Gallery, January 2000). Several of Page&#x27;s poems have been translated into languages other than English. A symposium on her work, &quot;Extraordinary Presence: The Worlds of P.K. Page&quot;, was held in 2002 at Trent University.

Page was a &quot;true Canadian literary and artistic icon,&quot; according to B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell. &quot;As an author, poet, teacher, scriptwriter and painter, P. K. Page was an extraordinary and varied force in promoting and developing Canadian culture. Her efforts helped to set the stage for decades of cultural growth in our nation... It is the passion of people like Patricia that forged our country&#x27;s cultural and artistic identity.&quot;

The National Film Board of Canada dedicated a 38-minute documentary to her career (&quot;Still Waters&quot;, directed by Montrealer Donald Winkler), In a special issue of &quot;The Malahat Review&quot; about Page and her work, Winkler writes about filming Page for the documentary segment on her childhood.

&quot;Coal and Roses&quot;, her last collection, was posthumously shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize.

&quot;Journey with No Maps&quot;, a biography of Page by Sandra Djwa, was published in late 2012 and was a finalist for the 2013 Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction.

==P. K. Page Founders&#x27; Award for Poetry==
A $1,000 poetry prize is awarded annually by the &quot;Malahat Review&quot; in Page&#x27;s name. Its editor, Marilyn Bowering, said, &quot;[Her] accomplishments have been an inspiration to several generations of writers,&quot; and declared that the award, called the P. K. Page Founders&#x27; Award for Poetry, would formalize Page&#x27;s &quot;long association with the &quot;Malahat Review&quot;!&quot;

<text>The Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) is a species of hare highly adapted to living in the Arctic tundra and other icy biomes. The Arctic hare survives with shortened ears and limbs, a small nose, fat that makes up close to 20% of its body, and a thick coat of fur. It usually digs holes in the ground or under the snow to keep warm and to sleep. Arctic hares look like rabbits but have shorter ears, are taller when standing, and, unlike rabbits, can thrive in extreme cold. They can travel together with many other hares, sometimes huddling with dozens or more, but are usually found alone, sometimes taking more than one partner. The Arctic hare can run up to .

== Etymology ==
The Arctic hare is named for the region in which it was first discovered, the Arctic tundra. Its generic name, &quot;Lepus&quot;, is borrowed from Latin and refers to hares, rabbits (as inferred from the earlier Hellenistic Greek (&quot;levirís&quot;), rabbit), and the constellation of the same name. The specific name, &quot;arcticus&quot;, is also borrowed from Latin, and is more directly derived from the Greek (&quot;arktikos&quot;), &quot;near the Bear, northern&quot;.

In the Cree language, the Arctic hare is named , coming from the words for &quot;large&quot;, , and &quot;rabbit&quot;, .

==Taxonomy==

Arctic explorer John Ross described the Arctic hare in 1819.

==Description==
The Arctic hare is one of the largest living lagomorphs. Typically, this species measures from long, not counting a tail length of . The body mass of this species is typically between , though large individuals can weigh up to .

===Subspecies===
There are four subspecies of this hare:
*&quot;Lepus arcticus arcticus&quot;
*&quot;Lepus arcticus bangsii&quot;
*&quot;Lepus arcticus groenlandicus&quot;
*&quot;Lepus arcticus monstrabilis&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
The Arctic hare is distributed over the northernmost regions of Greenland, the Canadian Arctic islands and Northern Canada, including Ellesmere Island, and farther south in Labrador and Newfoundland. The Arctic hare is well adapted to conditions found in the tundras, plateaus, and treeless coasts of this region, including cold weather and frozen precipitation. The Arctic hare may be found at elevations from sea level to .

In Newfoundland and Southern Labrador, the Arctic hare changes its coat color, moulting and growing new fur, from brown or grey in the summer to white in the winter. This seasonal moulting also enables other Arctic animals, including ermine and ptarmigan, to remain camouflaged as the environment changes. However, the Arctic hares in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white all year round.

===Fossil record and history===
Arctic hare fossils are rare prior to the Holocene epoch, with fossils from the Last Glacial Period found in North America (Wisconsin glaciation) and Europe (Würm glaciation) and no fossils from before the Holocene found in Russia. The Arctic hare persevered in refugia during periods of glaciation, which led to its differentiation from the Alaskan hare (&quot;L. othus&quot;) in as each species was separated in different parts of North America. Evidence of the Arctic hare has been found in Greenland from 7,960 years ago, and it has colonized regions across the Bering Strait at least twice.

==Feeding==
The Arctic hare is a herbivore, specifically a folivore. Arctic hares feed primarily on woody plants, with arctic willow constituting 95% of their diet year-round. Arctic hares predominantly consume saxifrage, crowberry, and dwarf willow, but can also eat a variety of other foods, including lichens and mosses, blooms, other species&#x27; leaves, twigs, and roots, mountain sorrel and macroalgae (seaweed). Arctic hare diets are more diverse in summer. Although previously believed to still be primarily willow, dryas, and grasses, recent studies show that their diet becomes dominated by legumes, constituting 70% of their diet in the summer. Arctic hares have been reported to occasionally eat meat, including fish and the stomach contents of eviscerated caribou. They eat snow to get water.

== Physiology ==
The Arctic hare has many physiological features that are adaptive to its extreme environment. Despite a 17% - 38% lower than expected basal metabolic rate, the Arctic hare is able to maintain a body temperature comparable to other lagomorphs (38.9 degrees C) because of its low surface area to volume ratio and high insulation. The lowered metabolic rate also allows the Arctic hare to save energy, making it adaptive for its cold and barren habitat. In addition, the Arctic hare has high locomotive efficiency combined with long periods of resting and shorter bouts of foraging which enables it to conserve energy and survive on its low diet intake.
The white fur of Arctic hares, in addition to their camouflage benefits in the winter, have a high reflectance which may prevent excessive heat gain during the day. Behaviorally, the Arctic hare keeps warm in winter using body orientation, posture, and seeking or digging shelter. When resting, Arctic hares maintain a nearly spherical shape and typically stay in groups, but do not huddle. If the rabbits are solitary, they often rest in the shelter of large rocks protecting them from the wind and staying out of sight of predators. In addition to rocks, Arctic hares also find shelter in other natural shelters such as snowdrifts, man-made structures, and even digging their own burrows in snowdrifts up to 188 cm in length.

The body size of Arctic hares is often significantly less in the winter compared to the summer, likely caused by decreased food quality and availability in addition to a decreased metabolic rate. Arctic hare body mass might also be affected by ambient temperature. At lower latitudes it was found that Arctic hares in Greenland exhibited larger body size with increased temperature, possibly caused by increased energy availability to contribute to body size and increased food plant availability. The opposite is true at higher latitudes in which Arctic hares had smaller body sizes with increased temperature. This trend is again linked to food plant availability. In this case, decreased precipitation and increased temperatures in the higher latitudes of Greenland result in a lower food plant availability to contribute to body mass.

==Reproduction and lifespan==

Breeding season occurs around April or May. Gestation period of the Arctic hare is 53 days, so the babies are born around May, June, or July. Hares can have up to eight babies (average litter size 5.4), called leverets. The leverets stay within the mother&#x27;s home range until they can survive on their own. Young Arctic hares are almost full size by late July (some weeks after birth) and breed for the first time after a year of age.

There is little information on the lifespan of Arctic hares. Some anecdotal evidence suggests they live three to five years in the wild. Arctic hares do not fare well in captivity, living only a year and a half at most.

==Predators==
Known predators of the Arctic hare are the Arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;), Red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), Wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), Lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;), Ermine (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), Snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;), Gyrfalcon (&quot;Falco rusticolus&quot;), Rough-legged hawk (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;) and occasionally humans.

The Arctic wolf is probably the most successful predator of the Arctic hare, and even young wolves in their first autumn can catch adult hares. Arctic foxes and ermines, which are smaller, typically prey on young hares. Gyrfalcon carry hares to their nests, cutting them in half first; gyrfalcons use hare bones and feet in the structure of their nests on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut. Peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) also prey on Arctic hares in the southern end of the hares&#x27; range. The snowy owls mainly target young hares; the French common name of the species derives from Anglo-Saxon &quot;harfang&quot; (&quot;hare-catcher&quot;).

Four groups of parasites have been known to use Arctic hares as a host: protozoans (&quot;Eimeria exigua&quot;, &quot;Eimeria magna&quot;, &quot;Eimeria perforans&quot;, and &quot;Eimeria sculpta&quot;); nematodes (including &quot;Filaria&quot; and &quot;Oxyuris ambigua&quot;); lice (including &quot;Haemodipsus lyriocephalus&quot; and &quot;Haemodipsus setoni&quot;) and fleas (including &quot;Euhoplopsyllus glacialis&quot; and &quot;Megabothris groenlandicus&quot;). Fleas are more common than parasitic worms.

<doc id="291188" wikidata="Q225845" url="?curid=291188" title="Kiya">
<text>Kiya was one of the wives of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten. Little is known about her, and her actions and roles are poorly documented in the historical record, in contrast to those of Akhenaten&#x27;s &#x27;Great royal wife&#x27;, Nefertiti. Her unusual name suggests that she may originally have been a Mitanni princess. Surviving evidence demonstrates that Kiya was an important figure at Akhenaten&#x27;s court during the middle years of his reign, when she had a daughter with him. She disappears from history a few years before her royal husband&#x27;s death. In previous years, she was thought to be mother of Tutankhamun, but recent DNA evidence suggests this is unlikely.

== Name and titles ==
The name Kiya itself is cause for debate. It has been suggested that it is a &quot;pet&quot; form, rather than a full name, and as such could be a contraction of a foreign name, such as the Mitanni name &quot;Tadukhipa,&quot; referring to the daughter of King Tushratta. Tadukhipa married Amenhotep III at the very end of his reign, and the Amarna Letters indicate that she was of marriageable age at that time. In particular, Amarna Letters 27 through 29 confirm that Tadukhipa became one of Akhenaten&#x27;s wives. Thus some Egyptologists have proposed that Tadukhipa and Kiya might be the same person.

However, there is no confirming evidence that Kiya was anything but a native Egyptian. In fact, Cyril Aldred proposed that her unusual name is actually a variant of the Ancient Egyptian word for &quot;monkey,&quot; making it unnecessary to assume a foreign origin for her.

In inscriptions, Kiya is given the titles of &quot;The Favorite&quot; and &quot;The Greatly Beloved,&quot; but never of &quot;Heiress&quot; or &quot;Great Royal Wife&quot;, which suggests that she was not of royal Egyptian blood. Her full titles read, &quot;The wife and greatly beloved of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Living in Truth, Lord of the Two Lands, Neferkheperure Waenre, the Goodly Child of the Living Aten, who shall be living for ever and ever, Kiya.&quot; All artifacts relating to Kiya derive from Amarna, Akhenaten&#x27;s short-lived capital city, or from Tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. She is not attested during the reign of any other pharaoh.

Kiya&#x27;s existence was unknown until 1959, when her name and titles were noted on a small cosmetic container in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It had been bought almost thirty years previously, without provenance, from Egyptologist Howard Carter.

The British Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton wrote:
:Kiya is named and depicted on various blocks originating at Amarna, on vases in London and New York, four fragmentary kohl-tubes in Berlin and London, and a wine-jar docket. She may also be depicted by three uninscribed sculptor&#x27;s studies. Her coffin and canopic jars were taken over for the burial of a king (probably Smenkhkare), which was ultimately discovered in tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. Almost all of Kiya&#x27;s monuments were usurped for daughters of Akhenaten, making it fairly certain that she was disgraced some time after Year 11 [of Akhenaten].

Akhenaten and his family were based in Thebes for the first four years of his reign, establishing the new capital city at Amarna in Year 5. Kiya is not attested during this early period. Only after the move to Amarna does she emerge through inscriptional evidence as one of Akhenaten&#x27;s wives.
Kiya&#x27;s name appeared prominently in the temple installation known as the Maru-Aten, at the southern edge of the city, according to epigraphic studies. The inscriptions in the Maru-Aten were eventually recarved to replace the name and titles of Kiya with those of Akhenaten&#x27;s eldest daughter, Meritaten.

One or more &quot;sunshades&quot; or side-chapels in the city&#x27;s largest temple to the Aten, the Per-Aten, also originally bore the name of Kiya. These sunshades were later reinscribed for Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten, the third daughter of Akhenaten. Some of the recarved inscriptions indicate that Kiya had a daughter, whose name is not preserved. Marc Gabolde proposes that Kiya&#x27;s daughter was Beketaten, who is more often identified as a daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiye.

The most spectacular of Kiya&#x27;s monuments is a gilded wooden coffin of costly and intricate workmanship that was discovered in Tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. The coffin&#x27;s footboard contains an Atenist prayer that was originally intended for a woman, but was later revised to a refer to a man – with enough grammatical errors to betray the gender of the original speaker. The style of the coffin and the language of its surviving inscriptions place its manufacture in the reign of Akhenaten. Scholarly opinion now makes Kiya its original owner. The richness of this coffin, which is comparable in style to the middle coffin of Tutankhamun, provides further evidence of Kiya&#x27;s exalted status at Amarna.

Many Egyptologists have tried to produce an explanation for her prominence. Numerous scholarly discussions of Tutankhamun&#x27;s parentage during the late twentieth century, and the early years of the twenty-first, have mentioned the hypothesis that Kiya was Tutankhamun&#x27;s mother. If she had indeed borne a male heir to Akhenaten, this distinction might well merit unique honors. However, genetic studies of the Egyptian royal mummies, led by Zahi Hawass and Carsten Pusch, have now established that Tutankhamun&#x27;s biological mother was KV35YL, the &quot;Younger Lady&quot; discovered in the mummy cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II.

== Disgrace or death? ==
Kiya disappears from history during the last third of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. Her name and images were erased from monuments and replaced by those of Akhenaten&#x27;s daughters. The exact year of her disappearance is unknown, with recent authorities suggesting dates that range from Year 11 or 12 to Year 16 of Akhenaten. One of the last datable instances of her name is a wine docket from Amarna that mentions Akhenaten&#x27;s Year 11, indicating that Kiya&#x27;s estate produced a vintage in that year. Whether she died, was exiled, or suffered some other misfortune, Egyptologists have often interpreted the erasure of her name as a sign of disgrace.

Various scenarios have been advanced to explain Kiya&#x27;s disappearance. Having suggested that Kiya was the mother of Tutankhamun, Nicholas Reeves writes that &quot;it is not beyond the realm of possibility that she fell from grace in a coup engineered by the jealous Nefertiti herself.&quot; Having argued that Kiya was Tadukhipa, daughter of the King of Mitanni, Marc Gabolde suggests that she &quot;paid the price&quot; for a deterioration in the alliance between Egypt and Mitanni and was sent back home.

It is uncertain whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, the answer would be no. On the other hand, if she died in good standing with Akhenaten, she probably would have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten&#x27;s family. At least two and possibly as many as three different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten&#x27;s daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.

Further, the conventional interpretation of the mourning scenes is that they represent the death in childbirth of the deceased, although this view has recently been challenged. The conventional interpretation has encouraged speculation that Kiya died bearing Akhenaten a child, but again, no clear-cut evidence is available.

== KV35 &quot;Younger Lady&quot; mummy ==
Some have speculated that the mummy known as the Younger Lady, discovered in KV35, might be that of Kiya. According to Joann Fletcher (who controversially identified the mummy as Nefertiti) a Nubian-style wig was found near the mummy. This style was also associated with Kiya.

DNA test results published in February 2010 have shown conclusively that the Younger Lady mummy was the mother of Tutankhamun, and by extension a wife of Akhenaten. The results also show that she was a full sister to her husband, and that they were both the children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. This family relationship rules out the possibility that the Younger Lady was Kiya, because no known artifact accords Kiya the title or attribute &quot;god&#x27;s daughter.&quot; For similar reasons Nefertiti is also ruled out. The report concludes that either Nebetah or Beketaten, younger daughters of Amenhotep III who are not known to have married their father, are the most likely candidates for the identity of the Younger Lady mummy.

<text>War Plan Red, also known as the Atlantic Strategic War Plan, was one of the color-coded war plans created by the United States Department of War during the interwar period of 1919–1939, covering scenarios related to a hypothetical war with the British Empire (the &quot;Red&quot; forces, likely in reference to the Red Ensign). Many different war plans were prepared by mid-level officers primarily as training exercises in how to calculate the logistical and manpower requirements of fighting a war, and War Plan Red outlined those steps necessary to defend against any attempted invasion of the United States by British forces. It further discussed fighting a two-front war with both Japan and Great Britain simultaneously (as envisioned in War Plan Red-Orange).

War Plan Red was developed by the War Department after the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference, and approved in May 1930 by Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley and Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III and updated in 1934–35. It was a routine hypothetical exercise that neither required nor received presidential or congressional approval.

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it was decided that no further preparations would be made but the plans were to be retained. War Plan Red was not declassified until 1974.

The war plan outlined actions that would be necessary if, for any reason, the US and UK went to war with each other. The plan assumed that the British would initially have the upper hand by virtue of the strength of the Royal Navy. The plan further assumed that Britain would probably use its base in Canada as a springboard from which to initiate an invasion of the United States. The assumption was taken that at first, the US would fight a defensive battle against invading British forces, but the US would eventually defeat the British by blockading Canada&#x27;s ports and cutting off its food supplies. It is debated whether this would have been successful, however, and if the plan would have ultimately resulted in a stalemate.

==Outline==

War Plan Red first set out a description of Canada&#x27;s geography, military resources, and transportation and went on to evaluate a series of possible pre-emptive American campaigns to invade Canada in several areas and occupy key ports and railways before British troops could provide reinforcement to the Canadians—the assumption being that Britain would use Canada as a staging point. The idea was that US attacks on Canada would prevent Britain from using Canadian resources, ports, or airbases.
A key move was a joint US Army-Navy attack to capture the port city of Halifax, cutting off the Canadians from their British allies. Their next objective was to &quot;seize Canadian Power Plants near Niagara Falls.&quot; This was to be followed by a full-scale invasion on three fronts: from Vermont to take Montreal and Quebec, from North Dakota to take over the railhead at Winnipeg, and from the Midwest to capture the strategic nickel mines of Ontario. In parallel, the US Navy was to seize the Great Lakes and blockade Canada&#x27;s Atlantic and Pacific ports.

===Zones of operation===
The main zones of operation discussed in the plan are:
* Nova Scotia and New Brunswick:
** The first strike with poison gas against the port city of Halifax was used to seize it, preventing the Royal Navy from using the naval base there, and cutting the undersea cable through Halifax, severing the connection between Britain and Canada.
** The plan considers several land and sea options for the attack and concludes that a landing at St. Margarets Bay, then an undeveloped bay near Halifax, would be superior to a direct assault via the longer overland route.
** Failing to take Halifax, the US could occupy New Brunswick by land to cut Nova Scotia off from the rest of Canada at the key railway junction in Moncton.
* Quebec and the valley of the Saint Lawrence River:
** Occupying Montreal and Quebec City would cut the remainder of Canada off from the Eastern seaboard, preventing the movement of troops and resources in both directions.
** The routes from northern New York to Montreal and from Vermont to Quebec are both found satisfactory for an offensive, with Quebec being the more critical target.
* Ontario and the Great Lakes area:
** Occupying this region gains control of Toronto and most of Canada&#x27;s industry and prevent Britain and Canada from using it for air or land attacks against the US industrial heartland in the Midwest.
** The plan proposes simultaneous offensives from Buffalo across the Niagara River, from Detroit across the Detroit River into Windsor, and from Sault Ste. Marie across the St. Mary&#x27;s River into Sudbury. Controlling the Great Lakes for US transport is considered logistically necessary for a continued invasion.
* Winnipeg
** Winnipeg is a central nexus of the Canadian rail system for connecting the country.
** The plan saw no major obstacles to an offensive from Grand Forks, North Dakota, to Winnipeg.
* Vancouver and Victoria:
** Although Vancouver&#x27;s distance from Europe reduces its importance, occupying it would deny Britain a naval base and cut Canada off from the Pacific Ocean.
** Vancouver could be easily attacked overland from Bellingham, Washington, and Vancouver Island could be attacked by sea from Port Angeles, Washington.
** The British Columbia port Prince Rupert has a rail connection to the rest of Canada, but a naval blockade is viewed as easy if Vancouver was taken.

===No attacks outside Western Hemisphere first===
Unlike the Rainbow Five plan, War Plan Red did not envision striking outside the Western Hemisphere first. Its authors saw conquering Canada as the best way to attack Britain and believed that doing so would cause London to negotiate for peace. A major problem with the plan was that it did not consider how to attack Britain if Canada were to declare its neutrality, which the authors believed was likely (the plan advised against accepting such a declaration without permission to occupy Canadian ports and some land until the war ended). The U.S. decided it should focus on the North American and Atlantic theater of operations first while leaving its Pacific outposts of the Philippines, Guam, and American Samoa alone to fend off any British, Australian, and New Zealander attacks during the early stages of the conflict.

Based on extensive war games conducted at the Naval War College, the plan rejected attacking British shipping or attempting to destroy the British fleet. The main American fleet would instead stay in the western North Atlantic to block British–Canadian traffic. The Navy would wait for a good opportunity to engage the British fleet and, if successful, would then attack British trade and colonies in the Western Hemisphere.

In 1935, War Plan Red was updated and specified which roads to use in the invasion. &quot;The best practicable route to Vancouver is via Route 99.&quot;

American war planners had no thoughts of returning captured British territory: &quot;The policy will be to prepare the provinces and territories of CRIMSON and RED to become U.S. state and territories of the BLUE union upon the declaration of peace.&quot; The planners feared that should they lose the war with Britain, America would be forced to relinquish its territories to the victors, such as losing Alaska (then an organized incorporated territory) to Canada as part of the peace treaty: &quot;It is probable that, in case RED should be successful in the war, CRIMSON will demand that Alaska be awarded to her.&quot;

==British strategy for war against the United States==
The British military never prepared a formal plan for war with the United States during the first half of the 20th century. For instance, the government of David Lloyd George in 1919 restricted the Royal Navy from building more ships to compete with American naval growth and thereby preventing the plan&#x27;s development. Like their US counterparts, most British military officers viewed cooperation with the United States as the best way to maintain world peace due to the shared culture, language, and goals, although they feared that attempts to regulate trade during a war with another nation might force a war with the US.

The British military generally believed that if war did occur, they could transport troops to Canada if asked, but nonetheless saw it as impossible to defend Canada against the much larger United States, so did not plan to render aid, as Canada&#x27;s loss would not be fatal to Britain. An October 1919 memo by the British Admiralty stated if they did send British troops to Canada,

...the Empire would be committed to an unlimited land war against the U.S.A., with all advantages of time, distance and supply on the side of the U.S.A.

A full invasion of the United States was unrealistic and a naval blockade would be too slow. The Royal Navy could not use a defensive strategy of waiting for the American fleet to cross the Atlantic because Imperial trade would be left too vulnerable. Royal Navy officers believed that Britain was vulnerable to a supply blockade and that if a larger American fleet appeared near the British Isles, the Isles might quickly surrender. The officers planned to, instead, attack the American fleet from a Western Hemisphere base, likely Bermuda, while other ships based in Canada and the West Indies would attack American shipping and protect Imperial trade. The British would also bombard coastal bases and make small amphibious assaults. Colonial forces from India and Australia would help capture Manila to prevent American attacks on British trade in the Far East and perhaps a conquest of Hong Kong. The officers hoped that such acts would result in a stalemate making continued war unpopular in the United States, followed by a negotiated peace.

Canadian military officer Lieutenant Colonel James &quot;Buster&quot; Sutherland Brown developed an earlier counterpart to War Plan Red, Defence Scheme No. 1, on April 12, 1921. Maintaining that the best defense was a good offense, Brown planned for rapid deployment of flying columns to occupy Seattle, Great Falls, Minneapolis, and Albany. With little hope of holding the objectives, the actual idea was to divert American troops to the flanks and away from Canada, hopefully long enough for British and Commonwealth allies to arrive with reinforcements. Defence Scheme No. 1 was terminated by Chief of the General Staff Andrew McNaughton in 1928, two years before the approval of War Plan Red.

<doc id="291194" wikidata="Q1506969" url="?curid=291194" title="Lost Cities">
<text>Lost Cities is a 60-card card game, designed in 1999 by game designer Reiner Knizia and published by several publishers. The objective of the game is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five lost cities (the Himalayas, the Brazilian Rain Forest, the Desert Sands, the Ancient Volcanos and Neptune&#x27;s Realm). The game was originally intended as a 2-player game, but rule variants have been contributed by fans to allow 1 or 2 further players, causing Reiner Knizia himself to later provide semi-official 4-player rules.

== Summary ==

&quot;Lost Cities&quot; is a fast-moving game, with players playing or discarding, and then replacing, a single card each turn. Cards represent progress on one of the five color-coded expeditions. Players must decide, during the course of the game, how many of these expeditions to actually embark upon. Card-play rules are quite straightforward, but because players can only move forward on an expedition (by playing cards which are higher-numbered than those already played), making the right choice in a given game situation can be quite difficult. An expedition that has been started will earn points according to how much progress has been made when the game ends, and after three rounds, the player with the highest total score wins the game. Each expedition that is started but not thoroughly charted incurs a negative point penalty (investment costs).

Interaction between players is indirect, in that one cannot directly impact another player&#x27;s expeditions. However, since players can draw from the common discard piles, they are free to make use of opposing discards. Additionally, since the available cards for a given expedition are finite, progress made by an opponent in a given color can lead to difficulty making progress in that same color.

The game&#x27;s board, while designed to supplement the theme, is optional and consists only of simple marked areas where players place discards. If &quot;Lost Cities&quot; had four expeditions instead of five, it could be played with a standard deck of playing cards. When doing so, the face cards would represent investment cards, with numbered cards two through ten serving as the expedition progress cards.

===Expedition 6: The Lost Expedition===
At GenCon 2016, The Lost Cities: Sixth Expedition promo pack was given away. It contains a set of grey cards that are added to the base game as an additional expedition. The sixth expedition has the same rules as the other five. 

In 2018, some newer international versions of Lost Cities were expected to also include Expedition 6 as well as two-sided boards. One side with five expeditions, the other side with six. Starting from 2019, the game now includes this extra expedition, for a total of six colored suits with a two-sided board.

== Awards ==
* Won the 2000 International Gamers Award.

== Lost Cities: The Board Game ==
The 2008 game Keltis was re-themed and published in the U.S. as Lost Cities: The Board Game. The game supports up to four players and is a more complex version of the original card game.

== Xbox Live Arcade ==
&quot;Lost Cities&quot; was published by Sierra Online for the Xbox Live Arcade platform on April 23, 2008. The title supports both online play against other humans and solo play against computer-controlled opponents. It was delisted on 20 February 2009 after a merger between Activision and Vivendi. It is currently not available for purchase.

<text>Pekka Himanen (born 19 October 1973) is a Finnish philosopher.

==Professional career==

Pekka Himanen studied philosophy (and computer science as a minor) at the University of Helsinki, under professor Esa Saarinen. In 1994, with his thesis on the philosophy of religion, &quot;The challenge of Bertrand Russell&quot;, he received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the same university, breaking the record as the youngest person to obtain a PhD in Finland, following other record-breaking young PhDs supervised by Saarinen.

He has done research work in Finland (University of Helsinki), the United Kingdom (University of Oxford), and the United States (Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley). At UC Berkeley, Himanen directed the Berkeley Center for the Information Society, a research group under Berkeley&#x27;s International Computer Science Institute. The Center was active from September 2002 until 2005.

Himanen has been a counselor to the president of Finland, Finnish government (including the Ministry of Education) and Finnish parliament, in the field of information society.

He was a visiting professor at the Oxford Internet Institute (based at Oxford University) from September 2005 to July 2006.

Himanen had multiple appointments as a fixed-term part-time professor at Helsinki School of Art and Design (now part of Aalto University as Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture) from 2008 until 2014.

==Writings==

In his book &quot;HimEros&quot; written as a dialogue, Socrates’ wife Xanthippe relates to the Helsinkian what happened to Socrates in Hades, how Socrates decided to escape from Hades and go to study philosophy at the University of Helsinki, and how he was arrested, sentenced to death and executed as a result of a three-day conversation with the philosophers of the University. Xanthippe also transmits Socrates’ dialogue with the university teachers of philosophy Cyborg (Stephen Hawking), Pope (John Paul II), Unabomber (Theodore Kaczynski) and Madonna (Madonna Ciccone).

In &quot;The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age&quot;, Himanen is trying to understand the core of informationalism, the post-industrialist paradigm, extending the ideas of Manuel Castells&#x27; &quot;Information Age&quot;. As an alternative to the industrial-capitalist protestant work ethic he proposes a hacker ethic as something like a cyber communitarianism. The structure of the information society is a web, which in contemporary business world manifests itself, for instance, in dynamic outsourcing and even cooperation with one&#x27;s competitors. The &quot;knots&quot; of such a web get activated according to the needs and opportunities.

==Global Dignity==

In 2006, he established Global Dignity with Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway and John Hope Bryant. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life.

==Criticism and negative publicity==

Two Finnish journalists, Anu Silfverberg and Johanna Vehkoo, published a critical investigation of Himanen&#x27;s research funding from public sources, the outcomes of his research, as well as his use of the title of &quot;professor&quot; without holding a professorship. The investigation followed the critical reception of Himanen&#x27;s recent research reports on information society done under contract with the Finnish government, and reports of disorderly conduct in public places while intoxicated.

<doc id="291203" wikidata="Q1058375" url="?curid=291203" title="Double agent">
<text>In the field of counterintelligence, a double agent is an employee of a secret intelligence service for one country, whose primary purpose is to spy on a target organization of another country, but who is now spying on their own country&#x27;s organization for the target organization.

Double agentry may be practiced by spies of the target organization who infiltrate the controlling organization or may result from the &quot;turning&quot; (switching sides) of previously loyal agents of the controlling organization by the target. The threat of execution is the most common method of turning a captured agent (working for an intelligence service) into a double agent (working for a foreign intelligence service) or a double agent into a &quot;re-doubled agent&quot;. It is unlike a defector, who is not considered an agent as agents are in place to function for an intelligence service and defectors are not, but some consider that defectors in place are agents until they have defected.

Double agents are often used to transmit disinformation or to identify other agents as part of counter-espionage operations. They are often very trusted by the controlling organization since the target organization will give them true, but useless or even counterproductive, information to pass along.

==Double agents==
==Re-doubled agent==
A re-doubled agent is an agent who gets caught as a double agent and is forced to mislead the foreign intelligence service. F.M. Begoum describes the re-doubled agent as &quot;one whose duplicity in doubling for another service has been detected by his original sponsor and who has been persuaded to reverse his affections again&quot;.
* Vitaly Yurchenko

==Triple agent==

A triple agent is a spy who pretends to be a double agent for one side while they are truthfully a double agent for the other side. Unlike a re-doubled agent, who changes allegiance due to being compromised, a triple agent usually has always been loyal to their original side. It may also refer to a spy who works for three opposing sides, such that each side thinks the spy works for them alone.

Notable triple agents include:

*Abdul Razak Hussein
*Ibrahim Ismail
*Humam Khalil
*Katrina Leung

==Events in which double agents played an important role==
* Babington plot
* Battle of Lexington
* Battle of Normandy
* Camp Chapman attack
* Cold War
* Duquesne Spy Ring
* Gukurahundi
* Stormontgate
* Vietnam War
* War on Terrorism
* Yom Kippur War

<text>Michelangelo Signorile (; born December 19, 1960) is an American journalist, author and talk radio host. His radio program is aired each weekday across the United States and Canada on Sirius XM Radio and globally online. Signorile was editor-at-large for HuffPost from 2011 until 2019. Signorile is a political liberal, and covers a wide variety of political and cultural issues.

Signorile is noted for his various books and articles on gay and lesbian politics, and is an outspoken supporter of gay rights. Signorile&#x27;s seminal 1993 book &quot;Queer in America: Sex, The Media, and the Closets of Power&quot; explored the negative effects of the LGBT closet, and provided one of the first intellectual justifications for the practice of outing public officials, influencing the debate and treatment of the issue among journalists from that point on. In 1992 &quot;Newsweek&quot; listed him as one of America&#x27;s &quot;100 Cultural Elite,&quot; and he is included as #100 in the 2002 book, &quot;The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present&quot;.

In August 2011, Signorile was inducted into the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association LGBT Journalist Hall of Fame. In November 2012, Signorile was included in the &quot;Out&quot; magazine annual Out 100. In April 2015, Signorile&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over: Getting Beyond Tolerance, Defeating Homophobia and Winning True Equality&quot;, was published.

== Early years ==
Signorile was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent his early childhood in the 1960s and 1970s in Brooklyn and Staten Island. He attended the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, where he majored in journalism. It was in those years that he came to realize his own homosexuality, but remained closeted to many friends and to family.

In the mid-1980s, shortly after graduating from college, Signorile moved to Manhattan. Among his first jobs, he worked for an entertainment public relations firm that specialized in &quot;column-planting&quot;, a term for getting clients into New York City&#x27;s gossip columns, such as Page Six in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and Liz Smith, then at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. This required collecting and trading in gossip, often about celebrities&#x27; private lives. Later, he became a gossip columnist himself. It was in that world, as Signorile describes in his book &quot;Queer in America&quot;, where he saw a double standard regarding how the media glamorized heterosexuality among celebrities while covering up homosexuality. But Signorile was not political at the time. He was somewhat open about his own homosexuality by that time, but he had not looked at it in the broader context of politics and culture in America. His political awakening came as the AIDS epidemic expanded in the late 1980s and more friends were getting sick and dying.

== Activism ==
In his book &quot;Queer in America&quot; and in numerous articles and interviews, Signorile has discussed how he began to see that many in the media, among his circles as well, were either sensationalizing AIDS in the 1980s or running away from it. He also began to believe the government was negligent in the face of the epidemic.

Signorile became a gay activist in 1988, after attending a meeting of the controversial grass roots protest group, ACT UP, in New York. Within days of the meeting he was arrested at a protest at St. Peter&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church at the Citigroup Center, where the Vatican&#x27;s envoy and the author of much of the Vatican&#x27;s recent positions against homosexuality, gay rights and the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was to give a major speech. (Ratzinger would go on to become Pope Benedict XVI, succeeding Pope John Paul II upon his death in April 2005.) Signorile has explained that he went to the event solely to watch the protesters who were planning on standing up among the attendees and letting their voices be heard. But he became filled with rage while hearing Ratzinger speak, thinking about the homophobia he&#x27;d experienced as a child and the Catholic Church&#x27;s decrees. (He was raised as a Roman Catholic.) &quot;Suddenly,&quot; Signorile wrote in &quot;Queer in America&quot; about the protest, &quot;I jumped up on one of the marble platforms, and looking down, I addressed the entire congregation in the loudest voice I could. My voice rang out as if it were amplified. I pointed at Ratzinger and shouted, &#x27;He is no man of God!&#x27; The shocked faces of the assembled Catholics turned to the back of the room to look at me as I continued: &#x27;He is no man of God. He is the devil!&#x27;&quot; Signorile was pulled down, handcuffed, and carted off by the police.

Signorile soon became the chair of the media committee of ACT UP, organizing publicity for major, theatrical AIDS activist protests of the time, and taking on the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, New York&#x27;s City Hall and other government agencies in the media, criticizing them for what AIDS activists saw as their foot-dragging while people were dying. Though controversial, ACT UP and its tactics have been credited with bringing more attention to AIDS among politicians and the media, and speeding the development and approval of HIV drugs in the 1990s. Signorile also was a co-founding member, along with three other ACT UP members, of the in-your-face activist group Queer Nation.

In May 2017, Signorile was criticized for an article that appeared on the Huffington Post. In the piece, he attacked Donald Trump and the Republican legislators supporting his agenda, stating that no Republican congressman &quot;should be able to sit down for a nice, quiet lunch or dinner in a Washington, DC, eatery or even in their own homes&quot;, and &quot;should be hounded by protestors everywhere, especially in public ― in restaurants, in shopping centers, in their districts, and yes, on the public property outside their homes and apartments&quot;.

==The outing controversy==
Signorile has been considered a pioneer of outing (though he believes the discussion has often been distorted by the media, and he opposes using a violent, active verb to define the phenomenon). Signorile has argued in favor of outing from a journalistic perspective, calling for the &quot;equalization&quot; of reporting on gay and straight public figures. He has argued that the homosexuality of public figures—and only public figures—should be reported on when relevant. Signorile was a co-founding editor of the gay magazine &quot;OutWeek&quot;, which launched in June 1989, and which was quickly at the center of heated debates inside and outside the gay community, including controversies over outing. Signorile became the features editor at &quot;OutWeek,&quot; and eventually stopped working within ACT UP and Queer Nation, though, like most of the staff of &quot;OutWeek&quot;, he maintained deep ties to both groups.

Signorile saw his role at &quot;OutWeek&quot; as one of taking on the media and the entertainment industry. From the start of the magazine he wrote a weekly column called &quot;Gossip Watch,&quot; which was just that—a watch of the gossip columns. He began writing about the media&#x27;s double standard in reporting on gay and straight public figures, and how he believed it made gays invisible in the midst of the health crisis. Among those whom Signorile outed at that time included Hollywood producer David Geffen (who has long since acknowledged that he is gay). Geffen, as a record producer, was promoting Guns N&#x27; Roses, a rock group which had been attacked for antigay lyrics (&quot;...faggots...spread some fuckin&#x27; disease&quot;) and other performers, such as comedian Andrew Dice Clay, whose comedy routines in the late 1980s were seen by many as homophobic and misogynistic. Clay had said in a 1984 stand-up act that in Hollywood they have &quot;herpes, AIDS and fag-itis.&quot; Clay has also mocked pleas for AIDS funding (&quot;get a job, buttfucka&quot;), and used antigay slurs; &quot;they don&#x27;t know if they want to be called gays, homosexuals, fairies,&quot; he has said. &quot;I call them cocksuckers.&quot; Signorile saw it as relevant to discuss Geffen&#x27;s closeted homosexuality in that context. Signorile also outed the gossip columnist Liz Smith (who also eventually acknowledged her bisexuality), whom he maintained helped celebrities and others to present themselves as heterosexual when they were in fact gay.

The media and celebrity culture that Signorile vilified took notice of his work. The chic fashion industry bible, &quot;W&quot; magazine, put OutWeek on the &quot;In&quot; list, calling it a &quot;must-read&quot; because of its mix of &quot;culture, politics and vicious gossip&quot; (&quot;Queer in America&quot;, p. 73), and Signorile would eventually be profiled in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; and in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Signorile was both praised and attacked for his column. He was called &quot;one of the greater contemporary gay heroes,&quot; while his work was also called &quot;revolting, infantile, cheap name-calling&quot; (Johansson &amp; Percy, p. 183). New York Post columnist Amy Pagnozzi compared him to the right-wing, anti-communist 1950s senator, Joseph McCarthy, in a column headlined &quot;Magazine Drags Gays Out of the Closet&quot; (&quot;Queer in America&quot;, p. 73). It was &quot;Time&quot; that coined the term &quot;outing&quot; at that time, something Signorile has always contended was a biased term. He saw what he was doing as simply &quot;reporting.&quot;

The outing controversy became much larger in March 1990, when Signorile wrote a cover story for &quot;OutWeek&quot; revealing the homosexuality of the publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes within weeks of his death, headlined &quot;The Other Side of Malcolm Forbes.&quot; In a subsequent article in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Signorile charged a media cover-up of his &quot;Forbes&quot; story, claiming that various news outlets were going to report on it, but later decided against it. Eventually, over a period of months, the story was reported in several news outlets, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; still refused to name Forbes, only referring to him as &quot;a recently deceased businessman&quot; who was outed. (It wasn&#x27;t until five years later, during coverage of Forbes&#x27; son Steve&#x27;s run for the Republican nomination for president in 1996, that the &quot;Times&quot; reported on Malcolm Forbes&#x27; gay life.)

OutWeek folded in June 1991. Signorile joined &quot;The Advocate&quot; with a cover story several months later that put him at the center of a firestorm over gays in the military as well as outing: he outed Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Pete Williams (Williams has since gone on to become a television journalist for NBC News). The outing caused Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to call the gay ban &quot;an old chestnut&quot; during an interview with Sam Donaldson on ABC, while then presidential candidate Bill Clinton, citing the outing, promised at a gay fundraiser to overturn the ban if he were elected president.

== Gay culture debates ==
Signorile wrote columns and feature stories for &quot;The Advocate&quot; for several years, including the groundbreaking two-part cover story &quot;Out at The New York Times&quot;—in which the paper&#x27;s gay and lesbian staffers, its top editors and its then-new publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., spoke for the first time, to Signorile, about years of homophobia at the paper of record and how they were charting a new course. In 1994, Signorile left the Advocate for the then new glossy, Out magazine, which was founded by his friend and &quot;OutWeek&quot; colleague Michael Goff and former &quot;OutWeek&quot; editor Sarah Pettit. In 1995 Signorile published his second book, &quot;Outing Yourself&quot;, a 14-step program for coming out as gay or lesbian.

At that time, as an &quot;Out&quot; magazine columnist and editor-at-large, Signorile soon was at the center of often-heated debates among gay activists, sexual liberationists and HIV prevention experts about gay male sexual culture and the prevalence of unsafe sex and HIV transmission. Signorile wrote a column for &quot;Out&quot; that sparked much discussion, titled &quot;Unsafe Like Me,&quot; in which he addressed the issue by admitting to have slipped up himself, having had an incident of unprotected sex, and discussed what may have led someone like him—a prominent AIDS activist, immersed in the issues of prevention—to have such a lapse. The column was adapted to the op-ed page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and inspired a CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; treatment of the issue in which Signorile was profiled. Signorile followed up that column with several others that focused on what he saw as some unhealthy aspects of gay culture that contributed to low self-esteem and risk-taking. This eventually grew into his 1997 bestseller &quot;Life Outside: The Signorile Report on Gay Men: Sex, Drugs, Muscles and the Passages of Life&quot;, which was a finalist for the New York Public Library Book Award for Excellence in Journalism. The columns and the book created controversy among some activists; Signorile was criticized by the group Sex Panic! which believed that he and other writers had inspired government crack-downs on gay sex through their writings. Many other commentators and activists disagreed with Signorile&#x27;s critics, and fierce debates broke out in both gay and mainstream media. Signorile also inspired much discussion and debate with pieces in Out on anti-abortion gays, animals rights vs. medical research, gay marriage and high-profile antigay hate crimes.

In August 1998, Signorile left &quot;Out&quot; magazine abruptly in a disagreement with the new editor James Collard. Former &quot;Out&quot; editor and co-founder, the late Sarah Pettit, a long-time colleague of Signorile&#x27;s who was also an editor at &quot;OutWeek&quot;, had been ousted from &quot;Out&quot; that year in a shake up (Michael Goff had been pushed out earlier) in which she had charged sex discrimination. The new editor, from the UK, had been a promoter of the &quot;post-gay&quot; sensibility, which seemed to eschew activism. According to Signorile, speaking to gay journalist Rex Wockner, Collard wanted him to tone down his writing. &quot;We had a heated discussion and he insulted my sensibilities and it made me so angry I threw water in his face,&quot; Signorile told Wockner. &quot;They did not want me to write biting commentary and opinion. They wanted me to do more feature-driven work and I refused to do that because my column in &quot;Out&quot; has always been a space where I could do commentary, political analysis, features, whatever I wanted. I think it&#x27;s important to have commentary and solidly researched journalism in the same forum.&quot;

== The radio years ==
Several months after leaving &quot;Out&quot;, Signorile joined &quot;The Advocate&quot; once again, in December 1998, as a columnist and editor-at-large; his first article was a cover piece taking on the notion of a &quot;post-gay&#x27; society as espoused by &quot;Out&quot; editor Collard. (Within a year after Collard took the post and six months after Signorile left &quot;Out&quot;, Collard left &quot;Out&quot; amid reports of a drop in circulation and negative response of a focus group to the magazine.) In 2000, Signorile left &quot;The Advocate&quot; again, and became a columnist for global Internet site Gay.com, which had just merged with the pioneering LGBT site PlanetOut.com. Signorile traveled around the U.S. and around the world, writing online columns. He covered the controversy surrounding the Millennium March on Washington for LGBT Rights, which divided many in the community regarding its time and purpose and at which a theft occurred at the festival. Signorile reported from Australia and New Zealand, where his partner had taken a position as a professor, and reported on World Pride in Rome in 2000, where activists butted heads with the Vatican, which tried to get the event canceled. During that time Signorile also pioneered Internet radio, webcasting a weekly show on GAYBC.com beginning in 2000, covering the global LGBT community. In an interview, he has described a machine called a &quot;vector&quot; that he would plug into a phone outlet and which allowed him to webcast live via Gaybc&#x27;s studios in Seattle.(Media Bistro Q &amp; A with Signorile 2002)

In April 2003, Signorile began hosting a radio program, &quot;The Michelangelo Signorile Show&quot;, on Sirius XM Radio&#x27;s OutQ each weekday 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time. OutQ, as the only 24/7 LGBT radio channel, broke new ground and Signorile&#x27;s interviews and monologues often made news . After a little over 10 years, on July 23, 2013, he moved to the newly launched SiriusXM Progress (channel 127) from 3 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time. The show airs on satellite radio across North America and is streamed worldwide on the Internet and to the Android, BlackBerry, and iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) handheld devices to over 25 million Sirius XM subscribers. Signorile interviews politicians, activists, journalists, authors and other public figures, analyzes news and cultural events, and takes calls from listeners from coast-to-coast. Signorile&#x27;s show is one of the highest rated programs on the Sirius XM network with an average daily listenership of more than 8.5 million households. 
Often, Signorile brings on those who are on America&#x27;s right-wing or are opponents of gay rights, with whom he engages in energetic debates. He is also editor-at-large for The Huffington Post Queer Voices where he blogs opinion pieces and interviews public figures.

Signorile has been an editor-at-large and columnist for &quot;The Advocate&quot;, and an editor-at-large and a columnist for &quot;Out&quot; magazine. He has written for many newspapers and magazines, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and has appeared on many American television news programs, including &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. His magazine articles, newspaper columns and website, which &quot;offers his always-intriguing take on the state of gay rights and other political and cultural topics&quot;, champion the cause of gay rights. In particular, Signorile has advocated that gay Americans come out, and has talked about the deleterious effects of the closet both on the closeted individual and on society as a whole. Signorile has been a long-time champion of the right to same-sex marriage. Signorile and much of his work over the years were featured prominently in the film &quot;Outrage&quot;, directed by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Kirby Dick and which focused on closeted antigay politicians, making a case for why media should report on their sexual orientation.

<doc id="291214" wikidata="Q335247" url="?curid=291214" title="Buddhaghosa">
<text>Buddhaghosa was a 5th-century Sinhalese Theravādin Buddhist commentator, translator, and philosopher. He worked in the great monastery (&quot;mahāvihāra&quot;) at Anurādhapura, Sri Lanka and saw himself as being part of the Vibhajyavāda school and in the lineage of the Sinhalese &quot;mahāvihāra&quot;.

His best-known work is the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; (&quot;Path of Purification&quot;), a comprehensive summary of older Sinhala commentaries on the scriptural canon of the Theravāda school. According to Sarah Shaw, in Theravāda Buddhism this systematic work is &quot;the principal text on the subject of meditation.&quot; The interpretations provided by Buddhaghosa have generally constituted the orthodox understanding of Theravādin scriptures since at least the 12th century CE.

Buddhaghosa is generally recognized by both Western scholars and Theravādin Buddhists as the most important philosopher and commentator of the Theravāda school.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Buddhaghosa&quot; means &quot;Voice of the Buddha&quot; (&quot;Buddha&quot;+&quot;ghosa&quot;) in Pāli, the language in which Buddhaghosa composed. In Sanskrit, the name would be spelled Buddhaghoṣa (Devanagari बुद्धघोष), but there is no retroflex ṣ sound in Pali, and the name is not found in Sanskrit works.

==Biography==
Limited reliable information is available about the life of Buddhaghōsa. Three primary sources of information exist: short prologues and epilogues attached to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s works; details of his life recorded in the Cūlavamsa, a Sri Lankan chronicle written in about the 13th century; and a later biographical work called the &quot;Buddhaghosuppatti&quot;. A few other sources discuss the life of Buddhaghosa, but do not appear to add any reliable material.

The biographical excerpts attached to works attributed to Buddhaghosa reveal relatively few details of his life, but were presumably added at the time of his actual composition. Largely identical in form, these short excerpts describe Buddhaghosa as having come to Sri Lanka from India and settled in Anuradhapura. Besides this information, they provide only short lists of teachers, supporters, and associates of Buddhaghosa, whose names are not generally to be found elsewhere for comparison.

Culavamsa, which is regarded as the second part of Mahavamsa and was written in around the thirteenth century, records that Buddhaghosa was born into a Brahmin family in the kingdom of Magadha. He is said to have been born near Bodh Gaya, and to have been a master of the Vedas, traveling through India engaging in philosophical debates. Only upon encountering a Buddhist monk named Revata was Buddhaghosa bested in debate, first being defeated in a dispute over the meaning of a Vedic doctrine and then being confounded by the presentation of a teaching from the Abhidhamma. Impressed, Buddhaghosa became a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) and undertook the study of the Tipiṭaka and its commentaries. On finding a text for which the commentary had been lost in India, Buddhaghosa determined to travel to Sri Lanka to study a Sinhala commentary that was believed to have been preserved.

In Sri Lanka, Buddhaghosa began to study what was apparently a very large volume of Sinhala commentarial texts that had been assembled and preserved by the monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya. Buddhaghosa sought permission to synthesize the assembled Sinhala-language commentaries into a comprehensive single commentary composed in Pali. Traditional accounts hold that the elder monks sought to first test Buddhaghosa&#x27;s knowledge by assigning him the task of elaborating the doctrine regarding two verses of the suttas; Buddhaghosa replied by composing the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;. His abilities were further tested when deities intervened and hid the text of his book, twice forcing him to recreate it from scratch. When the three texts were found to completely summarize all of the Tipiṭaka and match in every respect, the monks acceded to his request and provided Buddhaghosa with the full body of their commentaries.

Buddhaghosa went on to write commentaries on most of the other major books of the Pali Canon, with his works becoming the definitive Theravadin interpretation of the scriptures. Having synthesized or translated the whole of the Sinhala commentary preserved at the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Buddhaghosa reportedly returned to India, making a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya to pay his respects to the Bodhi Tree.

The details of the Mahavamsa account cannot readily be verified; while it is generally regarded by Western scholars as having been embellished with legendary events (such as the hiding of Buddhaghosa&#x27;s text by the gods), in the absence of contradictory evidence it is assumed to be generally accurate. While the Mahavamsa claims that Buddhaghosa was born in northern India near Bodh Gaya, the epilogues to his commentaries make reference to only one location in India as being a place of at least temporary residence: Kanci in southern India. Some scholars thus conclude (among them Oskar von Hinüber and Polwatte Buddhadatta Thera) that Buddhaghosa was actually born in Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh and was relocated in later biographies to give him closer ties to the region of the Buddha.

The &quot;Buddhaghosuppatti&quot;, a later biographical text, is generally regarded by Western scholars as being legend rather than history. It adds to the Mahavamsa tale certain details, such as the identity of Buddhaghosa&#x27;s parents and his village, as well as several dramatic episodes, such as the conversion of Buddhaghosa&#x27;s father and Buddhaghosa&#x27;s role in deciding a legal case. It also explains the eventual loss of the Sinhala originals that Buddhaghosa worked from in creating his Pali commentaries by claiming that Buddhaghosa collected and burnt the original manuscripts once his work was completed.

==Commentarial style==
Buddhaghosa was reputedly responsible for an extensive project of synthesizing and translating a large body of ancient Sinhala commentaries on the Pāli Canon. His &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; (Pāli: Path of Purification) is a comprehensive manual of Theravada Buddhism that is still read and studied today. Maria Heim notes that, while Buddhaghosa worked by using older Sinhala commentarial tradition, he is also &quot;the crafter of a new version of it that rendered the original version obsolete, for his work supplanted the Sinhala versions that are now lost to us&quot;.

===Writing style===
Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu writes that Buddhaghosa&#x27;s work is &quot;characterized by relentless accuracy, consistency, and fluency of erudition, and much dominated by formalism.&quot; According to Richard Shankman, the Visuddhimagga is &quot;meticulous and specific,&quot; in contrast to the Pali suttas, which &quot;can be vague at times, without a lot of explanatory detail and open to various interpretations.&quot;

===Method===
According to Maria Heim, Buddhaghosa is explicitly clear and systematic regarding his hermeneutical principles and exegetical strategies in his commentaries. He writes and theorizes on texts, genre, registers of discourse, reader response, Buddhist knowledge and pedagogy. Buddhaghosa considers each Pitaka of the Buddhist canon a kind of method (&quot;naya&quot;) that requires different skills to interpret. One of his most important ideas about exegesis of the buddha&#x27;s words (&quot;buddhavacana&quot;) is that these words are immeasurable, that is to say, there are innumerable ways and modes to teach and explain the Dhamma and likewise there are innumerable ways in which to receive these teachings. According to Heim, Buddhaghosa considered the &quot;dhamma&quot; to be &quot;well-spoken [...] visible here and now, timeless,&quot; visible meaning that the fruits of the path can be seen in the behavior of the noble ones, and that comprehending the &quot;dhamma&quot; is a transformative way of seeing, which has immediate impact. According to Heim, this idea of the transformative and immediate impact of the scriptures is &quot;vital to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s interpretative practice,&quot; concerned as he is with the immediate and transformative impact of the Buddha&#x27;s words on his audiences, as attested in the suttas

Regarding his systematic thought, Maria Heim and Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad see Buddhaghosa&#x27;s use of Abhidhamma as part of a phenomenological &quot;contemplative structuring&quot; which is expressed in his writings on Buddhist praxis. They argue that &quot;Buddhaghosa’s use of &quot;nāma-rūpa&quot; should be seen as the analytic by which he understands how experience is undergone, and not his account of how some reality is structured.&quot;

===Yogacara influences===
Some scholars have argued that Buddhaghosa&#x27;s writing evinces a strong but unacknowledged Yogācāra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada thought in the wake of his profound influence on the Theravada tradition. According to Kalupahana, Buddhaghosa was influenced by Mahayana-thought, which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce new ideas. According to Kalupahana, this eventually led to the flowering of metaphysical tendencies, in contrast to the original stress on anattā in early Buddhism. According to Jonardon Ganeri, though Buddhaghosa may have been influenced by Yogacara &quot;Vijñānavāda,&quot; &quot;the influence consists not in endorsement but in creative engagement and refutation.&quot;

===Theory of consciousness===
The philosopher Jonardon Ganeri has called attention to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s theory of the nature of consciousness and attention. Ganeri calls Buddhaghosa&#x27;s approach a kind of &quot;attentionalism&quot;, which places primacy on the faculty of attention in explaining activities of thought and mind and is against representationalism. Ganeri also states that Buddhaghosa&#x27;s treatment of cognition &quot;anticipates the concept of working memory, the idea of mind as a global workplace, subliminal orienting, and the thesis that visual processing occurs at three levels.&quot; Ganeri also states:
Ganeri sees Buddhaghosa&#x27;s work as being free from a mediational picture of the mind and also free of the Myth of the Given, two views he sees as having been introduced by the Indian philosopher Dignāga.

===Meditation===
The &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;&#x27;s doctrine reflects Theravada Abhidhamma scholasticism, which includes several innovations and interpretations not found in the earliest discourses (&quot;suttas&quot;) of the Buddha. Buddhaghosa&#x27;s &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; includes non-canonical instructions on Theravada meditation, such as &quot;ways of guarding the mental image (nimitta),&quot; which point to later developments in Theravada meditation. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, &quot;the Visuddhimagga uses a very different paradigm for concentration from what you find in the Canon.&quot; 

Bhante Henepola Gunaratana also notes that what &quot;the suttas say is not the same as what the Visuddhimagga says [...] they are actually different,&quot; leading to a divergence between a [traditional] scholarly understanding and a practical understanding based on meditative experience. Gunaratana further notes that Buddhaghosa invented several key meditation terms which are not to be found in the suttas, such as &quot;&quot;parikamma samadhi&quot; (preparatory concentration), &quot;upacara samadhi&quot; (access concentration), &quot;appanasamadhi&quot; (absorption concentration).&quot; Gunaratana also notes that the Buddhaghosa&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;kasina&quot;-meditation is not to be found in the suttas, where &quot;dhyana&quot; is always combined with mindfulness.

Bhikkhu Sujato has argued that certain views regarding Buddhist meditation expounded in the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; are a &quot;distortion of the Suttas&quot; since it denies the necessity of jhana. 

The Australian monk Shravasti Dhammika is also critical of contemporary practice based on this work. He concludes that Buddhaghosa did not believe that following the practice set forth in the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; will really lead him to Nirvana, basing himself on the postscript (colophon) to the text which states the author hopes to be reborn in heaven and wait until Metteyya (Maitreya) appears to teach the Dharma. However, according to the Burmese scholar Venerable Pandita, the colophon to the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; is not by Buddhaghosa.

According to Sarah Shaw, &quot;it is unlikely that the meditative tradition could have survived in such a healthy way, if at all, without his detailed lists and exhaustive guidance.&quot; Yet, according to Buswell, by the 10th century &quot;vipassana&quot; was no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of &quot;Maitreya&quot;. It was re-introduced in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728–1816), leading to the rise of the Vipassana movement in the 20th century, re-inventing &quot;vipassana&quot;-meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the &quot;Satipatthana sutta&quot;, the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, and other previous texts, emphasizing &quot;satipatthana&quot; and bare insight.

== Attributed works ==
The Mahavamsa ascribes a great many books to Buddhaghosa, some of which are believed not to have been his work, but composed later and attributed to him. Below is a listing of the fourteen commentaries (&quot;Aṭṭhakathā&quot;) on the Pāli Canon traditionally ascribed to Buddhaghosa
While traditional accounts list Buddhaghosa as the author of all of these works, some scholars hold that only the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; and the commentaries on the first four Nikayas as Buddhaghosa&#x27;s work. Meanwhile, Maria Heim holds that Buddhaghosa is the author of the commentaries on the first four Nikayas, the Samantapasadika, the Paramatthajotika, the Visuddhimagga and the three commentaries on the books of the Abhidhamma.

Maria Heim also notes that some scholars hold that Buddhaghosa was the head of a team of scholars and translators, and that this is not an unlikely scenario.

==Influence and legacy==
In the 12th century, the Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) monk Sāriputta Thera became the leading scholar of the Theravada following the reunification of the Sri Lankan (Sinhala) monastic community by King Parakramabahu I. Sariputta incorporated many of the works of Buddhaghosa into his own interpretations. In subsequent years, many monks from Theravada traditions in Southeast Asia sought ordination or re-ordination in Sri Lanka because of the reputation of the Sri Lankan (Sinhala) Mahavihara lineage for doctrinal purity and scholarship. The result was the spread of the teachings of the Mahavihara tradition — and thus Buddhaghosa — throughout the Theravada world. Buddhaghosa&#x27;s commentaries thereby became the standard method by which the Theravada scriptures were understood, establishing Buddhaghosa as the definitive interpreter of Theravada doctrine.

In later years, Buddhaghosa&#x27;s fame and influence inspired various accolades. His life story was recorded, in an expanded and likely exaggerated form, in a Pali chronicle known as the &quot;Buddhaghosuppatti&quot;, or &quot;The Development of the Career of Buddhaghosa&quot;. Despite the general belief that he was Indian by birth, he later may have been claimed by the Mon people of Burma as an attempt to assert primacy over Sri Lanka in the development of Theravada tradition. Other scholars believe that the Mon records refer to another figure, but whose name and personal history are much in the mold of the Indian Buddhaghosa.

Finally, Buddhaghosa&#x27;s works likely played a significant role in the revival and preservation of the Pali language as the scriptural language of the Theravada, and as a lingua franca in the exchange of ideas, texts, and scholars between Sri Lanka and the Theravada countries of mainland Southeast Asia. The development of new analyses of Theravada doctrine, both in Pali and Sinhala, seems to have dried up prior to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s emergence in Sri Lanka. In India, new schools of Buddhist philosophy (such as the Mahayana) were emerging, many of them making use of classical Sanskrit both as a scriptural language and as a language of philosophical discourse. The monks of the Mahavihara may have attempted to counter the growth of such schools by re-emphasizing the study and composition in Pali, along with the study of previously disused secondary sources that may have vanished in India, as evidenced by the Mahavamsa. Early indications of this resurgence in the use of Pali as a literary language may be visible in the composition of the Dipavamsa and the Vimuttimagga, both dating to shortly before Buddhaghosa&#x27;s arrival in Sri Lanka. The addition of Buddhaghosa&#x27;s works — which combined the pedigree of the oldest Sinhala commentaries with the use of Pali, a language shared by all of the Theravada learning centers of the time — provided a significant boost to the revitalization of the Pali language and the Theravada intellectual tradition, possibly aiding the Theravada school in surviving the challenge to its position posed by emerging Buddhist schools of mainland India.

According to Maria Heim, he is &quot;one of the greatest minds in the history of Buddhism&quot; and British philosopher Jonardon Ganeri considers Buddhaghosa &quot;a true innovator, a pioneer, and a creative thinker.&quot; Yet, according to Buddhadasa, Buddhaghosa was influenced by Hindu thought, and the uncritical respect for the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; has even hindered the practice of authentic Buddhism.

<text>Gimhae International Airport is located on the western end of Busan, South Korea. Opened in 1976, the airport is named after the nearby city of Gimhae. A new international terminal opened on October 31, 2007. Gimhae International Airport is the main hub for Air Busan, and a focus city for Jeju Air, Jin Air and Korean Air. Runway 18L/36R is used for military purposes only for Gimhae Air Base, but due to increasing traffic, there are plans to open the runway for airliners. In 2018, 17,064,613 passengers used the airport.

As the airport is now beyond its design capacity and surrounded by mountains, buildings and other objectives, a new airport is currently being built on Gadeokdo to meet growing demand. Because the airport is shared with military facilities, photography and video of the apron, runway, and military stations are prohibited according to the airport website.

==History==
In August 1976, Gimhae Airport opened, and commercial air traffic shifted there from the old airport. A new domestic terminal was completed in May 1983. Korean Air launched a route to Honolulu in October 1992. In April 2002, Northwest Airlines began service to its hub at Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport, where people could board connecting flights to the United States. In March 2007, Lufthansa inaugurated service to Munich via Seoul. This was the first route between Busan and Europe. President Roh Moo-hyun opened a new international terminal seven months later. Delta Air Lines, which had merged with Northwest, ended the Tokyo link in May 2012. Lufthansa terminated its flight to Busan in March 2014.

<text>Cherry Capital Airport is a commercial and general aviation airport located in Traverse City, Michigan, United States. The airport is located southeast of the central business district of Traverse City. The airport is categorized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

Cherry Capital Airport is the third-busiest airport in Michigan, after those of Detroit and Grand Rapids. It is the largest and busiest airport in Northern Michigan, with 700,699 total passengers in 2023. The airport is owned and operated by the Northwest Regional Airport Authority, which was created in 2022. Previously, the airport was jointly owned and operated by Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties.

The airport is home to U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City, which has been operational since 1946.

==History==
Cherry Capital Airport was opened in 1936 as Traverse City Airport, replacing Ransom Field. The airport was moved onto the Coast Guard Air Station, which at the time was a naval air station that had opened in 1946. The airport opened with four runways, all but one of which have been replaced. Remnants of the former runways exist to this day, with some being left abandoned and privately owned.

In the fall of 2004, Cherry Capital opened a new terminal on the south side of the east–west runway, demolishing the old one on the north side. This project also reconfigured the runways, marking the removal of the third diagonal runway. Since then, Cherry Capital Airport has continued to grow with various carriers adding seasonal service and destinations.

Cherry Capital Airport was the recipient of the 2003–04, 2004–05, and 2005–06 &quot;Balchen/Post Awards&quot; for outstanding achievement in snow and ice control in the small commercial service airport category. Soon, the airport will implement the first biometric access systems in the country. The airport is the ninth to implement the advanced security measures suggested after the September 11, 2001, attacks. This terminal is able to comply better with security regulations and supports a greater number of flights and passengers.

In 2013 and 2017, the airport extended the east–west runway to accommodate more flights to more locations, possibly to upgrade to an international airport for Air Canada Express flights.

In October 2017, a Costco store opened next to the airport entrance on a property leased to the warehouse chain for 60 years.

The airport saw upgrades to its parking lot and TSA checkpoint in 2022. This allowed for an additional 424 parking spots and a third TSA checkpoint line that can accommodate modern screening technology. The airport also added a hybrid USO location to assist soldiers traveling through.

Also in 2022, the Northwest Regional Airport Authority was established to operate the airport, after years of operation by Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties.

The airport received $14 million in 2020 as part of the federal CARES act to help it maintain operations and complete upgrades during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The airport set passenger records in 2021 and 2022 despite a drop in the number of flights passing through, making it the No. 3 airport in Michigan.

The airport was host to campaign events held by gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon during the 2022 midterm elections.

In February 2023, Cherry Capital Airport was selected as a recipient of a $5 million grant under the Airport Terminals Program, a component of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, to replace its passenger jetways to modernize the boarding process.

==Facilities and aircraft==
The Airport has one concourse with six gates. Cherry Capital Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 10/28 is and 18/36 is .

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 101,106 aircraft operations, an average of 277 per day: 75% general aviation, 11% scheduled commercial, 8% air taxi, and 6% military. At that time, there were 125 aircraft based at this airport: 98 single-engine and 15 multi-engine airplanes, 5 helicopters, and 7 jets.

In February 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Cherry Capital Airport second in their list of the top ten &quot;rip-off&quot; airports in the United States, citing an average cost per mile to travelers departing TVC of 41 cents.

The airport has one fixed-base operator, AvFlight.

===Ground transportation===
The Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) serves the airport terminal and links to downtown Traverse City as well as other locations in the surrounding area.

==Accidents and incidents==
* Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712 was a Bombardier CRJ200 from Minneapolis-St. Paul, which overran the runway while landing at TVC during a snowstorm on April 12, 2007. In its Report to Congress, the National Transportation Safety Board wrote that &quot;the aircraft received substantial damage, but the 52 people on board were not injured. The Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was the pilots&#x27; decision to land at TVC without performing a landing distance assessment, which was required by company policy. This poor decision-making likely reflected the effects of fatigue produced by a long, demanding duty day, and, for the captain, the duties associated with performing check airman functions. Contributing to the accident were the Federal Aviation Administration pilot flight and duty time regulations that permitted the pilots&#x27; long, demanding duty day and the TVC operations supervisor&#x27;s use of ambiguous and unspecific radio phraseology in providing runway braking information. Four safety recommendations were issued to the FAA addressing timely post-accident drug testing, training on landing distance assessment performance, ground operations personnel communications, and criteria for runway closures in snow and ice conditions. The NTSB adopted the report on June 10, 2008.&quot;

<text>German &quot;Reich&quot; (, from , ) was the constitutional name for the German nation state that existed from 1871 to 1945. The &quot;Reich&quot; became understood as deriving its authority and sovereignty entirely from a continuing unitary German &quot;Volk&quot; (&quot;national people&quot;), with that authority and sovereignty being exercised at any one time over a unitary German &quot;state territory&quot; with variable boundaries and extent. Although commonly translated as &quot;German Empire&quot;, the word &quot;Reich&quot; here better translates as &quot;realm&quot; or territorial &quot;reach&quot;, in that the term does not in itself have monarchical connotations.

The name &quot;German &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; was officially proclaimed on 18 January 1871 at the Palace of Versailles by Otto von Bismarck and Wilhelm I of Prussia. After the annexation of Austria to Germany on 12–13 March 1938, the name &quot;Greater German &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; () began to be used along with the official name &quot;German &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. According to the decree of the Chief of the &quot;Reich&quot; Chancellery Hans Lammers of 26 June 1943, the name &quot;Greater German &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; became mandatory in official documents.

The German &quot;Reich&quot; collapsed de facto with the death of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945, when the Allies decided not to recognise Karl Dönitz as the &quot;Reich&quot; President and to grant no legitimacy to the Flensburg Government he had formed. On 5 June 1945, the Allies signed the Berlin Declaration concerning the defeat of Germany and the assumption of supreme authority over Germany, by which they established the Allied Control Council and assumed supreme authority over German territory.

The Federal Republic of Germany asserted, following its establishment on 23 May 1949, that within its boundaries it was the sole legal continuation of the German Reich, and consequently not a successor state. Nevertheless, the Federal Republic did not maintain the specific title &quot;German Reich&quot;, and so consistently replaced the prefix &quot;Reichs-&quot; in all official titles and designations with &quot;Bundes-&quot; (&quot;Federal&quot;). Hence, for instance, the office of the &quot;Reichskanzler&quot; became the &quot;Bundeskanzler&quot;. Following German reunification on 3 October 1990, the expanded Federal Republic describes itself as &quot;United Germany&quot;, emphasizing that it does not now recognize any territories once included in the former German Reich outside its boundaries as having a valid claim to be a part of Germany as a whole.

== Use ==
In referring to the entire period between 1871 and 1945, the partially translated English phrase &quot;German Reich&quot; () is applied by historians in formal contexts; although in common English usage this state was and is known simply as Germany, the English term &quot;German Empire&quot; is reserved to denote the German state between 1871 and 1918.

The history of the nation state known as the German &quot;Reich&quot; is commonly divided into three periods:
* German Empire (1871–1918)
* Weimar Republic (1918–1933)
* Nazi Germany (1933–1945)

However the term dates back earlier than all of this. It was occasionally applied in contemporary maps to the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806), also called the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; from 1512. The Holy Roman Empire however was not exclusively German-speaking but constituted a supranational entity extending beyond the frontiers of the German language area (&quot;Sprachraum&quot;). The first attempt to re-establish a &quot;German Empire&quot; during the 1848 March Revolution by the Frankfurt Constitution ultimately failed: it was aborted by the monarchs of the German Confederation, especially by the Prussian aristocracy and the King of Prussia himself, which opposed German nationalism, as then was associated with the idea of popular sovereignty.

A 1923 book entitled &quot;Das Dritte Reich&quot; by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck counted the medieval Holy Roman Empire as the first, and the 1871–1918 monarchy as the second, which was then to be followed by a &quot;reinvigorated&quot; third one. Subsequently the Nazi regime was (unofficially) called the &quot;Third Reich&quot;; this usage was sometimes contemporaneous, but mostly retrospective and applied by non-Germans.

Following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; annexation of Austria in 1938, Nazi Germany informally named itself the Greater German Reich (). This name was made the official state name only during the last two years (1943–1945) of Nazi rule under Adolf Hitler, although the change was never proclaimed. After World War II, the denotation &quot;German &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; quickly fell into disuse in Allied-occupied Germany, however, and the state&#x27;s continued existence remained a matter of debate; the post-war Bonn Republic maintained the continued existence of the German &quot;Reich&quot; as an &#x27;overall state&quot;, but dormant while East and West Germany continued to be divided. Nevertheless, when Germany was reunited in 1990 the term &quot;German &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; was not revived as a title for the Berlin Republic.

==The difference between &quot;Reich&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot;==

The German word &quot;Reich&quot; translates to the English word &quot;empire&quot;; it also translates to such words as &quot;realm&quot; or &quot;domain.&quot; However, this translation was not used throughout the full existence of the German Reich. Historically, only Germany from 1871 to 1918—when Germany was under the rule of an emperor (&quot;Kaiser&quot;)—is known in English as the &quot;German Empire&quot; (&quot;Deutsches Kaiserreich&quot; in German historiography), while the term &quot;German Reich&quot; describes Germany from 1871 to 1945. As the literal translation &quot;German Empire&quot; denotes a monarchy, the term is used only in reference to Germany before the fall of the monarchy at the end of World War I in 1918.

After the unification of Germany, under the reign of the Prussian king Wilhelm I and his Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the historic German states (&quot;e.g.&quot; Bavaria and Saxony) were united with Prussia under imperial rule, by the Hohenzollern dynasty. On 18 January 1871, Wilhelm I was proclaimed &quot;German Emperor&quot; at the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, the German Reich was officially declared , or &quot;German Empire&quot;, explicitly harking back to the extinct Holy Roman Empire. The title &quot;German Emperor&quot; was a compromise; Wilhelm I had wanted the title of &quot;Emperor of Germany&quot;, but Bismarck refused this, so as to avoid implying a claim to extended monarchical authority over non-Prussian German kingdoms. On 14 April 1871, the Reichstag parliament passed the Constitution of the German Empire (&quot;Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches&quot;), which was published two days later.

However, originating from the North German Confederation, the Empire never comprised all &quot;German&quot; lands; as it excluded Luxembourg, and those Cisleithanian crown lands of Austria-Hungary which had been part of the former German Confederation until 1865. Moreover, it included the whole of the Kingdom of Prussia, the eastern parts of which had never been included in historic German lands. The unification under Prussian leadership manifested Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Lesser German&quot; solution of the German question after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, realised with the support of his national liberal allies. On the other hand, the German Reich of 1871 comprised extended Prussian territories with large non-German sections of the population, like Posen, West Prussia or Schleswig, and also territories with predominantly German populations which had never been constitutionally &quot;German&quot; (Holy Roman), such as East Prussia.

Bismarck was otherwise unable, however, to avoid the term &quot;German Reich&quot; acquiring connotations from the English term &quot;empire&quot; or the Dutch term &quot;rijk&quot; in the context of German colonial expansion during the New Imperialism period. Following in the example of other European colonial empires, Imperial Germany (against Bismarck&#x27;s intentions) started to rapidly acquire overseas colonies, including possessions in Africa, Oceania and China; the Imperial German Navy underwent a rapid expansion concurrently to protect these new colonies. At the same time strong Pan-Germanic political forces emerged, pressing for the borders of the &quot;Reich&quot; to be extended into a multiethnic German-led Central European empire, emulating and rivalling Imperial Russia to the east. 

Before and during the events of World War I, the German state was called an &quot;empire&quot; in English and Wilhelm II was titled &quot;His Imperial and Royal Majesty the German Emperor.&quot; After the War and the abolition of the monarchy during the German Revolution of 1918–1919, however, when Wilhelm was forced to abdicate, the official English name for Germany was the &quot;German Reich&quot;: &quot;Reich&quot; was left untranslated and no longer referred to an &quot;empire&quot; but, instead, took on the connotation of &quot;Realm&quot; or &quot;State&quot;, its original (1871) definition. &quot;German Reich&quot; was used in legal documents and English-language international treaties—for example, the Kellogg–Briand Pact and the Geneva Conventions.

Apart from official documents, post-World War I Germany was referred to as the &quot;German Reich&quot;—never as the &quot;German Empire&quot;—for example, by British politicians—and in the aftermath of World War II the word &quot;Reich&quot; was used untranslated by Allied prosecutors throughout the Nuremberg Trials, with &quot;German Empire&quot; only used to describe Germany before it became a federal republic in 1918.

==Reich as &quot;national people&quot; versus Reich as &quot;state territory&quot;==
At the 1871 Unification of Germany (aside from Austria), the Reich was established constitutionally as a federation of monarchies, each having entered the federation with a defined territory; and consequently the unitary nationalism of the &#x27;German Reich&#x27; was initially specified (at Article 1 of the 1871 constitution) in territorial terms, as the lands within the former boundaries of this particular subset of German monarchies. This geographical understanding of the Reich became steadily superseded in the period up to the first World War by an understanding of the German Reich as a unitary nation state identified with the German national people according to the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, and drawing on the rhetoric of &quot;the sovereignty of the nation&quot; in the Frankfurt Constitution—albeit that many ethnic &quot;Germans&quot; (as with the German-speaking peoples of Austria) remained outside the national people constituting the German Empire of 1871 and also that the Empire of 1871 included extensive territories (such as Posen) with predominantly non-German populations. This transition became formalised in the constitution of the Weimar Republic, where Article 1 identifies the Reich as deriving its authority from the German national people, while Article 2 identifies the state territory under the Reich as the lands which, at the time of the constitution&#x27;s adoption, were within the authority of the German state. The identity of Reich and people ran both ways—not only did the institutions of the German state derive their legitimacy from the German people, so, too, the German people derived their inherent identity and patriotic duties from their being collectively constituted as an organ and institution of the German Reich. Subsequently the term &quot;German Reich&quot; continued to be applied both as identifying with the national people, and also with the state territory; but increasingly, the application of the term to the German national people came to be seen as primary. Following the Second World War, the term &quot;German Reich&quot; fell out of use in constitutional formulations, being replaced by the term &quot;nation as a whole&quot;, as applied to denote the state as a totality of the German national people; and the term &quot;Germany as a whole&quot;, as applied to denote the state as a totality of German national territory.

==Nazi perspective on the Weimar Republic==
The 1918–1933 republic, which was also called the German Reich, was ignored and denounced by the Nazis as a historical aberration. The name &quot;Weimar Republic&quot; was first used in 1929 after Hitler referred to the period as the &quot;Republik von Weimar&quot; (Republic of Weimar, after the city (Weimar) which held its constitutional assembly) at a rally in Munich with the term later becoming mainstream during the 1930s both within and outside Germany. The Nazis also contemptuously referred to it as &quot;the System&quot;.

==Fall of the Third Reich==
On 8 May 1945, with the capitulation of the German armed forces, the supreme command of the Wehrmacht was handed over to the Allies. The Allies refused to recognise Karl Dönitz as &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; or to recognise the legitimacy of his Flensburg Government (so-called because it was based at Flensburg and controlled only a small area around the town) and, on 5 June 1945, the four powers signed the Berlin Declaration and assumed de jure supreme authority with respect to Germany. The declaration confirmed the complete legal extinction of the Third Reich with the death of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945, but asserted the continued subsequent existence of a German people and a German national territory; although subject to the four signatory powers also asserting their authority to determine the future boundaries of Germany.

At the Potsdam Conference, Allied-occupied Germany was defined as comprising &quot;Germany as a whole&quot;; and was divided into British, French, American and Soviet occupation zones; while the Allied Powers exercised the state authority assumed by the Berlin Declaration in transferring the former eastern territories of the German Reich east of the Oder–Neisse line to the Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union.

==Divided Germany==

In 1973, in a review of the previous year&#x27;s Basic Treaty between East and West Germany, the German Federal Constitutional Court (&quot;Bundesverfassungsgericht&quot;) ruled that according to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany the German &quot;Reich&quot; had outlasted the collapse in 1945, and hence had continued to exist as an “overall state”, albeit one not itself capable of action. The court ruled that since 1949 the Federal Republic (FRG) had been partially identical with the German &quot;Reich&quot; and not merely its successor. The court further elaborated that the &#x27;partial identity&#x27; of the FRG was limited to apply only within its current &quot;de facto&quot; territory; and hence the Federal Republic could not claim an exclusive mandate for the territory of the &quot;Reich&quot; then under the &quot;de facto&quot; government of the German Democratic Republic; &quot;identity does not require exclusivity&quot;. This was explained as being because the German Democratic Republic was beyond FRG authority and because the Allied powers still had jurisdiction where &quot;Germany as a whole&quot; was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court insisted that within the territory of the Federal Republic, the GDR could only be considered as one &quot;de jure&quot; German state amongst others, on the analogy of the pre-existing &quot;de jure&quot; German states that in 1949 had come together as the Federal Republic; and hence, like them, could never be accorded by the organs of the Federal Republic full recognition as a state in international law; even though the Federal Constitutional Court recognised that, within international law, the GDR was indeed an independent sovereign state. The constitutional status of the GDR under the Basic Law still differed from that of the &quot;Länder&quot; of the Federal Republic, in that the GDR had not declared its accession to the Basic Law; but the Constitutional Court maintained that the Basic Treaty was consistent with the GDR declaring its accession at some time in the future in accordance with its own constitution; and hence the Court determined that in recognising the GDR as a &quot;de jure&quot; German State, the Basic Treaty could be interpreted as facilitating the reunification of the German &quot;Reich&quot; (as indeed it eventually did). So long as any &quot;de jure&quot; German state remained separated from the rest, the German &quot;Reich&quot; could continue to exist only in suspension; but should the GDR be reunited with the Federal Republic, the &quot;Reich&quot; would once more be fully capable of action as a sovereign state.

&quot;In Article 6 the Contracting Parties agree that they shall base themselves on the principle that the sovereign power of each of the two States be confined to its State territory and that they will respect the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs. This agreement too is compatible with the Basic Law only if interpreted to the effect that for the Federal Republic of Germany the basis of this Treaty is the continued existence of Germany, which has according to the Basic Law to be recognized as a State (albeit not organized and therefore not capable of action), and that accordingly the mutual restriction of sovereign power to the territory of the State and respect for the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs has its reference to the special situation in which both States find themselves vis-à-vis each other as sub-States of Germany as a whole.&quot;

After 1973, however, the claimed identity of the Federal Republic with the German &quot;Reich&quot; was not recognised by most other countries of the world. The Soviet Union, the three Western allies, and most other Western countries regarded the German &quot;Reich&quot; as still being one nation—not synonymous with either the West or East German state but rather the two states in collective. Other countries tended to regard the German &quot;Reich&quot; as having been divided into two distinct states in international law, and accordingly accorded both states full diplomatic recognition. As of 1974, East Germany&#x27;s official stance was that the GDR was a new state that is German in nature, a successor of the German Reich, and that there were then two German states that were different nations.

==Reunified Germany==
When the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany between Germany and the wartime Allies was signed on 12 September 1990, there was no mention of the term , however the Allies paraphrased the international legal personality of Germany as &quot;Germany as a whole&quot; in the English version of the text. Instead the states of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, GDR) agreed to be bound by certain conditions which they had to ratify, one of which was the recognising the reunification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin as constituting the full achievement of a united Germany. On meeting these conditions under Article 7.2 &quot;The United Germany [has] accordingly full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.&quot;

Under Article 1 of the Treaty on Final Settlement, the new united Germany committed itself to renouncing any further territorial claims beyond the boundaries of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin; &quot;The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against other states and shall not assert any in the future.&quot; Furthermore the Basic Law of the Federal Republic was required to be amended to state explicitly that full German unification had now been achieved, such that the new German state comprised the entirety of Germany, and that all constitutional mechanisms should be removed by which any territories outside those boundaries could otherwise subsequently be admitted; these amendments being bound by treaty not to be revoked. Article 23 of the Basic Law was repealed, closing off the possibility for any further states to apply for membership of the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic comprised the entirety of the German people; &quot;This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect&quot;. This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; &quot;Germans..have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.&quot; In place of the former Article 23 under which the former GDR had declared its accession to the Federal Republic, a new Article 23 embedded the accession of the Federal Republic to the European Union within the Basic Law; hence with the subsequent accession of Poland to the EU, the constitutional bar on pursuing any claim to territories beyond the Oder–Neisse line was reinforced. Insofar as the German Reich may be claimed to continue in existence as &#x27;Germany as a whole&#x27;, the former eastern territories of Germany in Poland or Russia, and the western territories, such as the East Cantons or Alsace-Lorraine, are now definitively and permanently excluded from ever again being united within this Reich under the Basic Law.

Hence, although the GDR had by the Volkskammer&#x27;s declaration of accession to the Federal Republic, initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law required by the Treaty of Final Settlement) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law. This treaty was then voted into effect by both the Volkskammer and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Hence, although the GDR had nominally declared its accession to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood; but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty and the Treaty of Final Settlement. These amendments had the effect of removing all those clauses by which the Federal Constitutional Court had formerly maintained the identity of the Federal Republic with the historic &#x27;German Reich&#x27;, specifically including the very Article 23 that had provided the basis for the Volkskammer&#x27;s declaration of accession.

<text>McGhee Tyson Airport is a public/military airport south of Knoxville, in Alcoa, Tennessee. It is named for United States Navy pilot Charles McGhee Tyson, who was killed in World War I.

Owned by the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority, it is served by several major airlines and employs about 2,700 people. It is a 30-minute drive to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The airport is the home of McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base, an air base for the 134th Air Refueling Wing (134 ARW) of the Tennessee Air National Guard.

==History==
On August 1, 1930, the original McGhee Tyson airport opened, named for Charles McGhee Tyson. It was built on in West Knoxville where West High School is now located. In 1935, the city purchased in Blount County for the current airport. On July 29, 1937, an American Airlines Stinson Trimotor (about 10 seats) touched down, the first airline flight; before that, American&#x27;s Stinsons landed at Island Airport on Dickinson Island east of town. The 1938 directory shows a N–S runway and a NE-SW runway at McGhee Tyson; the 1939 directory shows N–S and NE-SW. The city built a control tower in 1941.

The development of TYS helped the City of Alcoa diversify its economy and gain its economic independence from what is today Arconic Inc. (formerly Alcoa Inc.), the world&#x27;s third largest producer of aluminum. Alcoa Inc. built one of its production plants in Alcoa because of the proximity of dams along the Little Tennessee River which were a hydroelectric energy source for the production of aluminum.

In 1951, the United States Air Force built several facilities on the field and runway 5L. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) added an Instrument landing system to runways 5L and 23R in 1959. In 1961, with financing by the Tennessee Air National Guard, runway 5L was extended to . The first scheduled airline jets were Delta DC-9s in December 1965.

In 1968, McGhee Tyson built a new air cargo facility; a new passenger terminal opened in 1974, a few years after runway 18/36 closed. Four years later, the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority (MKAA) was established. In 1990, runway 5R/23L was rebuilt to . In 1992, the airport authority built a new 21-acre cargo facility on the north side of the airport for Federal Express, UPS and Airborne Express. Buildings were designed to meet the carriers&#x27; needs; 90% of the air cargo operations are UPS and Federal Express. Cost of the project was estimated at $9.3 million.

In 2000, improvements to the passenger terminal were finished at a cost of $70 million, including two new concourses, 12 new gates, ticket counters, and a Ruby Tuesday restaurant. In 2002 an aircraft maintenance facility was built for Northwest Airlines, serving as their primary CRJ MRO facility. The now-defunct ExpressJet Airlines built a heavy-maintenance hangar near the air cargo facilities for its fleet. In June 2009, a new food court was completed, featuring Starbucks, Quiznos, Cinnabon, and Zia locations. The Zia location was replaced in April 2013 with an Uno Express Pizza.

In November 2016, the agency that operates McGhee Tyson received a $27.9 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration to complete the next phase of a multi-year runway expansion, the most expensive project the airport ever has undertaken. The north runway, 5L/23R, is being lengthened to . During the work, of that runway were demolished while remained open for small planes. Airliners still land on Runway 5R/23L, which will remain long.

On December 17, 2021, the rebuilt 10,000-foot runway 5L/23R reopened.

==Facilities==
McGhee Tyson Airport covers at an elevation of . It has two parallel runways: 5L/23R is 10,000 by 150 feet (3,048 x 46 m) concrete and 5R/23L is 9,000 by 150 feet (2,743 x 46 m) asphalt.

The fixed-base operator (FBO) at TYS is Signature Aviation, the parent company of Signature Flight Support. In July 2022 Signature Aviation announced the acquisition of the TAC Air division of TAC (Truman Arnold Companies) and the FBO was rebranded to join the Signature network.

Originally, Tac Air first moved into TYS on April 1, 2005, when it purchased Knox-Air, which had operated in TYS since 1974. Then a month later, on May 5, 2005, TAC Air purchased the only remaining FBO, Cherokee Aviation, which had been in operation since 1954. TAC Air combined these two FBOs under their own name, and they were the sole supplier of aviation fuel for commercial, corporate and general aviation aircraft as well as leased hangar space at the airport.

In 2023, the airport had 104,459 aircraft operations, averaging 286 per day: 46,858 general aviation, 18,433 air taxi, 9,952 military, and 29,216 air carrier. In 2023, 186 aircraft were based at the airport: 84 single-engine, 26 multi-engine, 50 jet, 22 military, and 4 helicopter.

TYS is home to a maintenance base for Endeavor Air, crew base for Allegiant Air, and delivery, maintenance and training centers for Cirrus Aircraft.

===Terminal===
McGhee Tyson Airport has two levels. The top level is accessed via the curbside drop off and the parking garage. The top level has ticket counters, security, gates, restaurants and shops. It is designed with a Smoky Mountain theme, complete with faux waterfalls and wood carvings of bears. The bottom level is used for car rental counters, three baggage claims, airline offices, and airport offices.
There are 12 gates. On a regular day Gates 2 &amp; 4 are used by Allegiant Air, Gate 6 is a common use gate, Gates 8, 10, &amp; 12 are used by American, Gates 1, 3 &amp; 5 are used by Delta, and Gates 7, 9, &amp; 11 are used by United. Gate assignments can be subject to change.

In July 2023, the airport announced the planning of a six-gate expansion to the terminal, with a target completion date of 2028, to meet the growing needs of the region.

In January 2024, airport officials announced they would be closing part of the airport&#x27;s long-term parking lot to begin a project that would expand the current garage to six stories and add 3,500 parking spots.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On August 6, 1962, American Airlines Flight 414, a Lockheed L-188A Electra attempting to land at TYS in high winds associated with a thunderstorm veered off the right side of runway 04L and struck the raised edge of a taxiway that was under construction, causing the right hand main gear to separate. There were no fatalities and only one minor injury among the 67 passengers and 5 crew, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off.
* On March 12, 1992, a USAir Express Jetstream 31 crashed on landing after the pilot failed to lower the landing gear. There were no passengers aboard, but the two crew members were killed.

<text>Klepp Stasjon is a village in Klepp municipality in Rogaland county, Norway, on the lakeshore of Frøylandsvatnet, about east of the village of Kleppe and southwest of Orstad. It is named after the Klepp railway station on the Jæren Line. When the line was constructed in 1878, Kleppe was somewhat offset from its path, so the station serving it was placed east of the village rather than in it. Thereafter, this village (literally &quot;Klepp Station&quot;) grew up around it.

<text>Stanford in the Vale is a village and civil parish in the Vale of White Horse about southeast of Faringdon and northwest of Wantage. It is part of the historic county of Berkshire, however since 1974, it has been administered as a part of Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population 2,093.

==Geography==
Stanford is a village with a clustered centre just north of the nascent River Ock, which is a tributary of the River Thames and flows from west to east through the parish. The parish is about wide north – south but extends for more than east – west along the course of the Ock and its tributaries. One tributary, Stutfield Brook, forms the southeast boundary of the parish. Another, Frogmore Brook, forms part of the northern boundary. The western boundary follows the edges of present and former fields.

Stanford village is built on soil-clad Corallian Limestone, which in patches comes close to the surface through erosion. The village is on the A417 road that links Faringdon and Wantage. All outlying parts of the parish are used for farming, interspersed with woodland and other land-intensive industries, with the exception of Bow, a hamlet just north of the village and almost contiguous with the village&#x27;s core.

==Archaeology==
On Bowling Green Farm at the western end of the parish, about east of Faringdon, are remains of what was probably a Roman estate. Along a ridge of Corallian Limestone was a village street more than long. Below it in the valley there may have been a large Roman villa and bath-house. Evidence exists of Roman fields and scattered outbuildings surrounding the village and villa. In the east end of the parish, about east of Stanford Park Farm, is a rectangular moated enclosure beside Stutfield Brook at a place called Stanford Park Island. Exploratory excavations in the early 1960s revealed no evidence of habitation.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Stanford&quot; is derived from the Old English for a &quot;stone ford&quot; across the Ock.

==Manor==
In the reign of Edward the Confessor in the middle of the 11th century, one Siward Barn held the manor of Stanford. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that after the Norman Conquest of England, the Norman nobleman Henry de Ferrers held it. It was made part of the Honour of Tutbury, and remained with the de Ferrers family until the 1260s, when Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby was defeated in the Second Barons&#x27; War and forfeited his estates in 1266. The Dictum of Kenilworth issued that October allowed him to reclaim his lands by paying a premium, which he did in 1269.

However, by 1276 Stanford had been granted to Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester. When his successor Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Stanford passed to Eleanor de Clare, wife of Hugh Despenser the Younger. As a result of the rebellions and executions of Hugh and his father Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester in 1326, and their descendant Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester in 1400, all Despenser lands were twice forfeited to the Crown. But after each forfeiture, Stanford was among the estates restored to the rebel&#x27;s widow. In the early 15th century Stanford was among the manors that passed by the marriage of Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Worcester to Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. In 1474 Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick conferred all her estates on her two daughters. Stanford was among those that she passed to Anne Neville, Queen Consort of King Richard III. But in 1485 Richard was defeated and killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field and her estates were forfeit. In 1489 the all Countess&#x27;s estates, including Stanford, were restored to her, but she conveyed them to the victorious King Henry VII.

In the 16th century the manor of Stanford passed through notable local landholding families including those of Fettiplace and Knollys. When Francis Knollys died in 1596, the manor of Stanford was divided between his granddaughters Elizabeth and Lettice. Around the turn of the 17th century Elizabeth Knollys became married to Henry Willoughby of Risley, Derbyshire, who in 1611 was created 1st Baronet. Their daughter Anne was married to Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet, and their half of Stanford remained in their family until Sir Thomas Aston, 4th Baronet died in 1744. Meanwhile, Lettice Knollys was married to William Paget, 4th Baron Paget, and her half of the manor of Stanford remained with his heirs until 1715, when Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge conveyed it to Peter Walter and John Morse. By the end of the 18th century an Edward Loveden Loveden bought and reunited the two halves of the manor. The present manor house was built in the 16th century and remodelled in a Georgian style in the 18th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.

==Churches and chapel==

===Church of England===
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Denys are its late 12th-century south and north doorways. The west tower was built late in the 13th century, but its height was increased later. The chancel is Decorated Gothic. Later are the 14th-century north and south aisles, Perpendicular Gothic clerestory and south and north porches. Remnants of 14th-century stained glass survive in the east and south windows of the chancel. The pulpit and baptismal font are Jacobean. The pulpit is wooden; the font is stone encased with wooden panels and cover. The church is a Grade I listed building The tower has a ring of eight bells. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the third, fifth, seventh and tenor bells in 1700. Abel Rudhall cast the fourth bell in 1753. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble and second bells in 1891. St Denys&#x27; parish is part of the Benefice of Stanford in the Vale with Goosey and Hatford.

===United Reformed===
There is a United Reformed Church in Chapel Lane. It was formerly a Congregational chapel. It is no longer in use.

===Methodist===
Stanford had a Primitive Methodist chapel. It is now a private house.

==Economic and social history==

In 1230 King Henry III granted William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby and the men of Stanford the rights to hold a weekly market in the village and an annual three-day fair on the eve, feast and morrow of St Denis, which is 8–10 October. Stanford&#x27;s market and fair faced competition with those of other villages in the area including Baulking, East Hendred, Hinton Waldrist, Kingston Lisle and Shrivenham. In the English Civil War there were clashes a few miles to the north, at Faringdon and Radcot (a strategic crossing of the Thames), in 1644 and 1645. According to oral history, Parliamentarian cavalry was billeted in the village. On 21 August 2005 a fire badly damaged a row of five 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century thatched cottages beside Church Green. The fire was seen at 1:30 a.m. by an off-duty soldier from Dalton Barracks, who rescued nine people from the cottages. All five cottages have since been restored.

==Amenities==
Stanford has a primary school, a pre-school, two village greens, a post office, other shops and businesses, and a number of clubs and societies. The village has one public house, the Horse and Jockey. It had two other pubs, the Red Lion and the Anchor, each of which has been converted into a private house. 

==Demography==

The 2011 Census found that the largest category of occupation in Stanford in the Vale is that of professions (151 of 1041 workers). In the more subdivided categorization of workers into industries, the largest was that of motor-related industries, including trade of motor vehicles (151 of 1041 workers). This was followed, in order, by human health and social work, professional, scientific and technical activities and by education as the other occupations. With between 88 and 95 workers, construction and manufacturing were industries in which other villagers at the date of that census tended to work. In the parish various grades of sand and gravel are quarried. However, only two people were employed in mining and quarrying: 0.2% of the working population. The gravel pit in the near northwest of the parish is dormant.

==Transport==
Bus route 67 links Stanford with Faringdon and Wantage six days a week. There is no service on Sundays or bank holidays. It is operated by Pulhams Coaches.

==Notable people==
The poet Pam Ayres was born in Stanford in 1947. 
The English biographer Winifred Gérin lived in Stanford in the 1970s. 
Christopher Wordsworth, nephew of the poet William Wordsworth, was Vicar of Stanford from 1850 to 1869.

==Twinning==
The village has been twinned with Saint-Germain-du-Corbéis in Lower Normandy, France since 1989.

<doc id="291226" wikidata="Q5021265" url="?curid=291226" title="2003 California gubernatorial recall election">
<text>The 2003 California gubernatorial recall election was a special election permitted under California state law. It resulted in voters replacing incumbent Democratic Governor Gray Davis with Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. The recall effort spanned the latter half of 2003. Seven of the nine previous governors, including Davis, had faced unsuccessful recall attempts.

After several legal and procedural efforts failed to stop it, California&#x27;s first-ever gubernatorial recall election was held on October 7, and the results were certified on November 14, 2003, making Davis the first governor recalled in the history of California, and just the second in U.S. history (the first was North Dakota&#x27;s 1921 recall of Lynn Frazier). California is one of 19 states that allow recalls. Nearly 18 years after the 2003 election, California held a second recall election in 2021; however, that recall was unsuccessful, failing to oust Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.

==Background==
The California recall process became law in 1911 as the result of Progressive Era reforms that spread across the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The ability to recall elected officials came along with the initiative and referendum processes. The movement in California was spearheaded by Republican Governor Hiram Johnson, a reformist, who called the recall process a &quot;precautionary measure by which a recalcitrant official can be removed&quot;. No illegality has to be committed by politicians in order for them to be recalled. If an elected official commits a crime while in office, the state legislature can hold impeachment trials. For a recall, only the will of the people is necessary to remove an official. Nineteen U.S. states, along with the District of Columbia, allow the recall of state officials.

Before the successful recall of Gray Davis, no California statewide official had ever been recalled, although there had been 117 previous attempts. Only seven of those even made it onto the ballot, all for state legislators. Every California governor since Goodwin Knight in the 1950s has been subject to a recall effort. Davis was the first governor of California whose opponents gathered the necessary signatures to qualify for a special election. Davis also faced a recall petition in 1999 but that effort failed to gain enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Davis&#x27;s recall at the time was only the second gubernatorial recall election in U.S. history. The first governor recall occurred in 1921, when North Dakota&#x27;s Lynn J. Frazier was recalled over a dispute about state-owned industries, and was replaced by Ragnvald A. Nestos. A third gubernatorial recall election occurred in Wisconsin in 2012 which, unlike the previous two, failed.

The 2003 recall was prompted by some actions taken by Davis and his predecessor, Governor Pete Wilson. Many people were upset with the governor&#x27;s decision to block the enactment of Proposition 187, which had been found unconstitutional by a Federal District Court. Davis, who had opposed the measure, decided not to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, effectively killing the ballot measure. He also signed two new restrictive gun-control laws. Many people were further upset about the then ongoing California electricity crisis. The crisis was brought on by a series of deregulatory moves, including a bill signed into law by the previous Governor. As Davis&#x27;s recall transpired before he had served half of his term as governor, he remained eligible to serve another term, should he win a future election for the California governor post.

===California law===

Under California law, any elected official may be the target of a recall campaign. To trigger a recall election, proponents of the recall must gather a certain number of signatures from registered voters within a certain time period. The number of signatures statewide must equal 12% of the number of votes cast in the previous election for that office. For the 2003 recall election, that meant a minimum of 897,156 signatures, based on the November 2002 statewide elections. As the 2002 California gubernatorial election had the lowest turnout in modern history, the number of signatures required was less than usual.

The effort to recall Gray Davis began with Republicans Ted Costa, Mark Abernathy, and Howard Kaloogian, who filed their petition with the California Secretary of State and started gathering signatures. The effort was not taken seriously until U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, who hoped to run as a replacement candidate for governor, donated $2 million to a new committee, Rescue California, which then led the effort. Eventually, proponents gathered about 1.6 million signatures, of which 1,356,408 were certified as valid.

Under most circumstances in which a recall campaign against a statewide elected official has gathered the required number of signatures, the governor is required to schedule a special election for the recall vote. If the recall campaign qualified less than 180 days prior to the next regularly scheduled election, then the recall becomes part of that regularly scheduled election. In the case of a recall against the governor, the responsibility for scheduling a special election falls on the lieutenant governor, who in 2003 was Cruz Bustamante.

===Political climate===
The political climate was largely shaped by the California electricity crisis of the early 2000s, during which many people experienced a tripling in the cost of their energy consumption as rolling blackouts happened throughout the state. The public held Davis partly responsible, although the causes included federal deregulation and California&#x27;s Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act, signed into law by Governor Wilson.

Driving the outcome of the recall was the perception that Davis had mismanaged the events leading up to the energy crisis. It was argued that he had not fought vigorously for Californians against the energy fraud, and that he had not pushed for legislative or emergency executive action against the fraudulent companies soon enough. He was said to have signed deals agreeing to pay energy companies fixed yet inflated prices for years to come based on those paid during the crisis. Opponents felt that a corporate-friendly Republican governor could shield California politically from further corporate fraud. Others speculated that the corporations involved sought not only profit but were acting in concert with Republican political allies to cause political damage to the nationally influential Democratic governor. Still others, such as Arianna Huffington, argued that Davis&#x27;s fundraising and campaign contributions from various companies, including energy companies, rendered him unable to confront his contributors. Davis had accepted $2 million from the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, and used his political connections to pass an estimated $5 billion raise for them over the coming years. That led many people throughout California to believe Davis was guilty of corruption, even if he did not meet the standard necessary for prosecution.

==Recall election==

On February 5, 2003, anti-tax activist Ted Costa announced a plan to start a petition drive to recall Davis. Several committees were formed to collect signatures, but Costa&#x27;s Davis Recall Committee was the only one authorized by the state to submit signatures. One committee &quot;Recall Gray Davis Committee&quot;, organized by Republican political consultant Sal Russo and former Republican assemblyman Howard Kaloogian played a smaller role in drumming up support. Kaloogian served as chairman, Russo as chief strategist of the committee. After the recall both Kaloogian and Russo went on to found Move America Forward.

By law, the committee had to collect signatures from registered California voters amounting to 12% of the number of Californians who voted in the previous gubernatorial election (November 2002) for the special recall vote to take place. The organization was given the go-ahead to collect signatures on March 25, 2003. Organizers had 160 days to collect signatures. Specifically, they had to collect at least 897,158 valid signatures from registered voters by September 2, 2003.

The recall movement began slowly, largely relying on talk radio, a website, cooperative e-mail, word-of-mouth, and grassroots campaigning to drive the signature gathering. Davis derided the effort as &quot;partisan mischief&quot; by &quot;a handful of right-wing politicians&quot; and called the proponents losers; nevertheless, by mid-May, recall proponents said they had gathered 300,000 signatures. They sought to gather the necessary signatures by July in order to get the special election in the fall of 2003 instead of March 2004 during the Democratic presidential primary election, when Democratic Party turnout would presumably be higher. The effort continued to gather signatures, but the recall was far from a sure thing and the proponents were short on cash to promote their cause.

The movement took off when wealthy U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican representing San Diego, California, announced on May 6 that he would use his personal money to push the effort. All told, he contributed $1.7 million of his own money to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost a sure thing. The only question was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election to take place in late 2003 rather than in March 2004.

The Issa recall committee&#x27;s e-mail stated that California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley, belonging to the same party as the Governor, resisted certification of the recall signatures as long as possible. By mid-May, the recall organization was calling for funds to begin a lawsuit against Shelley, and publicly considered a separate recall effort for the Secretary of State (also an elected official in California). By July 23, 2003, recall advocates turned in over 110% of the required signatures, and on that date, the Secretary of State announced that the signatures had been certified and a recall election would take place. Proponents had set a goal of 1.2 million to provide a buffer in case of invalid signatures. In the end, there were 1,363,411 valid signatures out of 1,660,245 collected (897,156 required). On July 24, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante announced that Davis would face a recall election. This was to be the second gubernatorial recall election in United States history and the first in the history of California. California&#x27;s Constitution required that a recall election be held within 80 days of the date the recall petition was certified, or within 180 days if a regularly scheduled statewide election came within that time. Had the petition been certified at the deadline of September 2, the election would have been held in March 2004, the next scheduled statewide election. Instead, Bustamante had to select a date. He chose Tuesday, October 7, 2003, which was 76 days after the date of certification.

===Arguments about the recall drive===

Backers of the recall effort cited Davis&#x27;s alleged lack of leadership, combined with California&#x27;s weakened and hurt economy. According to the circulated petition:

Opponents of the recall said the situation was more complicated for several reasons. The entire United States and many of its economic trading partners had been in an economic recession. California was hit harder than other states at the end of the speculative bubble known as the &quot;dot-com bubble&quot;—from 1996 to 2000—when Silicon Valley was the center of the internet economy. California state expenditures soared when the government was flush with revenues. Some Californians blamed Davis and the state legislature for continuing to spend heavily while revenues dried up, ultimately leading to record deficits.

The California electricity crisis of 2000–2001 caused great financial damage to the state of California. The legal issues still were not resolved in time to alleviate California&#x27;s dire need for electricity, and the state instituted &quot;rolling blackouts&quot; and in some cases instituted penalties for excess energy use. In the recall campaign, Republicans and others opposed to Davis&#x27;s governance sometimes charged that Davis did not &quot;respond properly&quot; to the crisis. Most economists disagreed, believing that Davis could do little else—and anyone in the governor&#x27;s office would have had to capitulate, as Davis did, in the absence of federal help. The George W. Bush administration rejected requests for federal intervention, responding that it was California&#x27;s problem to solve. Still, subsequent revelations of corporate accounting scandals and market manipulation by some Texas-based energy companies, mainly Enron, did little to quiet the criticism of Davis&#x27;s handling of the crisis.

Davis swept into the governor&#x27;s office in 1998 in a landslide victory and a 60% approval rating as California&#x27;s economy roared to new heights during the dot-com boom. Davis took his mandate from the voters and sought out a centrist political position, refusing some demands from labor unions and teachers&#x27; organizations on the left. The Democratic Davis, already opposed by Republicans, began losing favor among members of his own party. Nevertheless, Davis&#x27;s approval ratings remained above 50%.

When the California electricity crisis slammed the state in 2001, Davis was blasted for his slow and ineffective response. His approval rating dropped into the 30s and never recovered. When the energy crisis settled down, Davis&#x27;s administration was hit with a fund-raising scandal. California had a $95 million contract with Oracle Corporation that was found to be unnecessary and overpriced by the state auditor. Three of Davis&#x27;s aides were fired or resigned after it was revealed that the governor&#x27;s technology adviser accepted a $25,000 campaign contribution shortly after the contract was signed. The money was returned, but the scandal fueled close scrutiny of Davis&#x27;s fundraising for his 2002 re-election bid.

In the 2002 primary election, Davis ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. He spent his campaign funds on attack ads against California Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, the two well-known moderates in the Republican primary. The result was that his opponent in the general election was conservative Republican and political newcomer Bill Simon, who was popular within his own party but unknown by the majority of the state population. The attacks from both sides turned off voters and suppressed turnout; Davis ultimately won with 47% of the vote. The suppressed turnout had the effect of lowering the threshold for the 2003 recall petition to qualify.

On December 18, 2002, just over a month after being reelected, Davis announced that California would face a record budget deficit possibly as high as $35 billion, a forecast $13.7 billion higher than one a month earlier. The number was finally estimated to be $38.2 billion, more than all 49 other states&#x27; deficits combined. Already suffering from low approval ratings, Davis&#x27;s numbers hit historic lows in April 2003 with 24% approval and 65% disapproval, according to a California Field Poll. Davis was almost universally disliked by both Republicans and Democrats in the state and a recall push was high. A hot-button issue that seemed to galvanize the public was the vehicle license fee increase Davis implemented under provisions of legislation passed by his predecessor which originally reduced the fees.

On June 20, 2003, the Davis administration re-instituted the full vehicle license fee, and the action withstood legal challenge. The action was a key step in the plan to close the $38 billion shortfall in the 2003–2004 budget. The increase tripled the vehicle license fee for the average car owner, and began appearing in renewal notices starting August 1. The California state budget passed in late July 2003 included the projected $4 billion in increased vehicle license fee revenue. Proponents of the Governor&#x27;s recall characterized the increase as a tax hike and used it as an issue in the recall campaign. In mid-August 2003, Davis floated a plan to reverse the increase, making up the revenue with taxes on high-income earners, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages.

When Davis was recalled and Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor in October 2003, Schwarzenegger vowed that his first act as governor would be to revoke the vehicle license fee increase. On November 17, just after his inauguration, Governor Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order S-1-03, rescinding the vehicle license fee retroactive to October 1, 2003, when the fee increase went into effect. Analysts predicted that this would add more than $4 billion to the state deficit. Schwarzenegger did not indicate how cities and counties would be reimbursed for the lost revenue they received from the license fee to support public safety and other local government activities.

===Top candidates===
In total, 135 candidates qualified for the ballot for the October 7 recall election. Several of the candidates were prominent celebrities. In the election, only four candidates received at least 1% of the vote:
*Cruz Bustamante, lieutenant governor, Democrat
*Peter Camejo, 2002 Green Party candidate for governor
*Tom McClintock, State Senator, Republican
*Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hollywood actor, Republican

===Election process===

The ballot consisted of two questions; voters could vote on one or the other, or on both. The first question asked whether Gray Davis should be recalled. It was a simple yes–no question, and if a majority voted no, then the second question would become irrelevant and Davis would remain California governor. If a majority voted yes, then Davis would be removed from office once the vote was certified, and the second question would determine his successor.

Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list of 135 candidates. Voters who voted against recalling Davis could still vote for a candidate to replace him in case the recall vote succeeded. The candidate receiving the most votes (a plurality) would then become the next governor of California. Certification by the Secretary of State of California would require completion within 39 days of the election, and history indicated that it could require that entire time frame to certify the statewide election results. Once the results were certified, a newly elected governor would have to be sworn into office within 10 days.

=== Filing requirements and candidates ===
Those Californians wishing to run for governor were given until August 9 to file. The requirements to run were relatively low and attracted a number of interesting and strange candidates. A California citizen needed only to gather 65 signatures from their own party and pay a nonrefundable $3,500 fee to become a candidate, or in lieu of the fee collect up to 10,000 signatures from any party, the fee being prorated by the fraction of 10,000 valid signatures the candidate filed. No candidate in fact collected more than a handful of signatures-in-lieu, so that all paid almost the entire fee. In addition, candidates from recognized third parties were allowed on the ballot with no fee if they could collect 150 signatures from their own party.

The low requirements attracted many &quot;average Joes&quot; with no political experience to file as well as several celebrity candidates. Many prominent potential candidates chose not to run. These included Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, widely regarded as the most popular statewide office-holding Democrat in California, who cited her own experience with a recall drive while she was mayor of San Francisco.

Darrell Issa, who bankrolled the recall effort and had said he would run for governor, abruptly dropped out of the race on August 7 among accusations that he had bankrolled the recall effort solely to get himself into office. Issa claimed that Schwarzenegger&#x27;s decision to run did not affect his decision and he dropped out because he was assured that there were several strong candidates running in the recall. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; claimed that Davis&#x27;s attacks on Issa&#x27;s &quot;checkered past&quot; and polls showing strong Republican support for Schwarzenegger caused Issa to withdraw.

Former Mayor of Los Angeles Richard Riordan and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger (a fellow Republican) agreed that only one of them would run; when Schwarzenegger announced on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that he would be a candidate, Riordan dropped out of the race. Riordan was surprised and those close to him say he was angered when he learned Schwarzenegger was running. Riordan did end up endorsing Schwarzenegger, but his endorsement was described as terse and matter-of-fact in contrast to his usually effusive way.

Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante himself entered the race and quickly became the Democratic frontrunner, although he continued to oppose the recall and urged Californians to vote against it. State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi (a Democrat) announced on August 7 that he would be a candidate for governor. Just two days later and only hours before the deadline to file, he announced &quot;I will not engage in this election as a candidate&quot;, adding &quot;this recall election has become a circus&quot;. Garamendi had been under tremendous pressure to drop out from fellow Democrats who feared a split of the Democratic vote between him and Bustamante, should the recall succeed.

=== Campaign ===
On September 3, five top candidates—independent Arianna Huffington, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, Green Party candidate Peter Camejo, Republican State Senator Tom McClintock, and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth—participated in a live television debate. Noticeably absent was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who opponents charged was not adequately prepared. Schwarzenegger had repeatedly stated that he would not participate in such events until later in the election cycle. Prior to this first debate, Governor Davis spent 30 minutes answering questions from a panel of journalists and voters.

Due to the media attention focused on some candidates, GSN held a game show debate entitled &quot;Who Wants to Be Governor of California? – The Debating Game&quot;, a political game show featuring six candidates unlikely to win the election, including former child star Gary Coleman and porn star Mary Carey. Several candidates who would still be listed on the ballot dropped out of the campaign before the October 7 election. On August 23, Republican Bill Simon (the 2002 party nominee) announced he was dropping out. He said: &quot;There are too many Republicans in this race and the people of our state simply cannot risk a continuation of the Gray Davis legacy.&quot; Simon did not endorse any candidates at the time, but several weeks later he endorsed front-runner Arnold Schwarzenegger, as did Darrell Issa, who had not filed for the race. On September 9, former MLB commissioner and Los Angeles Olympic Committee President Peter Ueberroth withdrew his candidacy in the recall election.
On September 24, the remaining top five candidates (Schwarzenegger, Bustamante, Huffington, McClintock, and Camejo) gathered in the University Ballroom at California State University, Sacramento, for a live televised debate that resembled the red-carpet premiere of a movie in Hollywood. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s marquee name attracted large crowds, a carnival atmosphere, and an army of hundreds of credentialed media from around the world. While the candidate and his staff rode on buses named &quot;Running Man&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;, the reporters&#x27; buses were named after &quot;Predator&quot;. The aftermath of the debate was swift. On September 30, author Arianna Huffington withdrew her candidacy on the &quot;Larry King Live&quot; television program and announced that she was opposing the recall entirely in light of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s surge in the polls. Apparently in response to her withdrawal, Bustamante endorsed her plan for public financing of election campaigns, an intended anti-corruption measure.

Some replacement ballot candidates urged voters to vote &quot;no&quot; on recall the recall question. An endorsement of voting &quot;no&quot; on the recall was included in several candidates&#x27; official statements, including those of Bustamante, Eric Korevaar, Christopher Ranken, C.T. Weber and Tim Sylvester.

=== Election issues ===

====Concurrent alternatives====
On July 29, 2003, federal judge Barry Moskowitz ruled section 11382 of the California election code unconstitutional. The provision required that only those voters who had voted in favor of the recall could cast a vote for a candidate for governor. The judge ruled that a voter could vote for or against the recall election and still vote for a replacement candidate. Secretary of State Kevin Shelley did not contest the ruling, thereby setting a legal precedent.

====Availability of Spanish-speaking poll workers====
In August, a federal judge in San Jose announced that he was considering issuing an order postponing the recall election. Activists in Monterey County had filed suit, claiming that Monterey County, and other counties of California affected by the Voting Rights Act were violating the act by announcing that, because of budgetary constraints, they were planning on hiring fewer Spanish-speaking poll watchers, and were going to cut back by almost half the number of polling places. On September 5, a three-member panel of federal judges ruled that the county&#x27;s election plans did not constitute a violation of the federal Voting Rights Act.

====Punch card ballots====
A lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) claimed that the use of the &quot;hanging chad&quot; style punch-card ballots still in use in six California counties (Los Angeles, Mendocino, Sacramento, San Diego, Santa Clara, and Solano) were in violation of fair election laws. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles ruled on August 20, 2003, that the election would not be delayed because of the punch-card ballot problems. There was an estimate that up 40,000 voters in those heavily minority districts might be disenfranchised, if the election were not postponed to remedy the difficulty. His ruling was appealed, and heard by three judges in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. On September 15, the judges issued a unanimous ruling postponing the recall election until March 2004, on the grounds that the existence of allegedly obsolete voting equipment in those six counties violated the equal protection constitutional guarantee, thus overruling the lower district court which had rejected this argument.

Recall proponents questioned why punch-card ballots were adequate enough to elect Governor Davis, but were not good enough to recall him. Proponents planned to appeal the postponement to the U.S. Supreme Court; however, an 11-judge &quot;en banc&quot; panel, also from the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and quickly and carefully canvassed by Judge Alex Kozinski, gathered to rehear the controversial case. On the morning of September 23, the panel reversed the three-judge ruling in a unanimous decision, arguing that the concerns about the punch-card ballots were outweighed by the harm that would be done by postponing the election.

Further legal appeals were discussed but did not occur. The ACLU announced it would not make an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Davis was widely quoted in the press as saying &quot;Let&#x27;s just get it over with&quot;, and the election proceeded as planned on October 7.

===Polling===
Public opinion was divided on the recall, with many passionately-held positions on both sides of the recall election. Californians were fairly united in their disapproval of Governor Davis&#x27;s handling of the state, with his approval numbers in the mid-20s. On the question of whether he should be recalled, Californians were more divided, but polls in the weeks leading up to the election consistently showed that a majority would vote to remove him.

Polls showed that the two leading candidates, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat, and Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, were neck and neck with about 25–35% of the vote each, and Bustamante with a slight lead in most polls. Republican State Senator Tom McClintock also polled in the double-digits. Remaining candidates polled in the low single digits. Polls in the final week leading up to the election showed support for Davis slipping and support for Schwarzenegger growing.

Many observers outside California and some members of the press consistently called the recall chaos and madness as well as a media circus and nightmare. With the candidacies of a few celebrities and many regular Californians, the entire affair became a joke to some (there were tongue-in-cheek references to Schwarzenegger&#x27;s role in the science fiction film &quot;Total Recall&quot;) as well as an &quot;only-in-California&quot; event. Nevertheless, most Californians took the recall seriously, with the future of the governor&#x27;s office at stake. In the months before the election, 380,000 Californians registered to vote, for a total of 15.3 million—more registered voters than there had been in the three previous presidential elections.

=== Predictions ===
==Results==
The October 7 ballot had two questions. The first question was whether Gray Davis, the sitting governor, should be recalled; those voting on it were 55.4% in favor of recall and 44.6% opposed. The second question was who would replace the governor in the event that a majority voted to recall him. Among those voting on the potential replacement, Arnold Schwarzenegger received a plurality of 48.6%, surpassing Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante&#x27;s 31.5%, about a 3-to-2 ratio. Republican Tom McClintock received 13.4% of the vote – less than half the share of the candidate he trailed. Green Party candidate Peter Camejo polled 2.8%, trailing McClintock by almost four-to-one. Each remaining candidate polled 0.6% or less.

Schwarzenegger&#x27;s votes exceeded those for the next five candidates combined, despite the presumed division of Republican voters between him and McClintock. There were also more votes for Schwarzenegger (4,206,284) than votes against recalling Davis (4,007,783), avoiding the theoretical scenario of the replacement having less support than the recalled governor. At 10 p.m. local time, Davis conceded that he had lost to Schwarzenegger. He said &quot;We&#x27;ve had a lot of good nights over the last 20 years, but tonight the people did decide that it&#x27;s time for someone else to serve, and I accept their judgment.&quot; About 40 minutes later, in his acceptance speech, Schwarzenegger said: &quot;Today California has given me the greatest gift of all: You&#x27;ve given me your trust by voting for me. I will do everything I can to live up to that trust. I will not fail you.&quot;

Following the election, all 58 of California&#x27;s counties had 28 days (until November 4, 2003) each to conduct a countywide canvass of their votes. Counties used this time to count any absentee ballots or provisional ballots not yet counted, to reconcile the number of signatures on the roster of registered voters with the number of ballots recorded on the ballot statement, to count any valid write-in votes, to reproduce any damaged ballots, if necessary, and to conduct a hand count of the ballots cast in 1% of the precincts, chosen at random by the elections official. Counties then had seven days from the conclusion of canvassing (November 11, 2003, 35 days after the election) to submit their final vote totals to the California Secretary of State&#x27;s office. The Secretary of State had to certify the final statewide vote by 39 days (until November 15) after the election. The vote was officially certified on November 14, 2003. Once the vote was certified, governor-elect Schwarzenegger had to be sworn into office within ten days. His inauguration took place on November 17, 2003.


Note that San Bernardino County did not report write-in votes for individual candidates.

<doc id="291228" wikidata="Q1432146" url="?curid=291228" title="Nashville International Airport">
<text>Nashville International Airport is a public/military airport in the southeastern section of Nashville, Tennessee, United States. Established in 1937, its original name was Berry Field, from which its ICAO and IATA identifiers are derived. The current terminal was built in 1987, and the airport took its current name in 1988. Nashville International Airport has four runways and covers of land. It is the busiest airport in Tennessee, with more boardings and arrivals than all other airports in the state combined.

The airport was first served by American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines, and was a hub for American in the late 20th century. The airport now offers service to 99 destinations across the United States as well as a number of international destinations. In fiscal year 2022, it averaged 600 daily aircraft movements.

Joint Base Berry Field, formerly Berry Field Air National Guard Base, is located at Nashville International Airport. The base is home to the 118th Wing and the 1/230th Air Cavalry Squadron Tennessee Army National Guard.

==History==
===Origins===
Nashville&#x27;s first airport was Hampton Field, which operated until 1921. It was replaced by Blackwood Field in the Hermitage community, which operated between 1921 and 1928. The first airlines to serve Nashville, American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines, flew out of Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Rutherford County.

By 1935, the need for an airport larger and closer to the city than Sky Harbor Airport was realized and a citizens&#x27; committee was organized by Mayor Hilary Ewing Howse to choose a location. A plot along Dixie Parkway (now Murfreesboro Pike) composed of four farms was selected, and construction began in 1936 as one of the first major Works Progress Administration projects in the area. The airport was dedicated on November 1, 1936, as Berry Field, named after Col. Harry S. Berry, the Tennessee administrator for the Works Progress Administration. It opened in June 1937 with much fanfare, including parades, an air show, and an aerial bombardment display by the 105th Aero Squadron, which was based at the field. Passenger service began in mid-July through American Airlines and Eastern Airlines, both of which operated Douglas DC-3s. The new airport had three asphalt runways, a three-story passenger terminal, a control tower, two hangars and a beacon, and was built at a cost of $1.2 million. In its first year Berry Field served 189,000 passengers.

During World War II, the airfield was requisitioned by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command as the headquarters for the 4th Ferrying Command for movement of new aircraft overseas. During this time, the Federal government expanded the airport to . At the end of the war, the airport was returned to the control of the city, with a number of facilities remaining for support of the tenant unit of the Tennessee National Guard.

The airport had been enlarged by the military during World War II, but in 1958 the City Aviation Department started planning to expand and modernize the airport. In 1961, a new terminal opened off of Briley Parkway, west of runway 2L. 1961 also saw the first scheduled jets at Berry Field, American Airlines 720/720Bs. For the first time, more than half a million people passed through the airport when the six airlines that served Nashville carried 532,790 passengers. These renovations also included expansion of an existing runway, with 2L/20R being extended by , and the construction of a new crosswind runway, 13/31. In 1962, Nashville became the first municipal airport in the United States with a public reading room when the Nashville Public Library opened a branch inside the terminal.

By the 1970s, the airport was again in need of expansion and modernization. In 1973, the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a plan for the long-term growth of the airport; the plan included a new terminal and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to increase capacity by reducing time between takeoffs and landings.

In the early 1980s, the MNAA commissioned Robert Lamb Hart, in association with the firm of Gresham, Smith and Partners, to design a modern terminal; construction began on the opposite side of the existing two crossing runways in 1984 and was completed in 1987. The new terminal had three main concourses and a smaller commuter concourse radiating from a distinctive three-story atrium. An international wing was built in Concourse A; the airport was renamed Nashville International Airport/Berry Field. It is now rare to see the &quot;Berry Field&quot; portion used, but the airport&#x27;s IATA code (BNA) is short for Berry Field Nashville, and the military facilities at the airport are still commonly known by this name. In 1989, a new parallel runway (2R/20L) was opened for use.

===Hub years and aftermath===
American Airlines announced in 1985 that it would establish a hub at Nashville, and it officially opened in 1986. The hub was intended to compete with Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines and Piedmont Airlines for north–south traffic in the eastern United States. Besides providing nonstop flights to many cities in the U.S. and Canada, American also operated a transatlantic flight from Nashville to London. The American hub was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area. Nonetheless, the hub operated at a loss even during its heyday in the early 1990s, like the similarly sized hub American had at Raleigh/Durham.

American&#x27;s service peaked in 1993 with 265 daily departures to 79 cities, after which flights were gradually scaled back until the hub closed in 1995. American cited the aftermath of the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. In the aftermath of the hub closure, Southwest Airlines gradually filled the void by subleasing American&#x27;s gates and seizing a majority of the Nashville market.

In 2002, Embraer Aircraft Maintenance Services (EAMS) selected Nashville as the location for its Regional Airline Support Facility, which was built on the site of the demolished 1961 terminal building.

In October 2006, the Nashville Metropolitan Airport Authority started an extensive renovation of the terminal building, designed by Architectural Alliance of Minneapolis and Thomas, Miller &amp; Partners, PLLC, of Nashville, the first since the terminal opened 19 years prior. Phase one of the project involved updating and expanding food and vending services, improving flight information systems, and construction of a new consolidated security checkpoint for all terminals. Phase one was completed in 2009. Phase two of the project involved the expansion of the ticketing and check-in areas, the construction and renovation of bathrooms, and the renovation of the baggage claim areas. Completion of the second phase of the renovation project occurred in 2011. The renovated terminal was named the Robert C. H. Mathews Jr. Terminal in honor of a MNAA board chair in 2011.

In addition to passenger amenities in the terminal and parking areas, the renovations included improvements to the airport&#x27;s infrastructure. The largest project was the complete demolition and rebuilding of Runway 2L/20R, which was completed in August 2010. In addition to the rebuilding of Runway 2L/20R, Runway 2C/20C was closed from September through December 2010 for pavement and concrete rehabilitation. BNA&#x27;s of tarmac were also rehabilitated during this project after being funded entirely by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allotments.

===Recent years===

In recent years, the airport has seen rapid growth in both passengers and flights. Southwest Airlines, long the dominant airline in Nashville, has been building up Nashville into one of their top destinations, including opening a crew base at the airport in May 2024. In May 2018, British Airways inaugurated nonstop service to London, restoring transatlantic service for the first time since American ended their London flight in 1995.

To accommodate growth, the Metro Nashville Airport Authority has commenced two expansion programs, entitled &quot;BNA Vision&quot; and &quot;New Horizons&quot; respectively, which are overhauling and expanding many of the airport&#x27;s facilities. The BNA Vision upgrades consisted of expanding concourses, constructing a new international arrivals facility, constructing new parking garages and an onsite hotel, amongst other things. The New Horizons upgrades will consist of additional concourse expansions, upgrading the baggage handling system and expanding the terminal roadway. BNA Vision was mostly completed in 2023, though the hotel opened in March 2024. New Horizons is scheduled to be completed in 2028.

On January 17, 2025, Tennessee State Representative Todd Warner (R-Chapel Hill) filed a bill in the Tennessee House of Representatives to rename the airport Trump International Airport, for U.S. President Donald J. Trump.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===

The airport has one terminal with five concourses and a total of 54 gates. All non pre–cleared international flights are processed in Concourse T. Gates C4-C11 are located on a satellite concourse.

*Concourse A contains 6 gates.
*Concourse B contains 10 gates.
*Concourse C contains 26 gates.
*Concourse D contains 6 gates.
*Concourse T contains 6 gates.

==== Terminal carpeting ====

For roughly a decade, the airport&#x27;s terminal floors were carpeted with a unique pattern, with swirling patterns layered on top of shades of brown and other neutral colors. An (unofficial) fan Instagram account for the carpet started in 2018 became a significant success, amassing over 28,000 followers and arguably helping establish the carpet as a fan favorite among the public. In August 2020, despite a petition for the airport to keep the carpet, the airport announced it planned to replace the carpet mostly with terrazzo tiles but also, in some places, with a differently patterned carpet. For some time after the announcement, the airport&#x27;s online store sold doormats made of unused tiles of the old carpet.

===Military facilities===
Berry Field Air National Guard Base (ANGB) was located on the premises of Nashville International Airport. Since 1937 it hosted the 118th Airlift Wing (AW). Berry Field faced the removal of its flying mission with the BRAC 2005 recommendation to realign its assets to other units. It initially averted this fate by taking on a new role as the C-130 International Training Center. The C-130s assigned to the unit were eventually transferred and the 118th AW became the 118th Wing, supporting unmanned aircraft operations.

Approximately 1,500 personnel are assigned to both headquarters, Tennessee Air National Guard and to the 118 Air Wing at Berry Air National Guard Base. Approximately 400 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by approximately 1100 traditional part-time air guardsmen.

The last C-130 left Nashville in December 2012, and on April 17, 2015, the first UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters belonging to the Tennessee Army National Guard&#x27;s 1/230th Air Cavalry Squadron relocated to what is now known as Joint Base Berry Field from Army Aviation Support Facility #1 in Smyrna, Tennessee.

== Access ==

=== Car ===
The airport is served by I-40, which has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance ramp to the terminal road. The airport can also be accessed via the Donelson Pike exit. Taxis and ride share pick up in the Ground Transportation Center on Level 1 of Terminal Garage 2.

=== Public transportation ===

==== Bus ====
The WeGo Route 18 bus connects the airport to downtown.

==== Future rail service ====
Nashville International Airport could eventually be connected to downtown Nashville via a light rail line, and the ongoing expansion allows for a connection to be made in the plaza on top of the parking garages. Proposals for Nashville–Atlanta passenger rail include a station stop at the airport.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On January 1, 1947, a privately operated Douglas C-47A on final approach crashed into a house less than a mile from the airport. There were no fatalities reported, however sixteen passengers and crew on the aircraft and two persons on the ground were injured. 
* On September 28, 1963, an Eastern Air Lines Douglas DC-7 crashed on landing after the aircraft&#x27;s nose gear collapsed. All 45 passengers and crew survived.
* On May 31, 1985, a Gulfstream I crashed immediately after takeoff due to failure of the left engine. Both people on board were killed.
* On February 3, 1988, American Airlines Flight 132, an MD-83, suffered an in-flight fire on its way from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport to Nashville. The passengers and flight attendants noticed smoke emanating from the cargo hold as the flight approached Nashville. The pilots were notified but no emergency was declared until after the plane had landed and pulled onto the taxiway. The plane was evacuated as fire firefighting vehicles arrived. There were 18 injuries to passengers, crew, firefighters and other personnel on the ground due smoke inhalation and during the evacuation.
* On January 29, 1996, a United States Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter crashed shortly after takeoff. The jet struck a housing development and erupted into a fireball, killing the pilot and four individuals on the ground.
* On September 9, 1999, a TWA McDonnell Douglas DC-9 suffered a landing gear collapse after a hard touchdown. All 46 passengers and crew survived.
* On October 29, 2013, a Cessna 172R departing from Windsor International Airport in Windsor, Ontario, Canada deviated from its declared destination of Pelee Island Airport, flew south to Nashville, and circled the airport for two hours before crashing on Runway 2C and bursting into flames, killing the sole occupant. The burned wreckage went unnoticed for nearly six hours, as it had been obscured by dense fog, before being spotted by another general aviation aircraft. The NTSB investigation of the crash determined that the pilot, Michael Callan, was intoxicated at the time of the crash. Additionally, he falsely listed singer Taylor Swift as his next of kin, and had written letters with signs of stalking to her, leading investigators to believe that he flew to Nashville to stalk her.
*On December 15, 2015, Southwest Airlines Flight 31, a Boeing 737-300, from Houston, Texas, exited the taxiway and rolled into a ditch shortly after arriving into Nashville as the airplane was entering the terminal ramp because of the nosegear collapsing. All 138 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane and bussed into the airport.
*On December 27, 2019, Southwest Airlines Flight 975, a Boeing 737-700 from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, suffered a bird strike while on approach to the airport, damaging the wing and horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft was able to land without injuries and was later returned to service following repairs.

<text>In literature, an epigraph is a phrase, quotation, or poem that is set at the beginning of a document, monograph or section or chapter thereof. The epigraph may serve as a preface to the work; as a summary; as a counter-example; or as a link from the work to a wider literary canon, with the purpose of either inviting comparison or enlisting a conventional context.

A book may have an overall epigraph that is part of the front matter, or one for each chapter.

==Examples==
* As the epigraph to &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, Tom Clancy quotes Winston Churchill in the context of thermonuclear war: &quot;Why, you may take the most gallant sailor, the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier, put them at a table together – what do you get? The sum of their fears.&quot; 
* Sir Walter Scott frequently used epigraphs in his historical novels, including throughout his Waverley novels.
* The long quotation from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; that prefaces T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; is part of a speech by one of the damned in Dante&#x27;s Hell.
* The epigraph to E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot; quotes Scott Joplin&#x27;s instructions to those who play his music, &quot;Do not play this piece fast. It is never right to play ragtime fast.&quot;
*The epigraph to Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; is John 12:24: &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.&quot;
*The epigraph to Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Gerontion&quot; is a quotation from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. 
*Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; uses the line &quot;Mistah Kurtz, he dead&quot; from Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as one of its two epigraphs.
* As an epigraph to &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, Ernest Hemingway quotes Gertrude Stein, &quot;You are all a lost generation.&quot;
* The epigraph to Theodore Herzl&#x27;s &quot;Altneuland&quot; is &quot;If you will it, it is no dream...&quot; which became a slogan of the Zionist movement.
* Louis Antoine de Saint-Just&#x27;s line &quot;Nobody can rule guiltlessly&quot; appears before chapter one in Arthur Koestler&#x27;s 1940 anti-totalitarian novel &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;.
* A Samuel Johnson quotation serves as an epigraph in Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;: &quot;He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.&quot;
* Stephen King uses many epigraphs in his writing, usually to mark the beginning of another section in a novel. An unusual example is &quot;The Stand&quot; wherein he uses lyrics from certain songs to express the metaphor used in a particular part.

* Jack London uses the first stanza of John Myers O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem &quot;Atavism&quot; as the epigraph to &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;.
* Cormac McCarthy opens his 1985 novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; with three epigraphs: quotations from French writer and philosopher Paul Valéry, from German Christian mystic and Gnostic Jacob Boehme, and a 1982 news clipping from the &quot;Yuma Sun&quot; reporting the claim of members of an Ethiopian archeological excavation that a fossilized skull three hundred millennia old seemed to have been scalped.
* The epigraphs to the preamble of Georges Perec&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;La Vie mode d&#x27;emploi&quot;) and to the book as a whole warn the reader that tricks are going to be played and that all will not be what it seems.

* J. K. Rowling&#x27;s novels frequently begin with epigraphs relating to the themes explored. For example, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; opens with two: a quotation from Aeschylus&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; and a quotation from William Penn.
* Quotation from Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The State&quot; on the title page of every issue of &quot;The Bohemian Review&quot;, a magazine endorsing independence of Czechs and Slovaks to Austria-Hungary in 1917–1918 (example).

===Fictional quotations===
Some writers use as epigraphs fictional quotations that purport to be related to the fiction of the work itself. Examples include:

====In films====
* The film &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; opens with a fictional quotation from the &quot;&quot;.
* The film &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; opens with a fictional quotation attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt for comedic effect.

====In literature====
* Some science fiction works, such as Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;, Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series, and Jack McKinney&#x27;s &quot;Robotech&quot; novelizations use quotations from an imagined future history of the period of their story.
* Fantasy literature may also include epigraphs. For example, Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea&quot; series includes epigraphs supposedly quoted from the epic poetry of the Earthsea archipelago.
* Elizabeth C. Bunce&#x27;s Edgar Award-winning Myrtle Hardcastle mystery series, beginning with &quot;Premeditated Myrtle&quot; includes epigraphs by the fictional 19th century scholar H.M. Hardcastle at the beginning of each chapter of the five-book series.
* The first and last books of Diane Duane&#x27;s &quot;Rihannsu&quot; series of &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels pair quotations from &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot; with imagined epigraphs from Romulan literature.
* F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; carries on title page a poem called from its first hemistich &quot;Then Wear the Gold Hat,&quot; purportedly signed by Thomas Parke D&#x27;Invilliers. D&#x27;Invilliers is a character in Fitzgerald&#x27;s first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. 
**This cliché is parodied by Diana Wynne Jones in &quot;The Tough Guide To Fantasyland&quot;.
* Jasper Fforde&#x27;s &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; has quotations from supposedly future works about the action of the story.
* John Green&#x27;s &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot; has a quotation from a fictitious novel, &quot;An Imperial Affliction&quot;, which features prominently as a part of the story. 
* Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Half&quot; has epigraphs taken from the fictitious novels written by the protagonist.
* Dean Koontz&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Counted Sorrows&quot; began as a fictional book of poetry from which Koontz would &quot;quote&quot; when no suitable existing option was available; Koontz simply wrote all these epigraphs himself. Many fans, rather than realizing the work was Koontz&#x27; own invention, apparently believed it was a real, but rare, volume; Koontz later collected the existing verse into an actual book.
* The &quot;Ring Verse&quot; at the beginning of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; describes the Rings of Power, the central plot device of the novel.
* Akame Majyo&#x27;s &quot;Time Anthology&quot; begins each chapter with an excerpt from a fictional grimoire.
* Brandon Sanderson, in his &quot;Mistborn&quot; and &quot;Stormlight Archive&quot; series uses various epigraphs including letters between various gods, so-called &quot;death rattles&quot; and quotes from the villain&#x27;s diary.
* Edward Gorey&#x27;s &quot;The Unstrung Harp&quot; is not only about a fictitious novel, but its author thinks of a fictional verse for its epigraph.

*Incipit, the first few words of a text, employed as an identifying label
*Flavor text, applied to games and toys
*Prologue, an opening to a story that establishes context and may give background

<text>Marquis reagent is used as a simple spot-test to presumptively identify alkaloids as well as other compounds. It is composed of a mixture of formaldehyde and concentrated sulfuric acid, which is dripped onto the substance being tested. The United States Department of Justice method for producing the reagent is the addition of 100 mL of concentrated (95–98%) sulfuric acid to 5 mL of 40% formaldehyde. Different compounds produce different color reactions. Methanol may be added to slow down the reaction process to allow better observation of the colour change.

==History==
Marquis reagent was first discovered in 1896 and described by the Russian (Estonian) pharmacologist, Eduard Markus (1871–1944) () in his magister dissertation in 1896; and named after him, and was tested for the first time at the University of Dorpat. The reagent should be stored in the freezer for maximum shelf life.

It is the primary presumptive test used in Ecstasy reagent testing kits. It can also be used to test for such substances as opiates (e.g. codeine, heroin), and phenethylamines (e.g. 2C-B, mescaline).

The test is performed by scraping off a small amount of the substance and adding a drop of the reagent (which is initially clear and colorless). The results are analyzed by viewing the color of the resulting mixture, and by the time taken for the change in color to become apparent:

==Results==
Reagent test results develop very quickly and due to reactions with moisture and oxygen in air, any changes after the first 60 seconds should be discarded.


==Mechanism==
The colour change from morphine is proposed to be a result of two molecules of morphine and two molecules of formaldehyde condensing to the dimeric product which is protonated to the oxocarbenium salt.

<text>An occultation is an event that occurs when one object is hidden from the observer by another object that passes between them. The term is often used in astronomy, but can also refer to any situation in which an object in the foreground blocks from view (occults) an object in the background. In this general sense, occultation applies to the visual scene observed from low-flying aircraft (or computer-generated imagery) when foreground objects obscure distant objects dynamically, as the scene changes over time.

If the closer body does not entirely conceal the farther one, the event is called a &quot;transit&quot;. Both transit and occultation may be referred to generally as &quot;occlusion&quot;; and if a shadow is cast onto the observer, it is called an eclipse.

The symbol for an occultation, and especially a solar eclipse, is (U+1F775 🝵).

== Occultations by the Moon ==


The term occultation is most frequently used to describe lunar occultations, those relatively frequent occasions when the Moon passes in front of a star during the course of its orbital motion around the Earth. Since the Moon, with an angular speed with respect to the stars of 0.55 arcsec/s or 2.7 μrad/s, has a very thin atmosphere and stars have an angular diameter of at most 0.057 arcseconds or 0.28 μrad, a star that is occulted by the Moon will disappear or reappear in 0.1 seconds or less on the Moon&#x27;s edge, or limb. Events that take place on the Moon&#x27;s dark limb are of particular interest to observers, because the lack of glare allows easier observation and timing.

The Moon&#x27;s orbit is inclined slightly with respect to the ecliptic meaning any star with an ecliptic latitude between –6.6 and +6.6 degrees may be occulted by it. Three first magnitude stars appear well within that band – Regulus, Spica, and Antares – meaning they may be occulted by the Moon or by planets. Occultations of Aldebaran are in this epoch only possible by the Moon, because the planets pass Aldebaran to the north. Neither planetary nor lunar occultations of Pollux are currently possible, however several thousand years ago lunar occultations were possible. Some notably close deep-sky objects, such as the Pleiades, can be occulted by the Moon.



Within a few kilometres of the edge of an occultation&#x27;s predicted path, referred to as its northern or southern limit, an observer may see the star intermittently disappearing and reappearing as the irregular limb of the Moon moves past the star, creating what is known as a &quot;grazing lunar occultation&quot;. From an observational and scientific standpoint, these &quot;grazes&quot; are the most dynamic and interesting of lunar occultations.

The accurate timing of lunar occultations is performed regularly by (primarily amateur) astronomers. Lunar occultations timed to an accuracy of a few tenths of a second have various scientific uses, particularly in refining our knowledge of lunar topography. Photoelectric analysis of lunar occultations have also discovered some stars to be very close visual or spectroscopic binaries. Some angular diameters of stars have been measured by timing of lunar occultations, which is useful for determining effective temperatures of those stars. Early radio astronomers found occultations of radio sources by the Moon valuable for determining their exact positions, because the long wavelength of radio waves limited the resolution available through direct observation. This was crucial for the unambiguous identification of the radio source 3C 273 with the optical quasar and its jet, and a fundamental prerequisite for Maarten Schmidt&#x27;s discovery of the cosmological nature of quasars.

Several times during the year the Moon can be seen occulting a planet. Since planets, unlike stars, have significant angular sizes, lunar occultations of planets will create a narrow zone on Earth from which a partial occultation of the planet will occur. An observer located within that narrow zone could observe the planet&#x27;s disk partly blocked by the slowly moving Moon. The same mechanism can be seen with the Sun, where observers on Earth will view it as a solar eclipse. Therefore, a total solar eclipse is essentially the Moon occulting the Sun.

== Occultation by planets ==

Stars may also be occulted by planets. Occultations of bright stars are rare. In 1959, Venus occulted Regulus, and the next occultation of a bright star (also Regulus by Venus) will be in 2044. Uranus&#x27;s rings were first discovered when that planet occulted a star in 1977. On 3 July 1989, Saturn passed in front of the 5th magnitude star 28 Sagittarii. Pluto occulted stars in 1988, 2002, and 2006, allowing its tenuous atmosphere to be studied via atmospheric limb sounding.

In rare cases, one planet can pass in front of another. If the nearer planet appears larger than the more distant one, the event is called a mutual planetary occultation. The last occultation or transit occurred on 3 January 1818 and the next will occur on 22 November 2065, in both cases involving the same two planets—Venus and Jupiter.

Jupiter rarely occults Saturn. This is one of the rarest events known, with the next occurrence on February 10, 7541. This event is visible worldwide since the duo would be positioned almost in opposition to the sun, in the border line between the constellations of Orion and Taurus. In some areas this occultation cannot be seen, but when viewed through even small telescopes, both gas giants appear to be in the same part of view through the eyepiece. The last one occurred in 6857 B.C.E.

== Occultations by smaller bodies ==

A further set of occultations are those when a small Solar System body or dwarf planet passes in front of a star, temporarily blocking its light as seen from Earth. These occultations are useful for measuring the size and position of body much more precisely than can be done by other means. A cross-sectional profile of the shape of a body can even be determined if a number of observers at different, nearby, locations observe the occultation. Occultations have been used to calculate the diameter of trans-Neptunian objects such as , Ixion and Varuna. Software for coordinating observations is available for download at http://www.occultwatcher.net/

In addition, mutual occultation and eclipsing events can occur between a primary and its satellite. A large number of moons have been discovered analyzing the photometric light curves of small bodies and detecting a second, superimposed brightness variation, from which an orbital period for the satellite (secondary), and a secondary-to-primary diameter-ratio (for the binary system) can often be derived.

=== Examples ===
==== Asteroids ====
* On 29 May 1983, 2 Pallas occulted the naked-eye bright spectroscopic binary star 1 Vulpeculae along a track across the southern United States, northern Mexico, and north parts of the Caribbean. Observations from 130 different locations defined the shape of about two-thirds of the asteroid, and detected the secondary companion of the bright binary star; these observations, taken together with those of a separate occultation by Pallas in 1979, provided a complete figure for the asteroid eight years before any asteroid was visited by a spacecraft (the much smaller Gaspra by Galileo in October 1991).
* On 12 March 2009 nine asteroids (85 Io, 247 Eukrate, 1585 Union, 201 Penelope, 70 Panopaea, 980 Anacostia, 2448 Sholokhov, 1746 Brouwer, and 191 Kolga) occulted notable magnitude stars, viewed from given places on the Earth.
* According to the 1998 European Asteroidal Occultation Results from Euraster, 39 Laetitia was observed by over 38 observatories in one occultation on 3 March 1998, which resulted in many chords being determined.
* The star Regulus was occulted by the asteroid 163 Erigone in the early morning of 20 March 2014. This was the brightest occultation of an asteroid ever predicted to occur over a populated area. As the main belt asteroid passed in front of the star its shadow swept across Nassau and Suffolk counties, all of New York City and the Hudson River Valley, with the center of the shadow path following a line roughly connecting New York City, White Plains, Newburgh, Oneonta, Rome, and Pulaski before crossing into Canada near Belleville and North Bay, Ontario. Bad weather obscured the occultation.
* The star Betelgeuse was partially occulted by the asteroid 319 Leona in the early morning of 12 December 2023. The event could only be viewed over a small strip of America, Europe, and Asia.

==== Distant objects ====
* Preliminary results of a 6 November 2010 occultation by the dwarf planet Eris of a magnitude 17 star in the constellation of Cetus placed an upper limit on Eris&#x27;s diameter of 2320 km, making it almost the same size as Pluto. Due to their slower movement through the night sky, occultations by TNOs are far less common than by asteroids in the main-belt.
* The dwarf planet Haumea was observed in a stellar transit on 21 January 2017, identifying a ring.
* On 3 June 2017, a star was occulted by the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth, the first such occultation detected. The multi-faceted campaign involved cooperation from the Argentinian government (including local governments – a major highway was closed for two hours, and street lights were turned off, in order to preclude light pollution), three spacecraft, 24 portable ground-based telescopes, and NASA&#x27;s SOFIA airborne observatory in &quot;the most challenging stellar occultation in the history of astronomy,&quot; in an effort spanning six months.

== Double occultations ==

The Moon or another celestial body can occult multiple celestial bodies at the same time.

Because of its relatively large angular diameter the Moon, at any given time, occults an indeterminate number of stars and galaxies. However the Moon occulting (obscuring) two bright objects (e.g. two planets or a bright star and a planet) simultaneously is extremely rare and can be seen only from a small part of the world: the last such event was on 23 April 1998 when it occulted Venus and Jupiter for observers on Ascension Island.

== Artificial occultations ==

The &quot;Big Occulting Steerable Satellite (BOSS)&quot; was a proposed satellite that would work in conjunction with a telescope to detect planets around distant stars. The satellite consists of a large, very lightweight sheet, and a set of maneuvering thrusters and navigation systems. It would maneuver to a position along the line of sight between the telescope and a nearby star. The satellite would thereby block the radiation from the star, permitting the orbiting planets to be observed.

The proposed satellite would have a dimension of , a mass of about 600 kg, and maneuver by means of an ion drive engine in combination with using the sheet as a light sail. Positioned at a distance of 100,000 km from the telescope, it would block more than 99.998% of the starlight.

There are two possible configurations of this satellite. The first would work with a space telescope, most likely positioned near the Earth&#x27;s L2 Lagrangian point. The second would place the satellite in a highly elliptical orbit about the Earth, and work in conjunction with a ground telescope. At the apogee of the orbit, the satellite would remain relatively stationary with respect to the ground, allowing longer exposure times.

An updated version of this design is called the Starshade, which uses a sunflower-shaped coronagraph disc. A comparable proposal was also made for a satellite to occult bright X-ray sources, called an &quot;X-ray Occulting Steerable Satellite&quot; or XOSS.

<text>Open water diving is underwater diving in an open water environment, where the diver has unrestricted access by way of a direct vertical ascent to the breathable air of the atmosphere. Other environmental hazards may exist which do not affect the classification. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air, so it is also understood that, with this restriction, a staged decompression obligation is incompatible with open water diving, though it does not affect classification of the environment. This meaning is implied in the certifications titled Open Water Diver and variations thereof.

==Open water environment==
In underwater diving, open water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake, river, or flooded quarry. It is a contradistinction to an overhead environment, where there is a physical barrier to direct vertical ascent to the surface, and to a flooded confined space where there may not be enough room to maneuver freely. In open water the diver has direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. 

Environments which by definition are not open water include overhead environments, and diving in these is called Penetration diving. This may involve entering caves or wrecks, or diving under ice or the hull of a large ship. In some contexts the lack of a decompression obligation is considered a necessary condition for classification of a dive as an open water dive, as a decompression obligation is a procedural and safety restriction on immediate ascent to the surface, but this does not affect the classification of the venue as open water. 

Swim-throughs – the recreational diving term for arches and short, clear, tunnels where the natural light can be seen at the far end, and there is enough clearance that it is theoretically possible for the diver to pass through the narrowest point without contact with the sides, bottom or ceiling, are technically an overhead environment, but this is often overlooked by divers as there is no risk of getting lost inside, and the risk of entrapment is generally low.

Divers progress from learning diving skills in confined or benign water such as a swimming pool to practicing skills in open water in which the environment is not restricted to a small, controlled locality and depth, with conditions more typical of a natural body of water which might be used by divers, and the range of hazards and associated risk is significantly expanded. In this context confined water and benign water are special cases of open water, as they comply with the more general condition of unobstructed access to the surface.

Some recreational diver certification agencies use a variation on this term in the title of their entry level diver certification. Open Water Diver certification implies that the diver is competent to dive in unrestricted water, with various constraints regarding the conditions, and particularly that their competence is limited to diving in open water with free access to the surface.

There are a few variations of open water environments with more specific names. There are also a number of named diving environments which are usually also open water environments.

=== Open ocean ===

The extreme case of open water is the deep open ocean, where the bottom is at a depth which is irrelevant to the diver as there would be no chance of surviving long enough to reach it. Open oceanic water is often remarkably clear, but this is not always the case. There is no natural visual reference for depth in the open ocean, and depth monitoring and control is critically important to diver safety.

=== Blue-water diving ===

Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. It is done by scientific divers for direct observation and sampling of pelagic organisms and particulate matter, particularly the gelatinous zoo-plankton that are fragile and transparent, making them relatively inaccessible by other methods, and by recreational divers for observation and photography of a range of organisms not easily seen in inshore waters.

The techniques of blue-water diving have been developed over the years to suit the conditions and address the hazards of an environment which is functionally bottomless, and has no fixed visible positional references. The diver who is focused on small organisms or instruments at close range is likely to have diminished awareness of depth, buoyancy, current, surge, other divers, large organisms, and even the direction to the surface. 

An accepted procedure for scientific blue-water collection diving with several working divers, is to tether the working divers to a central hub connected to a surface platform, and to have an in-water safety diver attend the hub. The tethers pass through fairleads at the hub and are tensioned by a weight at the end, which keeps slack out of the line and thereby reduces the risk of entanglement, and prevents the end of the line from passing through the fairlead. The tether serves to limit the distance a diver can move away from the hub, which is typically fastened to a substantial downline supported by a large buoy at the surface, and kept vertical by a weight. The float at the surface allows the divers to move freely in the water column within the constraint of the tether, and drift with the current. The tethers also allow rope signals between the safety diver and the working divers. The surface platform, generally a small boat, may be tethered to the buoy, and if there is sufficient wind to make this a problem a parachute sea anchor can be deployed to minimise drift. Windage will generally position the buoy and boat downwind of the parachute. The other end of the tether is clipped to the diver&#x27;s harness or buoyancy compensator by some form of quick-release shackle. These procedures and equipment can also be used at night.

If a sea anchor is deployed to limit drift, it must be kept clear of the divers to minimise the risk of entanglement, and it should be buoyed to prevent sinking in a calm. The sea anchor cable should be buoyant line for the same reason. Blue-water diving operations are constrained by water and weather conditions, including wind, sea state, current strength, visibility, and the presence of aggressive predators.

===Black-water diving ===

Black-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. The environment is referred to as &quot;black-water&quot;. The term black-water may also be used to refer to diving in zero visibility, or in sewage. Christopher Newbert, author of &quot;Within a Rainbow Sea&quot;, (1984) is credited as an early black-water diver. In his book, he describes solo offshore night dives to depths of up to . Black-water diving is often done as a photographic opportunity for recreational divers as there can be a wide range of plankton that would not often be seen by day or closer inshore. This is known as blackwater photography.

Weighted downlines are commonly used to provide a stable vertical reference. These may be tied to the boat or supported by a buoy. Each diver may be attached to a downline using a shorter tether to ensure that divers do not go too far from the boat or too deep. The downline may be marked with lights to indicate depth and to attract mobile organisms. A wide range of animal life may be seen, including many species that spend the daylight hours at depths below those accessible to ambient pressure divers, and migrate vertically through the water column on a diurnal cycle. Many of these are bioluminescent or translucent or both.

The boat moves differently from the divers and the divers move differently from the plankton, making it necessary to work to get a position from which there will be enough time to frame and take photos of the drifting subjects. The boat will drift under the influence of current and wind, while the divers and plankton will drift with the current. If there is wind the boat will drag the downlines, and if tethered to the buoy, it will drag the buoy and divers attached. If divers swim ahead of the towing action, they will have a short time to drift with the plankton and take photos until the slack in the line has been taken up, at which point the plankton will be left behind. This drift problem can be reduced by setting a parachute anchor, which will reduce wind drift to a negligible amount. The divers should stay clear of the entanglement hazard of the parachute suspension lines.

===Confined water===

At the other extreme from the open ocean, confined water is open water where it is not possible to inadvertently stray outside the designated area due to physical barriers. Usually this also refers to an area of known low risk and minimal hazard – benign water.

The term is often used to refer to a swimming pool or tank where initial skills training of divers takes place, which is both confined and benign. The Queensland government defines confined water for recreational diving purposes as &quot;Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water&quot;. Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction. 

Confined water has some of the characteristics of benign water, in that it is not possible to accidentally stray from the environment, but although some usages of the term &quot;confined water&quot; imply benign conditions, that meaning is not inherent in the term, as water in a confined space may logically be referred to as confined water, and such confined water may contain significant hazards.

===Benign water===

Benign water is open water with very low risk and no unknown hazards, where it is unlikely or impossible for a diver to accidentally stray to an area of higher risk. Some definitions add a depth limit and that the water must also be confined.

Benign conditions are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.

<text>The Gran Paradiso () or Grand Paradis () is a mountain in the Graian Alps in Italy, located between the Aosta Valley and Piedmont regions. It is located in Gran Paradiso National Park.

== Etymology ==
The Italian toponym &quot;Gran Paradiso&quot; derives, via the French &quot;Grand paradis&quot;, from the Aosta Valley patois &quot;Granta Parey&quot;, which means &quot;large wall&quot;. It is the same etymology as nearby .

== Geography ==
The peak is the 7th highest mountain in the Graian Alps, with an elevation of 4,061 m. In the SOIUSA (&quot;International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps&quot;) the mountain belongs to an alpine subsection called &quot;North-Eastern Graian Alps&quot; (It:&quot;Alpi del Gran Paradiso&quot;; Fr:&quot;Alpes du Grand-Paradis&quot;) and also gives its name to the &quot;gruppo del Gran Paradiso&quot;.

While the Mont Blanc massif straddles the border between France and Italy, the Gran Paradiso is the only mountain whose summit reaches over 4,000 metres that is entirely within Italian territory.

== Routes ==
Climbs normally start from either the Refuge Frédéric Chabod or the Refuge Victor-Emmanuel II. The latter is named after Victor Emmanuel II of Italy who created the Gran Paradiso royal reserve in 1856, presently the site of the Gran Paradiso National Park.

It is widely accepted that Gran Paradiso is one of the easiest four-thousanders to summit. This is not fully true, however, because while almost the entire route to the ridge is graded at F+, the last several dozen metres to the Virgin Mary (or Madonna) summit (, or – 4058 m) comprises rock climbing with considerable exposure, with difficulties of grade I UIAA, while access to the proper main summit (4061 m) requires 15 minutes of climbing up to grade II UIAA. Gran Paradiso is popular with novice alpinists and many of these only climb to the Madonna summit.

In addition to the main summit routes, Gran Paradiso possesses a steep snow/ice North West Face, which can be climbed at AD+ from the Refuge Frédéric Chabod.

==Nature conservation==
Gran Paradiso is located in the Gran Paradiso National Park, an Italian national park named after the mountain. On the French side of the border, the park is continued by the Vanoise National Park.

<text>Technical diving (also referred to as tec diving or tech diving) is scuba diving that exceeds the agency-specified limits of recreational diving for non-professional purposes. Technical diving may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to a greater risk of serious injury or death. Risk may be reduced via appropriate skills, knowledge, and experience. Risk can also be managed by using suitable equipment and procedures. The skills may be developed through specialized training and experience. The equipment involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, and multiple gas sources.

The popularisation of the term &quot;technical diving&quot; has been credited to Michael Menduno, who was editor of the (now defunct) diving magazine &quot;aquaCorps Journal&quot;, but the concept and term, &quot;technical diving&quot;, go back at least as far as 1977, and divers have been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades.

==Origin==
The popular use of the term &quot;technical diving&quot; can be traced back to the cover story of the first issue of aquaCorps magazine (1990–1996), in early 1990, titled &quot;Call it &quot;High-Tech&quot; Diving&quot; by Bill Hamilton, describing the current state of recreational diving beyond the generally accepted limits, such as deep, decompression and mixed gas diving. By mid-1991, the magazine was using the term &quot;technical diving&quot;, as an analogy to the established term &quot;technical (rock) climbing&quot;.

More recently, recognizing that the term was already in use by the Royal Navy for rebreather diving, Hamilton redefined technical diving as diving with more than one breathing gas or with a rebreather. Richard Pyle (1999) defined a technical diver as &quot;anyone who routinely conducts dives with staged stops during an ascent as suggested by a given decompression algorithm&quot;.

The term technical diving was also used in the US as far back as 1977 by the California Advisory Committee on Scientific and Technical Diving (CACSTD), to distinguish more complex modes of recreational diving from scientific diving for regulatory purposes. In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorises diving which is not occupational as &quot;recreational diving&quot; for purposes of exemption from regulation. This is also the case in some other countries, including South Africa. The use of the term technical diving by the CACSTD appears to refer to dives done for technical support of scientific work by occupational divers, and is no longer used for this meaning.

Technical diving emerged between the mid-1980s and the mid-to-late-1990s, and much of the history of its development was recorded in aquaCorps, started by Michael Menduno to provide a forum for these aspects of diving that most recreational diving magazines of the time refused to cover.

At the time, amateur scuba divers were exploring the physiological limits of diving using air. Technical divers looked for ways to extend the limits of air dives, and for ways to extend breathing gas supplies as they went deeper and stayed down longer. The military and commercial diving communities had large budgets, extensive infrastructure, and controlled diving operations, but the amateur diving community had a more trial-and-error approach to the use of mixed gas and rebreathers. Consequently, a relatively large number of fatal incidents occurred during the early years, before a reasonably reliable set of operating procedures and standards began to emerge, making the movement somewhat controversial, both within the mainstream diving establishment and between sectors of the technical diving community.

While the motivation to extend the depth and duration range by military and commercial divers was mainly driven by operational needs to get the job done, the motivation to exceed recreational diving depths and endurance ranges was more driven by the urge to explore otherwise inaccessible places, which could not at the time be reached by any other means.

There are places that no one has been to since the dawn of time. We can’t see what’s there.
We can see what’s on the dark side of the moon or what’s on Mars, but you can’t see what’s in the back of a cave unless you go there.
Sheck Exley, &quot;Exley on Mix&quot;, aquaCorps #4, Jan 1992

The urge to go where no one has gone before has always been a driving force for explorers, and the 1980s was a time of intense exploration by the cave-diving community, some of whom were doing relatively long air dives in the 60–125 m depth range, and doing decompression on oxygen. The details of many of these dives were not disclosed by the divers as these dives were considered experimental and dangerous. The divers who conducted these dives did not consider them suitable for the ordinary person, but necessary to extend the frontiers of exploration, and there were no consensus guidelines for scuba diving beyond 40 m.

==Definition==
There is some professional disagreement as to what exactly technical diving encompasses. It is an arbitrary distinction, and the line has been drawn in different places by different organisations, and has shifted on a few occasions. Nitrox diving, rebreather diving and sidemount diving were originally considered technical, but this is no longer universally the case as several certification agencies now offer recreational nitrox diving, recreational rebreather diving and recreational sidemount diving training and certification. Some training agencies classify penetration diving in wrecks and caves as technical diving. Even those who agree on the broad definitions of technical diving may disagree on the precise boundaries between technical and recreational diving:
* IANTD proposes a description: &quot;Technical diving is a range of knowledge, skills and suitable equipment, which when combined correctly, allow recreational divers to increase their safety while underwater. This information (sic) may be employed in either shallow or deep water, may be used to safely extend the divers submerged duration well into the realms of extended decompressions and is often used as a tool for exploration.&quot; in their &quot;Exploration and Mixed Gas Diving Encyclopedia&quot;
* NAUI&#x27;s definition of technical diving states: &quot;Technical diving is a form of scuba diving that exceeds the typical recreational limits imposed on depth and immersion time (bottom time). Tec diving involves accelerated decompression and/or the use of variable gas mixtures during a dive.&quot;
* NOAA defines technical diving as &quot;all diving methods that exceed the limits imposed on depth and/or immersion time for recreational scuba diving. Technical diving often involves the use of special gas mixtures (other than compressed air) for breathing. The type of gas mixture used is determined either by the maximum depth planned for the dive, or by the length of time that the diver intends to spend underwater. While the recommended maximum depth for conventional scuba diving is 130 ft, technical divers may work in the range of 170 ft to 350 ft, sometimes even deeper. Technical diving almost always requires one or more mandatory decompression &#x27;stops&#x27; upon ascent, during which the diver may change breathing gas mixes at least once.&quot; NOAA does not address issues relating to overhead environments or specify the recreational diving limits in its definition, and the use of single mixture nitrox is well established in mainstream recreational diving.
* PADI defines technical diving as &quot;diving other than conventional commercial or recreational diving that takes divers beyond recreational diving limits (). It is further defined as an activity that includes one or more of the following: diving beyond 40 meters/130 feet, required stage decompression, diving in an overhead environment beyond 130 linear feet from the surface, accelerated stage decompression and/or the use of multiple gas mixtures in a single dive.&quot;
* TDI defines a technical dive as any dive involving decompression, additional cylinders, alternative breathing gases, rebreathers, or overhead environments such as wrecks, caves or mines. This definition does not make a strong distinction between “recreational” and “technical” as both styles of diving are recreational and require similar equipment.
* The government of Queensland, Australia defines recreational technical diving as recreational diving using nitrox or other mixed gas, or any diving requiring decompression.
* BSAC varies from many agencies in allowing some staged decompression within recreational diving. Its definition of technical diving is diving that involves specialist equipment such as closed circuit rebreathers (CCR), using multiple gas mixes on open circuit, or that uses helium-based gas mixtures termed mixed gas.

The European diving agencies tend to draw the line between recreational and technical diving at and many, as noted for BSAC above, teach staged decompression diving as an integral part of recreational training, rather than as a fundamental change of scope. The Bühlmann tables used by the Sub-Aqua Association and other European agencies make staged decompression dives available, and the SAA teaches modest staged decompression as part of its advanced training programme.

===Scope===
The following table gives an overview of the activities that various agencies suggest to differentiate between technical and recreational diving:


==Hazards and risk==
One of the perceived differences between technical and other forms of recreational diving is the associated hazards, of which there are more associated with technical diving, and risk, which is often, but not always greater in technical diving. Hazards are the circumstances that may cause harm, and risk is the likelihood of the harm actually occurring. The hazards are partly due to the extended scope of technical diving, and partly associated with the equipment used. In some cases, the equipment used presents a secondary risk while mitigating a primary risk, such as the complexity of gas management needed to reduce the risk of a fatal gas supply failure, or the use of gases potentially unbreathable for some parts of a dive profile to reduce the risk of harm caused by oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis or decompression sickness for the whole operation. Reduction of secondary risks may also affect equipment choice, but is largely skill-based. Training of technical divers includes procedures that are known from experience to be effective in handling the most common contingencies. Divers proficient in these emergency drills are less likely to be overwhelmed by the circumstances when things do not go according to plan, and are less likely to panic.

===Depth===
Technical dives may be defined as being dives deeper than about or dives in an overhead environment with no direct access to the surface or natural light. Such environments may include fresh and saltwater caves and the interiors of shipwrecks. In many cases, technical dives also include planned decompression carried out over a number of stages during a controlled ascent to the surface at the end of the dive. The depth-based definition is based on risk caused by the progressive impairment of mental competence with the increasing partial pressure of respired nitrogen. Breathing air under pressure causes nitrogen narcosis that usually starts to become a problem at depths of or greater, but this differs between divers. Increased depth also increases the partial pressure of oxygen and so increases the risk of oxygen toxicity. Technical diving often includes the use of breathing mixtures other than air to reduce these risks, and the additional complexity of managing a variety of breathing mixtures introduces other risks and is managed by equipment configuration and procedural training. To reduce nitrogen narcosis, it is common to use trimix which uses helium to replace some of the nitrogen in the diver&#x27;s breathing mixture, or heliox, in which there is no nitrogen.

===Inability to ascend directly===
Technical dives may alternatively be defined as dives where the diver cannot safely ascend directly to the surface either due to a mandatory decompression stop or a physical ceiling. This form of diving implies a much greater reliance on the redundancy of critical life support equipment and procedural training since the diver must stay underwater until it is safe to ascend or the diver has successfully exited the overhead environment.

====Decompression stops====
A diver at the end of a long or deep dive may need to do decompression stops or remain below a decompression ceiling to avoid decompression sickness, also known as &quot;the bends&quot;. Metabolically inert gases in the diver&#x27;s breathing gas, such as nitrogen and helium, are absorbed into body tissues when breathed under high pressure, mainly during the deep phase of the dive. These dissolved gases must be released slowly from the body tissues by controlling the ascent rate to restrict the formation and growth of bubbles. This is usually done by pausing or &quot;doing stops&quot; at various depths during the ascent to the surface. Most technical divers breathe oxygen enriched breathing gas mixtures such as nitrox and pure oxygen during long-duration decompression, as this increases the rate of inert gas elimination. Elimination of inert gases continues during the surface intervals (time spent on the surface between dives), which must be considered when planning subsequent dives. A decompression obligation is also referred to as a &quot;soft&quot;, or &quot;physiological&quot; ceiling.

====Physical ceiling====
These types of physical overhead, or &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;environmental&quot; ceiling can prevent the diver from surfacing directly:
* Cave diving – diving into a cave system.
* Ice diving – diving under ice.
* Wreck diving – diving inside a shipwreck.
* Diving under any other form of overhead physical obstruction to a direct ascent to the free surface, such as under the hull of a ship or under a harbour or offshore structure or a net.
In all of these situations, a guide line or from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as it is not easy to lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left &quot;in situ&quot; to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guidelines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.

===Extremely limited visibility===
Technical dives in waters where the diver&#x27;s vision is severely impeded by low-visibility conditions, caused by turbidity or silt out and low light conditions due to depth or enclosure, require greater competence. The combination of low visibility and strong current can make dives in these conditions extremely hazardous, particularly in an overhead environment, and greater skill and reliable and familiar equipment are needed to manage this risk. Limited visibility diving can cause disorientation, potentially leading to loss of sense of direction, loss of effective buoyancy control, etc. Divers in extremely limited visibility situations depend on their instruments such as dive lights, pressure gauges, compass, depth gauge, bottom timer, dive computer, etc., and guidelines for orientation and information. Training for cave and wreck diving includes techniques for managing extreme low visibility, as finding the way out of an overhead environment before running out of gas is a safety-critical skill.

==Equipment==
Technical divers may use diving equipment other than the usual single cylinder open circuit scuba equipment used by recreational divers. Typically, technical dives take longer than average recreational scuba dives. Because a decompression obligation prevents a diver in difficulty from surfacing immediately, there is a need for redundancy of breathing equipment. Technical divers usually carry at least two independent breathing gas sources, each with its own gas delivery system. In the event of a failure of one set, the second set is available as a back-up system. The backup system should allow the diver to safely return to the surface from any point of the planned dive, but may involve the intervention of other divers in the team. Stage cylinders may be dropped along the guideline for later use during the exit or for another dive. A stage cylinder is an additional diving cylinder filled with breathing gas and fitted with a regulator.

===Equipment configuration===

The usual configurations used for increased primary gas supply are manifolded or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple side mounted cylinders, or rebreathers. Bailout and decompression gas may be included in these arrangements, or carried separately as side-mounted stage and decompression cylinders. Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and where they will be used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger number of cylinders is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the maximum operating depth and if applicable, minimum operating depth.

===Gas mixes===
Technical diving can be done using air as a breathing gas, but other breathing gas mixtures are commonly used to manage specific problems. Some additional knowledge is required to understand the effects of these gases on the body during a dive and additional skills are needed to safely manage their use.

====Deep air/extended range diving====
One of the more divisive subjects in technical diving concerns using compressed air as a breathing gas on dives below . Some training agencies still promote and teach courses using air up to depths of 60m. These include TDI, IANTD and DSAT/PADI. Others, including NAUI Tec, GUE, ISE and UTD consider that diving deeper than , depending upon agency, on air is unacceptably risky. They promote the use of mixtures containing helium to limit the apparent narcotic depth to their agency specified limit should be used for dives beyond a certain limit. Even though TDI and IANTD teach courses using air up to depths of 60m, they also offer courses include &quot;helitrox&quot; &quot;recreational trimix&quot; and &quot;advance recreational trimix&quot; that also use mixtures containing helium to mitigate narcotic concerns when the diving depth is limited to 30-45m.

Such courses used to be referred to as &quot;deep air&quot; courses, but are now commonly called &quot;extended range&quot; courses. The 130 ft limit entered the recreation and technical communities in the USA from the military diving community where it was the depth at which the US Navy recommended shifting from scuba to surface-supplied air. The American scientific diving community represented by the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) has never specified a 130-foot limit in its protocols and has never experienced any accidents or injuries during air dives between 130 feet and the deepest air dives that the American scientific diving community permits, 190 feet, where the U.S. Navy Standard Air Tables shifts to the Exceptional Exposure Tables. In Europe, some countries set the recreational diving limit at , and that corresponds with the limit also imposed in some professional fields, such as police divers in the UK. The major French agencies all teach diving on air to as part of their standard recreational certifications.

Deep air proponents base the depth limit of air diving upon the risk of oxygen toxicity. Accordingly, they view the limit as being the depth at which partial pressure of oxygen reaches 1.4 ATA, which occurs at about . Both sides of the community tend to present self-supporting data. Divers trained and experienced in deep air diving report fewer problems with narcosis than those trained and experienced in mixed gas diving trimix/heliox, though scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.

The Divers Alert Network does not endorse or reject deep air diving but does note the additional risks involved.

====Mixtures to reduce decompression time====
Nitrox is a popular diving gas mix, that reduces the maximum allowable depth as compared to air. Nitrox also allows greater bottom time and shorter surface intervals by reducing the buildup of nitrogen in the diver&#x27;s tissues. This is accomplished by increasing the percentage of oxygen in the breathing gas. The depth limit of a nitrox mixture is governed by the partial pressure of oxygen, which is generally limited to 1.4 to 1.6 bar depending on the activity of the diver and duration of exposure.

Nitrox mixtures up to 100% oxygen are also used for accelerated decompression.

====Mixtures to reduce nitrogen narcosis====
Increased pressure due to depth causes nitrogen to become narcotic, resulting in a reduced ability to react or think clearly. By adding helium to the breathing mix, these effects can be reduced, as helium does not have the same narcotic properties at depth. Helitrox/triox proponents argue that the defining risk for air and nitrox diving depth should be nitrogen narcosis, and suggest that when the partial pressure of nitrogen reaches approximately 4.0 ATA, which occurs at about for air, helium is necessary to limit the effects of the narcosis.

====Mixtures to reduce oxygen toxicity====
Technical dives may also be characterised by the use of hypoxic breathing gas mixtures, including hypoxic trimix, heliox, and heliair. A diver breathing normal air (with 21% oxygen) will be exposed to increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity at depths greater than about The first sign of oxygen toxicity is usually a convulsion without warning which usually results in death when the demand valve mouthpiece falls out and the victim drowns. Sometimes the diver may get warning symptoms before the convulsion. These can include visual and auditory hallucinations, nausea, twitching (especially in the face and hands), irritability and mood swings, and dizziness.

These gas mixes can also lower the level of oxygen in the mix to reduce the danger of oxygen toxicity. Once the oxygen is reduced below about 18% the mix is known as a hypoxic mix as it does not contain enough oxygen to be used safely at the surface.

==Safety==

Technical diving encompasses multiple aspects of diving, that typically share a lack of direct access to the surface, which may be caused by physical constraints, like an overhead environment, or physiological, like decompression obligation. In case of emergency, therefore, the diver or diving team must be able to troubleshoot and solve the problem underwater. This requires planning, situational awareness, and redundancy in critical equipment, and is facilitated by skill and experience in appropriate procedures for managing reasonably foreseeable contingencies.

Some rebreather diving safety issues can be addressed by training, others may require a change in technical diver culture. A major safety issue is that many divers become complacent as they become more familiar with the equipment, and begin to neglect predive checklists while assembling and preparing the equipment for use - procedures that are officially part of all rebreather training programs. There can also be a tendency to neglect post-dive maintenance, and some divers will dive knowing that there are functional problems with the unit, because they know that there is generally redundancy designed into the system. This redundancy is intended to allow a safe termination of the dive if it occurs underwater, by eliminating a critical failure point. Diving with a unit that already has a malfunction, means that there is a single critical point of failure in that unit, which could cause a life-threatening emergency if another item in the critical path were to fail. The risk may increase by orders of magnitude.

===Accident modes===
Several factors have been identified as predispositions to accidents in technical diving. The techniques and equipment are complex, which increases the risk of errors or omissions - the task loading for a closed circuit rebreather diver during critical phases of a dive is greater than for open circuit scuba equipment, The circumstances of technical diving generally mean that errors or omissions are likely to have more serious consequences than in normal recreational diving, and there is a tendency towards competitiveness and risk-taking among many technical divers which appears to have contributed to some well-publicized accidents.

Some errors and failures that have repeatedly been implicated in technical diving accidents include:
* Incorrect gas switches in open circuit diving; The gas could be hypoxic, with a risk of blackout, hyperoxic, with a risk of oxygen toxicity seizure, or have an excessively high partial pressure of nitrogen, with a risk of nitrogen narcosis. 
* Having an incorrect gas in a cylinder resulting in hypoxia, hyperoxia, nitrogen narcosis or inadequate decompression, usually a consequence of failure to analyse all the mixes;
* Incorrect gas consumption calculations and failure to monitor use and change plans during the dive, causing running out of gas before the end of the dive;
* Losing staged decompression gas which was cached to be picked up later;
* The development of an insufficient or excessive oxygen partial pressure in the loop of closed or semi-closed circuit rebreathers;
* High CO2 levels in the breathing loop of rebreathers due to scrubber breakthrough;
* Flooding of the rebreather loop rendering it unusable;
* Failure to control depth.

Failure to control depth is critical during decompression, where the inability to stay at the correct depth due to excessive buoyancy is associated with a high risk of decompression sickness and a raised risk of barotrauma of ascent. There are several ways that excessive buoyancy can be caused, some of which can be managed by the diver if prompt and correct action is taken, and others that cannot be corrected. This problem may be caused by poor planning, in that the diver may underestimate the weight loss of using up the breathing gas in all the cylinders, by losing ballast weights during the dive, or by inflation problems with buoyancy compensator or drysuit, or both.

Insufficient ballast weight to allow neutral buoyancy at the shallowest decompression stop with nearly empty cylinders is an example of a buoyancy problem that can generally not be corrected by the diver. If an empty cylinder is positively buoyant, the diver may jettison it and allow it to float away, but if the empty cylinders are negatively buoyant, jettisoning them will exacerbate the problem, making the diver even more buoyant. Drysuit and buoyancy compensator inflation can cause runaway ascent, which can usually be managed if corrected immediately. If the initial problem is caused by loss of ballast weights or a reel jam when deploying an inflatable decompression buoy, and the reel is clipped on, the diver may not be able to manage several simultaneously accelerating buoyancy malfunctions. Dual bladder buoyancy compensators can contain air inadvertently added to the backup bladder, which the diver does not release as it is not supposed to be there in the first place. All of these failures can be either avoided altogether or the risk minimized by configuration choices, procedural methods, and correct response to the initial problem.

Failure to control depth due to insufficient buoyancy can also lead to scuba accidents. It is less of a problem with surface-supplied diving as the depth that the diver can sink to is limited by the umbilical length, and a sudden or rapid descent can often be quickly stopped by the tender. In early diving using copper helmets and a limited flow air supply, a sudden rapid descent could lead to severe helmet squeeze, but this is prevented by demand-supplied gas, and neck dams on later helmets, which allow water to flood the helmet until the gas supply catches up with the compression. Surface supply ensures that the gas supply will not run out suddenly due to high demand, which can deplete scuba supply to the extent that there may not be enough left to surface according to plan. Any sudden increase in depth can also cause barotrauma of the ears and sinuses if the diver cannot equalize fast enough.

===Accident statistics===
There is very little reliable data describing the demographics, activities and accidents of the technical diving population. Conclusions about accident rates must be considered tentative. The 2003 DAN report on decompression illness and dive fatalities indicates that 9.8% of all cases of decompression illness and 20% of diving fatalities in the USA happened to technical divers. It is not known how many technical dives this was spread over, but it was considered likely that technical divers are at greater risk.

The techniques and associated equipment that have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional single-cylinder, open-circuit scuba diving are necessarily more complex and subject to error, and technical dives are often done in more dangerous environments, so the consequences of an error or malfunction are greater. Although the skill levels and training of technical divers are generally significantly higher than those of recreational divers, there are indications that technical divers, in general, are at higher risk, and that closed circuit rebreather diving may be particularly dangerous.

===Operations===
Relatively complex technical diving operations may be planned and run like an expedition, or professional diving operation, with surface and in-water support personnel providing direct assistance or on stand-by to assist the expedition divers. Surface support might include surface stand-by divers, boat crew, porters, emergency medical personnel, and gas blenders. In-water support may provide supplementary breathing gas, monitor divers during long decompression stops, and provide communications services between the surface team and the expedition divers. In some cases the risk assessment may persuade the dive team to use similar equipment to that used in professional diving, such as ROV monitoring or the use of a stage or wet bell for the ascent and descent, and having a decompression chamber available at the surface. In an emergency, the support team would provide rescue and if necessary search and recovery assistance.

==Training==
Technical diving requires specialized equipment and training. There are many technical training organizations: see the Technical Diving section in the list of diver certification organizations. Technical Diving International (TDI), Global Underwater Explorers (GUE), Professional Scuba Association International (PSAI), International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD) and National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) were popular . Professional Technical and Recreational Diving (ProTec) joined in 1997. Recent entries into the market include Split-Face Diving (UTD), InnerSpace Explorers (ISE) and Diving Science and Technology (DSAT), the technical arm of Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI). The Scuba Schools International (SSI) Technical Diving Program (TechXR – Technical eXtended Range) was launched in 2005.

British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) training has always had a technical element to its higher qualifications, however, it has recently begun to introduce more technical level Skill Development Courses into all its training schemes by introducing technical awareness into its lowest level qualification of Ocean Diver, for example, and nitrox training will become mandatory. It has also recently introduced trimix qualifications and continues to develop closed-circuit training.

===Certification===
Technical diving certification is issued by several recreational diver training agencies, under a variety of names, often with considerable overlap or in some cases split into depth ranges. The certification titles vary between agencies but can be categorized as:
*, a scuba diver certified as competent to dive in open water using open circuit nitrogen-based gas mixtures that are safe to breathe at atmospheric pressure, and decompress using approved schedules on gases carried by the diver, usually including oxygen or oxygen-rich nitrox
*, a scuba diver certified as competent to dive in open water using open circuit trimix gases which are safe to breathe at atmospheric pressure, and decompress using approved schedules, on gases carried by the diver, usually including oxygen or oxygen-rich nitrox.
*, or , a scuba diver certified as competent to dive in open water using open circuit trimix gases which are not safe to breathe at atmospheric pressure, to use a travel gas to descend through the depth range in which the bottom gas is unsafe, and decompress using approved schedules, on gases carried by the diver, usually including oxygen or oxygen-rich nitrox.
*Rebreather certification for various types of diving rebreather. Training in the use of rebreathers has two components: Generic training for the class of rebreather, including the theory of operation, general procedures as well as specific training for the model of rebreather; which covers the details of preparation, testing, user maintenance, and troubleshooting, and those details of normal operating and emergency procedures which are specific to the model of rebreather. Crossover training from one model to another generally only requires the second aspect if the equipment is similar in design and operation.
**Nitrox semi-closed circuit rebreather diver, 
**Nitrox closed circuit rebreather diver,
**Mixed gas rebreather diver. This may distinguish between normoxic and hypoxic depth ranges.
*Cave diver, of various grades,
*Wreck penetration diver, of various grades,

<text>Deep diving is underwater diving to a depth beyond the norm accepted by the associated community. In some cases this is a prescribed limit established by an authority, while in others it is associated with a level of certification or training, and it may vary depending on whether the diving is recreational, technical or commercial. Nitrogen narcosis becomes a hazard below and hypoxic breathing gas is required below to lessen the risk of oxygen toxicity. At much greater depths, breathing gases become supercritical fluids, making diving with conventional equipment effectively impossible regardless of the physiological effects on the human body. Air, for example, becomes a supercritical fluid below about .

For some recreational diving agencies, &quot;Deep diving&quot;, or &quot;Deep diver&quot; may be a certification awarded to divers that have been trained to dive to a specified depth range, generally deeper than . However, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) defines anything from as a &quot;deep dive&quot; in the context of recreational diving (other diving organisations vary), and considers &quot;deep diving&quot; a form of technical diving. In technical diving, a depth below about where hypoxic breathing gas becomes necessary to avoid oxygen toxicity may be considered a deep dive. In professional diving, a depth that requires special equipment, procedures, or advanced training may be considered a deep dive.

Deep diving can mean something else in the commercial diving field. For instance early experiments carried out by COMEX using heliox and trimix attained far greater depths than any recreational technical diving. One example being its &quot;Janus 4&quot; open-sea dive to in 1977.

The open-sea diving depth record was achieved in 1988 by a team of COMEX and French Navy divers who performed pipeline connection exercises at a depth of in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the &quot;Hydra 8&quot; programme employing heliox and hydrox. The latter avoids the high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) caused by helium and eases breathing due to its lower density. These divers needed to breathe special gas mixtures because they were exposed to very high ambient pressure (more than 54 times atmospheric pressure).

An atmospheric diving suit (ADS) allows very deep dives of up to . These suits are capable of withstanding the pressure at great depth permitting the diver to remain at normal atmospheric pressure. This eliminates the problems associated with breathing pressurised gases. In 2006 Chief Navy Diver Daniel Jackson set a record of in an ADS.

On 20 November 1992 COMEX&#x27;s &quot;Hydra 10&quot; experiment simulated a dive in an onshore hyperbaric chamber with hydreliox. Théo Mavrostomos spent two hours at a simulated depth of .

==Depth ranges in underwater diving==
Assumed is the surface of the waterbody to be at or near sea level and underlies atmospheric pressure.

Not included are the differing ranges of freediving – without breathing during a dive.

==Particular problems associated with deep dives==
Deep diving has more hazards and greater risk than basic open-water diving. Nitrogen narcosis, the &quot;narks&quot; or &quot;rapture of the deep&quot;, starts with feelings of euphoria and over-confidence but then leads to numbness and memory impairment similar to alcohol intoxication. Decompression sickness, or the &quot;bends&quot;, can happen if a diver ascends too rapidly, when excess inert gas leaves solution in the blood and tissues and forms bubbles. These bubbles produce mechanical and biochemical effects that lead to the condition. The onset of symptoms depends on the severity of the tissue gas loading and may develop during ascent in severe cases, but is frequently delayed until after reaching the surface. Bone degeneration (dysbaric osteonecrosis) is caused by the bubbles forming inside the bones; most commonly the upper arm and the thighs. Deep diving involves a much greater danger of all of these, and presents the additional risk of oxygen toxicity, which may lead to convulsions underwater. Very deep diving using a helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) or a hydrogen-helium-oxygen mixture (hydreliox) carries the risk of high-pressure nervous syndrome and hydrogen narcosis. Coping with the physical and physiological stresses of deep diving requires good physical conditioning.

Using open-circuit scuba equipment, consumption of breathing gas is proportional to ambient pressure – so at , where the pressure is , a diver breathes six times as much as on the surface (). Heavy physical exertion makes the diver breathe even more gas, and gas becomes denser requiring increased effort to breathe with depth, leading to increased risk of hypercapnia – an excess of carbon dioxide in the blood. The need to do decompression stops increases with depth. A diver at may be able to dive for many hours without needing to do decompression stops. At depths greater than , a diver may have only a few minutes at the deepest part of the dive before decompression stops are needed. In the event of an emergency, the diver cannot make an immediate ascent to the surface without risking decompression sickness. All of these considerations result in the amount of breathing gas required for deep diving being much greater than for shallow open water diving. The diver needs a disciplined approach to planning and conducting dives to minimise these additional risks.

Many of these problems are avoided by the use of surface supplied breathing gas, closed diving bells, and saturation diving, at the cost of logistical complexity, reduced maneuverability of the diver, and greater expense.

==Dealing with depth==

Both equipment and procedures can be adapted to deal with the problems of greater depth. Usually the two are combined, as the procedures must be adapted to suit the equipment, and in some cases the equipment is needed to facilitate the procedures.

===Equipment adaptations for deeper diving===
The equipment used for deep diving depends on both the depth and the type of diving. Scuba is limited to equipment that can be carried by the diver or is easily deployed by the dive team, while surface-supplied diving equipment can be more extensive, and much of it stays above the water where it is operated by the diving support team.
* Scuba divers carry larger volumes of breathing gas to compensate for the increased gas consumption and decompression stops.
* Rebreathers, though more complex, manage gas much more efficiently than open-circuit scuba.
* Use of helium-based breathing gases such as trimix reduces nitrogen narcosis and reduces the toxic effects of oxygen at depth.
* A diving shot, a decompression trapeze, or a decompression buoy can help divers control their ascent and return to the surface at a position that can be monitored by their surface support team at the end of a dive.
* Decompression can be accelerated by using specially blended breathing gas mixtures containing lower proportions of inert gas.
* Surface supply of breathing gases reduces the risk of running out of gas.
* In-water decompression can be minimized by using dry bells and decompression chambers.
* Hot-water suits can prevent hypothermia due to the high heat loss when using helium-based breathing gases.
* Diving bells and submersibles expose the diver to the direct underwater environment for less time, and provide a relatively safe shelter that does not require decompression, with a dry environment where the diver can rest, take refreshment, and if necessary, receive first aid in an emergency.
* Breathing gas s reduce the cost of using helium-based breathing gases, by recovering and recycling exhaled surface supplied gas, analogous to rebreathers for scuba diving.
* The most radical equipment adaptation for deep diving is to isolate the diver from the direct pressure of the environment, using armoured atmospheric diving suits that allow diving to depths beyond those currently possible at ambient pressure. These rigid, articulated exoskeleton suits are sealed against water and withstand external pressure while providing life support to the diver for several hours at an internal pressure of approximately normal surface atmospheric pressure. This avoids the problems of inert gas narcosis, decompression sickness, barotrauma, oxygen toxicity, high work of breathing, compression arthralgia, high-pressure nervous syndrome and hypothermia, but at the cost of reduced mobility and dexterity, logistical problems due to the bulk and mass of the suits, and high equipment costs.

===Procedural adaptations for deeper diving===
Procedural adaptations for deep diving can be classified as those procedures for operating specialized equipment, and those that apply directly to the problems caused by exposure to high ambient pressures.
* The most important procedure for dealing with physiological problems of breathing at high ambient pressures associated with deep diving is decompression. This is necessary to prevent inert gas bubble formation in the body tissues of the diver, which can cause severe injury. Decompression procedures have been derived for a large range of pressure exposures, using a large range of gas mixtures. These basically entail a slow and controlled reduction in pressure during ascent by using a restricted ascent rate and decompression stops, so that the inert gases dissolved in the tissues of the diver can be eliminated harmlessly during normal respiration. 
* Gas management procedures are necessary to ensure that the diver has access to suitable and sufficient breathing gas at all times during the dive, both for the planned dive profile and for any reasonably foreseeable contingency. Scuba gas management is logistically more complex than surface supply, as the diver must either carry all the gas, must follow a route where previously arranged gas supply depots have been set up (stage cylinders). or must rely on a team of support divers who will provide additional gas at pre-arranged signals or points on the planned dive. On very deep scuba dives or on occasions where long decompression times are planned, it is a common practice for support divers to meet the primary team at decompression stops to check if they need assistance, and these support divers will often carry extra gas supplies in case of need.

* Rebreather diving can reduce the bulk of the gas supplies for long and deep scuba dives, at the cost of more complex equipment with more potential failure modes, requiring more demanding procedures and higher procedural task loading.
* Surface supplied diving distributes the task loading between the divers and the support team, who remain in the relative safety and comfort of the surface control position. Gas supplies are limited only by what is available at the control position, and the diver only needs to carry sufficient bailout capacity to reach the nearest place of safety, which may be a diving bell or lockout submersible.
* Saturation diving is a procedure used to reduce the high-risk decompression a diver is exposed to during a long series of deep underwater exposures. By keeping the diver under high pressure for the whole job, and only decompressing at the end of several days to weeks of underwater work, a single decompression can be done at a slower rate without adding much overall time to the job. During the saturation period, the diver lives in a pressurized environment at the surface, and is transported under pressure to the underwater work site in a closed diving bell.

== Ultra-deep diving ==
=== Mixed gas ===
Amongst technical divers, there are divers who participate in ultra-deep diving on scuba below . This practice requires high levels of training, experience, discipline, fitness and surface support. Only twenty-six people are known to have ever dived to at least on self-contained breathing apparatus recreationally. The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of deep scuba diving was the mark, first achieved by John Bennett in 2001, and has only been achieved five times since. Due to the short bottom times and long decompression, scuba dives to these depths are generally only done for deep cave exploration or as record attempts.

The difficulties involved in ultra-deep diving are numerous. Although commercial and military divers often operate at those depths, or even deeper, they are surface supplied. All of the complexities of ultra-deep diving are magnified by the requirement of the diver to carry (or provide for) their own gas underwater. These lead to rapid descents and &quot;bounce dives&quot;. This has led to extremely high mortality rates amongst those who practice ultra-deep diving. Notable ultra-deep diving fatalities include Sheck Exley, John Bennett, Dave Shaw and Guy Garman. Mark Ellyatt, Don Shirley and Pascal Bernabé were involved in serious incidents and were fortunate to survive their dives. Despite the extremely high mortality rate, the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; continues to maintain a record for scuba diving (although the record for deep diving with compressed air has not been updated since 1999, given the high accident rate). Amongst those who do survive significant health issues are reported. Mark Ellyatt is reported to have suffered permanent lung damage; Pascal Bernabé (who was injured on his dive when a light on his mask imploded) and Nuno Gomes reported short to medium term hearing loss.

Serious issues that confront divers engaging in ultra-deep diving on self-contained breathing apparatus include:
; Compression arthralgia: Deep aching pain in the knees, shoulders, fingers, back, hips, neck, and ribs caused by exposure to high ambient pressure at a relatively high rate of descent (i.e., in &quot;bounce dives&quot;).
; High-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS): HPNS, brought on by breathing helium under extreme pressure causes tremors, myoclonic jerking, somnolence, EEG changes, visual disturbance, nausea, dizziness, and decreased mental performance. Symptoms of HPNS are exacerbated by rapid compression, a feature common to ultra-deep &quot;bounce&quot; dives.
; Isobaric counterdiffusion (ICD): ICD is the diffusion of one inert gas into body tissues while another inert gas is diffusing out. It is a complication that can occur during decompression, and that can result in the formation or growth of bubbles without changes in the environmental pressure.
; Decompression algorithm: There are no reliable decompression algorithms tested for such depths on the assumption of an immediate surfacing. Almost all decompression methodology for such depths is based upon saturation, and calculates ascent times in days rather than hours. Accordingly, ultra-deep dives are almost always a partly experimental basis.

In addition, &quot;ordinary&quot; risks like size of gas reserves, hypothermia, dehydration and oxygen toxicity are compounded by extreme depth and exposure and long in-water decompression times. Some technical diving equipment is simply not designed for the greater pressures at these depths, and reports of key equipment (including submersible pressure gauges) imploding are not uncommon.

=== Air ===

A severe risk in ultra-deep air diving is deep water blackout, or depth blackout, a loss of consciousness at depths below with no clear primary cause, associated with nitrogen narcosis, a neurological impairment with anaesthetic effects caused by high partial pressure of nitrogen dissolved in nerve tissue, and possibly acute oxygen toxicity. The term is not in widespread use at present, as where the actual cause of blackout is known, a more specific term is preferred. The depth at which deep water blackout occurs is extremely variable and unpredictable. Before the popular availability of trimix, attempts were made to set world record depths using air. The extreme risk of both narcosis and oxygen toxicity in the divers contributed to a high fatality rate in those attempting records. In his book, &quot;Deep Diving&quot;, Bret Gilliam chronicles the various fatal attempts to set records as well as the smaller number of successes. From the comparatively few who survived extremely deep air dives:

In deference to the high accident rate, the Guinness World Records have ceased to publish records for deep air dives, after Manion&#x27;s dive.

==Fatalities during depth record attempts==
* Maurice Fargues, a member of the GRS (, Underwater Research Group headed by Jacques Cousteau), died in 1947 after losing consciousness at depth in an experiment to see how deep a scuba diver could go. He reached before failing to return line signals. He became the first diver to perish using an Aqua-Lung.&lt;ref name=&quot;SilentWorld /&quot;&gt;Cousteau, J. Y.; Dumas, Frédéric (1953).

* Archie Forfar and Ann Gunderson died on 11 December 1971 off the coast of Andros Island, while attempting to dive to , which would have been the world record at the time. Their third team member, Jim Lockwood, only survived due to his use of a safety weight that dropped when he lost consciousness at , causing him to start an uncontrolled ascent before being intercepted by a safety diver at a depth of around . Sheck Exley, who was acting as another safety diver at 300 feet, inadvertently managed to set the depth record when he descended towards Forfar and Gunderson, who were both still alive at the 480-foot level, although completely incapacitated by narcosis. Exley was forced to give up his attempt at around when the narcosis very nearly overcame him as well. The bodies of Forfar and Gunderson were never recovered.

<text>Herbert Lawrence Block, commonly known as Herblock (October13, 1909October7, 2001), was an American editorial cartoonist and author best known for his commentaries on national domestic and foreign policy.

During the course of a career stretching into nine decades, he won three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning (1942, 1954, and 1979), shared a fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for Public Service on Watergate, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1994), the National Cartoonist Society Editorial Cartoon Award in 1957 and 1960, the Reuben Award in 1956, the Gold Key Award (the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame) in 1979, and numerous other honors.

==Career==
Block was the youngest of three boys born in Chicago to a Catholic mother, Theresa Lupe Block, and a father of Jewish descent, David Julian Block, a chemist and electrical engineer. His brother Rich became president of an industrial laundry and his brother Bill was a newspaper reporter for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and later for the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot;.

He began taking classes at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was eleven, and adopted the &quot;Herblock&quot; signature in high school.

After graduating in 1927, he attended Lake Forest College for almost two years.

Late in his second year there he was hiredafter submitting some cartoons he had done in high school and college for the &quot;Evanston News-Index&quot;to replace the &quot;Chicago Daily News″&quot; departing editorial cartoonist. He never returned to school.

Block moved to Cleveland in 1933 to become the staff cartoonist for Newspaper Enterprise Association, which distributed his cartoons nationally.

He won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1942, then spent two years in the Army doing cartoons and press releases.
Upon discharge Block became chief editorial cartoonist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, where he worked until his death 55 years later.

Block&#x27;s cartoons were syndicated to newspapers around the world by Creators Syndicate from 1987 until his death in 2001.

He never married, and, in the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s employee index, his address was listed as simply &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Cartoons==
His first cartoon for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; (April24, 1929) advocated conservation of America&#x27;s forests. Herblock said that his family was conservative and that his father voted for Herbert Hoover in 1928. But with the onset of the Great Depression, he became a supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. He pointed out the dangers of Soviet aggression, the growing Nazi menace, and opposed American isolationists.

While he criticized Stalin and other Communist figures, he also believed that the United States was overreacting to the danger of communism.

In the early 1950s, Senator Joseph McCarthy was a recurring target of Herblock&#x27;s cartoons, one of which introduced the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot;.
He won a second Pulitzer Prize in 1954.
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; officially endorsed Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election.
Because Herblock supported Adlai Stevenson, the &quot;Post&quot; pulled his cartoons, but restored them after a week. He always insisted on total editorial independence, regardless of whether or not his cartoons agreed with the &quot;Post&quot;″s stance on political issues. He focused most of his attacks on those public figures in power, often on Republican figures, but Democrats who displeased him were not immune from criticism. As an example: despite being an ardent admirer of Franklin Roosevelt, he found it necessary to attack the president&#x27;s 1937 court-packing scheme.

During the 1950s, Herblock criticized Eisenhower mainly for insufficient action on civil rights and for not curbing the abuses of Senator McCarthy. In the following decade, he attacked the US war effort in Vietnam, causing President Johnson to drop his plans of awarding the cartoonist with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The cartoonist would eventually be awarded this honor by Bill Clinton in 1994.

Some of Herblock&#x27;s finest cartoons were those attacking the Nixon Administration during the Watergate Scandal, winning him his third Pulitzer Prize in 1979. Nixon canceled his subscription to the &quot;Post&quot; after Herblock drew him crawling out of an open sewer in 1954. He had once used the same motif for Senator McCarthy.

Herblock also regularly drew Nixon in the McCarthy era with his infamous &quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow&quot; beard stubble; shortly after Nixon was elected President in 1968, he published a cartoon of a barbershop with an open chair and the sign &quot;This establishment offers ONE FREE SHAVE to any new President. H. Block, Proprietor.&quot; Block never drew Nixon with stubble again.

He still ended up on the president&#x27;s infamous enemies list. In the 1980s and 1990s, he satirized and criticized Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton in addition to taking on the issues of the day: Gun control; abortion; the influence of fundamentalist Christian groups on public policy; and the Dot Com bubble. The tobacco industry was a favorite target of Herblock, who had smoked at one time. He gave it up and had criticized cigarette companies even before that.

Stating that he never got tired of his work, Herblock continued as the 21st century began by lampooning newly elected president George W. Bush. He died on October7, 2001, after a protracted bout of pneumonia six days short of what would have been his 92nd birthday. His final cartoon appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on August26.

==Honors==
Herblock won three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning (1942, 1954, 1979), shared a fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for Public Service on Watergate, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1994), the National Cartoonist Society Editorial Cartoon Award in 1957 and 1960, the Reuben Award in 1956, and the Gold Key Award (the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame) in 1979. In 1986 he received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College, and in 1999 an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Harvard University.

In 1961, he was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. Honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement.

In 1966, he was selected to design the U.S. postage stamp commemorating the 175th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.

In 1987 he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech.

In 2008 Herblock&#x27;s work was the subject of exhibitions entitled &quot;Herblock&#x27;s Presidents&quot; at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery (United States), and &quot;Herblock&#x27;s History&quot; at the Library of Congress. In late 2009 and early 2010, the Library of Congress showcased a new exhibition called &quot;Herblock!&quot;. This exhibition included cartoons that represented Block&#x27;s ability to wield his pen effectively and artfully. He used it to condemn corruption and expose injustice, inequality, and immorality. His topics included the Great Depression; the rise of fascism and World War II; communism and the Cold War; Senator Joseph McCarthy; race relations; Richard Nixon; the Reagan era; the 2000 election and more.

When Herb Block died in October 2001, he left $50 million with instructions to create a foundation to support charitable and educational programs that help promote and sustain the causes he championed during his 72 years of cartooning. The Herb Block Foundation awarded its first grants and the annual Herblock Prize in editorial cartooning in 2004. According to its website, the Herb Block Foundation &quot;is committed to defending the basic freedoms guaranteed all Americans, combating all forms of discrimination and prejudice and improving the conditions of the poor and underprivileged through the creation or support of charitable and educational programs with the same goals. The Foundation is also committed to improving educational opportunities to deserving students through post-secondary education scholarships and to promoting editorial cartooning through continuing research.&quot;

On January 27, 2014, HBO premiered a documentary, &quot;Herblock: The Black &amp; The White&quot;, which was executive produced by George Stevens Jr., produced and directed by his son, Michael Stevens, who also co-wrote with Sara Lukinson. The documentary interviews Jon Stewart, Lewis Black, Tom Brokaw, Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, Jules Feiffer, Ted Koppel and Ben Bradlee as witnesses to Block&#x27;s life, work and indelible contribution to American satire.

<doc id="291251" wikidata="Q1185073" url="?curid=291251" title="Regulation and licensure in engineering">
<text>Regulation and licensure in engineering is established by various jurisdictions of the world to encourage life, public welfare, safety, well-being, then environment and other interests of the general public and to define the licensure process through which an engineer becomes licensed to practice engineering and to provide professional services and products to the public.

As with many other professions and activities, engineering is often a restricted activity. Relatedly, jurisdictions that license according to particular engineering discipline define the boundaries of each discipline carefully so that practitioners understand what they are competent to do.

A licensed engineer takes legal responsibility for engineering work, product or projects (typically via a seal or stamp on the relevant design documentation) as far as the local engineering legislation is concerned. Regulations require that only a licensed engineer can sign, seal or stamp technical documentation such as reports, plans, engineering drawings and calculations for study estimate or valuation or carry out design analysis, repair, servicing, maintenance or supervision of engineering work, process or project. In cases where public safety, property or welfare is concerned, licensed engineers are trusted by the government and the public to perform the task in a competent manner. In various parts of the world, licensed engineers may use a protected title such as professional engineer, chartered engineer, or simply &quot;engineer&quot;.

== Legislative intent ==
It is often illegal for a practicing engineer to jeopardize public safety in any way. This means that an engineer must hold herself or himself to the highest level of technical and moral conduct reasonable or suffer litigation if an engineering system fails causing harm to the public, including maintenance technicians. Breaches of engineering law are often sufficient grounds for enforcement measures, which may include the suspension or loss of license and financial penalties. They may also include imprisonment, should gross negligence be shown to have played a part in loss of human life.

An engineering licence provides the public with the assurance that qualified persons are doing or overseeing engineering work. An unlicensed worker or manager has no specific liability, as this is borne by the employer through tort law or engineering legislation, and there is no regulatory authority to enforce acceptable engineering practice in relation to the work.

In cases of gross negligence, an engineering firm may not be considered vicariously liable for an individual engineer&#x27;s offence.

==Licensure and regulation==
Becoming a licensed engineer is a process that varies around the world but generally requires a four-year engineering degree and four years of engineering experience. In some regions, use of the term &quot;engineer&quot; is regulated, in others it is not. Where engineering is a regulated profession, there are specific procedures and requirements for obtaining a registration, charter or license to practice engineering. These are obtained from the government or a charter-granting authority acting on its behalf and engineers are subject to regulation by these bodies. In addition to licensure, there are voluntary certification programs for various disciplines which involve examinations accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards.

Due to occupational closure, licensed engineers enjoy significant influence over their regulation. They are often the authors of the pertinent codes of ethics used by some of these organizations. Engineers in private practice most often find themselves in traditional professional-client relationships in their practice. Engineers employed in government service and government-run industry are on the other side of that relationship. Despite the different focus, engineers in industry and private practice face similar ethical issues and reach similar conclusions. One American engineering society, the National Society of Professional Engineers, has sought to extend a single professional license and code of ethics for all engineers, regardless of practice area or employment sector.

== Asia ==
=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
China has two parallel systems for evaluating professional engineers, one as part of the &quot;Professional Title&quot; and the other as part of the &quot;Occupation Qualification&quot;.

Under the &quot;Professional Title&quot; system, engineers are divided into Assistant Engineer, Engineer, and Senior Engineer. Professional titles are awarded based on educational background, work experience, performance, participation in training programs, and awards received.

Under the &quot;Occupation Qualification&quot; system, engineers are classified by their specific profession, such as &quot;Registered Architect,&quot; &quot;Registered Structural Engineer,&quot; &quot;Registered Civil Engineer,&quot; &quot;Registered Electrical Engineer,&quot; &quot;Registered Public Equipment Engineer,&quot; etc. To obtain a registered engineer title, in addition to having a certain amount of work experience in a specific profession, one must pass a series of specific exams organized by the government.

Registered engineers must pass two levels of rigorous exams. Whether design documents or drawings need to be signed by registered engineers depends on provinces or cities.

To qualify, candidates must complete two levels of exams. The first level is an 8-hour close-book basic knowledge exam, covering coures of undergraduate engineering degrees. After passing this exam, participants can take the second-level professional exam the following year. This professional exam is divided into multiple disciplines, such as structural, architectural, electrical, and mechanical. It tests candidates&#x27; ability to understand and apply relevant codes and standards. The exam is conducted over a weekend, with each day featuring a 6-hour session. The first day&#x27;s exam focuses on code requirements, while the second day&#x27;s exam involves questions about actual engineering cases, requiring references to equations and performing calculations. 

=== Iran ===
In Iran, registration or licensure of professional engineers and engineering practice is governed by Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran).
For standardization, FE and PE exams are written and graded by a central organization, the National Organization for Examination and Training (NOET) which is known as Sanjesh in Persian.

Requirements for licensing are as follows:

Graduate from accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Complete a standard Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) written examination, which tests applicants on breadth of understanding of basic engineering principles and, optionally, some elements of an engineering speciality. Accumulate a certain amount of engineering experience requirement is at least four years. Complete a written Principles and Practice in Engineering (PE) examination, which tests the applicant&#x27;s knowledge and skills in their chosen engineering discipline (civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, computer, etc.), as well as engineering ethics.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, engineering education and profession is regulated by the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) via PEC Act 1976. PEC is a federal government organization. Any person with an engineering degree (BE/BS/BSc Engineering) from PEC accredited universities/institutes is legally allowed to register with the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) as a Registered engineer (RE). Previously, every engineering graduate registered with the PEC and at least five years of relevant work experience was eligible for the title of professional engineer (PE) without any exam. To improve the quality of engineering profession, this two-tier system has been enhanced via PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008. This system was realistically implemented starting 10 July 2010. Graduate engineers now enroll and practice as registered engineer (RE) in their general discipline of work. After at least five years of relevant work experience and accumulation of at least 17 CPD (Continued Professional Development) points, they may attempt the Engineering Practice Examination (EPE) conducted by the PEC. EPE is held by PEC biennially in major cities across the country. Those who pass the EPE are given the prestigious title of professional engineer (PE) in their specialized discipline of work.

To improve the quality of engineering services, engineers with professional engineer (PE) status are also required to engage in CPD activities in order to be able to retain their PE license. CPD points are awarded for various developmental activities such as formal education (e.g. Postgraduate diploma, master or PhD), on-job experience, participating in conferences/workshops as audience, speaker or organizer, publications in technical journals, part-time teaching activities, serving as guest lecturer (other than full-time teaching) and serving as external examiner for master/PhD thesis.

For CPD points system, upper limit of points has also been implemented to prevent abuse of the system and encourage balanced participation in various CPD activities. In case of on-job work experience which is the primary engagement of engineering profession, one CPD point is awarded for 400 hours of work. Upper limit of 2 credit points per year has been established for on-job work experience. Rewarding only 800 hours (~4 months full-time) of work per year has many benefits including inherent tolerance for bouts of unemployment, in-built allowance for sickness/disease/injury, discouraging workaholism, enabling full-time engineering teachers to gain relevant field experience with reduced time commitment (e.g. part-time consulting engagement) and encouraging participation in other CPD activities which further the engineering profession (e.g. guest lectures, publishing research, authoring a book and social work for engineers under recognized engineers&#x27; associations).

To avoid confusion, PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008 introduced the legal term &quot;registered person&quot;. Registered person is a term distinct from registered engineer (RE). It is a blanket term used for all persons enrolled with PEC in any capacity – whether as registered engineers (RE) or professional engineers (PE).

Mobility

In Pakistan, engineering is regulated at the federal level. Engineers recognized as registered engineer (RE) or professional engineer with PEC need not go through further process once they move to another province or territory within Pakistan. For structural engineers, registration with local building authority may be a further requirement depending upon the jurisdiction and local building code.

Washington Accord: Pakistan gained Observer status in Washington Accord in 2009, Provisional member in 2010 and became Full signatory on 21 June 2017. Pakistan was the 19th signatory ever to achieve this status.

IPEA &amp; IntPE: Through clause 13 (h) of PEC CPD Bye-laws 2008, PEC was unilaterally honoring the Engineers Mobility Forum (EMF)/International Professional Engineers Agreement (IPEA) since 10 July 2010. An engineer already registered as a professional engineer with EMF/IPEA would be exempt from EPE &amp; CPD points requirement and will be awarded professional engineer (PE) title on submission of application. On 29 June 2018, International Engineering Alliance (IEA) bestowed on PEC the authority to award IPE (IntPE) status to qualifying candidates. PEC developed the application framework and, since September 2020, began accepting applications through a dedicated IPEA portal on the PEC website.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the title &quot;engineer&quot; is not regulated. However, as per the &quot;Engineering Council Act No 4 of 2017&quot;, all engineering practitioners in Sri Lanka needs to be registered with the engineering council to practice. Failing to do so would result in an offence and can be convicted by a summary trial before a Magistrate with imprisonment period not exceeding one year and/or a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand rupees.

== Europe ==
The designation &quot;European Engineer&quot; (Eur Ing, EUR ING) is an international professional qualification and title for engineers in many European countries. The certificate for this is granted after successful application to a national member of &quot;Engineers Europe&quot; (previously named the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI)). &quot;Engineers Europe&quot; includes representation from many European countries, including much of the European Union.

&quot;Engineers Europe&quot; lobbies and strives to establish the EUR ING as a guarantee of competence for professional engineers. It is not a government or supranational (European Union) authority, but recognized by the EU as an example of self-regulation.

Because of that it can be problematic to add EUR ING to ones name in some states. Especially those who regulate the use of the term &quot;Engineer&quot;, abbreviations of it, and translations. And where the title Engineer can only be granted by recognized institutions (like universities). Of which &quot;Engineers Europe&quot; is none. The title EUR ING, if used, is supposed to be &quot;pre-nominal,&quot; i.e., it is placed before rather than after the name as in the case of a post-nominal title such as those for academic degrees. However, this clashes with the practice in some EU countries where academic degrees are also pre-nominal.

Ultimately national law, not the EUR ING certificate from &quot;Engineers Europe&quot;, defines if an engineering degree and usually an engineering professional qualification from one member country is recognized by another. For EU member states, Directive 2005/36/EC is the legal framework and must be implemented in national law.

Another association in Europe is the Eureta. The professional title &quot;Ing. EurEta&quot; is used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof). An engineer registered with EurEta &quot;European Higher Engineering and Technical Professionals Association&quot; is called an &quot;EurEta Registered Engineer,&quot; and has the right to use this title in Europe.

===Austria===
Austria&#x27;s nationally-based seat requirements for architects and engineers were criticised by the European Commission in 2016, as the Commission believed the requirements were not consistent with the EU&#x27;s Services Directive of 2006.

=== Germany ===
The use of the job title engineer (&quot;Ingenieur&quot; in German) was not regulated until the 8th of July 1965. It was estimated that at this point there were 105 000 Engineers with academic degrees, 225 000 engineers with an academy or engineering school degree, and 30 000 self-styled engineers. Self-styled engineers could apply for an exception to continue to use the job title or had to cease to use the title within a certain time frame.

From that point on the typical ways to be allowed to use the job title engineer were to obtain the academic title of a diploma engineer &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot;) or doctor engineer (Phd, &quot;Dr.-Ing.&quot;) from an academic institutions, or to obtain a graduated engineer title (&quot;Ingenieur (grad.)&quot;) from an engineering school or engineering academy. Earlier graduates from engineering schools or academies could continue to use the title or in some cases could change their title to &quot;Ingenieur (grad.)&quot;. Mining schools were granting some engineer titles, too.

In the 1970s German converted its engineering schools and academies into universities of applied sciences and founded new such universities. With this change the &quot;Ingenieur (grad.)&quot; was no longer granted. Instead universities of applied sciences awarded the academic title of diploma engineer &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot;, too. Over time, and depending on the actual state of the infighting between universities and universities of applied sciences, universities of applied sciences granted the title with a suffix &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)&quot;.

Around the same time the federal states (&quot;Bundesländer&quot;) established their own engineer laws, because in Germany education is a matter of regulation for the federal states, not the federal government. These laws are all very similar and describe who is allowed to use the job title of an engineer.

Today (2023) the number of engineers with the academic title &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot;, with or without a suffix, is on the decline. Germany adopted the Bologna Process and changed to a bachelor/master system with the respective academic titles. Only very few universities still provide diploma degree courses and grant an academic title with the word engineer (&quot;Ingenieur&quot;) in the title. For a doctorate the &quot;Dr.-Ing.&quot; is still awarded.

However, the use of the term &quot;Ingenieur&quot; continues to be protected even after the implementation of the bologna process. This also applies to translations and abbreviations. The group of people allowed to use the job title was actually widened. Typically since 2013 the engineer laws of the states allow persons who completed scientific or engineering studies of at least three years (e.g. bachelor, or the older diploma studies) at a German academic institution to use engineer as a job title. Also a lot of &quot;grandfather cases&quot; are covered, like engineers with a &quot;Ingenieur (grad.)&quot; title.

Further, the laws of the states contain provisions for the authorities to grant persons who obtained their engineering degree or title from a foreign institution or otherwise the right to use the job title. With special provisions for EU member states.

The state laws typically regard the unauthorized use of the job title engineer as a misdemeanor. § 132a of the criminal code of Germany makes the unauthorized use of an academic degree title a criminal offense punishable by up to one year of imprisonment or a fine.

==== Engineering chambers ====
Engineers offering certain engineering services need to be a member of an engineering chamber (&quot;Ingenieurkammer&quot;) by law. This is most commonly the case for freelance consulting (&quot;Beratender Ingenieur&quot;) activities in construction, but can also be required for other engineering work. Voluntary membership is also possible.

Engineering chambers are self-governing and provide services for their members.

==== &quot;Techniker&quot; ====
&quot;State-certified engineer&quot; (German: &quot;staatlich geprüfter Techniker&quot;) is a for a professional engineering technologist (not to be confused with an engineering technician or &quot;Dipl.-Ing&quot;).

The certificate is granted to engineering technologists upon successful completion of a technical college and it is also granted by an international organization with headquarters in Germany, the &quot;BVT&quot;, Federal Association of Higher Professions for Technology, Economy and Design (&quot;Bundesverband höherer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V.&quot;).

&quot;Techniker&quot; certificates have been grouped on the same level as academic bachelor&#x27;s degrees in national (DFQ) and European Qualifications Framework (EFQ).

A member of the BVT is entitled to use the initials &quot;BVT&quot; after his name. To achieve this qualification, it is required to complete a 42-month apprenticeship program, a minimum 2,400 hour college diploma in engineering or technology, two years of relevant experience and pass the state examination. The academic requirement to be a state-certified engineer is a degree equivalent to &quot;level 6 on EQF = bachelor&quot; on the European Qualification Framework. A bachelor&#x27;s (honours) degree in engineering or engineering technology from an accredited university is also equated to level 6 on EQF. A state-certified engineer is not required to complete a university degree. Before Jan. 31, 2012, a state-certified engineer certificate usually qualified the holder to proceed to bachelor&#x27;s level education at a university of applied science. In the past, this led to wide and controversial discussions between bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees engineers and state-certified engineers.

Today, this is on the same level as a bachelor&#x27;s degree. One can continue to study to a master&#x27;s degree level to achieve SCE qualification. The academic requirements for qualification are similar to incorporated engineer qualification/registration by EC UK. State-certified engineers now assist engineers with only a diploma or master&#x27;s degree. They are also holding full engineering positions as systems engineers, integration engineers, test engineers, QA engineers, etc.

State-certified engineer, business manager and designer levels are now a level 6–Bachelor on DQF and EQF, as of Jan. 31, 2012.
The following top representatives and agents institutions were involved: federal government (Federal Ministry for Education and Research, Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology), standing conference and economic ministerial meeting of countries, the Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Associations, German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, German Trade Union Federation and the Federal Institute for Vocational Application. They agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF, as a German qualifications framework (DQR).

=== United Kingdom ===
&quot;In general there is no restriction on the right to practise as an engineer in the UK. However there are a small number of areas of work, generally safety related, which are reserved by statute, regulations or industry standards to licensed or otherwise approved persons.&quot; The title &quot;engineer&quot; is not regulated, but certain engineering titles are. There is no system for licensing, but registers are held of qualified persons. The Engineering Council is the UK regulatory body for its engineering profession. It holds the national registers of 235,000 engineers registered as EngTech (engineering technicians), ICTTech (information and communications technology technicians), IEng (incorporated engineers) and CEng (chartered engineers). These titles are fully protected under law by means of the Engineering Council&#x27;s royal charter and bylaws. In order to protect these titles, action is taken through the courts against their unauthorized use.

To receive designation as a CEng, it is required to have approved education (typically to Master&#x27;s level) and also demonstrate significant technical and commercial leadership and management competencies.

A chartered engineer is entitled to register through Engineers Europe (formerly FEANI) as a European Engineer and use the pre-nominal designation EUR ING.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===
The practice of engineering in Canada is highly regulated under a system of licensing administered by a self regulated engineering association in each province. In Canada the designation &quot;professional engineer&quot; and &quot;engineer&quot; (including titles containing the word engineer and abbreviations such as P. Eng.) can only be used by licensed engineers and the practice of engineering is protected in law in all provinces. The regulation and licensing of engineers is done through each province&#x27;s own engineering association which was created by acts passed by that province&#x27;s legislature. There is also Engineers Canada which regulates undergraduate programs for engineering. The process for registration is generally as follows:

# Qualify academically by one of two equally valid methods:
## Graduate with a degree from an accredited program in engineering or applied science, accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).
## Graduate from a non-CEAB program with a minimum of two years education in engineering or a related study area plus the completion of a technical examination program.
# Complete an engineer-in-training (EIT) or engineering internship program under the direction of a professional engineer. With the exception of Quebec, this is a minimum four-year program.
# Review of work experience by the association.
# Pass a professional practice exam, on engineering law the content and format of which differs by province.

Professional engineers are not licensed in a specific discipline but are bound by their respective provincial engineering legislation (e.g. in Ontario: Professional Engineers Act R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 941, Section 72) from practicing beyond their training and experience. Breaches of the code are often sufficient grounds for enforcement measures, which may include the suspension or loss of license and financial penalties. It could also result in serving time jail, should negligence be shown to have played a part in any incident that causes loss of human life.

Engineers are not tested on technical knowledge during the licensing process if their education was accredited by the CEAB. Accreditation of schools and their accredited degree granting status are monitored and controlled. This accreditation process is governed by Engineers Canada through their active group CEAB.

The accreditation process is continuous and enforced through regular accreditation reviews of each school. These reviews typically include the review of the school&#x27;s curriculum (including marked final exams and assignments), interviews of current students, extracurricular activities and teaching staff as well additional areas the visiting board may feel need addressing. The specific areas considered are curriculum content, program environment and general criteria. The associations are granted both an exclusive right to title and an exclusive right to practice. A professional engineer is legally required to be licensed in most provinces. The level of enforcement varies depending on the specific industry but often a complaint needs to be filed for regulatory action to commence.

The professional engineer&#x27;s license is only valid in the province of delivery. There are, however, agreements between the associations to ease mobility. In 2009, professional engineers Ontario led an initiative to develop a national engineering licensing framework.

The term &quot;engineer&quot; is often used loosely in some Canadian industry sectors to describe people working in the field of engineering technology—not professional engineering—as engineering technologists or engineering technicians and trades names such as stationary engineer. For example, the Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy often calls its technicians &quot;marine engineers,&quot; &quot;power engineers&quot; and &quot;military engineers&quot; internally, but not in the public domain. The term &quot;locomotive engineer&quot; has been an integral part of the Canadian railroad since its inception. &quot;Stationary engineering&quot; is a trade whose technicians operate heavy machinery and equipment that provide heat, light, climate control and power.

=== United States ===
In the United States, registration or licensure of professional engineers and engineering practice is governed by the individual states. Each registration or license is valid only in the state where it is granted. Some licensed engineers maintain licenses in more than one state. Comity, also known as reciprocity, between states allows engineers who are licensed or registered in one state to obtain a license in another state without meeting the ordinary rigorous proof of qualification by testing. This is accomplished by the second state recognizing the validity of the first state&#x27;s licensing or registration process.

==== History ====
Licensure in the United States began in the State of Wyoming when lawyers, notaries and others without engineering education were making poor quality submissions to the state for permission to use state water for irrigation. Clarence Johnson, the Wyoming state engineer, presented a bill in 1907 to the state legislature that required registration for anyone presenting themselves as an engineer or land surveyor and created a board of examiners. Charles Bellamy, a 52-year-old engineer and mineral surveyor then became the first licensed professional engineer in the United States. After enactment, Johnson would wryly write about the effect of the law, saying, &quot;A most astonishing change took place within a few months in the character of maps and plans filed with the applications for permits.&quot; Louisiana, followed by Florida and Illinois, would become the next states to require licensure. Montana became the last state to legislate the licensing in 1947, except Hawaii.

==== Requirements ====
Requirements for licensing vary, but generally are as follows:

# Graduate from an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science in engineering, Master of Science in engineering, Master of Engineering) or in some states, graduate from an ABET-accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering technology.
# Complete a standard Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) written examination, which tests applicants on breadth of understanding of basic engineering principles and, optionally, some elements of an engineering speciality. Completion of the first two steps typically qualifies applicants for certification in the United States as an engineer in training (EIT), sometimes also called an engineer intern (EI).
# Accumulate a certain amount of engineering experience: in most states the requirement is four years, but it is lower in some. For engineering technology graduates, the required number of years may be higher.
# Complete a written Principles and Practice in Engineering (PE) examination, which tests the applicant&#x27;s knowledge and skills in their chosen engineering discipline (civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, etc.), as well as engineering ethics.

For standardization, FE and PE exams are written and graded by a central organization, the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES). However, each state&#x27;s board of professional engineers individually sets the requirements to take the exams, as well as the passing score. For example, applicants in some states must provide professional references from several PEs before they can take the PE exam. There is a fairly large range in exam pass rates for FE and PE exams, but the pass rate for repeat test takers is significantly lower.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia have engineering boards that are represented on the NCEES, which administers both the FE and PE examinations.

Degree requirements in the United States are evolving. Effective January 1, 2020, the NCEES model will require additional credits beyond a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. NCEES is developing the types of creditable activities that will satisfy the additional educational requirement. This has received some support from civil engineers.

As of 2023, it is still possible for an individual to bypass Steps No. 2 and 4. In Texas, for example, FE exam waivers are still available to individuals with several years of creditable experience.

In a few states, it is still possible for an individual to bypass Step No. 1 and apply to take the registration examinations—as long as a PE sponsors the applicant—because work experience can be substituted for academic experience. The requirement for years of experience may also vary. For example, in California it is possible to take a PE examination with only two years of experience after a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree or one year of experience after a Master of Engineering. In other states candidates may take one of the PE exams directly through NCEES, in some cases immediately after graduation, but they still must wait until obtaining the required experience before obtaining a license. Some states also have state-specific examinations. California requires two additional exams in land surveying and earthquake engineering for civil engineering candidates and many states have exams based on their individual laws and ethics requirements.

Some states issue generic professional engineering licenses. Others, known as &quot;discipline states&quot;, issue licenses for specific disciplines of engineering, such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, nuclear engineering, electrical engineering and chemical engineering. However, in all cases engineers are ethically required to limit their practice to their area of competency, which is usually a small portion of a discipline. While licensing boards do not often enforce this limitation, it can be a factor in negligence lawsuits. In a few states, licensed civil engineers may also perform land survey work.

In addition to the person&#x27;s license, most states require that firms providing engineering services are authorized to do so. For instance, the state of Florida requires businesses offering engineering services to be registered with the state and have a Florida licensed professional engineer qualify the business.

Civil engineers account for a large portion of licensed professional engineers. In Texas, for example, about 37 percent of licenses are for civil engineers, with civil engineering exams making up more than half of the exams taken. Many of the remainder are mechanical, electrical and structural engineers. However, some engineers in other fields obtain licenses for the ability to serve as professional witnesses in courts, before government committees or just for prestige—even though they may never actually sign and seal design documents.

Areas that include much of mechanical, aerospace and chemical engineering may be specifically exempted from regulation under an &quot;industrial exemption&quot;. The industrial exemption varies from state to state. An industrial exemption covers engineers who design products such as automobiles that are sold (or have the potential to be sold) outside the state where they are produced, as well as the equipment used to produce the product. Structures subject to building codes are not covered by an industrial exemption, though small residential buildings often do not require an engineer&#x27;s seal. In some jurisdictions, the role of architects and structural engineers overlap. In general, the primary professional responsible for designing habitable buildings is an architect. The architect signs and seals design plans for buildings and other structures that humans may occupy. A structural engineer is contracted to provide technical structural design ensuring the stability and safety of the overall structure, however, no states currently allow engineers the ability to perform professional architecture without also being licensed as an architect.

Many private companies employ non-degree workers in technical positions with engineering titles such as &quot;test engineer&quot; or &quot;field engineer&quot;. At the company&#x27;s discretion, as long as the company does not offer engineering services directly to the public or other businesses, such positions may not require an engineering license.

However, it is important to make a distinction between a &quot;graduate engineer&quot; and a &quot;professional engineer&quot;. A &quot;graduate engineer&quot; is anyone holding a degree in engineering from an accredited four-year university program, but is not licensed to practice or offer services to the public. Unlicensed engineers usually work as employees for a company or as professors in engineering colleges, where they are governed under the industrial exemption clause.

==Designations==
Letters after or before a person&#x27;s name (post-nominal or pre-nominal letters) are commonly used to denote the holder of an engineering license in various jurisdictions:

===Europe===
* Eur Ing (European engineer) in Europe, used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof.) after being suitably registered in their own country and then accepted by FEANI.
* Ing.P.Eur (European professional engineer) in Europe, used as a pre-nominal.
* &quot;Ing.&quot; (&quot;ingeniero&quot;) in Spain, used as a pre-nominal, for the engineers who have the equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree as they studied five or six courses in an engineering superior school. There also exists an &quot;ingeniero técnico&quot; (&quot;I.T.&quot;), who is a professional that holds a &quot;degree&quot; and a minimum formation of three courses in an engineering official college. Both types of engineers have full competency in their respective professional field of engineering, being the difference that the three-year engineers have competence only in their specialty (mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc.) and the &quot;engineering superior school&quot; engineers have wider competences. The Bologna process changes this structure. The degree will require four courses and the superior engineering school engineers will equal the ones that hold a master&#x27;s in engineering.
* &quot;Eng.&quot; (&quot;Engenheiro&quot;) in Portugal, used as a pre-nominal. An &quot;engenheiro&quot; is a full chartered professional in engineering who was awarded a master&#x27;s degree (2nd study cycle according to the Bologna process system) by an accredited engineering school. In Portugal there is also the &quot;engenheiro técnico&quot; who is a professional with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (first study cycle) in engineering or engineering sciences. Accredited master&#x27;s degrees in engineering are regulated and certified by the &quot;Ordem dos Engenheiros&quot; (Order of Engineers) and every professional full chartered engineer is registered at the &quot;Ordem.&quot;
* In Finland, regulation affects only academic degrees. In academic education, the degree of &quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot; (&quot;dipl. ins.&quot; or &quot;DI&quot;), officially translated &quot;Master of Science (Technology)&quot;, is awarded by universities and universities of technology and is preceded by an intermediate bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;tekniikan kandidaatti&quot;) or equivalent studies. In vocational education, the degrees &quot;insinööri&quot; and &quot;ylempi insinööri (amk)&quot; are awarded by polytechnics.
* In Germany the &quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot; (&quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot;, diploma engineer) is awarded by the educational ministries of the federal states (&quot;Bundesländer&quot;) after having completing an academic engineering education according to the German engineer&#x27;s law (&quot;Ingenieurgesetz&quot;). The degrees &quot;Ing. grad.&quot; (&quot;graduierter Ingenieur&quot;, graduate engineer) and &quot;Obering.&quot; (&quot;Oberingenieur&quot;, supervisor engineer) are no longer awarded. (pre-nominal letters)
* &quot; Ing. EurEta&quot; is used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof). An engineer registered with EurEta &quot;European Higher Engineering and Technical Professionals Association&quot; is called an &quot;EurEta Registered Engineer&quot; and has the right to use this title in Europe.
* State-certified Engineer BVT. These titles are the respective translations (authorized by the German Federal Government) of staatlich geprüfter Techniker in Europe.
* Ir.&quot; in the Netherlands (for engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree from a university) or Ing.&quot; (for engineers holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree from a professional school). (pre-nominal letters)
* Ir.&quot; in Belgium (for &quot;civil&quot; engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree in &quot;engineering/bio-engineering sciences&quot; from a university) or Ing.&quot; (for &quot;industrial&quot; engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree in &quot;applied engineering&quot;, formerly from university colleges, from 2013 these formations are integrated in the universities). (pre-nominal letters)
* Ing.&quot; in Italy used as a pre-nominal (for engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree ) or Ing.jr&quot; (for engineers holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree). A state exam is required. (pre-nominal letters) Registration is with the Consiglio Nazionale degli Ingegneri.
* &quot;Siv. Ing.&quot; (sivilingeniør, Master of Science) and &quot;ing.&quot; (høyskoleingeniør, Bachelor of Science) in Norway. The title is used by persons holding degrees from accredited engineering colleges and universities.
* CEng (chartered engineer) and IEng (incorporated engineer) in the UK and Ireland. UK and Irish engineers may also carry post-nominal letters specific to their specialist engineering institute, such as MIET (professional engineers and graduate professionals registered with the Institution of Engineering and Technology). In the UK these are recognized as regulated qualifications and titles.
* &quot;Civ. Ing.&quot; in Sweden (for engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree in engineering, Master of Engineering, Master of Science in Engineering) and &quot;högskoleingenjör&quot; in Sweden (for engineers holding a Bachelor of Science degree).
* &quot;Cand.polyt.&quot; in Denmark (for engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree in engineering, Master of Engineering, Master of Science in engineering).
* &quot;Ing.&quot; in Romania, used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof.).
* &quot;Ing.&quot; for engineers holding a master&#x27;s degree in Czech Republic and Slovak republic, used as a pre-nominal (similar to Mgr. = MSc).
* inż.&quot; and mgr inż.&quot; in Poland, inż., inżynier (&quot;engineer&quot;) is the title obtained after 3,5 years of technical studies; &quot;inżynier&quot; who obtained MSc degree, uses &quot;mgr inż.&quot; (&quot;magister inżynier&quot;, literally: &quot;master engineer&quot;). The &quot;mgr&quot; degree can be obtained in two years post-graduate education or formerly (until full adaptation of the Bologna process by university) through an integrated five-year Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program. Some (particularly in the U.S.) mistakenly believe that &quot;mgr inż.&quot; is some kind of separate degree, while in fact these are two degrees, regardless of how they were obtained. The degree in general includes license to practice, although some regulation may require additional registration to perform specific tasks (see pre-nominal letters).
* &quot;маг. инж.&quot; (Mag. Inzh. from &quot;magister (master) engineer&quot;) in Bulgaria (for engineers holding a master&#x27;s (magister) degree) or &quot;инж.&quot; (for engineers holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree). (pre-nominal letters)
* &quot;Inġ.&quot; in Malta (for engineers holding a university degree and at least three years of experience).
* &quot;PEng (UK) in UK (for engineers who are members of Society of Professional Engineers UK).
* &quot;BVT in Germany (for engineers holding three-and-a-half years of certified apprenticeship, followed by a minimum of a 2,400-hour degree and a minimum of two years of approved relevant experience, members of the federal Association of Higher Professionals for Technology, Economy and Design).
* &quot;Müh.&quot; or &quot;&quot;Mühendis&quot; in Turkey. The titled is used by persons holding a degree from four years of study in accredited engineering universities.
* &quot;Διπλωματούχος Μηχανικός&quot; (Diploma owner in Engineering) or &quot;Διπλ. Μηχ.&quot; in Greece is the title that is used by persons holding a five years of study degree from a public engineering university. This separates them from &quot;simple&quot; engineers having four years of studies in Greek &quot;TEI&quot; (Technical Educational Institutes).

===Latin America===
* &quot;Ing.&quot; in most Spanish speaking countries (pre-nominal letters) (similar to Dr. or Prof): Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, México, Perú, Uruguay, Venezuela.
* In Chile customary practice consists in placing the post-nominal term &quot;ingeniero civil&quot; plus the specialty area, such as &quot;ingeniero civil eléctrico&quot;, &quot;ingeniero civil en minería&quot; or &quot;ingeniero civil químico&quot;.
* &quot;Eng.&quot; (&quot;engenheiro&quot;) customary practice in post-nominal terms such as: engenheiro civil, engenheiro mecânico, engenheiro electricista, engenheiro florestal, engenheiro agrônomo, engenheiro de segurança do trabalho in Brazil. Registration by CONFEA/CREA in the federation states of Pará, Maranhão, Tocantins, São Paulo and others but to work in more than one state is possible only with &quot;visto&quot;.
* &quot;R.Eng.&quot; registered engineer in Trinidad and Tobago, as accredited by the Board of Engineering of Trinidad and Tobago.

===North America===
* &quot;PE&quot; or &quot;P.E.&quot; is used in the United States. Individual states grant PE registration, which can sometimes be endorsed by other states.
* &quot;P.Eng.&quot; is used in Canada, including the province of Quebec. This is a regulated title, and requires licensing.
* &quot;Eng.&quot; () is used in Quebec (professional engineers in Quebec may use either Eng., P.Eng. or ing., which are all equivalent).

==Title usage==
In many countries, laws exist that limit the use of job titles containing the word &quot;engineer&quot;.

===Canada===
In Canada it is illegal to practice engineering or use the title &quot;professional engineer&quot; or &quot;engineer&quot;, without a license. There are two exceptions—stationary engineer and power engineer. Engineering in Canada is regulated in the public interest by self-governing professional licensing bodies. These bodies were established by Canada&#x27;s 13 provincial and territorial governments through legislation. The provincial and territorial governments have delegated their constitutional authority to regulate engineers and engineering in Canada to professional licensing bodies that are maintained and governed by the profession, creating a system of self-regulation.

The first law related to professional engineering in Ontario was created in 1922 and allowed for the creation of a voluntary association to oversee registration of engineers. The Act of 1922 was &quot;open&quot;, meaning that membership in the association was not mandatory for practising engineers. In Ontario, regulation of engineering practice dates to 1937, when the Professional Engineers Act was amended and the engineering profession was &quot;closed&quot; to non-qualified individuals; that is, licensure was made mandatory for anyone practising professional engineering. The provincial government determined that it would be in the public interest to restrict the practice of engineering to those who were qualified and the right to practice was &quot;closed&quot; to non-engineers as a result of the failures of bridges and buildings, which had been designed by unskilled individuals.

Canadian provinces legally allow engineers to self-regulate their profession. The licensing bodies fulfil this mandate by ensuring standards of engineering practice and education in Canada, by setting standards for admission into the profession, by disciplining engineers who fail to uphold the profession&#x27;s practice and ethical standards and by preventing the misuse of the title professional engineer by individuals who are not licensed members of the profession. They also take appropriate action to prevent the illegal practice of engineering by unlicensed individuals. Each licensing body&#x27;s mandate and obligation to undertake this role is laid out in the act that created it. Although each act is slightly different, most also define a scope of practice for engineers and specifically restrict the use of the title professional engineer to individuals who have been licensed by the engineering licensing body in the province or territory where the act applies.

The use of the term engineer was an issue between professional bodies, the IT industry and the security industry, where companies or associations may issue certifications or titles with the word engineer as part of that title (such as security engineer or Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer). Microsoft has since changed the title to &quot;Microsoft Certified IT Professional&quot;. Several licensing bodies for professional engineering contend that only licensed professional engineers are legally allowed to use the title engineer. The IT industry, on the other hand, counters that:

# These title holders never presented themselves as professional engineers
# Provincial laws, other than in Quebec and Ontario, regulate only the use of term professional engineer and not any title with the word engineer; in Quebec and Ontario, the term engineer is protected by both the Engineers Act and by Section 32 of the Professional Code
# The IT industry has used the term engineer since the dawn of the computing industry in the 60s.

Court rulings regarding the usage of the term engineer have been mixed. For example, after complaints were lodged by the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers, a court in Quebec fined Microsoft Canada $1,000 for misusing the &quot;engineer&quot; title by referring to MCSE graduates as engineers. Conversely an Alberta court dismissed the lawsuit filed by The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA) against Raymond Merhej for using the title &quot;system engineer,&quot; claiming that, &#x27;The respondent&#x27;s situation is such that it cannot be contended that the public is likely to be deceived, confused or jeopardized by his use of the term...&#x27;&quot; APEGGA also lost the appeal to this decision.

The Canadian Information Processing Society, and in particular CIPS Ontario, have attempted to strike a balance between the professional engineering licensing bodies and the IT industry over the use of the term engineer in the software industry, but so far no major agreements or decisions have been announced.

Additional confusion has taken place over similarly-named occupations. One such example is power engineers or stationary engineers. Graduates of a two-year college level power engineering technology program in Nova Scotia may use the title power engineer or stationary engineer. This conflicts with the title often used in the electrical industry for professional engineers who design related equipment and can cause confusion.

===Europe and Latin America===
* Regulation and titling of engineers in Europe are handled differently by various countries.
* In Germany and some other European and Latin American countries, the term diploma engineer implies that the person has completed typically one year of academic work beyond the basic Bachelor of Engineering degree and completed a major academic project, similar to a master&#x27;s thesis. Therefore, a diploma engineer is a university degree and not a professional registration or license. However, in Germany and most other countries where the diploma engineer degree exist, there is no professional registration or license in engineering (with a very limited number of exceptions, such as civil engineering in Germany). For this reason, graduates holding these degrees are generally allowed to use the legally protected title of &quot;engineer&quot; within these countries. In Germany the usage of the term engineer (&quot;Ingenieur&quot;) as such, not just the &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot;, is protected by various &quot;Länder&quot; (states of Germany) laws—because education matters are governed by the legislation of the &quot;Länder&quot;, not the federal government. Although the details of the laws vary, they all properly restrict the usage of the term. Examples of such laws are listed in the endnotes.
* In France, the title engineer is used liberally and is often attributed based on professional position rather than initial qualification. However, the title ingénieur diplomé (diploma engineer) is reserved for people having followed one of the trainings listed by the Commission des Titres d&#x27;Ingénieur (Commission for Engineer Titles). It corresponds to a highly selective master&#x27;s degree level.
* In Turkey use of the title is limited by several laws to people with an engineering degree from an accredited higher education institution or university. Engineering and architecture professions and related titles are governed by Law No. 3458, which came into effect in 1938. There are also several laws for each of the engineering branches. Usage of the &quot;mühendis&quot; (engineer in Turkish) title by others (even those with much more work experience) is illegal and punishable by law.
* In Chile, the ingeniero (engineer) title is regulated by law, which distinguishes at least three different kinds of professional engineering titles. First, the igeniería de ejecución, which only requires a degree in applied science and a technical degree from a university or a technical institute (usually four years total). Second, ingeniería, which requires a major degree in basic sciences plus a technical degree, both from a university (usually five years total). Third, ingeniería civil, which requires an academic major degree in basic sciences, a minor degree in applied sciences and a technical degree, all from a university (usually six or six and a half years total). In all cases, the term refers to a professional degree conceded by an educational institution, yet it can only be given by certain institutions when all legal requirements are met.
* In Brazil, the title of engenheiro (engineer)—and in Argentina, the title of ingeniero—can only be legally used by someone with a five- or six-year engineering degree. In Argentina most universities have a five- or six-year engineering degree (Around 3,500–4,000 hours of classes or approx. 240–250 credits, where one credit equals 16 contact hours). Both countries concede the degree most commonly through universities and sometimes through certain institutions.
* In Puerto Rico, use of the title ingeniero (engineer) is restricted to those holding an engineer&#x27;s license registered by the Puerto Rico Professional College of Engineers and Land Surveyors. These people have the right to add the prefix Ing. before their names on resumes, business cards and other communication.

===United Kingdom===
There is no restriction on anyone describing themselves as an engineer or working as an engineer in the UK. The word &quot;engineer&quot; has a broad sense and can refer to multiple different jobs associated with engineering. Specific titles, however, are protected. In addition to professional engineering titles, these include &quot;Registered Gas Engineer&quot; and &quot;Chief Engineer Class 1 [or 2] Fishing Vessel&quot;.

The Engineering Council grants the titles &quot;Chartered Engineer&quot;, &quot;Incorporated Engineer&quot;, &quot;Engineering Technician&quot; and &quot;Information and Communications Technology Technician&quot; under its royal charter. These titles are protected under civil law. The Engineering Council is also the UK member of the International Professional Engineers Agreement and awards the title of &quot;International Professional Engineer (UK)&quot;.

Various engineering institutions grant their own professional titles in addition to those granted by the Engineering Council. These include &quot;Chartered Chemical Engineer&quot; (Institution of Chemical Engineers), &quot;Chartered Mechanical Engineer&quot; (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), &quot;Chartered Civil Engineer&quot; (Institution of Civil Engineers), &quot;Chartered Energy Engineer&quot; and &quot;Chartered Petroleum Engineer&quot; (Energy Institute), &quot;Chartered Gas Engineer&quot; (Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers), &quot;Chartered Marine Engineer&quot; (Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology), &quot;Chartered Structural Engineer&quot; (Institution of Structural Engineers), and &quot;Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology&quot; (Institution of Engineering and Technology).

===United States===
In the United States, the practice of professional engineering is highly regulated and the title &quot;professional engineer&quot; is legally protected, meaning that it is unlawful to use it to offer engineering services to the public unless permission, certification or other official endorsement is specifically granted by that state through a professional engineering license. Also, many states prohibit unlicensed persons from calling themselves an &quot;engineer&quot; or indicating branches or specialties not covered by the licensing acts. Employees of state or federal agencies may also call themselves engineers if that term appears in their official job title. The IEEE&#x27;s formal position on this is as follows: &quot;The title, engineer and its derivatives should be reserved for those individuals whose education and experience qualify them to practice in a manner that protects public safety. Strict use of the title serves the interest of both the IEEE-USA and the public by providing a recognized designation by which those qualified to practice engineering may be identified.&quot;

Every state regulates the practice of engineering to ensure public safety by granting only Professional Engineers (PEs) the authority to sign and seal engineering plans and offer their services to the public. There are additional requirements to include at least one professional engineer within the firm for these type of companies to include the word engineering in the title of the business, although these requirements are not universal.

In the United States an &quot;industrial exemption&quot; allows businesses to employ employees and call them an &quot;engineer&quot;, as long as such individuals are under the direct supervision and control of the business entity and function internally related to manufacturing (manufactured parts) related to the business entity or work internally within an exempt organization. Such person does not have the final authority to approve or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans or specifications that are to be: (A) incorporated into fixed works, systems or facilities on the property of others; or (B) made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from representing an ability or willingness to perform engineering services or make an engineering judgment requiring a licensed professional engineer, engage in practice of engineering, offer engineering services directly to the public and/or other businesses; unless the business entity is registered with the state&#x27;s board of engineering and the practice is carried on/supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering. Examples are sanitation engineer, production engineer, test engineer, network engineer, project engineer, systems engineer and sales engineer. These are often seen in engineering job advertisements online and in news papers. Most of the advertisements and employers do not require licensing because these positions do not pose a direct threat to public health or pose a liability danger.

The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety or safeguarding of life, health or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education and government need not be licensed.

In the United States, use of the title professional engineer is restricted to those holding a professional engineer&#x27;s license. These people have the right to add the letters PE after their names on resumes, business cards and other communication. However, each state has its own licensing procedure and the license is valid only in the state that granted it. Therefore, many professional engineers maintain licenses in more than one state. Comity, also known as reciprocity, between states allows engineers who are licensed or registered in one state to obtain a license in another state without meeting the ordinary rigorous proof of qualification by testing. This is accomplished by the second state recognizing the validity of the first state&#x27;s licensing or registration process.

Other uses of the term engineer are legally controlled and protected to varying degrees, dependent on the state and the enforcement of its engineering certification board. The term is frequently applied to fields where practitioners may have no engineering background or the work has no basis in the physical engineering disciplines; for example sanitation engineer.

With regard to the term &quot;software engineer&quot;, many states, such as Texas and Florida, have introduced license requirements for such a title that are in line with the requirements for more traditional engineering fields.

==Complaints process==
Generally engineering regulatory bodies will not launch an investigation without a complaint form being filled out by an individual. The complaint will be the basis of an investigation into professional misconduct, breach of contract or negligence.

== Disciplinary committees ==
California law dictates disciplinary proceedings by the Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists against a licensed engineer who has committed deceit, misrepresentation, negligence, or a contract violation. The Professional Engineers of Ontario have a disciplinary committee that hears complaints of professional misconduct and incompetence.
A discipline committee may suspend a certificate of authorization (firm license) for an engineering corporation or an engineering license or issue a fine for violations of local engineering legislation, such as professional misconduct, deceit, misrepresentation, negligence, or violation of a contract.

==Cost engineering==
The AACE, a professional body for cost engineers, explains why a technical engineering background is not required for their profession with the following statement:

<text>The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel&#x27;s ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers&#x27; ballots make up the other 20 percent. The game&#x27;s viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones. Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team. Voters cannot select an entire unit.

The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game&#x27;s inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine. Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL. At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP. Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy. The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LIX, is Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.

Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana and Patrick Mahomes won three times and three other players—Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw and Eli Manning—have won the award twice. Starr, Bradshaw, and Mahomes are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys&#x27; loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts. Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen. Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 34 times in 59 games (and 60 awards).

From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car as a part of their MVP award. However, since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.

<doc id="291254" wikidata="Q1115567" url="?curid=291254" title="Drift diving">
<text>Drift diving is a type of scuba diving where a diver is transported by water movement caused by the tide, an ocean current or in a river. The choice whether to drift dive depends on the purpose of the dive and whether there is an option. At some sites there is almost always a current running, and at others the strength and direction of water movement may vary with the tide, or other driving forces, like wind or recent rainfall. At some sites there may be considerable variation in visibility and underwater life activity based on the speed and direction of flow.

The current gives the diver the impression of flying and allows the diver to cover long distances underwater, possibly seeing more habitats and formations than usual. Often drift diving is performed more for the experience of underwater &quot;flight&quot; and less for interactions with underwater life, which, given the speed at which most divers move, are reduced.

==Environment==

Drift diving is defined by the diver being primarily carried by the flow of water, so can be done anywhere that the water flow is suitable. This generally implies tolerable turbulence, and mainly horizontal flow. Blue-water diving and black-water diving in mid-water are usually drift diving, and wall diving is often drift diving when a current flows along the wall.

===Hazards===

==Skills==

The skills used in drift diving are not fundamentally different from the skills of scuba diving in similar circumstances in water without current. The main differences are in awareness of position and movement relative to the fixed surroundings, and avoiding and managing impacts and entanglement. 
Drift diving skills are not generally included in basic entry level recreational scuba training, but may be included in entry level professional diver training. Some diver training agencies offer drift diving training as a specialty part of their Advanced Open Water Diver training.

==Procedures==
Drift dives can be done from the shore, but this requires some form of transport to pick up the divers where they come ashore, which is usually not accurately predictable, so it is more commonly done from a boat, which will follow the group and pick up divers as they surface. It may be possible to follow the divers by watching the bubbles, but a more reliable method is for the dive leader to tow a surface marker buoy, and for all the divers of the group to follow the leader. If a diver or buddy pair finds it necessary to surface before the leader they will ascend up the float line if possible, as this will surface them where the boat crew expects and is watching. Divers that are separated from the group are generally advised to deploy a decompression buoy and ascend on their own line, as the buoy will alert the surface crew to a separate group, and will also help other boat traffic to notice and avoid running the divers down as they reach the surface. Divers ascending on the float line should avoid exerting force on the line, as that will inconvenience the dive leader.
Using a line from a drifting boat has been done, but it constrains the boat from maneuvering freely to pick up separated divers, the boat may tend to drift differently from divers at the bottom, and it may be necessary for all the divers to be towed by the drifting boat to stay together. This is more practical with canoe or kayak diving, where the vessel is light and windage is low.
===Planning===

Drift diving requires more rigorous planning than a dive in still water to be executed safely. Drift diving is generally not planned to coincide with slack water, but this can vary depending on the strength of the stream. It is important to consider the direction of tidal streams as well as their strength to avoid divers being swept into dangerous areas such as shipping lanes or areas known to have entanglement hazards. It is also important to plan for the possibility of separation, either underwater or at the surface.

===Precautions===
A common precaution for drift diving is to have a supporting boat follow the divers and for the dive leader to use a surface marker buoy. It is also generally necessary for all divers intending to drift dive as a group to enter the water at the same time, so there is less chance of being separated by the flow. It is quite common for current speeds to vary with depth, so a low drag buoy and line will reduce the workload on the diver carrying the reel. Mitigation equipment for separation may include signaling devices and a compass, and a personal DSMB and reel or spool. Since the intention is to drift with the current in a group, there is normally no need for a negative buoyancy entry, but to stay together it is helpful if the dive leader descends first and the other divers follow down, either visually or following the surface marker line.

==Equipment==

Most of the equipment is identical to that for a recreational dive in similar environment in the absence of a current. The exceptions are the use of a surface marker buoy by the dive leader, and delayed surface marker buoys carried by divers for deployment if they become separated from the dive leader.

==Legislation==
There may be local rules pertaining to the use of surface marker buoys. In some parts of the world, surface marker buoys alone are not legally sufficient signaling devices, and one of the international diver down flags (in an appropriate size), might be required while drift diving.

<doc id="291255" wikidata="Q7345069" url="?curid=291255" title="Robert H. Knight">
<text>Robert H. Knight (born April 23, 1951) is an American conservative writer and activist. He was a draftsman of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. DOMA was invalidated by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013). He is senior fellow of the American Civil Rights Union and a regular columnist for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. He was senior writer for Coral Ridge Ministries (now D. James Kennedy Ministries) and director of the Culture and Media Institute, a project founded in 2006 by the Media Research Center in Alexandria, Virginia. Knight has also served as director of the Culture &amp; Family Institute, an affiliate of Concerned Women for America.

==Career==
Knight worked as an editor and writer for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and was a 1989–1990 media fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He was a senior fellow for cultural policy studies at The Heritage Foundation before becoming director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council.

===Views===
Knight is a social conservative. He is an outspoken opponent on same-sex marriage and civil partnerships and has written prolifically on that topic. He believes that recognizing same-sex couples &quot;will destroy marriage&quot; and &quot;would threaten families, children, and ultimately civilization.&quot; In 1995, Knight accused the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay Republicans, of being a &quot;small group trying to harness government power to force affirmation of unhealthy, immoral and destructive behavior.&quot; Knight has stated: &quot;The end goal of gay activism is the criminalization of Christianity&quot; and has accused gays of advocating pedophilia and attempting to recruit youth. He has referred to abortion, pornography, and gay rights as part of an &quot;iron triangle.&quot; In the aftermath of the 1998 torture and murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay student, Knight denounced the murder but opposed proposals to extend hate crime laws, believing them to be &quot;the precursor toward thought crimes.&quot;

In a 1995 interview, Knight asserted that, &quot;Lesbianism is the animating principle of feminism. Because feminism, at the core, is at war with motherhood, femininity, family, and God. And lesbians are at war with all these things.&quot;

Knight is on the advisory board of the Abstinence Clearinghouse, which promotes abstinence-only sex education.

His 2018 manifesto, &quot;A Nation Worth Fighting For: 10 Steps to Restore Freedom&quot;, calls upon Evangelical Christians to &quot;go on offense against the darkness, not cower in our church buildings, hoping it will go away.&quot;

==Personal==
He has a B.S. in 1973 and M.S. in 1975 in political science from American University in Washington, D.C. In 1981, he married his wife Barbara, with whom he now lives in the Washington, D.C. area.

<doc id="291256" wikidata="Q2268313" url="?curid=291256" title="Wreck diving">
<text>Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. The term is used mainly by recreational and technical divers. Professional divers, when diving on a shipwreck, generally refer to the specific task, such as salvage work, accident investigation or archaeological survey. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom.

Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.

==Environment==

The environment of wreck diving is sunken shipwrecks and other vehicles and structures, either sunk by misfortune, acts of war, or intentionally, as targets in military exercises, to serve as artificial reefs, or as recreational dive sites for the diving tourism industry. Wrecks sunk as tourist dive sites are usually cleaned up and have many hazards removed before scuttling. A redundant gas source is important to carry for emergencies when diving an overhead environment.

== Reasons for diving wrecks ==
A shipwreck may be attractive to divers for several reasons:
* it serves as an artificial reef, which creates a habitat for many types of marine life
* it often is a large structure with many interesting parts and machinery, which is not normally accessible to casual observers on working, floating vessels
* it often has an interesting history
* it presents new skill challenges for scuba divers to manage the risks associated with wreck penetration.
* it is part of the underwater cultural heritage and may be an important archaeological resource
* it provides a first-hand insight into context for the loss, such as causal connections, geographical associations, trade patterns and many other areas, providing a microcosm of our maritime heritage and maritime history
* it may contain artifacts of historical, artistic and/or monetary value, which can be recovered for profit (treasure hunting) or collection purposes (ranging from rare collector&#x27;s items to souvenirs, memorabilia or other &quot;trophies&quot;, such as crew members&#x27; or passengers&#x27; personal belongings, nautical instruments, brass portholes or silverware, cutlery, intact china or other tableware).

== Types of wreck diving ==

In &quot;The Advanced Wreck Diving Handbook&quot;, Gary Gentile sub-divides wreck diving into three categories:
* Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming outside the wreck)
* Limited penetration diving, within the &quot;light zone&quot;, the parts of the interior of the wreck from which light entering the wreck from an exit can be seen. There may be parts of the interior illuminated by exterior light penetrating though holes too small to exit through, and these are not generally considered part of the light zone, as they cannot be used as an escape route. Limited penetration limits penetration to where the diver can see the way out. 
* Full penetration diving, beyond the &quot;light zone&quot;

Each subsequent level involves additional hazards and greater risk, and therefore will normally require additional learning and experience to develop the required competence, and may also require additional equipment and the competence to use it effectively.

Non-penetration wreck diving is the least hazardous form of wreck diving, although divers still need to be aware of the entanglement risks presented by fishing nets and fishing lines which may be snagged to the wreck (wrecks are often popular fishing sites), and the underlying terrain may present greater risk of sharp edges.

Penetration within the light zone presents greater hazards due to overhead and greater proximity of the wreck&#x27;s structure, but because of the proximity of a visible exit point, and some amount of external light, those hazards are more manageable. However, there is clearly a much greater risk of entanglement and silt out inside of the structure, as well as the requirement to move laterally to a defined exit point before one can surface in the event of an emergency.

Full penetration involves the greatest level of risks, including the risk of getting lost within the structure, the risk of complete darkness in the event of multiple light failures, and the inability to escape unassisted in the event of a complete disruption to breathing gas supply.

These categorisations broadly coincide with the traditional division between &quot;recreational&quot; wreck diving (taught as a specialty course by recreational diver training agencies and normally limited to the &quot;light zone&quot; and/or 100-130 cumulative feet of depth plus penetration) and &quot;technical&quot; wreck diving (taught as a stand-alone course by technical diver training agencies).

== Procedures and safety ==
Wrecks may present a variety of site-specific hazards to divers. Wrecks are often fouled by fishing lines or nets and the structure may be fragile and break without notice. Penetration diving, where the diver enters a shipwreck, is an activity exposing the diver to hazards of getting lost, entrapment and consequently running out of breathing gas. Management of these risks requires special skills and equipment. Many attractive or well preserved wrecks are in deeper water requiring deep diving precautions. Training agencies recommend that at least one cutting device be carried in case the diver is entangled with fishing lines, nets or ropes and to have a spare light source in case the primary light fails. If penetrating a wreck, a guideline tied off before entering a wreck and run out inside the wreck is required by training agencies. A guideline can help a diver to find the way out more easily in case of low visibility, and has often been necessary for survival. For penetration diving, a reserve of breathing gas sufficient to allow the diver to exit the wreck and make a safe ascent in the event of any reasonably foreseeable single failure of equipment is required by training agencies&#x27; protocols and scientific codes of practice. Many wreck divers use a minimum of the rule-of-thirds for gas management. This allows for 1/3 of the gas down and into the wreck, 1/3 for exit and ascent and 1/3 reserve. In dives where decompression stops are required, this may not be sufficient. In addition, because of the potential fragility of the wreck, the likelihood of disturbing sediments or disturbing the many marine animals that take advantage of the artificial habitat offered by the wreck, extra care is required when moving and finning. Many divers are taught to use alternative finning methods such as frog kick or modified flutter kick which direct the thrust of the fins away from the bottom where most of the silt is likely to deposit. Good buoyancy control is necessary for safe and non-destructive diving in the environment of a wreck.
===Connecting to the wreck===
There are several methods for getting the divers to the wreck. The preferred method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility, hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a grapnel or anchor. A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage is less likely to damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important to get back to the shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up-current, a technique sometimes known as &quot;parachuting in&quot; or &quot;free drop&quot;. The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary. Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal decompression buoy depending on the conditions.

When using the anchor line to control ascents and descents, a &quot;tag line&quot; may be used between the anchor line and the stern of the vessel, to allow secure transfer between these points in a current. When there are alternative methods for descent, including free drop and descent on the shotline.

===Penetration navigation===
In technical penetration diving, there are broadly two approaches.

====Use of guidelines====

The conventional approach involves the use of continuous guidelines laid from a wreck reel, tied just outside the entrance point, just inside the entrance point, and at intervals inside (to mitigate the risk of a cut line, or a &quot;line trap&quot;). In deeper penetrations, two reels are used, so that in the event of a total loss of visibility where the diver loses contact with the primary line or the primary line gets cut, the secondary line can be anchored and then used as a reference point to sweep for the primary line. Procedures and techniques for navigation inside the wreck using a guide line are very much the same as in cave penetration.

====Progressive penetration====
An alternative approach, popularised to a limited extent by deep wreck divers in the American Northeast, is referred to as &quot;progressive penetration&quot;. Progressive penetration eschews the use of guidelines, but the diver makes several successive penetrations, each deeper than the last, memorising the layout for both the inward and outward journeys. The method is vulnerable to complete loss of visibility in a silt-out, and any disorientation in an unfamiliar area or due to nitrogen narcosis. It relies on accurate recall where an error can be fatal, and where a more reliable option is easily and affordably available. As a navigational technique, progressive penetration is generally considered unsafe. As a surveying technique it tends to be inaccurate unless measurements are also recorded. It is not taught by any of the mainstream recreational diver training agencies. 

Divers engaging in penetration diving are conventionally taught to carry three lights - a primary light and two backup lights - thereby virtually eliminating the risk of completely losing light inside the wreck. Nonetheless, total loss of visibility due to a silt-out remains a risk.

===Deep wreck diving===
Wrecks in shallower waters tend to deteriorate faster than wrecks in deeper water due to higher biological activity. Accordingly, many of the older and larger shipwrecks that tend to offer full penetration dives tend to be deeper dives. This can present additional complications; if a wreck dive is intended to be a decompression dive, then the diver will normally carry decompression gases in side-mounted cylinders. However, it is difficult to penetrate many wrecks with both back-mounted and side-mounted cylinders, requiring divers to either use a different configuration, or leave their decompression gases outside the wreck prior to penetration. This creates the possibility of a diver being unable to relocate their decompression gases if they exit the wreck at a different point from which they enter it. Furthermore, regulations have been implemented in prevention of fatal dives that restricts deep-sea wreck diving only towards experienced diving, such as the &quot;Britannic&quot; for instance.

===Training===

Because of the increasing popularity and higher risk of wreck diving, many diver training organizations such as Scuba Diving International and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors provide specialist wreck diver training courses, which divers are advised to take before wreck diving. Such courses typically teach skills such as air management and the proper use of guidelines and reels. Most recreational diving organizations teach divers only to penetrate to, at most, the limit of the &quot;light zone&quot; or a maximum aggregate surface distance (depth and penetration) of 100 feet. Other technical diving organizations, such as IANTD, TDI and ANDI teach advanced wreck courses that require more extensive training and competence and more safety equipment, and prepare divers for levels of wreck penetration beyond the areas illuminated by ambient light. The Nautical Archaeology Society in the UK teaches awareness of underwater cultural heritage issues as well as practical diver and archaeological skills. In this context, some research projects are investigating the potentialities offered by digital technologies to adopt virtual replicas of the underwater wrecksite for training purposes. Other organizations, such as the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia (ARSBC) deliberately create artificial reefs to provide features for divers to explore, as well as substrates for marine life to thrive upon.

== Special equipment ==
As long as there is no penetration of the wreck, no special wreck diving equipment is required, and equipment is based on the situation outside the wreck. For example, if the wreck is at a depth that is classified as technical deep diving, then the basic equipment requirement will be based on that.

In the limited penetration diving zone, at least one diving reel and one primary light are recommended in addition to the basic equipment for the outside environment. Additional breathing gas for the rule of thirds in an overhead environment increases the required cylinder size. Sufficient emergency gas must be available to reach the surface for any reasonably foreseeable emergency. This may be in the form of buddy or team supplied reserve gas or as a bailout cylinder carried by the diver

For full penetration diving, additional safety equipment is necessary. This is similar to equipment used in cave diving, but more cut-resistant line may be used. Most of this equipment is to reduce the risk of getting lost or trapped inside the wreckage. The most important components are lights and guide lines. Lights include a primary light, a secondary light and a positioning light. Line may be carried on, and deployed from, a primary reel, a safety reel, and a jump/gap reel. A redundant emergency gas supply is necessary. Depending on the dive plan, double cylinders are standard, even when stage cylinders are also carried. A cave diving helmet is useful protection for the head, and gloves protect against sharp metal edges. Equipment should be stowed compactly, to reduce the risk of snagging on wreckage and being damaged or trapping the diver. Rubber bands and metal or plastic clips are used to secure loose or dangling equipment.

==Impact of recreational scuba diving on wrecks==
The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:
*The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
*Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, 
*Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage,
*Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.

== Protection of wrecks ==
In many countries, wrecks are legally protected from unauthorized salvage or desecration.

In the United Kingdom, three Acts protect wrecks:
* Protection of Wrecks Act 1973: certain designated, charted, historic or dangerous sites may not be dived without a license
* Protection of Military Remains Act 1986: all military aircraft and 16 designated ships are considered war graves that can only be dived with a license. Other non-designated ships may be dived providing the divers do not enter, disturb or remove artifacts
* Merchant Shipping Act 1995: all wrecks and cargoes are owned: each artifact removed must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck
Wrecks that are protected are denoted as such on nautical charts (such as admiralty charts); any diving restrictions should be adhered to. Historic wrecks (often but not always defined as being more than 50 years of age) are often protected from pillaging and looting through national laws protecting cultural heritage. Internationally they may be protected by a State ratifying the Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. In this case pillaging is not allowed. One such example is the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; which is undergoing archaeological recovery by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (NC DNCR) near Beaufort Inlet, NC.

In 2003 the Greek Ministry of Culture, issued a Ministerial Order classifying &quot;any wreck of ship or aeroplane, sunk for longer than 50 years from the present&quot; as Cultural Assets / Monuments, with a protection zone of 300 meters around them. Terms and conditions for visiting any monument in Greece are set by the Ministry of Culture.

In South African waters, the wrecks of ships or aircraft, and any associated cargo, debris or artifact more than 60 years old and are protected by the National Heritage Resources Act number 25 of 1999 (NHRA). The law of salvage and finds does not apply to historical shipwrecks, which are considered by the NHRA to be archaeological material, and as such are the property of the state, administered by SAHRA in trust for the nation, and may not be disturbed in any way except under the terms of a permit issued by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA). There are severe penalties for contravening the Act, including heavy fines and jail terms. All members of the South African Police Services, and Customs and Excise officers may act as Heritage Inspectors in terms of the Act, with powers of search, confiscation and arrest. Historical wrecks may be visited provided that the sites are not disturbed or interfered with and no artifacts are removed or damaged.

==Wreck diving sites==

There are thousands of popular wreck diving sites throughout the world. Some of these are artificial wrecks or sunk deliberately to attract divers (such as and in Florida, in Grenada, and the wrecks of Recife in Pernambuco/Brazil which include artificial and disaster wrecks). Diver trails, also called wreck trails, can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving. One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network&#x27;s (FPAN) &quot;Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.&quot;

Along the Outer Banks, navigational challenges posed by the Diamond Shoals area off Cape Hatteras, caused the loss of thousands of ships and an unknown number of human lives. More than 5000 ships have sunk in these waters since record keeping began in 1526. Among the better known shipwrecks was , a participant in the Battle of Hampton Roads during the American Civil War. &quot;Monitor&quot; foundered on 31 December 1862 off Cape Hatteras. During World War II German U-boats would lie offshore and silhouette passing freighters and tankers against the lights onshore. Dozens of ships along the North Carolina coast were torpedoed in this fashion by German submarines in what became known as Torpedo Alley. Popular wrecks include the , USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, (), , , , and .

Others are wrecks of vessels lost in disasters (such as in the British Virgin Islands, in Cyprus and the many shipwrecks off the Isles of Scilly in England). In the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, the wreck of , a cruise liner which was lost in 1986, is a popular dive site. Lying at underwater, this wreck is an excellent base for recreational and technical divers.

More unusual are wrecks of structures, such as the wreck of the old cruise ship pier in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. As part of the recovery and replacement of the Frederiksted Pier, the old pier was to be removed and sunk far out at sea in deep waters. Much of the old pier was used to create an artificial reef. Several barges carried the wreckage down the beach, and dumped the wreckage of steel girders, vehicles, concrete tubes, pylons, and pavement into deep waters to create a dive site now known as Armageddon.

A number of wreck diving sites are ships lost to wartime hostilities, such as in the Red Sea, the wrecks of Subic Bay and Coron in the Philippines, in Vanuatu and the &quot;ghost fleet&quot; of Truk Lagoon. In the Andaman Islands, the Inket Wreck, where a Japanese ship sank during World War II is a dive site near Duncan Island.

Some regions are particularly noted for the number and quality of wreck dive sites, such as Truk Lagoon in Micronesia, Scapa Flow in Orkney Islands, Scotland, the Outer Banks of North Carolina, known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;, and the Great Lakes.

For technical divers there are a few wrecks that have attracted widespread popularity. For years SS &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was regarded as the pinnacle of challenges to the wreck diver, but, since the popularisation of trimix as a breathing gas, technical divers now dive deeper and more challenging wrecks, and &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; is now considered by some to be a good training wreck for trimix divers.

<text>Flytoget (&#x27;) is a [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] [[airport rail link|airport railway service]] connecting [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo Airport]] to [[Oslo Central Station]]. Run byFlytoget AS (formerly NSB Gardermobanen AS), it operates on the high-speed Gardermoen Line using sixteen GMB Class 71 electric trains. Normal service frequency is once every ten minutes, with five of the services each hour continuing westwards beyond Oslo Central. The journey takes nineteen minutes, with extended services serving nine stops within Greater Oslo and taking up to 60 minutes.

Flytoget transported 5.4 million passengers in 2007, a 34-percent market share of airport ground transport. The service, which has a top speed of , is the only high-speed rail service in Norway. Construction started in 1994 and high-speed trains began serving Gardermoen Airport from the date of its opening on 8 October 1998, although full operation using the Romerike Tunnel had to wait another ten and a half months after severe leaks caused by the tunnel&#x27;s construction led to the partial depletion of two lakes.

Formed in 1992 as a subsidiary of Norwegian State Railways, the company has been owned since 2001 by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry.

==History==

===Decision for a new airport connection===
When the Parliament of Norway on 8 October 1992 decided to build a new central airport for Eastern Norway, they also decided that the main mode of ground transport should be by rail. While the previous airport, Oslo Airport, Fornebu, was located just outside the city limits, the new airport, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, would be located north of the city, outside the reach of existing public transport. The principle of the airport construction was that it was not to be footed by the tax payers; the entire airport would be built with borrowed money through Oslo Lufthavn AS, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Airport Administration. The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link—the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) creating the limited company subsidiary NSB Gardermobanen AS, founded on 24 November 1992, to perform the construction of the line. It would be able to charge train operators using the line, channeling the payments to cover down payments and interest of the debt used to build the railway. Profit margin was estimated to 7.5%.

===Construction===

Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, is not on the Trunk Line that runs north from Oslo. With heavy traffic and many small stops until Lillestrøm, and continuing north as single track, the Trunk Line would have to be supplemented by a parallel double track from Oslo, with a new route north of Kløfta to Eidsvoll, the north of the airport allowing trains operating on the Dovre Line to Lillehammer and Trondheim to access the airport. The line was named the Gardermo Line.

The Gardermo Line was the second attempt to build high-speed rail in Norway, after the line from Ski to Moss on the Østfold Line. But no operation speeds exceeding are achieved there due to short distances and limitations to rolling stock, making Gardermobanen the first real high-speed railway line in Norway. Due to the domination of single track in Norway, the opening of the Gardermo Line increased the total length of double track in the kingdom by two-thirds.

Construction started in 1994. An agreement for purchase of sixteen three-car electric multiple units was signed with Adtranz on 23 February 1995. Parliament decided on 1 October 1996 that the construction company would also operate the new train service. The trains were delivered between 19 September 1997 and 30 January 1998, costing NOK 1.4 billion.

===Challenges===
The greatest challenge was the need to build the Romerike railway tunnel – Norway&#x27;s longest – beneath the geologically highly unstable Østmarka area between Etterstad, close to Oslo Central Station, and Lillestrøm. During construction, in 1997, the water level in some lakes above the tunnel, including Lutvann and Nordre Puttjern, sank dramatically. After the leaks were discovered on 3 February 1997, sanctions were imposed by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate requiring the elimination of all leakages. At its worst, the tunnel was leaking of water per minute.

Rhoca-Gil sealant was used in an attempt to fix the leaks, but failed to work properly. Not only did it not polymerise, and therefore failed to staunch the leaks, but it also poisoned its surroundings with acrylamide. Manual fixing with concrete became necessary; the fixing and cleaning up of the toxin delayed the building of the tunnel by one year. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company, Scandinavian Rock Group, with the latter at one instance stopping work for three weeks while the parties quarrelled in court.

Reports have shown a lack of inspection and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed – but were never taken seriously – in 1995. Construction of the tunnel caused damage to around sixty houses and an evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK 500 million was spent on fixing the leaks and claimed that this was to a large extent an unnecessary expenditure which more efficient engineering procedures would have avoided. The report also criticised the administrative planning and organisation of the overall construction of the railway.

Airport Express Trains began operating as soon as the new airport (and the Lillestrøm to Gardermoen stretch of the new high-speed line) opened on 8 October 1998; however, for more than ten months they had to use the old Hovedbane (Trunk Line) between Oslo S and Lillestrøm, which restricted their frequency to just two trains per hour. Regular operations at full capacity, using the Romerike Tunnel, did not commence until 22 August 1999.

===Reorganisation===

Estimates for the project costs were NOK 4.3 billion, ±20%, but by completion they had ended at NOK 7.7 billion, of which NOK 1.3 billion were related to the leakages. The rest of the line had a cost exceedings of NOK 0.4 billion. The company had acquired financial costs of NOK 0.9 billion, so the company owed NOK 10.0 billion by 1999, including money spent on the new trains.

The first steps of organisational restructure were taken 29 June 2000, when the CEO of NSB, Osmund Ueland, was fired due to several incidents related to the operations of NSB—not just the Gardermo Line. Einar Enger took over as new CEO on 26 February 2001.

The debt in NSB Gardermobanen had become unmanageable, and in April 2000 parliament accepted that it would not be possible to make the Gardermo Line—with the current structure—the profitable venture predicted in 1992. From 1 January 2001, the company changed name to Flytoget AS, retaining ownership of the trains and operations and kept as a subsidiary of NSB. The tracks and infrastructure were transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration (), who owns the rest of the Norwegian railway network. All debt was restored and covered by the state, and a vehicle excise duty was implemented on the Gardermo Line to cover the management and maintenance of the line, to be paid by all users.

On 9 December 2002, parliament decided that Flytoget AS would become a separate railway company from 1 January 2003, owned directly by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. One year later the ownership was transferred to the Ministry of Trade and Industry as part of a cleanup of political overhaul between the departments. As part of the process, a new CEO, Thomas Havnegjerde, was appointed in June 2002, and in January 2003 the new chair, Endre Skjørestad—who took over the position form NSB&#x27;s director Einar Enger. Havnegjerde announced on 6 August 2008 that he would retire from his job before the end of the year. He was replaced by Linda Bernander Silseth on 10 November 2008. On 30 August 2009, two of three services to Asker were extended to Drammen. This followed upgrades to the Drammen Line, including the Lieråsen Tunnel, and a new parking lot at Drammen Station, in total costing NOK 20 million.

==Operations==

Departures operate every ten minutes from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) to the airport - i.e. six trains per hour. Half of the trains originate in Drammen, making five intermediate stops before Oslo S, and again at Lillestrøm. One starts from Oslo S and goes directly to Gardermoen without intermediate stops. Two start from Stabekk with stops at Lysaker, Skøyen, Nationaltheateret and Oslo S. On Saturdays, Sunday mornings and during most of July, Flytoget does not operate the direct trains from Oslo S or Stabekk — only the 20-minute headway all-stop trains. While the services northeast from Oslo S to the airport use the high-speed Gardermo Line, those westwards towards Asker use the Drammen Line built in 1870–72 and the Asker Line; so while the from Oslo S to the airport can be done in 19 minutes, the from Asker to Oslo S takes 26 minutes. The latter does however include stops at five stations: Nationaltheatret, Skøyen, Lysaker, Sandvika and Asker.

Competition is offered from other means of ground transport and by Vy who operate trains from and to the airport. This includes one hourly departure with line R12 of the Oslo Commuter Rail north to Eidsvoll and south to Oslo, Drammen and Kongsberg; two regional trains (line RE10 and RE11) hourly north to Eidsvoll and Lillehammer and south to Drammen and Vestfold; and five daily express trains to Dombås and Trondheim calling Oslo Airport Station, including one night train (although the express trains to Trondheim do not accept passengers only travelling between Oslo and Gardermoen).

The price of a ticket to Oslo is NOK 230, though higher if departing from Sandvika, Asker and Drammen. Reduced fares with 50% discount are offered to senior citizens, children, youth under 21 years, students, benefit recipients and military personnel. Flytoget tickets are not valid on Vy trains, and vice versa. Vy tickets are generally cheaper, though not for some groups with reduced fare; for instance students are granted a greater discount with Flytoget than with Vy. Ticket can either be bought at vending machines or as e-tickets; there is no seat reservation.

Flytoget transported 5.4 million passengers in 2007, a 34% market share of airport ground transport. Flytoget boasts a high service quality, with 96% of departures arriving within 3 minutes of schedule and only 0.4% of departures canceled. Part of this is due to the airport express trains receiving priority over other trains in the limited capacity around Oslo. Flytoget was announced to have the most satisfied, and the fourth most loyal customers of all Norwegian companies in 2008, by the customer satisfaction survey conducted by the Norwegian School of Management. The same year Flytoget was declared the best place of work in Norway by &quot;Great Place to Work&quot;. During the 2007 recruitment half of the newly educated train drivers chose Flytoget over Vy, mostly due to higher wages.

===Incidents===

Several deaths have taken place on the route, but only one due to an accident. In 1999, an employee of the National Rail Administration was killed by a train because it was operating at instead of the temporarily reduced limit of ; Flytoget was fined for not informing the engineer of the speed limit reduction. Several other deaths on the line have been classified as suicides, and so are not in the accident statistics; they do however cause delays on all services for hours after the incident takes place.

In 2000–01, Flytoget experienced three derailments with empty trains at Gardermoen; one caused by the engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a red light. No more such accidents occurred after automatic Train Control was installed in 2001.

Delays have been experienced many times by travelers due to technical problems on the infrastructure. In particular the old line west of Oslo causes much delay, and the National Rail Administration performed during 2008 a NOK 100 million upgrade to the Oslo Tunnel to ensure better performance. But problems also incur on the new sections, regularly delaying service or capacity, and forcing Flytoget to operate fewer departures. In total 96% of departures arrived within 3 minutes of schedule and 0.4% of departures were canceled in 2007.

Pickpocketing has been a problem since the start; even the Chief of Police in Oslo has been robbed on the train. The train has also been the target of sabotage, and embezzlement for NOK 1 million by an employed ticket salesman, who found a way to print two tickets with the system only charging for one, by turning off and on the ticket printer.

When Al Gore came to Oslo to receive his Nobel Peace Prize on 7 December 2007, he used the Airport Express Train to make his journey as environmentally friendly as possible. The company has initiated a program to ensure better diet for the employees; this had made several lose weight and has reduced the level of sick leave from 12 to 8%. In 2005–07, a program to reduce the energy use of the trains through smarter operation reduced energy consumption by 15%.

During the 2010 volcano air travel disruption, the Gardermoen airport was closed for a period, and the Flytoget trains were used by NSB instead, to give extra train capacity for long-distance routes.

==Rolling stock==
===Class 71===

The company operates sixteen Class 71 three-car electric multiple units delivered in 1997–98, and built domestically by Adtranz at Strømmen based on carbodies built in Adtranz factory in Kalmar. They are based on the Swedish X2 operated by SJ in their X 2000 intercity service, and developed by Kalmar Verkstad during the 1980s. The Class 71 are nearly identical to the NSB Class 73, save the 71-series lacking one car and tilting mechanism, and a different interior. Both have chosen to not use the original locomotive design, instead installing one powered bogie in each car. The 71-series is built for a maximum operating speed of , but has achieved higher speeds in test runs.

Among the features are pressure-tight cabins to allow comfortable travel through tunnels at high speeds, and step-free access to the cars. Instead, steps are inside the trains; this has been criticized to be in non-conformance with public accessibility policy. The multiple units can only operate in fixed sets of three cars, but up to three sets can be run in multiple. Flytoget regularly uses double sets to create six-car trains. In 2008–09, all units will be refit with an additional middle car by Bombardier Transportation, increasing capacity by 40% to 244 seats.

Unlike the Class 71, the sister trains in service with NSB were prone to trouble, having to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services; the Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure. The only incident to ground all the BM71 trains occurred on the 17 June 2000 at Nelaug when a Class 73 train operated by NSB derailed because of stress on the axle. Unlike the NSB trains, the airport express trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month. On 24 January 2004 a unit had to be taken out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing—within days the bearings were replaced on all units.

===Class 78===

Flytoget purchased eight new 4-car CAF Oaris EMUs from the Spanish manufacturer CAF. They started operation in June 2021. Even though the EMU&#x27;s maximum speed is , the infrastructure limits the speed to .
The trainsets delivered to Flytoget were withdrawn from service after 19 days of operation due to discovery of cracks in the chassis. In January 2023, the trainsets resumed operation.

===New tracks===
There are plans to build two more tracks from Lysaker to Oslo Central Station, including a new tunnel under central Oslo. This project is not decided.

<text>Underwater photography is the process of taking photographs while under water. It is usually done while scuba diving, but can be done while diving on surface supply, snorkeling, swimming, from a submersible or remotely operated underwater vehicle, or from automated cameras lowered from the surface.

Underwater photography can also be categorised as an art form and a method for recording data. 
Successful underwater imaging is usually done with specialized equipment and techniques. However, it offers exciting and rare photographic opportunities. Animals such as fish and marine mammals are common subjects, but photographers also pursue shipwrecks, submerged cave systems, underwater &quot;landscapes&quot;, invertebrates, seaweeds, geological features, and portraits of fellow divers.

==Equipment==
Some cameras are made for use underwater, including modern waterproof digital cameras. The first amphibious camera was the Calypso, reintroduced as the Nikonos in 1963. The Nikonos range was designed specifically for use underwater. Nikon ended the Nikonos series in 2001 and its use has declined, as has that of other 35mm film systems. &quot;Sea and Sea USA&quot; made the Motor Marine III, an amphibious range-finder camera for 35mm film.

===Underwater housings===


Cameras made for dry work can also work underwater, protected by add-on housings, which are made for point and shoot cameras, compact cameras with full exposure controls, and single lens reflex cameras (SLRs). Most such housings are specific to the camera model. Materials range from relatively inexpensive injection moulded plastic to higher-priced die-cast or machined from solid aluminum. Housings allow many options: users can choose housings specific to their everyday &quot;land&quot; cameras and use any lens, provided that it fits or they use the appropriate lens port accessory. Underwater photographers generally use wide-angle lenses or macro lenses, both of which allow close focus and therefore a shorter distance to the subject, which reduces the loss of clarity to scattering.

Digital media can hold many more shots than standard film (which rarely has more than 36 frames per roll). This gives digital cameras an advantage, since it is impractical to change film underwater. Other comparisons between digital and film photography also apply, and the use of film under water has declined, as it has on land. It is also not possible to change regular lenses underwater, though some wet connectable telephoto, fisheye and macro extensions are available for some housings.

Underwater housings have control knobs and buttons that reach the camera inside, allowing use of most of its normal functions. These housings may also have connectors to attach external flash units. Some basic housings allow the use of the flash on the camera, but the on-board flash may not be powerful enough or properly placed for underwater use. More-advanced housings either redirect the on-board strobe to fire a slave strobe via a fiber-optic cable, or physically prevent the use of the on-board strobe. Housings are made waterproof by silicone or other elastomer O-rings at the closures and where control spindles and pushbuttons pass through the housing. High-end housings may use double O-rings on many of the critical pushbuttons and spindles to reduce the risk of leaks, which can destroy the electronics in cameras. Some cameras are inherently waterproof, or submersible to shallow depths; when these are in submersible housings, the consequences of a small leak are generally not serious.

There are optical problems with using cameras inside a watertight housing. Because of refraction, the image coming through the glass port will be distorted, especially with wide-angle lenses. A dome-shaped or fish-eye port corrects this distortion. Most manufacturers make these dome ports for their housings, often designing them to be used with specific lenses to maximize their effectiveness.

The Nikonos series allowed the use of water-contact optics—lenses designed to be used submerged, without the ability to focus correctly when used in air. There is also a problem with some digital cameras, which do not have sufficiently wide lenses built in; to solve this, there are housings made with supplementary optics in addition to the dome port, making the apparent angle of view wider. Some housings work with wet-coupled lenses, which are screwed on to the outside of the lens port and increase the field of view; these lenses may be added or removed under water, allowing both macro and wide-angle photography on the same dive.

With macro lenses, the distortion caused by refraction is not a problem, so normally a simple flat glass port is used. Refraction through a flat port increases the magnification of a macro lens; this is considered a benefit to photographers who are trying to capture very small subjects. Digital cameras may have several user selectable or programmable modes, which may include modes specifically for underwater use.Buoyancy of the housing may have to be adjusted by adding ballast or buoyancy chambers. Ideally these should be incompressible at working depth range so the buoyancy remains constant throughout the dive, and can be set with considerable precision. Most divers can manage a small divergence from neutral buoyancy, but a large divergence can make it difficult to hold the camera in place with one hand, which can often be useful, particularly with point and shoot cameras. When photographing on breath-hold, it is convenient if the camera will float back to the surface if dropped. On scuba it may be more convenient if it does not float away.

====Smartphone housings====
Underwater housings for smartphones are available with a variety of depth ratings and features. These can be less expensive than dedicated underwater photography cameras. The simplest form is a waterproof pouch, best used for shallow-water photography.

Some smartphone housings are limited by operating system. Others are compatible with almost any phone that will physically fit into the housing, but require Bluetooth and an app enabling the phone to communicate with the housing. Wireless communication allows the housing to be made with only one opening hull penetration and no moving parts penetrating the camera compartment. Some housings are pumped down to a near vacuum after sealing, which secures the cover and allows the seal to be tested before entering the water. Some (like the Diveroid Universal Lite) use physical capacitive buttons that interact with the touch screen.
===Camera formats===

Most types of digital camera have some underwater application. Those commonly seen in use are the models for which stock underwater housings are available, or which are inherently waterproof, such as rugged compact cameras, which may be used at shallow depths without a housing, but have housings available for greater depths. 
* Compacts, rugged compacts and bridge cameras have great versatility regarding focal length, they tend to have a wide angle to telephoto lens with macro capabilities making these functions available without need to change lenses, which cannot be done during a dive. Although wet change accessories are available to increase or decrease focal length and for greater magnification, the 2020 generation rugged compacts already have inherent very close focus ability, and fairly wide angle low end of the focal length. Some of the rugged compact cameras will fit into a large dry suit or BC pocket in their underwater housing, though not usually with an external strobe or video light, allowing a diver to conveniently carry the camera on a working dive in case it may be useful, or for a larger format photographer to carry it as a backup, or for opportunities where the main camera has an unsuitable lens fitted. 
*Action cameras are popular with divers who want a record of the dive, but not the task loading of operating the camera controls. The camera can be hand held for versatility, or can be head mounted for first person view, or mounted on other equipment, like a diver propulsion vehicle. 
*Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras and Digital single-lens reflex cameras have very similar ranges of applications, mostly for high end work, where the photographer wants the best possible image quality, and has the skills and desire to put in the necessary effort and accepts the limitations of being stuck with the same lens throughout the dive, and managing bulky equipment. These formats are almost always used with large external lighting systems which are needed in most circumstances to get the best results. A relatively large capital investment in equipment is associated with the format. 
==Lighting==
Lighting for underwater photography has several aspects. There may be insufficient natural light to take a photo, in many cases the natural light has lost a significant part of the spectrum, or the photographer wishes to emphasize contrast between foreground and background. Where flash is used for the actual photograph, auxiliary light may be necessary or desirable to facilitate composition and focusing in low light conditions. Many digital cameras have video options, which require a steady light source, and in some cases a single video light can provide all these functions, and also serve as an adequate dive light for non-photographic applications.

The primary obstacle faced by underwater photographers is the loss of color and contrast when submerged to any significant depth. One issue faced is light attenuation. The longer wavelengths of sunlight (such as red or orange) are absorbed quickly by the surrounding water, so even to the naked eye everything appears blue-green. The loss of color increases not only vertically through the water column, but also horizontally, so subjects farther away from the camera also appear colorless and indistinct. This effect occurs in apparently clear water, such as that found around tropical coral reefs.

Underwater photographers solve this problem by combining two techniques. The first is to get the camera as close to the photographic subject as possible, minimizing the horizontal loss of color. Many serious underwater photographers consider any more than about one yard or meter unacceptable. The second technique is the use of a flash or video lights to restore colour lost to depth. Fill flash, used effectively, &quot;paints&quot; in missing colors by providing full-spectrum visible light to the overall exposure.

Another environmental effect is range of visibility. The water is seldom optimally clear, and the dissolved and suspended matter can reduce visibility by both absorption and scattering of light.

===Underwater flash===

The use of a flash or strobe is often regarded as the most difficult aspect of underwater photography. Some misconceptions exist about the proper use of flash underwater, especially as it relates to wide-angle photography. Generally, the flash should be used to supplement the overall exposure and to restore lost color, not as the primary light source. In situations such as the interior of caves or shipwrecks, wide-angle images can be 100% strobe light, but such situations are fairly rare. Usually, the photographer tries to create an aesthetic balance between the available sunlight and the strobe. Deep, dark or low visibility environments can make this balance more difficult, but the concept remains the same. Many modern cameras have simplified this process through various automatic exposure modes and the use of through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The increasing use of digital cameras has reduced the learning curve of underwater flash significantly, since the user can instantly review photos and make adjustments.

Color is absorbed as it travels through water, so that the deeper the observer, the less reds, oranges and yellow colors remain. The strobe replaces that color. It also helps to provide shadow and texture, and is a valuable tool for creativity.
An added complication is the phenomenon of backscatter, where the flash reflects off particles in the water. These particles show up in the final shot as bright dots. Even seemingly clear water contains enormous amounts of these particulates, even if they not readily seen by the naked eye. The best technique for avoiding backscatter is positioning the strobe away from the axis of the camera lens. Ideally, this means the flash will not light up the particulates in water directly in front of the lens, but will still illuminate the subject. Various systems of jointed arms and attachments are used to make off-camera strobes easier to manipulate.
When using macro lenses, photographers are much more likely to use 100% strobe light for the exposure. The subject is normally very close to the lens, and the available ambient light is usually not sufficient.

There have been some attempts to avoid the use of artificial light entirely, but these have mostly failed. In shallow water, the use of custom white-balance provides excellent color without the use of strobe. In theory one could use color filters to overcome the blue-green shift, but this can be problematic. The amount of shift varies with depth and turbidity, and there would still be a significant loss of contrast. Many digital cameras have settings that will provide color balance, but this can cause other problems. For example, an image shifted toward the &quot;warm&quot; part of the spectrum can create background water which appears gray, purple or pink, and looks unnatural. There have been some successful experiments using filters combined with the raw image format function on some high-end digital cameras, allowing more detailed manipulation in the digital darkroom. This approach will probably always be restricted to shallower depths, where the loss of color is less extreme. In spite of that, it can be effective for large subjects such as shipwrecks which could not be lit effectively with strobes.

Natural light photography underwater can be beautiful when done properly with subjects such as upward silhouettes, light beams, and large subjects such as whales and dolphins.

Although digital cameras have revolutionized many aspects of underwater imaging, it is unlikely that flash will ever be eliminated completely. From an aesthetic standpoint, the flash emphasizes the subject and helps separate it from the blue background, especially in deeper water. Ultimately the loss of color and contrast is a pervasive optical problem that cannot always be adjusted in software such as Photoshop.

====Snoot====
A snoot is a tube used to direct the illumination from the flash or other light source to a very restricted area, strongly illuminating the area of focus and leaving the surroundings relatively dark. It is used to selectively illuminate the subject to give dark backgrounds and a brightly lit subject. It is easier to use if the flash has an integral modeling light so the photographer can see how the illumination will be distributed during exposure. A snoot with the opening placed close to the subject at an angle can virtually eliminate backscatter.
===Modeling lights===
A modeling light is a low intensity light used to compose the picture when flash is intended for illumination. It allows a better view of the subject for focusing and framing the shot, but does not provide enough light to interfere with the flash illumination. Some flash units have integral modeling lights with a aluminum funnel and flash unit to direct the angle in which the light is exerted in. otherwise a diffuse low power dive light may work well for close up work. 
===Video lights===
A video light is a powerful light source used primarily for shooting video in environments with insufficient natural light, but can also be used as the primary light source for still photography. Placement of the video light follows the same recommendations as for flash photography, with the advantage that the illumination can be clearly seen and assessed before exposure. Considerably more energy is required for constant illumination in comparison with flash, and this method is best suited to cameras with sufficiently sensitive CCDs and for close up work. Another advantage is that the video light provides good illumination for general diving purposes. Video lights with adjustable intensity can be even more versatile. Video lights tend to be mounted similarly to flash. The intense light may disturb light sensitive animals, and they may react by retreating from the source. A large proportion of digital cameras have high definition video function, and video lights provide the option of switching between still and video using the same equipment. 
==Split images==

Another format considered part of underwater photography is the over/under or split image, a composition that includes roughly half above the surface and half underwater, with both in focus. One of the pioneers of the traditional technique was National Geographic photographer David Doubilet, who used it to capture scenes above and below the surface simultaneously. Split images are popular in recreational scuba magazines, often showing divers swimming beneath a boat, or shallow coral reefs with the shoreline seen in the background.

Over/under shots present some technical challenges beyond the scope of most underwater camera systems. Normally an ultra wide angle lens is used, similar to the way it would be used in everyday underwater photography. However, the exposure value in the above water part of the image is often higher (brighter) than in the one underwater. There is also the problem of refraction in the underwater segment, and how it affects the overall focus in relation to the air segment. There are specialized split filters designed to compensate for both of these problems, as well as techniques for creating even exposure across the entire image.

However, professional photographers often use extremely wide or fisheye lenses that provide extensive depth of field - and a very small aperture for even more extensive depth of field; this is intended for acceptably sharp focus both on the nearby underwater subject and the more distant elements above water. An external flash can also be very useful underwater, on a low setting, to balance the light: to overcome the difference in brightness of the elements above and below the water.

Over/under photos necessitate the lens or port to be partly below and partly above the surface. When bringing the outer optical surface out of the water, droplets can be left on the surface which can distort the image. This can be avoided to some extent by wiping off the droplets with a chamois leather cloth above the water and lowering the camera to working position. Keeping the port fully wet is an alternative option, which requires the shot to be taken before the water on the top part of the lens surface separates into droplets. Which approach works better will depend on the surface tension of water on the lens surface.

David Doubilet explained his technique for split field images in an interview for Nikon Corporation. &quot;You need to use a D-SLR and a super wide-angle or fisheye lens and a sophisticated housing that has a dome, not a flat port. Underwater images are magnified by 25 percent, and the dome will correct for that. The technique requires a small f/stop—f/16 or smaller—for great depth of field, plus a lens capable of close-focus; you always focus on the subject below the water line. You also have to balance the light. I look for a light bottom—white sand is best—or a light underwater subject. I&#x27;ll put the strobes down below and light the bottom and then expose for the top. If you shoot at, say, ISO 400, you&#x27;ll have plenty of exposure for the top, and the strobes will take care of the bottom. Of course, you need subjects that suit the technique.&quot;

Digital darkroom techniques can also be used to &quot;merge&quot; two images together, creating the appearance of an over/under shot.

==Applications==
*Artistic photography, where the emotional impact on the viewer is a primary concern. 
*Records of the condition of equipment and structures by commercial divers, where the purpose is to accurately present visible evidence of the condition of the subject. 
*Records of the environment for personal and scientific purposes
**Citizen science websites for recording Biodiversity using underwater photographs as records, such as iNaturalist, Reef Life Survey, iSpot etc., use photography as a reliable source of objective data where the observer is not required to be recognised as an expert in identification of the subject, but is trusted to provide sufficiently accurate information regarding time, location, and similar meta-data. Recreational diver photographic coverage of the underwater environment is much more frequent than scientific research capacity for popular dive sites. 

==Skills and training==

Since underwater photography is often performed while scuba diving, it is important that the diver-photographer be sufficiently skilled so that it remains a reasonably safe activity. Good scuba technique also improves the quality of images, since marine life is less likely to be scared away by a calm diver, and the environment is less likely to be damaged or disturbed by a diver competent in buoyancy, trim, and maneuvering skills. There is the possibility of encountering poor conditions, such as heavy currents, tidal flow, or poor visibility. Underwater photographers usually try to avoid these situations if reasonably practicable, but in many cases the desired subject can only be accessed under less than ideal conditions and the photographer must deal with reality. Underwater diving training providers provide courses to help improve divers&#x27; diving skills and underwater photography skills. Good diving skills are necessary to avoid damaging the environment when maneuvering close to benthic subjects on reefs. Some underwater photographers have been implicated in reef damage.

== Scientific potential ==
Underwater photography has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting on millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. 
As a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites (such as iNaturalist), along with protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in Réunion island, allowing for tens of new records and even new species.

Scientists use underwater photography to examine objects on the sea floor over time, such as through quadrats.

== History and Advancement ==
Underwater photography dates back to the early 20th century. Technological advancements, like the invention of the first waterproof camera housings and improvements in diving equipment, have made underwater photography more accessible. Today, digital cameras and advances in post-processing software have revolutionized underwater imaging, allowing photographers to capture high-resolution, color-rich images.

<doc id="291262" wikidata="Q1123858" url="?curid=291262" title="Concerned Women for America">
<text>Concerned Women for America (CWA) is a socially conservative, evangelical Christian non-profit women&#x27;s legislative action committee in the United States. Headquartered in Washington D.C., the CWA is involved in social and political movements, through which it aims to incorporate Christian ideology. 
The group was founded in San Diego, California in 1978 by Beverly LaHaye, whose husband Timothy LaHaye was an evangelical Christian minister and author of &quot;The Battle for the Mind&quot;, as well as coauthor of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series.

The CWA identifies itself as an amalgam of &quot;policy experts and... activists[s]&quot; with an anti-feminist approach to politics.

== Formation ==

Concerned Women for America is part of a movement known as the New Christian Right. Organized in reaction to the establishment of its liberal counterpart, the National Organization for Women; the growing dispute over traditional gender roles; and the rising discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the CWA set out to &quot;fight policies that it believe[d] [to] disrupt traditional gender roles and norms.&quot; Fueling its formation, an interview between Barbara Walters and Betty Friedan, a prominent feminist activist, gained public attention in 1978 regarding women&#x27;s issues. In the interview, Friedan claimed to speak for American women. Beverly LaHaye did not believe that Betty Friedan was speaking for the majority of women because feminist views were, according to LaHaye, anti-God and anti-family. In regards to the interview, LaHaye stated that she was convinced Friedan&#x27;s goal was a &quot;misguided attempt to dismantle the bedrock of American culture: the family,&quot; and that she believed Christian women were not included in discussions of women&#x27;s rights. In this regard, the &quot;concern&quot; that the CWA had behind the name of the group was in response to the worries that feminism would &quot;ruin&quot; America. Such fears and opposition to much of the Democratic Party&#x27;s ideology during this era led Beverly LaHaye to host a series of conventions and rallies in San Diego, resulting in Concerned Women for America&#x27;s formation. As a result, the CWA became known as &quot;the largest women&#x27;s organization of the Christian Right during the 1980s and 1990s.&quot;

The CWA began with local prayer chapters mobilized around issues such as the ERA and legalized abortion. In 1987, the CWA relocated from San Diego, California to Washington, DC, at which time it formally established a national office and a national presence.

== Issues ==
The CWA identifies itself as an organization in opposition to feminism that speaks for evangelical women who feel that the national feminist movement does not support their interests. The CWA has taken strong conservative stances on several highly debated matters. The CWA has publicly stated its opposition to issues such as abortion, sex education, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, needle exchange programs, pornography, cloning, drug abuse, secular education, gambling, or any other efforts which &quot;intervene with natural human life.&quot; The organization&#x27;s stance on contraception is not as clear, however, for members’ opinions on this topic vary widely. The only definite statement the CWA has put forth in regards to contraception is that its stance, as a whole, is ambiguous, but that &quot;many Catholic women follow the church’s teaching on the use of contraceptives.&quot; The CWA focuses on promoting its conservative, Christian-based ideology through seven &quot;core issues&quot;.

=== Abortion ===
A few years prior to the organization&#x27;s founding, the Supreme Court released its decisions regarding &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;, which granted women the right to attain an abortion, and disbanded all state laws restricting such action. Because many of the CWA&#x27;s members were supporters of the Right to Life Movement and strongly opposed these rulings, Concerned Women for America is recognized as an anti-abortion organization. At the time of its founding, the CWA, along with similar organizations which spawned during this era, identified itself as part of the &quot;pro-family movement,&quot; arguing that abortion defied both Christian morality and traditional family values.

The CWA was a proponent of the welfare revisions set out by the 1994 &quot;Contract with America&quot;, which aimed to reduce the frequency and acceptance of illegitimate (out of wedlock) births. These revisions suggested (1) incentivizing states to &quot;reduce illegitimate births without...increas[ing] abortions&quot; by way of block grants; (2) denying monetary assistance to &quot;children born to unmarried minor mothers;&quot; and (3) establishing a &quot;family cap&quot; in which unwed mothers could only be compensated for one child, all of which the CWA supported due to its strong opposition to abortion and its defense of the traditional family, as discussed below.

Currently, the CWA strives to inform the public of the harm it claims that abortion has on men, women and their families. The CWA began using the common anti-abortion movement&#x27;s rhetoric of protecting women and their health in the mid-1990s, as a way to promote interest in the anti-abortion movement. The CWA lobbies for defunding domestic and international family planning programs, especially those that perform abortions or provide Norplant. The CWA supports crisis pregnancy centers and post-abortion counseling services.

The CWA opposes emergency contraception, such as Plan B, on the grounds that it &quot;blurs the line&quot; between contraception and abortion.

=== Marriage ===
As a supporter of traditional gender roles and the nuclear family, the CWA publicly defends western familialism and the subservience of women. As such, the CWA is a supporter of the sanctity of marriage and reproduction, and strongly opposes divorce.

Regarding the defense of the family, the CWA was a latecomer to the opposition of the ERA. The CWA believes that the woman&#x27;s place is within the home, therefore the rights set forth by the ERA threatened the traditional nuclear family. The CWA built a national network of prayer chains in opposition to the ERA. The CWA was a supporter of the Defense of Marriage Act as DOMA declared homosexual marriages to be illegal, thus supporting the CWA&#x27;s ideals of both heterosexuality and marriage.

The CWA believes it is a Christian&#x27;s duty to start a family, explaining their general disapproval of those who do not wish to have children. More specifically, these familial ideals tie into the CWA&#x27;s understanding of women and motherhood; as expressed by founder Beverly LaHaye, women have a &quot;natural&quot; desire to be mothers, leading to the organization&#x27;s encouragement of women&#x27;s domesticity through stay-at-home motherhood.

The CWA opposed the 1988 Act for Better Child Care (H.R. 3660), which would have provided government-sponsored child care for families in which both parents are working. The CWA also testified against the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 on the premise that it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave.

In support of these ideals, the CWA opposes pornography, believing that consumption of such media can disrupt traditional family values, as well as promote domestic violence. More specifically, the CWA &quot;contends that pornography persuades men to demean their wives, to ruin their marriages, and to engage in illicit sexual behaviors&quot;. In addition, the CWA claims that the proliferation of and lack of regulation for pornography promotes gay rights and premarital sex, both of which it strongly opposes.

=== Religious education in public schools ===
Being a Christian organization, the CWA is known to promote Christian teachings in schools. The CWA believes that they must defend &quot;God&#x27;s truth,&quot; and to do so, they advocate against &quot;secular humanist&quot; teachings and influence in public education. It is for these reasons that the CWA initially gained recognition as a public policy organization, for it publicly opposed the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s rulings in 1962 and 1963, which banned religious teachings and practices, such as prayers and Bible readings, in public schools.

To provide a more historical context of the organization&#x27;s educational efforts, in 1983, the CWA&#x27;s desire for a combination of fundamental and religious teachings was concretely displayed through a lawsuit, known today as &quot;Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education&quot;, which arose between parents (members of the CWA) and a local Tennessee school board&quot;.&quot; The case began when a local mother, Vicki Frost, reprimanded the administration at her daughter&#x27;s school for providing students with books that discussed evolution, feminism, and telepathy, which she contended &quot;could turn children away from God.&quot; The dispute quickly escalated as a group of likeminded parents joined Frost and filed a federal lawsuit, resulting in the CWA&#x27;s public support against the school and People for the American Way, one of its many liberal counterparts. Fearing the growth of the &quot;Religious New Right,&quot; the CWA claimed that students should have the right to freely exercise their religion, parents should have a voice in their child&#x27;s education, and there should be greater control over schools as a whole, arguments which gained favor in the trial court in 1986. To the CWA&#x27;s dismay, however, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed this decision in 1987.

The CWA believes that sex education should not be taught in school, and that parents should be empowered to teach their own children about sex. However, they also concede that if it is taught in school, then it needs to be abstinence-only sex education. Many &quot;sexual conservatives,&quot; as Lisa McGirr refers to them in her research regarding sex education, have relied on the CWA to help them implement such ideology into the development or modification of sex education programs in schools, as well as to provide educational speakers.

CWA supports teaching intelligent design in public schools and advocates school prayer, saying in a 1988 book titled &quot;America: To Pray or Not To Pray?&quot;, that since the &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; Supreme Court case of 1962 outlawed government-directed prayer, morality has declined in public schools and in society in general. As described above, the CWA aided the plaintiff in the 1983 case &quot;Mozert v. Hawkins&quot;, by arguing it is unconstitutional for public schools to require reading material that conflicts with the religious values of parents.

In similar fashion to the &quot;Mozert&quot; case, the CWA was recognized for its support of Nathan Bishop Middle School and the Providence, Rhode Island school district in the 1992 &quot;Lee v. Weisman&quot; case. Contrary to &quot;Mozert v. Hawkins&quot;, in which the CWA protested against the school&#x27;s nonsecular teaching, &quot;Lee v. Weisman&quot; resulted in support from conservative Christian organizations, such as the CWA, who fought to defend the maintenance of religious practices in public schools, such as prayer at graduation.

Along with its support of the welfare revisions in the Contract with America, the CWA advocated for other amendments, such as the reinstitution of state-sponsored school prayer and &quot;the eligibility of religious programs for public funding.&quot;

=== National sovereignty ===
The CWA originally opposed the U.S. involvement in the United Nations, but have since accepted the UN and instead focus on the alleged dangers of conferences and treaties. The CWA has more influence in international affairs than many other conservative organizations because they are active in the UN.

The CWA opposed CEDAW, The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was adopted by the UN in 1979. They view CEDAW as a tool to undermine the traditional family and guarantee global abortion and prostitution.

=== Sexual exploitation ===
The CWA believes that men becoming addicted to pornography leads to the exploitation and victimization of women.

In addition to pornography, the CWA opposes prostitution. The CWA believes that legalizing prostitution would increase sex trafficking, not decrease it as other organizations have proposed.

The CWA has been actively involved in the prevention of sex trafficking; working closely with the National Organization for Women, the Family Research Council, Catholics for a Free Choice, Gloria Steinem, and Chuck Colson, the CWA has increased awareness of this issue, and was a major contributor in the establishment of The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) in 2000.

In response to Google and Mozilla&#x27;s plans to test a standard which would encrypt the Domain Name System, which could possibly impede internet surveillance by law enforcement, a CWA spokesperson said &quot;We believe it is important for all stakeholders in the internet ecosystem to work together to ensure that encrypted DNS does not lead to unintended consequences that harm our children.&quot;

=== Support for Israel ===
On 8 May 2013 CWA&#x27;s board of directors voted unanimously to include support for Israel as part of its core mission. CWA says it will support &quot;laws and policies that strengthen the ties between Israel and the U.S.&quot; and &quot;Policies enacted by our State Department, Department of Defense and others that encourage the development of our relationship with Israel.” Penny Nance said that support from CWA&#x27;s founder, Beverly LaHaye, was the biggest driver behind the group formalizing its support for Israel. This relationship is backed by a long history of conservative Christians&#x27; support for Israel.

=== Project 2025 ===
CWA is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.

== Working through the media ==
In the late 1990s, the CWA garnered attention by way of its midday broadcasts on KFAX, a San Francisco-based Christian radio station. These broadcasts often featured &quot;Beverly LaHaye Live&quot;, a popular talk-show segment which spoke about the CWA&#x27;s mission, morals, and aspirations for society. Today, the CWA continues to produce a daily radio show, however it is now entitled &quot;Concerned Women Today&quot;, and focuses primarily on calling members and other listeners to action by encouraging them to lobby senators.

The CWA publishes a monthly magazine called &quot;Family Voice&quot;, which chronicles their current events as well as ways in which members can become more involved with the organization.

== Beverly LaHaye Institute ==
The Beverly LaHaye Institute (BLI), named for the CWA founder, is the research arm of the CWA. BLI is considered one of the CWA&#x27;s official think tanks. The BLI has a variety of research style essays and briefs that cover a wide variety of topics the CWA is interested in, most of which is published or featured on the CWA website.

BLI filed an &quot;amicus&quot; brief in January 2014 in &quot;Sebelius vs. Hobby Lobby&quot;. Most of the &quot;amicus&quot; briefs in the Hobby Lobby case focused on religious freedom issues. BLI&#x27;s brief had a unique focus on rebutting the government&#x27;s argument that the birth control mandate imposed by Affordable Care Act would improve women&#x27;s health and prevent unintended pregnancies. The BLI brief rejected a clear-cut notion of &quot;intended&quot; and &quot;unintended&quot; pregnancies. BLI argued that the government&#x27;s evidence, based mostly on a 2011 Institute of Medicine report, did not prove the birth control mandate would increase use rates for birth control or that unintended pregnancies harm women&#x27;s health. The brief also argued against the government&#x27;s claim that the mandate promotes &quot;gender equity.&quot;

== Culture and Family Institute ==
The Culture and Family Institute is one of two of the CWA&#x27;s research facilities. The Culture and Family Institute, founded in 2001, is a think tank that focuses exclusively on opposition to gay rights activism.

<doc id="291263" wikidata="Q1962918" url="?curid=291263" title="Night diving">
<text>Night diving is underwater diving done during the hours of darkness. It frequently refers specifically to recreational diving which takes place in darkness. The diver can experience a different underwater environment at night, because many marine animals are nocturnal.

There are additional hazards when diving in darkness, such as dive light failure. This can result in losing vertical visual references and being unable to control depth or buoyancy, being unable to read instruments such as dive computers and diving cylinder contents gauges, and potential separation from the rest of the diving group, boat, or shore cover. Even with a functioning light, these hazards are still present in night diving. Backup lights are recommended. 

==Training and certification==

Several diver certification agencies offer specialty training in night diving, and it was originally part of the training requirement for the second level of recreational diving (CMAS two-star scuba diver, etc.), but professional diver training will usually include it in entry-level training as it is considered a normal part of occupational diving.

==Equipment and procedures==
Normal requirements for night diving are a dive light, and adequate protection from exposure. Some precautions and skills for night diving include: avoiding shining the light in other divers&#x27; eyes, to be aware of and use surface light signals for bearings, and if appropriate to use an illuminated shotline buoy. A surface marker buoy with an attached strobe light or cyalume stick can be used to indicate the position of the divers to the surface team. The use of a strobe light by a diver under water can damage the night vision of other divers, and would generally be reserved as an emergency signal. A backup light can be useful if the primary light fails, and is essential if doing a decompression dive without a dive computer which can be read in the dark.

There are several advantages to night diving at a site that is familiar from diving there during the day. The diver who is more familiar with the site is less likely to be disoriented. 

Excessively strong lights can scare off or stress nocturnal animals. and may make them more vulnerable to predation while regaining their vision. Similarly, divers will be dazzled by lights shone in their eyes, and will take some time to recover night vision, during which they will be less able to deal with contingencies. Dive light discipline is more difficult in larger groups.

Black-water diving is the night time equivalent of blue-water diving which is mid-water diving in deep open oceanic waters.

==Recovering divers==
If a diver surfaces away from the boat, dive lights can be used to signal the dive boat. A surface marker buoy can be illuminated with a dive light at night to increase the visibility of the dive team to the boat. Reflective tape surfaces can also be used to increase visibility of the team on the surface.

<doc id="291267" wikidata="Q222355" url="?curid=291267" title="Superessive case">
<text>In grammar, the superessive case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case indicating location on top of, or on the surface of something. Its name comes from Latin : to be over and above. While most languages communicate this concept through the use of adpositions, there are some, such as Hungarian, which make use of cases for this grammatical structure.

An example in Hungarian: means &quot;on the books&quot;, literally &quot;the books-on&quot;.

In Finnish, superessive is a case in the adverbial cases category, that are productive only with a limited set of stems. The superessive is marked with the ending. For example:

* means &quot;everywhere&quot; ( &quot;everything-at&quot;)

* means &quot;(at) here&quot; (from - &quot;this&quot;, &quot;at this place&quot;)

* means &quot;(at) somewhere else&quot; (from - &quot;other&quot;, &quot;other-at&quot;)

In Lezgian, the superessive case is marked with suffixes: &#x27;on the bear&#x27;.

<doc id="291268" wikidata="Q114403" url="?curid=291268" title="Depreciation">
<text>In accountancy, depreciation refers to two aspects of the same concept: first, an actual reduction in the fair value of an asset, such as the decrease in value of factory equipment each year as it is used and wears, and second, the allocation in accounting statements of the original cost of the assets to periods in which the assets are used (depreciation with the matching principle).

Depreciation is thus the decrease in the value of assets and the method used to reallocate, or &quot;write down&quot; the cost of a tangible asset (such as equipment) over its useful life span. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both accounting and tax purposes. The decrease in value of the asset affects the balance sheet of a business or entity, and the method of depreciating the asset, accounting-wise, affects the net income, and thus the income statement that they report. Generally, the cost is allocated as depreciation expense among the periods in which the asset is expected to be used.

==Accounting concept==

In determining the net income (profits) from an activity, the receipts from the activity must be reduced by appropriate costs. One such cost is the cost of assets used but not immediately consumed in the activity. Such cost allocated in a given period is equal to the reduction in the value placed on the asset, which is initially equal to the amount paid for the asset and subsequently may or may not be related to the amount expected to be received upon its disposal. Depreciation is any method of allocating such net cost to those periods in which the organization is expected to benefit from the use of the asset. Depreciation is a process of deducting the cost of an asset over its useful life. Assets are sorted into different classes and each has its own useful life. The asset is referred to as a depreciable asset. Depreciation is technically a method of allocation, not valuation, even though it determines the value placed on the asset in the balance sheet.

Any business or income-producing activity using tangible assets may incur costs related to those assets. If an asset is expected to produce a benefit in future periods, some of these costs must be deferred rather than treated as a current expense. The business then records depreciation expense in its financial reporting as the current period&#x27;s allocation of such costs. This is usually done in a rational and systematic manner. Generally, this involves four criteria:
*Cost of the asset
*Expected salvage value, also known as the residual value of the assets
*Estimated useful life of the asset
*A method of apportioning the cost over such life

===Depreciable basis===

Cost generally is the amount paid for the asset, including all costs related to acquiring and bringing the asset into use. In some countries or for some purposes, salvage value may be ignored. The rules of some countries specify lives and methods to be used for particular types of assets. However, in most countries the life is based on business experience, and the method may be chosen from one of several acceptable methods.

===Impairment===

Accounting rules also require that an impairment charge or expense be recognized if the value of assets declines unexpectedly. Such charges are usually nonrecurring and may relate to any type of asset.
Many companies consider write-offs of some of their long-lived assets because some property, plant, and equipment have suffered partial obsolescence. Accountants reduce the asset&#x27;s carrying amount by its fair value. For example, if a company continues to incur losses because prices of a particular product or service are higher than the operating costs, companies consider write-offs of the particular asset. These write-offs are referred to as impairments. There are events and changes in circumstances might lead to impairment. Some examples are:
* Large amount of decrease in fair value of an asset
* A change of manner in which the asset is used 
* Accumulation of costs that are not originally expected to acquire or construct an asset 
* A projection of incurring losses associated with the particular asset 
Events or changes in circumstances indicate that the company may not be able recover the carrying amount of the asset. In which case, companies use the recoverability test to determine whether impairment has occurred. The steps to determine are:

# Estimate the future cash flow of asset (from the use of the asset to disposition)
# If the sum of the expected cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is considered impaired

===Depletion and amortization===

Depletion and amortization are similar concepts for natural resources (including oil) and intangible assets, respectively.

===Effect on cash===

Depreciation expense does not require a current outlay of cash. However, since depreciation is an expense to the P&amp;L account, provided the enterprise is operating in a manner that covers its expenses (e.g., operating at a profit) depreciation is a source of cash in a statement of cash flows, which generally offsets the cash cost of acquiring new assets required to continue operations when existing assets reach the end of their useful lives.

===Accumulated depreciation===

While depreciation expense is recorded on the income statement of a business, its impact is generally recorded in a separate account and disclosed on the balance sheet as accumulated under fixed assets, according to most accounting principles. Accumulated depreciation is known as a contra account, because it separately shows a negative amount that is directly associated with an accumulated depreciation account on the balance sheet. Depreciation expense is usually charged against the relevant asset directly. The values of the fixed assets stated on the balance sheet will decline, even if the business has not invested in or disposed of any assets. Theoretically, the amounts will roughly approximate fair value. Otherwise, depreciation expense is charged against accumulated depreciation. Showing accumulated depreciation separately on the balance sheet has the effect of preserving the historical cost of assets on the balance sheet. If there have been no investments or dispositions in fixed assets for the year, then the values of the assets will be the same on the balance sheet for the current and prior year (P/Y).

==Methods for depreciation==

There are several methods for calculating depreciation, generally based on either the passage of time or the level of activity (or use) of the asset.

===Straight-line depreciation===

Straight-line depreciation is the simplest and most often used method. The straight-line depreciation is calculated by dividing the difference between assets pagal sale cost and its expected salvage value by the number of years for its expected useful life. (The salvage value may be zero, or even negative due to costs required to retire it; however, for depreciation purposes salvage value is not generally calculated at below zero.) The company will then charge the same amount to depreciation each year over that period, until the value shown for the asset has reduced from the original cost to the salvage value.

Straight-line method:
:formula_1
DE=(Cost-SL)/UL

For example, a vehicle that depreciates over 5 years is purchased at a cost of $17,000 and will have a salvage value of $2000. Then this vehicle will depreciate at $3,000 per year, i.e. (17-2)/5 = 3. This table illustrates the straight-line method of depreciation. Book value at the beginning of the first year of depreciation is the original cost of the asset. Book value equals original cost minus accumulated depreciation.

book value = original cost − accumulated depreciation Book value at the end of year becomes book value at the beginning of next year. The asset is depreciated until the book value equals scrap value.

If the vehicle were to be sold and the sales price exceeded the depreciated value (net book value) then the excess would be considered a gain and subject to depreciation recapture. In addition, this gain above the depreciated value would be recognized as ordinary income by the tax office. If the sales price is ever less than the book value, the resulting capital loss is tax-deductible. If the sale price were ever more than the original book value, then the gain above the original book value is recognized as a capital gain.

If a company chooses to depreciate an asset at a different rate from that used by the tax office, then this generates a timing difference in the income statement due to the difference (at a point in time) between the taxation department&#x27;s and company&#x27;s view of the profit.

=== Diminishing balance method ===

The double-declining-balance method, or reducing balance method, is used to calculate an asset&#x27;s accelerated rate of depreciation against its non-depreciated balance during earlier years of assets useful life. When using the double-declining-balance method, the salvage value is not considered in determining the annual depreciation, but the book value of the asset being depreciated is never brought below its salvage value, regardless of the method used. Depreciation ceases when either the salvage value or the end of the asset&#x27;s useful life is reached.

Since double-declining-balance depreciation does not always depreciate an asset fully by its end of life, some methods also compute a straight-line depreciation each year, and apply the greater of the two. This has the effect of converting from declining-balance depreciation to straight-line depreciation at a midpoint in the asset&#x27;s life. The double-declining-balance method is also a better representation of how vehicles depreciate and can more accurately match cost with benefit from asset use. The company in the future may want to allocate as little depreciation expenses as possible to help with additional expenses. 

With the declining balance method, one can find the depreciation rate that would allow exactly for full depreciation by the end of the period, using the formula:

formula_2,

where N is the estimated life of the asset (for example, in years).

=== Annuity depreciation ===

Annuity depreciation methods are not based on time, but on a level of Annuity. This could be miles driven for a vehicle, or a cycle count for a machine. When the asset is acquired, its life is estimated in terms of this level of activity. Assume the vehicle above is estimated to go 50,000 miles in its lifetime. The per-mile depreciation rate is calculated as: ($17,000 cost - $2,000 salvage) / 50,000 miles = $0.30 per mile. Each year, the depreciation expense is then calculated by multiplying the number of miles driven by the per-mile depreciation rate.

=== Sum-of-years-digits method ===

Sum-of-years-digits is a spent depreciation method that results in a more accelerated write-off than the straight-line method, and typically also more accelerated than the declining balance method. Under this method, the annual depreciation is determined by multiplying the depreciable cost by a schedule of fractions.

Sum of the years&#x27; digits method of depreciation is one of the accelerated depreciation techniques which are based on the assumption that assets are generally more productive when they are new and their productivity decreases as they become old. The formula to calculate depreciation under SYD method is:

SYD depreciation = depreciable base x (remaining useful life/sum of the years&#x27; digits)&lt;br&gt;
depreciable base = cost − salvage value

Example: If an asset has original cost of $1000, a useful life of 5 years and a salvage value of $100, compute its depreciation schedule.

First, determine the years&#x27; digits. Since the asset has a useful life of 5 years, the years&#x27; digits are: 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

Next, calculate the sum of the digits: 5+4+3+2+1=15

The sum of the digits can also be determined by using the formula (n2+n)/2 where n is equal to the useful life of the asset in years. The example would be shown as (52+5)/2=15

Depreciation rates are as follows:

5/15 for the 1st year,
4/15 for the 2nd year,
3/15 for the 3rd year,
2/15 for the 4th year, and
1/15 for the 5th year.

=== Units-of-production depreciation method ===

Units-of-production depreciation method calculates greater deductions for depreciation in years when the asset is heavily used 
:formula_3

DE= ((OV-SV)/EPC) x Units per year 

Suppose an asset has original cost $70,000, salvage value $10,000, and is expected to produce 6,000 units.

Depreciation per unit = ($70,000−10,000) / 6,000 = $10

10 × actual production will give the depreciation cost of the current year.

The table below illustrates the units-of-production depreciation schedule of the asset.

Depreciation stops when book value is equal to the scrap value of the asset. In the end, the sum of accumulated depreciation and scrap value equals the original cost.

=== Group depreciation method ===

The group depreciation method is used for depreciating multiple-asset accounts using a similar depreciation method. The assets must be similar in nature and have approximately the same useful lives.

=== Composite depreciation method ===

The composite method is applied to a collection of assets that are not similar and have different service lives. For example, computers and printers are not similar, but both are part of the office equipment. Depreciation on all assets is determined by using the straight-line-depreciation method.

Composite life equals the total depreciable cost divided by the total depreciation per year. $5,900 / $1,300 = 4.5 years.

Composite depreciation rate equals depreciation per year divided by total historical cost.
$1,300 / $6,500 = 0.20 = 20%

Depreciation expense equals the composite depreciation rate times the balance in the asset account (historical cost). (0.20 * $6,500) $1,300. Debit depreciation expense and credit accumulated depreciation.

When an asset is sold, debit cash for the amount received and credit the asset account for its original cost. Debit the difference between the two to accumulated depreciation. Under the composite method, no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of an asset. Theoretically, this makes sense because the gains and losses from assets sold before and after the composite life will average themselves out.

To calculate composite depreciation rate, divide depreciation per year by total historical cost. To calculate depreciation expense, multiply the result by the same total historical cost. The result will equal the total depreciation per year again.

Common sense requires depreciation expense to be equal to total depreciation per year, without first dividing and then multiplying total depreciation per year by the same number.

==Tax depreciation==
Most income tax systems allow a tax deduction for recovery of the cost of assets used in a business or for the production of income. Such deductions are allowed for individuals and companies. Where the assets are consumed currently, the cost may be deducted currently as an expense or treated as part of cost of goods sold. The cost of assets not currently consumed generally must be deferred and recovered over time, such as through depreciation. Some systems permit the full deduction of the cost, at least in part, in the year the assets are acquired. Other systems allow depreciation expense over some life using some depreciation method or percentage. Rules vary highly by country and may vary within a country based on the type of asset or type of taxpayer. Many systems that specify depreciation lives and methods for financial reporting require the same lives and methods be used for tax purposes. Most tax systems provide different rules for real property (buildings, etc.) and personal property (equipment, etc.).

===Capital allowances===
A common system is to allow a fixed percentage of the cost of depreciable assets to be deducted each year. This is often referred to as a capital allowance, as it is called in the United Kingdom. Deductions are permitted to individuals and businesses based on assets placed in service during or before the assessment year. Canada&#x27;s Capital Cost Allowance are fixed percentages of assets within a class or type of asset. Fixed percentage rates are specified by the type of asset. The fixed percentage is multiplied by the tax basis of assets in service to determine the capital allowance deduction. The tax law or regulations of the country specifies these percentages. Capital allowance calculations may be based on the total set of assets, on sets or pools by year (vintage pools) or pools by classes of assets... Depreciation has got three methods only.

===Tax lives and methods===

Some systems specify lives based on classes of property defined by the tax authority. Canada Revenue Agency specifies numerous classes based on the type of property and how it is used. Under the United States depreciation system, the Internal Revenue Service publishes a detailed guide which includes a table of asset lives and the applicable conventions. The table also incorporates specified lives for certain commonly used assets (e.g., office furniture, computers, automobiles) which override the business use lives. U.S. tax depreciation is computed under the double-declining balance method switching to straight line or the straight-line method, at the option of the taxpayer. IRS tables specify percentages to apply to the basis of an asset for each year in which it is in service. Depreciation first becomes deductible when an asset is placed in service.

===Additional depreciation===

Many systems allow an additional deduction for a portion of the cost of depreciable assets acquired in the current tax year. The UK system provides a first-year capital allowance of £50,000. In the United States, two such deductions are available. A deduction for the full cost of depreciable tangible personal property is allowed up to $500,000 through 2013. This deduction is fully phased out for businesses acquiring over $2,000,000 of such property during the year. In addition, additional first year depreciation of 50% of the cost of most other depreciable tangible personal property is allowed as a deduction. Some other systems have similar first year or accelerated allowances.

===Real property===

Many tax systems prescribe longer depreciable lives for buildings and land improvements. Such lives may vary by type of use. Many such systems, including the United States, permit depreciation for real property using only the straight-line method, or a small fixed percentage of the cost. Generally, no depreciation tax deduction is allowed for bare land. In the United States, residential rental buildings are depreciable over a 27.5 year or 40-year life, other buildings over a 39 or 40-year life, and land improvements over a 15 or 20-year life, all using the straight-line method.

===Averaging conventions===

Depreciation calculations require a lot of record-keeping if done for each asset a business owns, especially if assets are added to after they are acquired, or partially disposed of. However, many tax systems permit all assets of a similar type acquired in the same year to be combined in a &quot;pool&quot;. Depreciation is then computed for all assets in the pool as a single calculation. These calculations must make assumptions about the date of acquisition. The United States system allows a taxpayer to use a half-year convention for personal property or mid-month convention for real property. Under such a convention, all property of a particular type is considered to have been acquired at the midpoint of the acquisition period. One half of a full period&#x27;s depreciation is allowed in the acquisition period (and also in the final depreciation period if the life of the assets is a whole number of years). United States rules require a mid-quarter convention for per property if more than 40% of the acquisitions for the year are in the final quarter.

===Fixed rate of Depreciation===

In many countries, for the purpose of tax, a fixed rate is deemed for a class of asset at which rate the depreciation is to be charged and claimed as expense in profit and loss account for the purpose of tax expense allowance.

<doc id="291279" wikidata="Q771669" url="?curid=291279" title="Harvey Ball">
<text>Harvey Ross Ball (July 10, 1921 – April 12, 2001) was an American commercial artist. He is recognized as the inventor of the popular smiley face graphic picture, which became an enduring and notable international icon. He never applied for a trademark for the iconic smiley image and only earned $45 for his efforts. Ball later founded the Harvey Ball World Smile Foundation in 1999, a non-profit charitable trust that supports children&#x27;s causes.

== Early life ==

Ball was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, by his parents Ernest G. Ball and Christine (&quot;Kitty&quot;) Ross Ball. Ball had five siblings, three younger by the names of Merrit, Virginia, and Raymond, and two older by the names of Jessie and Ernest Jr. Ball was a student at South High School where he started to take an interest in art. During high school, he worked as an apprentice under a local sign painter who started teaching him different styles and techniques of graphic design. After high school and his apprenticeship, he later went to Worcester Art Museum School where he studied fine arts. After his time at Worcester Art Museum School, Ball decided to go into the National Guard, where he served for 27 years. He was stationed in the Pacific and Asia during World War 2.

== State Mutual and the creation of The Smiley ==

After World War II, Ball worked for a local advertising firm until he started his own business, Harvey Ball Advertising, in 1959. He designed the smiley in 1963.

The State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester, Massachusetts (now known as Hanover Insurance) had purchased Guarantee Mutual Company of Ohio. The merger resulted in low employee morale. In an attempt to solve this, Ball was employed in 1963 as a freelance artist, to come up with an image to increase morale. Ball started with a sunny-yellow circle containing a smile, however wasn&#x27;t happy that it could be turned upside down to make a frown. By adding two eyes, he created a smiley face. The whole drawing took 10 minutes to complete, and earned him $45.

State Mutual had planned to hand out 100 button pins containing the design, however demand quickly soared. The aim was to get employees to smile while using the phone and doing other tasks. Research has since taken place confirming Ball&#x27;s instincts. The buttons became popular, with orders being taken in lots of 10,000. More than 50 million smiley face buttons had been sold by 1971, and the smiley has been described as an international icon.

By 1971 the smiley face was everywhere, so Ball contacted patent attorneys, who told him the design was now in the public domain. Ball said: &quot;It never bothered me. I figured if I make the world a little happier, OK, fine&quot;. Ball&#x27;s son, Charles, is reported to have said his father never regretted not registering the copyright. Telegram &amp; Gazette reported Charles Ball as saying &quot;he was not a money-driven guy, he used to say, &#x27;Hey, I can only eat one steak at a time, drive one car at a time.&#x27;&quot;

Note that similar other designs had existed for a long time. For example, see the backs of the &quot;flower&quot; headdresses on the dancers in the &quot;Cakewalk&quot; dance scene in the 1943 film, &quot;Stormy Weather.&quot;

== Popularity of the smiley ==
The phrase &quot;Have a happy day&quot; became associated with the smiley although it was not part of Ball&#x27;s original design. Philadelphian brothers Bernard and Murray Spain designed and sold products with the phrase and logo in the early 1970s. They trademarked the combination and later changed the phrase to &quot;Have a nice day&quot;, which itself has become a phrase in everyday use in North America.

The smiley was introduced to France in 1972 as a signal of a good news story in the newspaper &quot;France-Soir&quot;. Frenchman Franklin Loufrani used the image this way and made swift moves to trademark the image. As of 2013, the company turns over $100 million a year and became embroiled in a copyright dispute with Walmart over the image in the 1990s.

The BBC broadcast a radio documentary on February 4, 2012, called &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; that covered the story of the smiley.

== Promotion ==

On July 18, 1998, around the 35th anniversary of the design&#x27;s inception, Ball appeared at That&#x27;s Entertainment to meet fans and sign smiley pins and art. At this appearance Ball was shown copies of the graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot; issue number 1, which featured a notorious image of a smiley face with a splatter of blood across it. Store Manager Ken Carson was quoted as saying Ball seemed amused to see it on the cover.

== World Smile Foundation ==

Ball founded the World Smile Foundation in 1999, a non-profit charitable trust that supports children&#x27;s causes. The group licenses Smileys and organizes World Smile Day, which takes place on the first Friday of October each year and is a day dedicated to &quot;good cheer and good works&quot;. The catchphrase for the day is: &quot;Do an act of kindness – help one person smile.&quot;

== Later life, death and legacy ==

After his first military years with the National Guard, he served another 6 years in the Army Reserves and retired as a full colonel in 1979. A major accolade that he was granted after his service was the Bronze Medal for his acts of heroism during the Battle of Okinawa. Ball was a decorated, respected veteran. 

Ball died on April 12, 2001, as a result of liver failure following a short illness. He was 79. He left behind his wife of 54 years, Winifred Trudell, and four children.

The land that was owned by the Ball family, off Granite Street in Worcester, was purchased by the City of Worcester in June 2007, with help from Mass Audubon and a $500,000 grant from the state Executive Office of Environmental Affairs&#x27; Division of Conservation Services. This property links Mass Audubon&#x27;s Broad Meadow Brook Sanctuary with the developing Blackstone River Bikeway. It is now known as the &quot;Harvey Ball Conservation Area&quot; and is home to the appropriately named &quot;Smiley Face Trail&quot;.

== Distinguishing features of Ball&#x27;s smiley face ==
A Harvey Ball smiley face can be identified by three distinguishing features: Narrow oval eyes (with the one on the right slightly larger than the one on the left), a bright sunny yellow color, and a mouth that is not a perfect arc, which has been claimed to be similar to a &quot;Mona Lisa Mouth&quot;. The face has creases at the sides of the mouth, and the mouth is slightly off-center (with the right side a little higher than the left) and the right side of the mouth is slightly thicker than on the left.

<text>Oberammergau is a municipality in the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Bavaria, Germany. The small town on the Ammer River is known for its woodcarvers and woodcarvings, for its NATO School, and around the world for its 380-year tradition of mounting Passion Plays.

==History==
===Passion Play===

The Oberammergau Passion Play was first performed in 1634. According to local legend, the play is performed every ten years because of a vow made by the inhabitants of the village that if God spared them from the effects of the bubonic plague then sweeping the region, they would perform a passion play every ten years. A man traveling back to the town for Christmas allegedly brought the plague with him by accident. The man purportedly died from the plague and it began spreading throughout Oberammergau. After the vow was made, according to tradition, not another inhabitant of the town died from the plague. All of the town members that were still suffering from the plague are said to have recovered.

The play is now performed in years ending with a zero, as well as in 1934 which was the 300th anniversary and 1984 which was the 350th anniversary (though the 1920 performance was postponed to 1922 due to postwar economic conditions, and the 1940 performance was cancelled due to the onset of the Second World War in 1939). The 2020 was postponed to 2022 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. It involves over 2,000 actors, singers, instrumentalists and technicians, all residents of the village.

==Geography==
===Tongue-twister===
The name of the village (as well as that of neighbouring Unterammergau) appears in a well-known German tongue-twister, often sung as a round:

* &quot;German:&quot; Heut&#x27; kommt der Hans zu mir, / freut sich die Lies. / Ob er aber über Oberammergau, / oder aber über Unterammergau, / oder aber überhaupt nicht kommt, / das ist net g&#x27;wiß!
* &quot;English:&quot; Hans will come join with me, / rejoices Lies (Lies is most likely the shortened form (pet name) of the name Elizabeth). / If he comes by way of Oberammergau / or by way of Unterammergau, / or if at &quot;all&quot; he comes, / that is not sure!

==Economy==
=== Tourism ===

About half the inhabitants of Oberammergau took part in the once-a-decade Passion Play in 2010.

Over 2,000 villagers performed the story of the Passion of Jesus for the audiences from around the world. This was a labor-intensive community enterprise, in which only natives of the village could participate. Performances have taken place between mid-May and early October.

The play has a major economic impact on Oberammergau. There is a local expression &quot;Die Passion zahlt&quot; (&quot;The Passion Play will pay for it&quot;) in explaining how the Oberammergau community financed construction of a new community swimming pool, community centre, and other civic improvements. Since 1930, the number of visitors has ranged from 420,000 to 530,000. Most tickets are sold as part of a package with one or two nights&#x27; accommodation.

===Traditional art===
The village is also known as the home of a long tradition of woodcarving; the Bavarian State Woodcarving School is located there. Among the celebrated former students is the German artist Wolfram Aichele. His processional church staff depicting Christ on a donkey can be seen in the church of St Peter and St Paul. The streets of central Oberammergau are home to dozens of woodcarver shops, with pieces ranging from religious subjects, to toys, to humorous portraits.

Oberammergau is also famous for its &quot;Lüftlmalerei,&quot; or frescoes, of traditional Bavarian themes, fairy tales, religious scenes or architectural &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; found on many homes and buildings. Lüftlmalerei is common in Upper Bavaria and its name may be derived from an Oberammergau house called &quot;Zum Lüftl&quot;, which was the home of facade painter Franz Seraph Zwinck (1748–1792).

The village is also known for its religious art. A wooden statue of Our Lady of Good Voyage from Oberammergau stands in the Seaport Shrine in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Transport==
Oberammergau lies near the Bundesstraße 23, part of the &quot;Deutsche Alpenstrasse&quot; route. Its single-track, single platform railway station is the terminus of the Ammergau Railway. Several Aerial lifts climb the nearby mountains.

==Military==
The Conrad von Hötzendorf Kaserne was built just east of the village in 1935–37 as a base for the signals detachment (&quot;Gebirgs-Nachrichten-Abteilung 54)&quot; of the Mountain Brigade. In October 1943, the barracks were taken over by the Messerschmitt company as a research and development site; of tunnels were bored into the neighboring Laber mountain for engine production facilities, and a winter sports hotel was also taken over. In all, Messerschmitt had 500 employees in the design department and about 1,300 more in the factory. At the end of the Second World War, the Messerschmitt design department was visited by both U.S. and British scientific missions, as well as by teams from Bell (who stayed for five weeks) and de Havilland. Among the German staff interviewed by the Fedden Mission were Woldemar Voigt, Messerschmitt&#x27;s chief designer, Hans Hornung, and Joseph Helmschrott.

After the war, the Americans occupied the kaserne, renaming it Hawkins Barracks and making it the primary facility of U.S. Army School Europe; over the next three decades schools in specialties ranging from military police to nuclear weapons handling were located there. The base reverted to German Army control and its original name in 1974.

NATO School, formerly NATO Weapons Systems School, the alliance&#x27;s principal training and education facility on the operational level, has been located at Hawkins Barracks/Hötzendorf Kaserne since 1953.

<doc id="291284" wikidata="Q2008913" url="?curid=291284" title="Oberammergau Passion Play">
<text>The Oberammergau Passion Play () is a passion play that has been performed every 10 years from 1634 to 1674 and each decadal year since 1680 (with a few exceptions) by the inhabitants of the village of Oberammergau, Bavaria, Germany. It was written by Othmar Weis, J A Daisenberger, Otto Huber, Christian Stuckl, Rochus Dedler, Eugen Papst, Marcus Zwink, Ingrid H Shafer, and the inhabitants of Oberammergau, with music by Dedler. Since its first production it has been performed on open-air stages in the village. The text of the play is a composite of four distinct manuscripts dating from the 15th and 16th centuries.

The play is a staging of Jesus&#x27; passion, covering the short final period of His life from His visit to Jerusalem and leading to His execution by crucifixion. It is the earliest continuous survivor of the age of Christian religions vernacular drama.

==Background==
===Vow===

According to legend:
an outbreak of bubonic plague devastated Bavaria during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). Bad Kohlgrub was so depopulated that only two married couples remained alive. The village of Oberammergau remained plague-free until 25 September 1633, when a man named Kaspar Schisler returned home after working in the nearby village of Eschenlohe. Over the next 33 days, 81 villagers would die, half of Oberammergau&#x27;s population. On 28 October 1633, the villagers vowed that if God spared them from the plague, they would perform a play every 10 years depicting the life and death of Jesus. Nobody died of plague in Oberammergau after that vow, and the villagers kept their word to God by performing the passion play for the first time in 1634.

The legend is a distorted account of the actual plague. There was an outbreak of plague in Oberammergau, but it took place from September 1632 to March 1633, when there were a total of 84 deaths from all causes. Deaths followed an epidemic curve instead of ending suddenly. There was one death in September 1632, rising to 20 deaths in March 1633, and ending with one death in July 1633. There is also no record of a man named Kaspar Schisler. Only two couples got married in Bad Kohlgrub in 1634, instead of only two couples surviving the plague. There were 39 marriages in Bad Kohlgrub in 1635, so hundreds of villagers must have survived.

The errors may have been introduced by the retelling of an oral history that was not written down until 1733. The original work has been lost, and only fragments of the oral history survive as quotations in other works. The legend is told in the play &quot;The Plague of 1633&quot; (), which used to be performed the year before the Passion Play. It was retold as recently as the 1999 vow ceremony, which marked the beginning of rehearsals for the 2000 play. The town of Oberammergau now claims that Kaspar Schisler came home for a church festival in 1632 instead of 1633.

===Performance===

The production involves over 2,000 people: actors, musicians, stage technicians, and others, all residents of the village. The play comprises spoken dramatic text, musical and choral accompaniment and &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;, which are scenes from the Old Testament depicted for the audience by motionless actors accompanied by verbal description. These scenes are the basis for the typology, the interrelationship between the Old and New Testaments, of the play. They include a scene of King Ahasuerus rejecting Vashti in favor of Esther, the brothers selling Joseph into slavery in Egypt, and Moses raising up the nehushtan (bronze serpent) in the wilderness. Each scene precedes that section of the play that is considered to be prefigured by the scene. The three &quot;tableaux&quot; mentioned are presented to the audience as prefiguring Christianity superseding Judaism, Judas selling information on the location of Jesus, and the crucifixion of Jesus.

The evolution of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the Easter Play, originating in the ritual of the Latin Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on Good Friday should be sung in parts divided among various persons.

==Plot synopsis==
Prelude

The prologue and chorus greet the audience. Two tableaux are presented. In the first, Adam and Eve, wearing sheepskins are banished from the Garden of Eden by a winged angel who holds a sword in the form of a flame. Behind the angel stands a burst of gilded rays symbolizing the tree of forbidden fruit. The second living picture traditionally showed a number of girls and smaller children surrounding a cross at center stage. The adoration represents the time in 1633 when villagers swore their vow before a huge crucifix bearing a twelve-foot-high Jesus.

Act 1
&quot;Jesus and the Money Changers.&quot; Jesus enters Jerusalem on a donkey to the shouts and exultation of the people on Palm Sunday. He drives the money changers and traders from the Second Temple then returns to Bethany.

Act 2
&quot;Conspiracy of the High Council.&quot; In the past, this act began with a tableau showing the sons of the patriarch Jacob conspiring to kill Joseph in the Plain of Dothan; the frieze was deleted from the 1980 presentation. The act consists of discussions between the traders and Sanhedrin, who agree that Jesus must be arrested to preserve Mosaic law.

Act 3
&quot;Parting at Bethany.&quot; Two tableaux presage the action. In the first, the young Tobias departs from his parents while the angel Raphael, played by another boy, waits, crook in hand, stage left. In the second, the loving bridesmaid from the Song of Solomon laments the loss of her groom. In the play, Christ is anointed by Mary Magdalene, then takes leave of his mother and friends. Judas is angered by the waste of the spikenard oil.

Act 4
&quot;The Last Journey to Jerusalem.&quot; A controversial tableau (now deleted) showed Queen Vashti dishonored at the court of King Ahasuerus. The old queen (Judaism, explains the Prologue) has been displaced by Esther (Christianity). Jesus sends two disciples to secure a Paschal lamb. He enters Jerusalem for the last time and weeps over the fate of the city. Judas contemplates betraying his master and is tempted by Dathan and other merchants.

Act 5
&quot;The Last Supper.&quot; The Passover Seder or Last Supper is celebrated in a scene evocative of the famous Da Vinci painting. Jesus washes the feet of his disciples and institutes the mass with wine and thick, brown, leavened bread. Two tableaux show Moses with rays or horns protruding from his head, bringing manna and grapes to the people in the wilderness.

Act 6
&quot;The Betrayer.&quot; In a tableau, Joseph, a boy nude to the waist, is sold by his brothers to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver. In accompanying action, Judas appears before the Sanhedrin and promises to deliver Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. After his departure, the Pharisees plan at great length the death of Jesus.

Act 7
&quot;Jesus at the Mount of Olives.&quot; Two more Old Testament scenes introduce the soliloquy of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. The first, a non-sequitur, which we are told explains that man must earn his food by the sweat of his brow, shows Adam, in sheepskin and assisted by a brood of similarly attired children, drawing a plow across a field. The second frieze more appropriately offers a helmeted Joab, surrounded by soldiers stabbing an unsuspecting Amasa in the ribs. Christ agonizes over his fate while his apostles doze. Judas enters with an armed band and betrays Jesus with a kiss.

Act 8
&quot;Jesus before Annas.&quot; The Old Testament parallel has Micah slapped on the cheek by Zedekiah, priest of Baal, for daring to predict King Ahab would die in battle. In like manner, Jesus is taken before a waiting, eager Annas and is struck on the face for his insolence. Soldiers also deride Christ as he is led through the streets by a rope.

Act 9
&quot;Condemned by the High Council.&quot; Two more tableaux emphasize the humiliation of Christ. In one, the aged Naboth is condemned by false witnesses and is stoned to death by the sons of Jezebel. In the other, Job, sitting on a dunghill is railed at by his friends, servants, even his wife and children. Meanwhile, Jesus is questioned by Caiaphas about his messiah-ship and is condemned. A tortured Judas tries to get the Sanhedrin to repeal its verdict. When his efforts prove unsuccessful, he tosses the money back at them and storms off.

Act 10
&quot;Despair of Judas.&quot; Judas and all who identify with him are linked with Cain in the opening tableau. The battered body of Abel appears at center stage. To the right is Cain, clad in a leopard skin and holding a club in one hand. His other hand is at his brow, attempting to conceal the brand of God. In this short act Judas offers a speech of remorse then hangs himself.

Act 11
&quot;Christ before Pilate.&quot; Originally there was a frieze that heralded Christ&#x27;s first appearance before Pilate. The tableau of Daniel in the great pillared hall of Darius was deleted from later twentieth-century productions. Pilate&#x27;s interrogation, coupled with news of his wife&#x27;s dream, convinces the governor that Jesus should be prosecuted by Herod Antipas for lese majesty.

Act 12
&quot;Christ Before Herod.&quot; The scene stands without the original living picture which showed a blinded Samson mocked by the Philistines. Herod treats Christ with scorn, demanding a miracle, then sends him back to Pilate, cloaked in a red mantle of royalty. Responding to the urging of the Sanhedrin, Pilate reluctantly agrees to have Jesus scourged. Roman guards beat Jesus and press a crown of thorns into his scalp.

Act 13
&quot;Christ Sentenced to Death on the Cross.&quot; Two graphic pictures showing the presentation of Joseph&#x27;s bloodied coat to Jacob, and Abraham about to stab Isaac on Mt. Moriah have been rejected from contemporary versions of the Passion. Retained, however, are tableaux which show Joseph riding a sedan chair as vizir of Egypt and another which supposedly represents the scapegoat offering of Yom Kippur. Following the tableaux, the stage is swarming with action as priests and Pharisees bring mobs from every direction. Pilate gives Jesus another hearing then offers the people a choice between Jesus and Barabbas. They demand and receive a final judgement on Christ.

Act 14
&quot;The Way of the Cross.&quot; The final segment of the Passion is introduced by a more sublime image of the &quot;Akedah,&quot; or binding of Isaac. In this tableau, the boy, like Jesus, carries wood on his back as he and Abraham climb Mt. Moriah. Another frieze, showing Moses and a bronze serpent intertwined about the cross has been deleted. When the chorus withdraws from the stage Christ bears his cross to Golgotha. As he passes through the streets he encounters his mother, Veronica, and Simon of Cyrene. The women of Jerusalem weep for him.

Act 15
&quot;Jesus on Calvary.&quot; For the first time the chorus appears in black traditional mourning garb. There is no tableau. He is mocked by members of the Sanhedrin and the soldiers and utters his last words. The legs of the criminals are broken. A soldier pierces the side of Christ with a lance and blood gushes forth. Jesus&#x27; followers slowly and reverently take down the body and lay it before his mother in a replica of the Pieta. The Sanhedrin insists that guards be posted before the tomb which is to hold Christ&#x27;s body.

Act 16
&quot;Resurrection and Apotheosis.&quot; For the first time, action precedes a tableau. Roman guards see a light at the tomb. Mary Magdalene and the other women encounter an angel and recite the same lines as &quot;Quem Quaeritis.&quot; The final tableau shows Jesus resplendent in white with his apostles, angels, the Virgin Mary, and Moses. The Passion ends with a proclamation by the chorus.

==Length==
The running time has varied due to the many revisions that have taken place through the years. In 2010 it had a running time of 5 hours, beginning at 2:30 pm and ending at 10:00 pm, with a meal break. It was staged a total of 102 days and ran from May 15 until October 3 that year. According to a record from 1930, the play then had running time of approximately seven hours. It started at 8:00 am and ended at 5:00 pm with a meal break. Audiences come from all over the world, often on package tours, the first instituted in 1870. Admission fees were first charged in 1790. Since 1930, the number of visitors has ranged from 420,000 to 530,000. Most tickets are sold as part of a package with one or two nights&#x27; accommodation.

==Frequency==

The play is performed every ten years. From 1634 to 1674, it was performed in years ending in 4. Since 1680, it has been performed in years ending in the digit zero. There have been several cancellations and off-cycle performances.

== The Passion Play Theatre ==


Oberammergau&#x27;s original parish church proved to be far too small for performances of the Passion Play, so it was decided to hold the Play in the graveyard of the church, before the graves of the villagers who had died in the plague.

The fame of the Play must have spread quickly to the surrounding towns and villages for as early as 1674 records show that seats were to be provided for the audience.

Over the following years, sets and stage mechanics were added to the simple wooden stage structure. By the middle of the 18th century, it was obvious that the graveyard was also too small and a new venue was found on a field close by; however, the stage had to be specially built every year of the Play.

The first permanent stage seems to have been built in 1815 to a design by the then-local parish priest. In 1830 he was asked to help build a new, larger stage on the site of the present theatre. When it rained the audience got wet: umbrellas would have obscured the view of people sitting behind them.

However, in 1890 a new, purpose-built theatre was built and, apart from some of the scenes on the side of the stage, it would have looked much as it does today. It was ready in time for the 1900 performance, with the six-arched hall capable of holding over 4000 spectators.

The theatre was enlarged in time for the 1930 and 1934 seasons and whilst it was considered ugly and uncomfortable it was praised for its superb acoustics and sight of the stage.

Following the 1990 production both the interior and façade of the theatre were renovated and the stage mechanics modernised.

It has now been transformed – new more comfortable seating has been installed along with under-floor heating; cloakrooms have been extended; the foyer made accessible for wheelchair users; exhibition areas added; safety and toilet facilities improved. In 2010 a retractable glass roof was installed over the stage, which before then had been open to precipitation.

Today the theatre can seat an audience of over 4700.

==Antisemitism==

Previous versions of the play were considered antisemitic in character, blaming the Jews for the &quot;murder&quot; of Christ. Adolf Hitler indicated, according to Abe Foxman, approval of these allegedly anti-Semitic elements in the Oberammergau Passion Play.

The play had been largely based on a mid-19th century version edited by pastor Alois Daisenberger. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the passion play came under increasing pressure from American Jews because of its anti-Semitic elements. In 1950, playwright Arthur Miller and composer Leonard Bernstein led a petition to cancel the passion play. However, the townspeople defiantly restaged the 1934 play. In the 1960s, Heinrich Böll, Günter Grass, Paul Celan, and other prominent intellectuals called for a boycott due to the play&#x27;s antisemitism. In the 1970s, Oberammergau invited representatives from Jewish organizations to revise the play, and revisions were approved by a Christian theological advisor. However, only minor revisions were made in the 1980 play. Change finally came in 1986, when generational turnover in the Community Council resulted in the 24-year-old Christian Stückl becoming director. Stückl narrowly outlasted an attempt by conservative members of the Community Council to fire him in 1989. Stückl, alongside dramaturgist Otto Huber, made considerable changes to the 1990 version to remove antisemitism from the text. The most radical changes came in 2000, when the story was reinterpreted as an inter-Jewish conflict, with some Jews supporting and others opposing the crucifixion of Jesus. Muslims, whose religion was not founded until six centuries after the events of the Passion occurred, were allowed to perform in the Passion Play for the first time in 2000.

A 2010 review in the Jewish newspaper &quot;The Forward&quot; stated: &quot;It is undeniably true that the play was virulently antisemitic through most of its history, and that it gained an extra dose of notoriety after Hitler endorsed the 1934 production.&quot; The review noted that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) stated that the play &quot;continues to transmit negative stereotypes of Jews&quot; and that even the Catholic Church demanded changes to the play, to bring it more in line with church policies expressed by the Second Vatican Council, 1962–1965, in the Apostolic Constitution, &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, 4, October 28, 1965 (&quot;[T]he Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God as if this followed from Sacred Scripture&quot;). 2000 and 2010 director Christian Stückl told &quot;The Forward&quot; that Jesus &quot;lived as a Jew.&quot; Therefore, in the revised play, Jesus and his disciples pray in Hebrew. After viewing the play, the reviewer was sympathetic to its artistry and felt less offended by its message than by &quot;Wagner&#x27;s antisemitic caricatures and religious mysticism&quot;. Nonetheless, the review quoted a report from the Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations, which reviewed the 2010 script and objected that the play still makes use of &quot;elements that are historically dubious&quot; from the Gospels. The review stated that &quot;It seems unfair&quot; to accuse the play of anti-semitism when it recounts material in Christianity&#x27;s sacred texts and noted that the ADL&#x27;s national director Abe Foxman had said that if the play is &quot;about a Crucifixion in which the Jews kill Christ, you can never clean it up enough&quot; to avoid an anti-semitic message.

For the 2022 play, the American Jewish Committee convened an Academic Advisory Group led by their Director of Interreligious and 
Relations, composed of experts in the play, Christian-Jewish relations, New Testament studies, and German-Jewish relations. This group was created to recommend, through ongoing dialogue, paths by which the play&#x27;s leadership can further advance a decades-long process to rid the play of any lingering anti-Jewish tropes. AJC has described the collaborative process with the Oberammergau community as productive: “The Oberammergau leadership desire for ongoing improvement is genuine,” even as “there remain concerns about points within the play that do not properly reflect&quot; the range of first century Jewish opinion on Jesus&#x27;s leadership. This reflects both the historic progress in Christian-Jewish relations in the past decades and also lingering tensions over the anti-Jewish implications of certain traditional Christian interpretations of the Gospels’ narratives of Jesus&#x27;s conviction and execution. 

The changes to the play since World War II have included the manner in which the play presents the charge of deicide, collective guilt, supersessionism and typology, as well as the following:

*the role of the Temple traders has been reduced;
*the &quot;Rabbi&quot; character has been eliminated and his lines given to another character;
*Jewish priests no longer wear horn shaped hats;
*Jesus has been addressed as Rabbi Yeshua;
*Jesus and others speak fragments of Hebrew prayers in the play;
*Jews are shown disputing with others about theological aspects of Judaism, not just about Jesus;
*Pilate has been made to appear more tyrannical and threatens Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest, and it is made clear that Caiaphas does not speak for all the Jews;
*Romans now stand guard at the gates when Jesus makes his entrance to Jerusalem;
*Jesus&#x27; supporters have been added to the screaming crowd outside Pilate&#x27;s palace;
*Judas is portrayed as being duped into betraying Jesus;
*removing the line &quot;His blood is upon us and also upon our children&#x27;s children&quot; (from Matthew 27:25), and &quot;Ecce homo&quot; (Behold [only] a man);
*Peter, when questioned by Nathaniel regarding abandoning Judaism replies, &quot;No! We don&#x27;t want that! Far be it from us to abandon Moses and his law&quot;; and
*at the Last Supper Jesus recites the blessing over the wine in Hebrew. although Jesus actually spoke Aramaic.

===Nazi support of 1934 play===

The special jubilee season of the Oberammergau Passion Play in 1934, marking the 300th anniversary of the original vow to stage the play every ten years thereafter, was the first and only performance after the Nazi regime&#x27;s rise to power the previous year. Among other things, the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda ordered the official poster for the jubilee season amended to include the message &quot;Deutschland ruft dich!&quot; (&quot;Germany is calling you!&quot;), and the &quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; scheme&#x27;s discount-travel programme offered special cut-rate packages for the Passion Play, including train fare, tickets and accommodations.

Official propaganda described the Passion Play as &quot;peasant drama ... inspired by the consecrating power of the soil&quot;, and Hitler attended a performance. An attempt to rewrite the Passion Play script to bring it into line with Nazi ideology was rejected, however, by the more conservative element.

==Catholic Church certification==
&quot;Missio Canonica&quot; is a canonical certification necessary for preaching. In 19th-century Germany, it was extended to teaching as well. In 1922 the Catholic Church gave the play a &quot;Missio Canonica&quot;. It is a certification that the beliefs of the Catholic Church are being taught or, in this case, being presented.

<text>HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; was a British nuclear-powered fleet submarine which served in the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1990. She was the third submarine of her class, following the earlier and , all designed to face the Soviet threat at sea. She was built by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead.

&quot;Conqueror&quot; the only nuclear-powered submarine to have engaged an enemy ship with torpedoes, sinking the cruiser &quot;General Belgrano&quot; during the 1982 Falklands War.

==Construction==
&quot;Conqueror&quot; was ordered on 9 August 1966 and was laid down at Cammell Laird&#x27;s Birkenhead shipyard on 5 December 1967; she was launched on 28 August 1969. Construction was delayed by slow working by Cammell Laird&#x27;s workforce, and sabotage of the ship&#x27;s gearbox, which delayed completion by several months. &quot;Conqueror&quot; was finally commissioned on 9 November 1971; she was the last nuclear submarine built by Cammell Laird.

==Operational history==
===Falklands War===
&quot;Conqueror&quot;, commanded by Commander Chris Wreford-Brown, was deployed during the Falklands War, setting sail from Faslane Naval Base on the Gareloch in Scotland on 3 April 1982, one day after the Argentine invasion. &quot;Conqueror&quot; arrived in the exclusion zone around the Falkland Islands 21 days later and was ordered to scan the area for Argentine shipping, particularly the aircraft carrier &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; (&quot;25th of May&quot;).

On 30 April she detected, at a range of on long range sonar, a task force of the Armada de la República Argentina (ARA-Argentine Navy). The taskforce was composed of the WWII-era ex-USN light cruiser &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, and two destroyers, ARA &quot;Piedra Buena&quot; and ARA &quot;Bouchard&quot; (both also ex-United States Navy vessels). &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was originally commissioned in 1944 but significantly modernised in 1960–62 with SPS 40 LRAW radar and SQS29 sonar. By the early 1980s the ARA were no longer receiving parts from the USA to maintain these systems, but the destroyers had recently been re-armed with French Exocet anti-ship missiles. The missiles were a real threat, unlike the 6-inch (150 mm) guns on &quot;General Belgrano&quot; which only had a range of . The task force was sailing southwest of the Falklands, just outside the exclusion zone imposed by the British on all shipping. With &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; approaching the islands from the north, the commander of the British carrier battle group in the South Atlantic, Rear Admiral &quot;Sandy&quot; Woodward, feared a pincer attack, with &quot;General Belgrano&quot; attacking from the south and &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; from the north. Woodward requested permission from his superiors to sink &quot;General Belgrano&quot;.

After some debate, permission to engage &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was sent to the submarine from the Commander-in-Chief Fleet and Task Force commander, Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, at the Royal Navy&#x27;s command centre in Northwood in the United Kingdom. In the intervening period, &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had retired from her attack position and turned west, since &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was not yet ready to engage the British fleet. This would cause some controversy, although &quot;General Belgrano&quot;″s captain and the Argentine government acknowledged that the attack was a legitimate act of war.

On 2 May &quot;Conqueror&quot; became the first nuclear-powered submarine to sink an enemy surface ship using torpedoes, launching three Mark 8 torpedoes at &quot;General Belgrano&quot; and the destroyers, two of which struck the ship and exploded. Twenty minutes later, the ship was sinking rapidly and was abandoned by her crew. &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was unable to issue a Mayday signal because of electrical failure; this and poor visibility meant the two escorting destroyers were unaware of the sinking until some hours later. A total of 323 men were killed.

Adding to the confusion, the crew of &quot;Bouchard&quot; felt an impact that was the third torpedo striking or exploding in proximity to the hull, inflicting more than minor damage with 4 gashes in the hull (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. At the time, &quot;Conqueror&quot;″s officers believed they were under attack and continued to regard the two Argentine destroyers as a serious threat to the British task force and later returned to search for the Argentine warships with the aim of sinking the destroyers rather than searching for &quot;Belgrano&quot; survivors. By the time the Argentine destroyers realised that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had actually foundered it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts. The sinking shocked the Argentine people and the ruling dictatorship.

&quot;Conqueror&quot;″s war did not end there. The crew of the submarine had to face the Argentine Air Force which located the submarine&#x27;s wake and her raised periscope on 7 May, apparently from a C130 Hercules overhead at peak light, of midday in the short Falklands sub-Antarctic day; the Argentine Air Force may have attacked the submarine then or later with US-type air-launched anti-submarine torpedoes in the days after the attack. &quot;Conqueror&quot; did not fire again for the remainder of the war, but helped the task force by using sophisticated monitoring equipment to track Argentine aircraft departing from the mainland.

After the war, &quot;Conqueror&quot; returned to Faslane, flying a Jolly Roger, a customary act of Royal Navy submarines after a kill. The flag, now in the Royal Navy Submarine Museum at Gosport, featured an atom for &quot;Conqueror&quot; being the only nuclear submarine with a kill, crossed torpedoes for the type of weapon used, a dagger indicating a cloak-and-dagger operation, and the outline of a cruiser for what kind of ship was sunk. When asked about the incident later, Commander Wreford-Brown responded, &quot;The Royal Navy spent thirteen years preparing me for such an occasion. It would have been regarded as extremely dreary if I had fouled it up&quot;.

===Operation Barmaid===
Later in 1982, &quot;Conqueror&quot; completed a raid to acquire a Soviet passive towed sonar array from its Polish-flagged towing vessel. The operation, a joint mission between British and American forces, was conducted on the boundary of Soviet territorial waters. &quot;Conqueror&quot; used cutters affixed to her bow to shear through the thick wire before silently returning to her base on the Clyde.

===Collision===
On 2 July 1988 &quot;Conqueror&quot; was involved in a collision with the Army Sail Training Association yacht &quot;Dalriada&quot; south of the Mull of Kintyre. The yacht sank and four crew members were rescued.

===Decommissioning===

&quot;Conqueror&quot; was decommissioned in 1990 and the periscopes, captain&#x27;s cabin and main control panel from the submarine&#x27;s control room, and the Jolly Roger flag flown, are on display in the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport. , &quot;Conqueror&quot; is one of over 20 nuclear submarines still held in storage by the Ministry of Defence, awaiting final disposal.

<doc id="291297" wikidata="Q898703" url="?curid=291297" title="T-Stoff">
<text>T-Stoff (; &#x27;substance T&#x27;) was a stabilised high test peroxide used in Germany during World War II. T-Stoff was specified to contain 80% (occasionally 85%) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), remainder water, with traces (&lt;0.1%) of stabilisers. Stabilisers used included 0.0025% phosphoric acid, a mixture of phosphoric acid, sodium phosphate and 8-oxyquinoline, and sodium stannate.

== Uses ==
The decomposition of T-Stoff into hot steam and oxygen caused by the addition of the catalyst Z-Stoff (an aqueous solution of permanganates) was used to drive the split-tube steam catapults which launched the V-1 flying bomb.

Similarly generated steam was used to drive the turbopump in the German V2 rocket, and the pumps in several other rocket engines. The turbopump was used to transport fuel and oxidizer liquids under pressure to the rocket engine of the V2.

Another of T-Stoff&#x27;s many uses was to be combined as the oxidizer, with C-Stoff (methanol–hydrazine–water mixture) as the fuel, in the bipropellant Walter HWK 109-509 engine of the Messerschmitt Me 163 and Messerschmitt Me 263, at a ratio of approximately 3.1 parts T-Stoff oxidizer to one part C-Stoff fuel. Because the two substances were so visually similar, a complex testing system was developed to make sure that each propellant was put into the correct tanks of the Messerschmitt Me 163. This was because T-Stoff and C-Stoff are hypergolic propellants: they spontaneously ignite when mixed at normal temperatures. Even slight contamination between the T-Stoff oxidizer and the C-Stoff fuel was likely to cause an explosion.

Catalytic decomposition of T-Stoff by Z-Stoff was also used as a monopropellant in several &quot;cold&quot; Walter rocket engines, including early versions of the engine for the Me 163A, and rocket-assisted takeoff pack engines like the Walter HWK 109-500.

== Precautions ==
Because of its extreme oxidizing potential, T-Stoff was a very dangerous chemical to handle, so special rubberized suits were required when working with it, as it would react with most cloth, leather, or other combustible material and cause it to spontaneously combust. T-Stoff corroded iron and steel, and thus had to be kept in aluminium tanks. Conversely, C-Stoff ate through aluminium and had to be kept in glass or enamel. T-Stoff containers were white, C-Stoff containers were yellow. The tanker trucks carrying T-Stoff and C-Stoff, clearly marked &quot;T&quot; and &quot;C&quot; were forbidden to come within 800 meters of each other.

<doc id="291301" wikidata="Q7182755" url="?curid=291301" title="Philadelphia nativist riots">
<text>The Philadelphia nativist riots (also known as the Philadelphia Prayer Riots, the Bible Riots and the Native American Riots) were a series of riots that took place on May 68 and July 67, 1844, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States and the adjacent districts of Kensington and Southwark. The riots were a result of rising anti-Catholic sentiment at the growing population of Irish Catholic immigrants. The government brought in over a thousand militia—they confronted the nativist mobs and killed or wounded hundreds of anti-Catholic rioters.

In the five months leading to the riots, nativist groups had been spreading a false rumor that Catholics were trying to remove the Bible from public schools. A nativist rally in Kensington erupted in violence on May 6 and started a deadly riot that would result in the destruction of two Catholic churches and numerous other buildings. Riots erupted again in July after it was discovered that St. Philip Neri&#x27;s Catholic Church in Southwark had armed itself for protection. Fierce fighting broke out between the nativists and the soldiers sent to protect the church, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Two of the 13 Catholic churches were burned. The Catholic Church sued the city and won some money for repairs. Civic leaders deplored the nativist attacks. Nationally, the riots helped fuel criticism of the nativist movement, despite denials of responsibility from nativist groups. The riots exposed deficiencies in law enforcement in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts, influencing various reforms in local police departments and the eventual consolidation of the city in 1854.

==Background==

As Philadelphia became industrialized, immigrants from Europe, mostly Ireland and Germany, settled in the city and especially in the surrounding districts. In the areas the immigrants settled, tensions that resulted from religious, economic and cultural differences grew between residents. Most new arrivals were Catholic.

Historian Elizabeth Geffen states:
Alarmed by the rising Catholic population, Protestants and native-born Americans started organizing anti-Catholic and nativist groups. On August 26, 1842, an anonymous arsonist set ablaze the bridge of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company. Immediately the responsibility was attributed to the local Irish Catholic community, sparking the founding of a Protestant Institute. The group, alongside others established in the early 1840s, distributed anti-Catholic literature and published anti-Catholic newspapers.

During the 1840s, students in Philadelphia schools began the day with reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia&#x27;s Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, wrote a letter to the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teachings while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick&#x27;s requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.

Approximately one year later, a rumor was circulated that Hugh Clark, a Catholic Kensington school director, was visiting a girls school, where he demanded that the principal stop Bible reading in school. The story also claimed that the principal refused and that she would rather lose her job. Clark denied this version of events and claimed that after finding out several students had left a Bible reading to read a different version of the Bible, he commented that if reading the Bible caused such confusion, it would be better if it were not to be read in school. Protestants claimed that Catholics, with direct influence from the Pope, were trying to remove the Bible from schools. Kenrick issued a statement asserting, &quot;It is not consistent with the laws and the discipline of the Catholic Church for her members to unite in religious exercises with those who are not of their communion.&quot;

Historian David Montgomery argues that the Irish Catholic Democrats in the city had successfully appealed to the upper-class Whig leadership. The Whigs wanted to split the Democratic coalition, so they approved Bishop Kenrick&#x27;s request that Catholic children be allowed to use their own Bible. That approval outraged the evangelical Protestant leadership, which rallied its support in Philadelphia. Montgomery states:
==May riot==
On May 3, 1844, the American Republican Party (a precursor of the American &quot;Know-Nothing&quot; Party, a Protestant nativist group, which would be founded a decade later) held a meeting in a predominantly Irish part of the Kensington District, then a suburb of Philadelphia. A group of Irish residents attacked the platform where the speakers were standing, and the nativists retreated.

On May 6, nativists returned in greater numbers. During the rally, it began to rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people in the windows of nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18-year-old leatherworker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.

The district constable was powerless to stop the violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence erupted in a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable summoning the county sheriff Morton McMichael, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, the posse arrived armed only with clubs and was powerless to do anything.
On May 7, nativists denounced Catholics and called on Americans to defend themselves from &quot;the bloody hand of the Pope.&quot; A mob marched to Kensington, where gunfire broke out between nativists and Catholics. During the riot, nativist mobs set fire to and destroyed the Hibernia fire station, thirty homes, and the market where the violence had begun the day before. Joseph Rice, described as a bystander, was shot dead; he is the only known Catholic killed. The violence did not end until the local state militia, commanded by General George Cadwalader, arrived and dispersed the crowd. Kenrick quickly issued a statement instructing Catholics to avoid violence and confrontations.

After a brief lull, the violence continued on May 8. The nativists came back to Kensington and burned down St. Michael&#x27;s Catholic Church and rectory at Second and Jefferson Streets, the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity, which had been attacked a few days before, and several homes were attacked before soldiers arrived and the fire was contained. While the riot was contained in Kensington, another nativist mob had gathered within the borders of Philadelphia itself. They gathered at St. Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Church, located on Fourth Street between Vine and New Streets. City troops were stationed by the church, and Mayor John Morin Scott pleaded for calm. The rioters threw stones at the mayor, ignored the troops, and burned down the church, cheering when the steeple fell. A nearby school with a collection of rare books was also set aflame. The rioters did not attack an unfinished German Catholic church.

During the riots, at least fourteen were killed, an estimated fifty people were injured, two hundred fled their homes, and damage totaled $150,000. This is equivalent to $ in 2016 USD.

In the days afterward, Mayor Scott set up a force to protect Catholic churches, and Bishop Kenrick ordered all churches to be closed the following Sunday to avoid any provocation and possible violence. Valuables were removed from the churches and hidden in homes for safekeeping. Bishop Kenrick asked Catholics to offer no resistance and urged them to wait for the law to deal with the rioters. However, in its June 18 report, a grand jury blamed an imperfect response by law enforcement and the Irish Catholics for the riots, stating that the outbreak of violence was due to &quot;the efforts of a portion of the community to exclude the Bible from the public schools&quot; and the disruption of legitimate meetings by immigrants.

Nativists said they were only responding to attacks and were justified in their actions but were not responsible for the riots after May 6. The American Republican Party issued a statement blaming Mayor Scott, the sheriff, and the civil authorities for the riots.

==July riot==

On July 3, Father John Patrick Dunn of the Church of St. Philip Neri in the Southwark District was warned that the church might be attacked during an upcoming parade held by the Native American Party. The Native American Party, a nativist political party, planned to hold a large parade the next day on Independence Day.

To prepare for violence, the church applied for an arsenal that a volunteer company would use in case the church was attacked. Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter authorized the formation of a company and the procurement of twenty-five muskets from the Frankford Arsenal. Major General Robert Patterson, commander of the Pennsylvania militia, put the troops on alert in case of violence.

Five of the muskets placed in St. Philip Neri&#x27;s Church were discovered to be defective and were sent back to the Frankford Arsenal to be repaired. No violence occurred before or during the parade, but on July 5, a nativist mob numbering in the thousands gathered at the church after some observed five defective muskets being returned to the church. They then demanded that the sheriff remove the weapons, while Father Dunn and volunteers rallied to protect the church. Sheriff Morton McMichael and two aldermen searched the church and removed twelve muskets. After leaving the church, the sheriff urged the crowd to disperse and left a volunteer posse to guard the church. The mob remained, and a man injured in the May riots made a speech to the crowd, calling for a second search of the church. The sheriff, an alderman, and seventeen nativists entered the church and found three armed men, fifty-three muskets, ten pistols, a keg of gunpowder and ammunition. To avoid inciting the mob, the sheriff decided not to remove the armaments, and the search party stayed in the church. Just after midnight, July 6, Major General Patterson ordered a company of city guards to clear the streets. After the crowd dispersed, the arms found within the church were removed.
By midday, the crowds returned around St. Philip Neri&#x27;s Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, but they did not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. Responding to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the crowd on Third Street. Former U.S. Congressman Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds, led by an alderman and the sheriff, returned and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people&#x27;s shoulders.

After Naylor was brought home, the mob attacked the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was brought from the wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. The crowd pelted the soldiers with rocks and some soldiers fired back, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced its way into the church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri&#x27;s, and the mob left the church.

By the evening, a large number of soldiers arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob&#x27;s cannons, soldiers charged one cannon&#x27;s position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.

At least fifteen people, including rioters and soldiers, were killed in the riot, and at least fifty people were injured. Under Governor Porter&#x27;s orders, state troops continued to arrive in the city in the days afterward, but no further violence took place. An estimated 5,000 militia were used to stop violence. Troops began to withdraw from the city on July 10, and the church took over responsibility from the district of Southwark of protecting the church on July 11. As with the May riots, a grand jury blamed the Irish Catholics for the riots, but supported the military&#x27;s response to the violence.

==Aftermath==
The riots had gained national attention and condemnation. The riots were used as an issue in the 1844 U.S. Presidential election, the Democratic Party condemning the growing Native American Party and the Whig Party, which the Democrats accused of involvement in the nativist movement. In Philadelphia, the Native American Party ended up making a strong showing in the city&#x27;s October election. In New York City, many feared that nativists would target New York City&#x27;s Catholic churches. Archbishop John Hughes organized defenders for the churches and told the mayor that if any Catholic churches were burned, &quot;New York would be another Moscow.&quot;

On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia passed an ordinance that gave the city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry, and at least one full troop of cavalry to preserve peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia&#x27;s suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.

After the riots, Bishop Kenrick ended his efforts to influence the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty and could not be property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the order had been incorporated in 1804 and were awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.

<text>C-Stoff (; &quot;substance C&quot;) was a reductant used in bipropellant rocket fuels (as a fuel itself) developed by Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft in Germany during World War II. It was developed for use with T-Stoff (a high-test peroxide) as an oxidizer, which together with C-Stoff as the fuel, forms a hypergolic mixture.

The proportions of the components in C-Stoff were developed to catalyse the decomposition of T-Stoff, promote combustion with the oxygen released by the decomposition, and sustain uniform combustion through sufficient quantity of the highly reactive hydrazine. The combination of the C-Stoff, used as a rocket fuel, with the T-Stoff used as the oxidizer, often resulted in spontaneous explosion from their combined nature as a hypergolic fuel combination, necessitating strict hygiene in fueling operations; there were numerous catastrophic explosions of the Messerschmitt Me 163 aircraft that employed this fuel system. Another hazard was toxicity to humans of each of the propellants.

== C-fuel ==
After the war, Allied studies into rocket propellants continued with engines such as the Armstrong Siddeley Beta, under the name &quot;C-fuel&quot;.

<text>Peter Richard Nichols (31 July 1927 – 7 September 2019) was an English playwright, screenwriter, director and journalist.

==Life and career==
Born in Bristol, England, he was educated at Bristol Grammar School, and served his compulsory National Service as a clerk in Calcutta and later in the British Army&#x27;s Combined Services Entertainment Unit in Singapore where he entertained the troops alongside John Schlesinger, Stanley Baxter, Peter Vaughan and Kenneth Williams, before going on to study acting at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He later claimed to have studied acting because there were no dedicated courses for playwrights. While working as a teacher, he began to write television plays that achieved notice. His first play for the stage was &quot;The Hooded Terror&quot;, part of a season of new plays at the Little Theatre in Bristol. He later wrote &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; for the stage. An early film script was &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; directed by John Boorman.

&quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; is a one-set drama in music hall style. &quot;The National Health&quot; is a fantasy farce, also interrupted by vaudeville. &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; is a musical comedy, partly inspired by Nichols&#x27;s own experiences in the Combined Services Entertainments Unit. &quot;Poppy&quot; takes the form of a Christmas pantomime.

Despite the comic style, Nichols&#x27; plays deal with the most serious of themes. In &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; the burden of raising a hopelessly handicapped child shatters a couple&#x27;s marriage. The patients of &quot;The National Health&quot; suffer and die, as do the singing soldiers of &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;. In &quot;Poppy&quot;, a pantomime take on the Chinese opium wars, Dick Whittington&#x27;s girlfriend becomes a drug addict. &quot;Passion Play&quot; (known as &quot;Passion&quot; in the United States) focuses on adultery and betrayal. In &quot;Blue Murder&quot;, a comic satire about play censorship, a constable investigates a death.

Nichols is often considered an especially autobiographical playwright, and chronicled much of the background to his plays in his published autobiography and diaries. &quot;Joe Egg&quot; is based on Nichols&#x27; own experiences of raising a handicapped child, &quot;The National Health&quot; draws on a hospital stay of his own, while &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; draws on his own military experiences.

Nichols was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to drama.

He died on 7 September 2019 in Oxford, survived by his wife Thelma and three children.

==Books==
*&quot;Feeling You&#x27;re Behind&quot;, an autobiography by Peter Nichols (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1984) 
&#x27;Whatever interest my life may have had must have been exhausted. Yet there were better reasons than vanity – I needed the advance the publishers offered, which was far more generous than any given to me for a play; the theatre itself, once so alluring, now seemed past its best, the wrinkles showing, the kisses dry and dutiful; it would be a bitter pleasure to describe my disenchantment and blame the people who&#x27;d done me down; and if I didn&#x27;t write a book about me, it was clear no one else would.&quot; Peter Nichols&#x27; preface, page xi.

*&quot;Peter Nichols: Diaries 1969–1977&quot; by Peter Nichols (Nick Hern Books, 2000) 
&quot;Did you know that Maggie Smith once accused Laurence Olivier of having &quot;a tin ear and two left feet&quot;? That&#x27;s one of many enjoyably acerbic snippets in &quot;Peter Nichols&#x27; Diaries 1969–77&quot;, a period that stretches from the composition of his &quot;The National Health&quot; to the conception of his masterpiece, &quot;Passion Play&quot;...Nichols tends to be touchy, crusty, disappointed with himself...yet wonderfully observant, honest and likeable.&quot; Benedict Nightingale, &quot;The Times&quot; 13 December 2000.

<text>Weißenfels was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the south of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from south clockwise) Burgenlandkreis, Merseburg-Querfurt and the Saxon district Leipziger Land.

== History ==
Near the small town of Goseck, archaeologists, discovered in 1999 was the oldest solar observatory in Europe, beating Stonehenge by more than 2,000 years. Around 5,000 BC, the circular trench with a diameter of 75 meters was surrounded with wood palisades, with three openings which allowed to measure the date of the spring and autumn equinox. Excavations on the site are planned to continue until 2007.

The district in today&#x27;s borders was created in 1994 when the two previous districts Weissenfels and Hohenmölsen were merged.

== Geography ==
The main river in the district is the Saale with viticulture along the river valley. In the east of the district is the lignite open pit mining area of Hohenmölsen.

In May 1992, Davidson acquired Educational Resources, Ltd.

In April 1993, the company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol &quot;DAVD&quot;. By February 1994, sales generated by the company&#x27;s software totaled to .

In March 1994, Davidson acquired Learningways, an educational software firm from Cambridge, Massachusetts, for an undisclosed sum.

On April 12, 1994, Davidson entered into two agreements with Simon &amp; Schuster to fund the development, marketing and distribution of titles for the home market. Davidson at this time also agreed to provide a minimum of $15 million of development services to Simon &amp; Schuster over the five-year period of the agreement for the development of SimonSchuster&#x27;s educational software for the school market.

In February 1995, Davidson acquired Funnybone Interactive, a developer of children&#x27;s entertainment and educational software, headquartered in Canton, Connecticut.

Davidson&#x27;s Math Blaster, Reading Blaster, Fisher Price and Syracuse Learning product lines, as well as Sierra&#x27;s Dr. Brain product line, were transferred to Knowledge Adventure. Control of Davidson&#x27;s subsidiary studios such as Funnybone Interactive was also transferred to Knowledge Adventure, with the exception of Blizzard Entertainment, which became a separate division of Cendant Software.

By December 1998, Davidson&#x27;s website would redirect to Knowledge Adventure&#x27;s website, while the Torrance, California offices of Davidson &amp; Associates would, as of 2001, continue to serve as the headquarters for Cendant Software&#x27;s successor, Havas Interactive. Despite this, Davidson continued as a brand name for a time.

In April 1999, Havas Interactive announced a reorganization of its senior management structure, which included the dismissal of Larry Gross as president of Knowledge Adventure. By the end of 1999, the Davidson &amp; Associates brand name had ceased to be.

<text>Francisco Gómez de Quevedo y Santibáñez Villegas, Knight of the Order of Santiago (; 14 September 1580 – 8 September 1645) was a Spanish nobleman, politician and writer of the Baroque era. Along with his lifelong rival, Luis de Góngora, Quevedo was one of the most prominent Spanish poets of the age. His style is characterized by what was called &quot;conceptismo&quot;. This style existed in stark contrast to Góngora&#x27;s &quot;culteranismo&quot;.

== Biography ==
Quevedo was born on 14 September 1580 in Madrid into a family of &quot;hidalgos&quot; from the village of Vejorís, located in the northern mountainous region of Cantabria. His family was descended from the Castilian nobility.

Quevedo&#x27;s father, Francisco Gómez de Quevedo, was secretary to Maria of Spain, daughter of emperor Charles V and wife of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and his mother, Madrid-born María de Santibáñez, was lady-in-waiting to the queen. Quevedo matured surrounded by dignitaries and nobility at the royal court. Intellectually gifted, Quevedo was physically handicapped with a club foot, and myopia. Since he always wore pince-nez, his name in the plural, &quot;quevedos&quot;, came to mean &quot;pince-nez&quot; in the Spanish language.

Orphaned by the age of six, he was able to attend the Imperial School run by the Jesuits in Madrid. He then attended university at Alcalá de Henares from 1596 to 1600. By his own account, he made independent studies in philosophy, classical languages, Arabic, Hebrew, French and Italian.

In 1601, Quevedo, as a member of the Court, moved to Valladolid, where the Court had been transferred by the King&#x27;s minister, the Duke of Lerma. There he studied theology, a subject that would become a lifelong interest, and on which in later life he would compose the treatise &quot;Providencia de Dios&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Providence&quot;) against atheism.

By this time, he was becoming noted as both a poet and a prose writer. Some of his poetry was collected in a 1605 generational anthology by Pedro Espinosa entitled &quot;Flores de Poetas Ilustres&quot; (&quot;Flowers by Illustrious Poets&quot;).

We can also date back to this time the first draft of his picaresque novel &quot;Vida del Buscón –&quot; apparently written as an exercise in courtly wit – and a few satirical pamphlets that made him famous among his fellow students and which he would later disown as juvenile pranks.

Around this time, he began a very erudite exchange of letters with the humanist Justus Lipsius, in which Quevedo deplored the wars that were ravaging Europe. The Court returned to Madrid in 1606, and Quevedo followed, remaining till 1611. By then, he was a well-known and accomplished man-of-letters. He befriended and was praised by Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega, the premier playwright of the age.

Between 1616–1622, Quevedo attended the Medrano Academy (Poetic Academy of Madrid) founded by Dr. Sebastián Francisco de Medrano.

=== Enemies ===
Quevedo&#x27;s enemies included, among others, the dramatist Juan Ruiz de Alarcón for, despite his own physical handicaps, Quevedo found Alarcón&#x27;s redheaded and hunchbacked physique a source of amusement. Quevedo also attacked Juan Pérez de Montalbán, the son of a bookseller with whom he had quarrelled, satirizing him in &quot;La Perinola&quot; (&quot;The Teetotum&quot;), a piece against Montalbán&#x27;s book &quot;Para todos&quot; (&quot;For Everyone&quot;). In 1608, Quevedo duelled with the author and fencing master Luis Pacheco de Narváez as a result of Quevedo criticizing one of Pacheco&#x27;s works. Quevedo took off Pacheco&#x27;s hat in the first encounter. They remained enemies all their lives. In Quevedo&#x27;s &quot;Buscón&quot;, this duel was parodied with a fencer relying on mathematical calculations having to run away from a duel with an experienced soldier. 
Quevedo could be impulsive. He was present at the church of San Martín in Madrid when a woman praying there was slapped on the cheek by another man who had rushed up to her. Quevedo seized the man, dragging him outside the church. The two men drew swords, and Quevedo ran his opponent through. The man, who died of his wounds some time later, was someone of importance. Quevedo thus retired temporarily to the palace of his friend and patron, Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna.

The preferred object of his fury and ridicule, however, was the poet Góngora, whom, in a series of scathing satires, he accused of being an unworthy priest, a homosexual, a gambler, and a writer of indecent verse who used a purposefully obscure language. Quevedo lampooned his rival by writing a sonnet, &quot;Aguja de navegar cultos,&quot; which listed words from Góngora&#x27;s lexicon: &quot;He who would like to be a &quot;culto&quot; poet in just one day, / must the following jargon learn: / &quot;Fulgores, arrogar, joven, presiente / candor, construye, métrica, armonía...&quot;&quot;

Quevedo satirized Góngora&#x27;s physique, particularly his prominent nose in the sonnet &quot;A una nariz&quot;, (&quot;To a Nose&quot;). It begins with the lines: &quot;Érase un hombre a una nariz pegado, / érase una nariz superlativa, / érase una nariz sayón y escriba, / érase un peje espada muy barbado&quot;. (There was a man glued to a nose, / there was a superlative nose, / there was a nose that was an official and a scribe, / there was a bearded swordfish.)

=== Relationships with the Duke of Osuna ===
About that time, Quevedo grew very close to Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna, one of the great statesmen and generals of the age, whom he accompanied as secretary to Italy in 1613, carrying out a number of missions for him which took him to Nice, Venice, and finally back to Madrid. There he engaged in all manner of courtly intrigue to get the viceroyalty of Kingdom of Naples for Osuna, an effort that finally bore fruit in 1616. He then returned to Italy in the Duke&#x27;s entourage, where he was entrusted with putting in order the Viceroyalty&#x27;s finances, and sent on several espionage-related missions to the rival Republic of Venice, although it is now believed these did not involve him personally. He was rewarded for his efforts with a knighthood in the order of Santiago in 1618.

=== Temporary exile and retirement ===

With the fall from favor of Osuna in 1620, Quevedo lost his patron and protector and was exiled to Torre de Juan Abad (Ciudad Real), whose fiefdom his mother had purchased for him. His supposed vassals, however, refused to acknowledge him, forcing Quevedo into an interminable legal battle with the town&#x27;s council that would not be won until after his death.

Quevedo would write some of his better poetry in this retirement, such as the sonnet &quot;Retirado a la paz de estos desiertos...&quot; or &quot;Son las torres de Joray...&quot;. He found consolation to his failed ambitions as a courtier in the Stoicism of Seneca, his study and commentary turning him into one of the main exponents of Spanish Neostoicism.

The elevation of Philip IV to the throne in 1621 meant the end of Quevedo&#x27;s exile, and his return to Court and politics, now under the influence of the new minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares. Quevedo accompanied the young king in trips to Andalusia and Aragon, recounting some of its various incidents in interesting letters.

At this time he decided to denounce to the Spanish Inquisition his own works, published without his consent by profiteering booksellers. It was a move to frighten off the booksellers and regain control over his writings, with a view to a definitive edition of his work that was not to come in his lifetime.

He became known for a disorderly lifestyle: he was a heavy smoker, a frequent visitor to brothels and taverns, and cohabited with a woman only known as &quot;Ledesma.&quot; Góngora derided him as a drunkard in a satirical poem as &quot;Don Francisco de Quebebo&quot; (a play on his name that can be roughly translated as &quot;Don Francisco of Drinksalot.&quot;)

None of this put a stop to his career at court, perhaps because the king had an equally rowdy reputation. In fact, in 1632 he would become secretary to the king, thus reaching the apex of his political career.

His friend Antonio Juan de la Cerda, the Duke de Medinaceli, forced Quevedo to marry against his will with Doña Esperanza de Aragón, a widow with children. The marriage, made in 1634, barely lasted three months. Quevedo filled these years with febrile creative activity.

In 1634 he published &quot;La cuna y la sepultura&quot; (&quot;The Cradle and the Sepulchre&quot;) and the translation of &quot;La introducción a la vida devota&quot; (&quot;Introduction to a Life of Devotion&quot;) of Francis of Sales; between 1633 and 1635 he completed works like &quot;De los remedios de cualquier fortuna&quot; (&quot;On the Remedies of Any Fortune&quot;), the &quot;Epicteto&quot;, &quot;Virtud Militante&quot;, &quot;Los cuatro fantasmas&quot; (&quot;The Four Ghosts&quot;), the second part of &quot;Política de Dios&quot; (&quot;The Politics of God&quot;), &quot;Visita y anatomía de la cabeza del cardenal Richelieu&quot; (&quot;Visit and Anatomy of the Head of Cardinal Richelieu) or &quot;Carta a Luis XIII&quot; (&quot;Letter to Louis XIII&quot;).

In 1635 there appeared in Valencia the most important of the numerous libels destined to defame him, &quot;El tribunal de la justa venganza, erigido contra los escritos de Francisco de Quevedo, maestro de errores, doctor en desvergüenzas, licenciado en bufonerías, bachiller en suciedades, catedrático de vicios y protodiablo entre los hombres.&quot; (&quot;The Court of the rightful revenge, erected against the writings of Francisco de Quevedo, teacher of errors, doctor in shamelessness, licensed in buffoonery, bachelor in dirt, university professor of vices and proto-devil among men.&quot;)

=== Arrest and exile ===

In 1639, he was arrested. His books were confiscated. The authorities, hardly giving Quevedo time to get dressed, took the poet to the convent of San Marcos in León. In the monastery Quevedo dedicated himself to reading, as recounted in his &quot;Carta moral e instructiva&quot; (&quot;Moral and instructive letter&quot;), written to his friend, Adán de la Parra, depicting hour by hour his prison life (&quot;From ten to eleven, I spend my time in prayer and devotions, and from eleven to noon I read good and bad authors; because there is no book, despicable as it can be, that does not contain something good...&quot;).

Quevedo, who was frail and very ill when he left from his confinement in 1643, resigned from royal court definitively to retire at Torre de Juan Abad. He died in the Dominican convent of Villanueva de los Infantes, on 8 September 1645. One tale tells that his tomb was pillaged days later by a gentleman who wished to have the gold spurs with which Quevedo had been buried.

== Style ==
Quevedo was an adherent of the style known as &quot;conceptismo&quot;, a name derived from &quot;concepto&quot;, which has been defined as &quot;a brilliant flash of wit expressed in pithy or epigrammatic style.&quot; &quot;Conceptismo&quot; is characterized by a rapid rhythm, directness, simple vocabulary, witty metaphors, and wordplay. In this style, multiple meanings are conveyed in a very concise manner, and conceptual intricacies are emphasised over elaborate vocabulary. &quot;Conceptismo&quot; can effect elegant philosophical depth, as well as biting satire and humor, such as in the case of the works of Quevedo and Baltasar Gracián.

The first tercet from Quevedo&#x27;s sonnet &quot;¡Ah de la vida!&quot; is considered to exemplify &quot;conceptismo&quot; in poetry at its peak:

:&quot;Ayer se fue, mañana no ha llegado,&quot;
:&quot;Hoy se está yendo sin parar un punto;&quot;
:&quot;Soy un fue, y un será y un es cansado&quot;.

== Works ==
=== Poetry ===
Quevedo produced a vast quantity of poetry. His poetry, which was not published in book form during his lifetime, &quot;shows the caricature-like vision its author had of men, a vision sometimes deformed by a sharp, cruel, violently critical nature.&quot; This attitude is of a piece with the &quot;black seventeenth century&quot; he lived in. Despite his satirical work, however, Quevedo was primarily a serious poet who valued love poems.

His poetry gives evidence not only of his literary gifts but also of his erudition (Quevedo had studied Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, French, and Italian). One of his sonnets, &quot;A Roma sepultada en sus ruinas&quot; (1650), was an adaptation of a French poem by Joachim du Bellay, &quot;Nouveau venu qui cherches Rome en Rome,&quot; from &quot;Les Antiquités de Rome&quot; (1558). His poetic works range from satirical and mythological subjects to love poetry and philosophical pieces.

Quevedo constantly attacked avarice and avaricious people. His &quot;Cartas del Caballero de la Tenaza&quot; attack a notorious miser. He also attacked apothecaries, who had a reputation for adulterating and badly preparing medications.

His love poetry includes such works as &quot;Afectos varios de su corazón, fluctuando en las ondas de los cabellos de Lisi&quot; (&quot;Several Reactions of his Heart, Bobbing on the Waves of Lisi&#x27;s Hair&quot;). As one scholar has written, &quot;Even though women were never very much appreciated by Quevedo, who is labeled as a misogynist, it is impossible to imagine that there was anyone else who could adore them more.&quot; The first four lines run as follows:

: Within a curly storm of wavy gold
: must swim great gulfs of pure and blazing light
: my heart, for beauty eagerly athirst,
: when your abundant tresses you unbind.
His work also employed mythological themes, typical of the age, though it also employs satirical elements, for example in his &quot;To Apollo chasing Daphne&quot;:

: Ruddy silversmith from up on high,
: in whose bright beams the rabble pick their fleas:
: Daphne, that nymph, who takes off and won&#x27;t speak,
: if you&#x27;d possess her, pay, and douse your light.

Quevedo&#x27;s poetry also includes pieces such as an imagined dedication to Columbus by a piece of the ship in which the navigator had discovered the New World:

: Once I had an empire, wanderer,
: upon the billows of the salty sea;
: I was moved by the wind and well-respected,
: to southern lands I forged an opening.

=== Novel ===

The only novel written by Quevedo is the picaresque novel &quot;Vida del Buscón&quot; or &quot;El Buscón&quot; (Full original title: &quot;Historia de la vida del Buscón, llamado Don Pablos, ejemplo de vagamundos y espejo de tacaños&quot;) published in 1626. The work is divided into three books. The novel was popular in English; it was first translated by John Davies in 1657 under the title &quot;The Life and Adventures of Buscon the Witty Spaniard&quot;, a second edition appearing in 1670. New translations appeared in 1683 and 1707.

=== Theological works ===

Quevedo produced about 15 books on theological and ascetic subjects. These include &quot;La cuna y la sepultura&quot; (1612; &quot;The Cradle and the Grave&quot;) and &quot;La providencia de Dios&quot; (1641; &quot;The Providence of God&quot;).

=== Literary criticism ===
His works on literary criticism include &quot;La culta latiniparla&quot; (&quot;The Craze for Speaking Latin&quot;) and &quot;Aguja de navegar cultos&quot; (&quot;Compass for Navigating among Euphuistic Reefs&quot;). Both works were written with the purpose of attacking &quot;culteranismo&quot;.

=== Satire ===
Quevedo&#x27;s satire includes &quot;Sueños y discursos&quot;, also known as &quot;Los Sueños&quot; (1627; &quot;Dreams and Discourses&quot;). Quevedo employed much word-play in this work, which consists of five &quot;dream-visions.&quot; The first is &quot;The Dream of the Last Judgment&quot;, in which Quevedo finds himself witnessing the Day of Judgment, and closes with a glimpse of Hell itself. The second dream is &quot;The Bedeviled Constable&quot; in which a constable is possessed by an evil spirit, which results in the evil spirit begging to be exorcised, since the constable is more evil of the two. The third dream is the long &quot;Vision of Hell&quot;. The fourth dream-vision is called &quot;The World from the Inside&quot; The last dream is &quot;Dream of Death&quot; in which Quevedo offers examples of man&#x27;s dishonest ways.

In the &quot;Dreams&quot;, the somewhat misanthropic Quevedo showcased his antipathy for numerous groups, including but not limited to tailors, innkeepers, alchemists, astrologers, women, the Genovese, Protestants, constables, accountants, Jews, doctors, dentists, apothecaries, and hypocrites of all kinds.

He wrote too, in a satirical tone, &quot;La hora de todos y la Fortuna con seso&quot; (1699), with many political, social and religious allusions. He shows in it his ability in the use of language, with word-play and fantastic and real characters. &quot;La Isla de los Monopantos&quot;, a virulently antisemitic tale in the book portraying a secret Jewish plot to destroy Christendom with the assistance of the Monopanto chief Pragas Chincollos (a satirical portrayal of the Count-Duke of Olivares), is believed by some to have been a key influence in Hermann Goedsche&#x27;s novel &quot;Biarritz&quot;, one of the unacknowledged sources of &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. A strident antisemite and opponent of the &quot;conversos&quot;, Quevedo had described the character of the Portuguese new Christians to Philip IV in his work &quot;Execración contra los judíos&quot; (a blend of a teological-medieval anti-Jewish worldview and racial antisemitism) in the following light: &quot;mice they are, Lord, enemies of the light, friends of darkness, unclean, stinking, subterranean&quot;.

=== Political works ===
His political works include &quot;La política de Dios, y gobierno de Cristo&quot; (1617–1626; &quot;The Politics of the Lord&quot;) and &quot;La vida de Marco Bruto&quot; (1632–1644; &quot;The Life of Marcus Brutus&quot;). According to writers Javier Martínez-Pinna and Diego Peña &quot;in his writings he always manifested an obsession for the defense of the country, being convinced of the necessity and inevitability of the hegemony of Spain in the world, something that in the full Spanish decline had to do him much harm. It was also integrated in the tradition of laus Hispaniae, established by San Isidoro and used by Quevedo himself to try to recover the values that he thought, made the nation powerful. In a series of works like his defended Spain, he praised the greatness of his most prestigious compatriots, highlighting the Spanish superiority in the field of letters, visible in authors such as Fray Luis de León, Jorge Manrique or Garcilaso de la Vega, but also in the art of war, making possible the victory of Castilian weapons in their confrontations against Arabs and other European powers during the sixteenth century.&quot;

==History==
The first issue of the &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot; was printed in October 1984. Ever since, the magazine has been dealing with small computers, from ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, via Amiga to today&#x27;s PCs.

Most people famous in the Serbian (ex Yugoslav), Serbian and Belgrade computer scene have been working for the &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot;. The first editor-in-chief was Milan Misic, later &quot;Politika&quot;&#x27;s correspondent from India and Japan, then foreign policy column editor, and former editor-in-chief in the same newspaper. Before settling in another businesses, contributors to the development of the &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot; were the following individuals: Stanko Popović (working independently in computer business), Stanko Stojiljković (editor in &quot;Ekspres&quot; daily newspaper), Sergej Marcenko (marketing editor in political weekly magazine &quot;NIN&quot;), Andrija Kolundžić (working independently in computer business in Tokyo, Japan), Aleksandar Radovanovic (now working at various universities around the world), Voja Antonić, Dragoslav Jovanović (working at the Belgrade University), Jovan Puzovic (working at the Belgrade University), Nenad Balint (working in IT company in United Kingdom), Aleksandar Petrović (manager of a software company in Canada), Dalibor Lanik (working as a programmer in Czech Republic) and many others.

During 1986, when the home computers made the biggest boom, a games subsection of the &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot; started to evolve into a special issue &quot;Svet igara&quot; (Games World). This issue was published from time to time as a supplement to the games column in the magazine. Up until now, 14 issues have been published.

The same year, &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot; had a special edition in Russian that was distributed to the former Soviet Union.

&quot;Computer Grand Prix&quot;, organized by the &quot;ComputerWorld&quot;, is a contest for the best hardware and software products on domestic market. Unfortunately, during UN sanctions, organized import of such products was not allowed, so it was not possible to organize this contest.

Also, in 1988 the &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot; organized &quot;Computer &#x27;88&quot;, a small computer fair in downtown Belgrade. It consisted of the exhibition and presentations, lectures and special broadcasts in Belgrade media.

In August 2005 &quot;Svet kompjutera&quot; formed its official Web forum named &quot;Forum Sveta kompjutera&quot;.
As of February 2011 it has over 26,000 users and over 1,200,000 posts in over 56,000 topics.
