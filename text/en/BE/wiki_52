<text>Chevron Corporation is an American multinational energy corporation predominantly specializing in oil and gas. The second-largest direct descendant of Standard Oil, and originally known as the Standard Oil Company of California (shortened to Socal or CalSo), it is active in more than 180 countries. Within oil and gas, Chevron is vertically integrated and is involved in hydrocarbon exploration, production, refining, marketing and transport, chemicals manufacturing and sales, and power generation.

Founded originally in Southern California during the 1870s, the company was then based for many decades in San Francisco, California, before moving its corporate offices to San Ramon, California, in 2001; and on August 2, 2024, Chevron announced that it would be relocating its headquarters from California to Houston, Texas.

Chevron traces its history back to the second half of the 19th century to small California-based oil companies which were acquired by Standard and merged into Standard Oil of California. The company grew quickly on its own after the breakup of Standard Oil by continuing to acquire companies and partnering with others both inside and outside of California, eventually becoming one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.

In 1985, Socal merged with the Pittsburgh-based Gulf Oil and rebranded as Chevron; the newly merged company later merged with Texaco in 2001. Chevron manufactures and sells fuels, lubricants, additives, and petrochemicals, primarily in Western North America, the US Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea and Australia. In 2018, the company produced an average of of net oil-equivalent per day in United States.

Chevron is one of the largest companies in the world and the second-largest oil company based in the United States by revenue, only behind fellow Standard Oil descendant ExxonMobil. Chevron ranked 10th on the Fortune 500 in 2023. The company is also the last-remaining oil-and-gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since ExxonMobil&#x27;s exit from the index in 2020.

Chevron has been subject to numerous controversies.

==History==
=== Predecessors ===

==== Star Oil and Pacific Coast Oil Company ====
One of Chevron&#x27;s early predecessors, &quot;Star Oil&quot;, discovered oil at the Pico Canyon Oilfield in the Santa Susana Mountains north of Los Angeles in 1876. The 25 barrels of oil per day well marked the discovery of the Newhall Field, and is considered by geophysicist Marius Vassiliou as the beginning of the modern oil industry in California. Energy analyst Antonia Juhasz has said that while Star Oil&#x27;s founders were influential in establishing an oil industry in California, Union Mattole Company discovered oil in the state eleven years prior.

In September 1879, Charles N. Felton, Lloyd Tevis, George Loomis and others created the &quot;Pacific Coast Oil Company&quot;, which acquired the assets of Star Oil with $1 million in funding. Pacific Coast Oil eventually became the largest oil interest in California, and in 1900, John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil acquired Pacific Coast Oil for $761,000. In 1906, the Pacific Coast acquired the business operations and assets of the Standard Oil Company (Iowa). At this time, Pacific renamed itself the Standard Oil Company (California).

==== Texaco ====

Since the acquisition of the Pacific Coast Oil Company by Standard Oil, the Standard descendant had traditionally worked closely with Texaco for 100 years, before acquiring Texaco outright in 2001. Originally known as the Texas Fuel Company (later the Texas Company), Texaco was founded in Beaumont, Texas, as an oil-equipment vendor by &quot;Buckskin Joe&quot;. The founder&#x27;s nickname came from being harsh and aggressive. Texas Fuel worked closely with Chevron. In 1936, it formed a joint venture with California Standard named Caltex, to drill and produce oil in Saudi Arabia. According to energy analyst and activist shareholder Antonia Juhasz, the Texas Fuel Company and California Standard were often referred to as the &quot;terrible twins&quot; for their cutthroat business practices.

===Formation of the Chevron name===

In 1911, the federal government broke Standard Oil into several pieces under the Sherman Antitrust Act. One of those pieces, Standard Oil Co. (California), went on to become Chevron. It became part of the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, which dominated the world oil industry in the early 20th century. In 1926, the company changed its name to Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL). By the terms of the breakup of Standard Oil, at first Standard of California could use the Standard name only within its original geographic area of the Pacific coast states, plus Nevada and Arizona; outside that area, it had to use another name.

Today, Chevron is the owner of the Standard Oil trademark in 16 states in the western and southeastern United States. Since American trademark law operates under a use-it-or-lose-it rule, the company owns and operates one Standard-branded Chevron station in each state of the area. However, though Chevron (as CalSo) acquired Kyso in the 1960s, its status in Kentucky is unclear after Chevron withdrew its brand from retail sales from Kentucky in July 2010.

The &#x27;Chevron&#x27; name came into use for some of its retail products in the 1930s. The name &quot;Calso&quot; was also used from 1946 to 1955, in states outside its native West Coast territory.

Standard Oil Company of California ranked 75th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

In 1933, Saudi Arabia granted California Standard a concession to find oil, which led to the discovery of oil in 1938. In 1948, California Standard discovered the world&#x27;s largest oil field in Saudi Arabia, Ghawar Field. California Standard&#x27;s subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, grew over the years and became the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1944. In 1973, the Saudi government began buying into ARAMCO. By 1980, the company was entirely owned by the Saudis, and in 1988, its name was changed to Saudi Arabian Oil Company—Saudi Aramco.

Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil merged in 1984, which was the largest merger in history at that time. To comply with U.S. antitrust law, California Standard divested many of Gulf&#x27;s operating subsidiaries, and sold some Gulf stations in the eastern United States and a Philadelphia refinery which has since closed. Among the assets sold off were Gulf&#x27;s retail outlets in Gulf&#x27;s home market of Pittsburgh, where Chevron lacks a retail presence but does retain a regional headquarters there as of 2013, partially for Marcellus Shale-related drilling. The same year, Standard Oil of California also took the opportunity to change its legal name to Chevron Corporation, since it had already been using the well-known &quot;Chevron&quot; retail brand name for decades. Chevron would sell the Gulf Oil trademarks for the entire U.S. to Cumberland Farms, the parent company of Gulf Oil LP, in 2010 after Cumberland Farms had a license to the Gulf trademark in the Northeastern United States since 1986.

In 1996, Chevron transferred its natural gas gathering, operating and marketing operation to NGC Corporation (later Dynegy) in exchange for a roughly 25% equity stake in NGC. In a merger completed February 1, 2000, Illinova Corp. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. and Chevron&#x27;s stake increased up to 28%. However, in May 2007, Chevron sold its stake in the company for approximately $985 million, resulting in a gain of $680 million.

=== Acquisitions and diversification ===
==== 2000s ====
The early 2000s saw Chevron engage in many mergers, acquisitions, and sales, the first largest of which was the $45 billion acquisition of Texaco, announced on October 15, 2000. The acquisition created the second-largest oil company in the United States and the world&#x27;s fourth-largest publicly traded oil company with a combined market value of approximately $95 billion. Completed on October 9, 2001, Chevron temporarily renamed itself to ChevronTexaco between 2001 and 2005; after the company reverted its name to Chevron, Texaco became used as a brand by the company for some of its fueling stations.

2005 also saw Chevron purchase Unocal Corporation for $18.4 billion, increasing the company&#x27;s petroleum and natural gas reserves by about 15%. Because of Unocal&#x27;s large South East Asian geothermal operations, Chevron became a large producer of geothermal energy. The deal did not include Unocal&#x27;s former retail operations including the Union 76 trademark, as it had sold that off to Tosco Corporation in 1997. The 76 brand is owned by Phillips 66, unaffiliated with Chevron.

Chevron and the Los Alamos National Laboratory started a cooperation in 2006, to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil shale by developing a shale oil extraction process named Chevron CRUSH. In 2006, the United States Department of the Interior issued a research, development and demonstration lease for Chevron&#x27;s demonstration oil shale project on public lands in Colorado&#x27;s Piceance Basin. In February 2012, Chevron notified the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Reclamation, Mining and Safety that it intended to divest this lease.

==== 2010s ====
Starting in 2010, Chevron began to reduce its retail footprint and expand in domestic natural gas. In July 2010, Chevron ended retail operations in the Mid-Atlantic United States by removing the Chevron and Texaco names from 1,100 stations. In 2011, Chevron acquired Pennsylvania-based Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion in cash and an additional $1.1 billion in existing debt owed by Atlas. Three months later, Chevron acquired drilling and development rights for another 228,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale from Chief Oil &amp; Gas LLC and Tug Hill, Inc. In September 2013, Total S.A. and its joint-venture partner agreed to buy Chevron&#x27;s retail distribution business in Pakistan for an undisclosed amount.

In October 2014, Chevron announced that it would sell a 30 percent holding in its Canadian oil shale holdings to Kuwait&#x27;s state-owned oil company Kuwait Oil Company for a fee of $1.5 billion. Despite these sales, Chevron continued to explore acquisitions, a trend which had reinvigorated in 2019 and extended throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2019, Chevron announced its intention to acquire Anadarko Petroleum in a deal valued at $33 billion, but decided to focus on other acquisitions shortly afterwards when a deal could not be reached. Despite the failed acquisition of Anadarko, Chevron did acquire Noble Energy for $5 billion in July 2020.

Chevron was not spared from the pandemic, however, as Chevron announced reductions of 10–15% of its workforce due to both the pandemic and a 2020 oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. During the pandemic, Chevron considered a merger with rival ExxonMobil in 2020 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic that drove oil demand sharply down. It would have been one of the largest corporate mergers in history, and a combined Chevron and ExxonMobil (dubbed &quot;Chexxon&quot; by Reuters) would have been the second-largest oil company in the world, trailing only Saudi Aramco.

Later in the pandemic, Chevron began requiring some employees, namely expatriate employees, those working overseas, and workers on U.S.-flagged ships, to receive COVID-19 vaccinations after having some key operations, the off-shore platforms off the Gulf of Mexico and Permian Basin for example. The requirement will begin for workers off the Gulf of Mexico on the first of November.

==== 2020s ====
In the 2020s, Chevron&#x27;s primary focus was on alternative energy solutions, gradual pullouts from Africa and Southeast Asia, and an increased focus on the Americas with a lessened albeit still present interest in natural gas. Chevron in February 2020 joined Marubeni Corporation and WAVE Equity Partners in investing in Carbon Clean Solutions, a company that provides portable carbon capture technology for the oil field and other industrial facilities. Two years later, Chevron announced that they will acquire Renewable Energy Group, a biodiesel production company based in Ames, Iowa. The acquisition was completed just under four months later on June 13.

In the Americas, Chevron acquired natural gas company Beyond6, LLC (B6) and its network of 55 compressed natural gas stations across the United States from Mercuria in November 2022. However, Chevron&#x27;s largest American moves in the 2020s were in Venezuela, as the Biden administration relaxed restrictions on Chevron from pumping oil in the South American nation, originally imposed due to corruption scandals and human rights violations by Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The relaxed restrictions, however, came with severe limitations, including provisions which prohibited Chevron from selling to Russian or Iranian-affiliated agencies and from allowing any direct profits to go to Venezuelan oil company PDVSA.

On November 29, 2022, Venezuelan Government Petroleum Minister Tarek El Aissami met in Caracas, Venezuela, with the president of Chevron, Javier La Rosa. The Venezuelan ruling party said it was committed to &quot;the development of oil production&quot; after the easing of sanctions.

The most important joint ventures where Chevron is involved in Venezuela are Petroboscán, in the west of the nation, and Petropiar, in the eastern Orinoco Belt, with a production capacity of close to 180,000 barrels per day between both projects. In the case of Petroboscán, current production is nil and, in Petropiar, current records indicate close to 50,000 barrels per day.

On March 20, 2023, Tareck El Aissami resigned from his government post amid serious corruption allegations. Moreover, El Aissami, a longtime Maduro ally, has a $10mn US government reward on his head for allegedly facilitating drug trafficking from Venezuela. He played a key role in helping Nicolas Maduro&#x27;s government dodge US economic sanctions, using his Syrian and Lebanese parentage to open up new business channels to Iran and Turkey.

On January 5, 2022, Chevron temporarily decreased production in Kazakhstan&#x27;s Tengiz Field due to the 2022 Kazakh protests, which were motivated by heavy oil price increases. Later that month, Chevron also announced it would end all operations in Myanmar, citing rampant human rights abuses and deteriorating rule of law since the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état. A statement released by the company on its website stated while Chevron was committed to an orderly exit which ensured it could still provide energy to Southeast Asia, Chevron remained firmly opposed to the human rights violations committed by the current military rule in Myanmar.

Also in 2022, Chevron was reported to explore the sale of stakes in three fields located in Equatorial Guinea. It was suggested by Reuters that the sales are intended to attract smaller oil companies.

Chevron, however, did not do business in the 2020s without controversy and regulatory obstacles. Chevron Phillips Chemical, a company jointly owned by Chevron and Phillips 66, agreed to pay $118 million in March 2022 as a result of violating the Clean Air Act at three of its chemical production plants in Texas. According to the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chevron and Phillips failed to properly flare at the plants, causing excess air pollution. The companies agreed to add pollution control systems to the plants as well.

Despite the major oil and gas companies, including Chevron, reporting sharp rises in interim revenues and profits due to Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the world&#x27;s-largest oil companies received immense backlash for such profits. In total, Chevron made US$246.3 billion in revenue and $36.5 billion in profit within 2022, both of which are records for the company. In addition, days before the company reported its full year earnings, Chevron increased its dividend and announced a $75 billion stock buyback program, a move which attracted a heated response from the Biden administration as well as from news commentators within the United States.

The 2020s also saw efforts by Chevron to expand into the clean energy industry. Across the 2020s, Chevron invested stakes into fusion power companies, the two largest of them being Zap Energy and TAE Technologies. September 2023 saw Chevron acquire a majority stake in a Utah hydrogen storage facility, which is poised to be the world&#x27;s largest storage facility for hydrogen in renewable energy.

In October 2023, Chevron Corporation acquired Hess Corporation in an all-stock deal for $53 billion. The acquisition, which was announced on October 23, 2023, opens up new opportunities in the US shale plays and in oil-rich Guyana. Hess Corp, Exxon Mobil and China&#x27;s CNOOC, key players in Guyana, have been producing a combined 400,000 barrels per day.from two offshore projects. With the potential to develop 10 more projects, Guyana becomes one of the fastest-growing oil regions that Chevron now has access to.

In 2023, Chevron entered into a 10-year agreement with state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to license, manufacture, distribute and sell Chevron lubricants in India under the Caltex brand.

In August 2024, Chevron earmarked $1 billion in a new research and development (R&amp;D) hub called Chevron Engineering and Innovation Excellence Center (ENGINE) in Bengaluru, India.

== Corporate image ==
=== Logo evolution ===
The first logo featured the legend &quot;Pacific Coast Oil Co.&quot;, the name adopted by the company when it was established in 1879. Successive versions showed the word &#x27;Standard&#x27; (for &quot;The Standard Oil of California&quot;). In 1968, the company introduced the word &#x27;Chevron&#x27; (which was introduced as a brand in the 1930s) for the first time in its logo. In July 2014, the Chevron Corporation logo design was officially changed, although it has been used since 2000. By 2015, the logo had been changed multiple times, with three different color schemes applied in the logo. The logo was gray, then blue, and then turned red before returning to the silver gray it is today.
=== &quot;Human Energy&quot; ===
Chevron today is well known for its slogan &quot;the human energy company&quot;, a campaign first launched in September 2007. In a corporate blog, Chevron states &quot;human energy&quot; was chosen as their campaign&#x27;s slogan and focus because &quot;human energy captures our positive spirit in delivering energy to a rapidly changing world&quot;. The slogan remains prominent in Chevron advertising, and Chevron has derived from this slogan to use phrases in marketing such as &quot;it&#x27;s only human&quot;.

== Operations ==
As of December 31, 2018, Chevron had approximately 48,600 employees (including about 3,600 service station employees). Approximately 24,800 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees), or 51 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.

Chevron&#x27;s dominant regions of production are North America, which produces 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE), and Eurasia, which produces 1.4 BBOE. Chevron&#x27;s Eurasian-Pacific operations are concentrated in the United Kingdom, Southeast Asia, Kazakhstan, Australia, Bangladesh, and greater China. Chevron additionally operates in South America, the west coast of sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Nigeria and Angola), Egypt, and Iraq; these four regions collectively produce 0.4 BBOE. Chevron&#x27;s largest revenue products are shale and tight, though produces considerable revenue from heavy oil, deepwater offshore drilling, conventional oil, and liquefied natural gas.

In October 2015, Chevron announced that it was cutting up to 7,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, Chevron announced reductions of 10–15% of its workforce.
===Upstream===
Chevron&#x27;s oil and gas exploration and production operations, which in the oil and gas industry are considered as &quot;upstream&quot; operations, are primarily in the US, Australia, Nigeria, Angola, Kazakhstan, and the Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 2018, the company&#x27;s upstream business reported worldwide net production of 2.930 million oil-equivalent barrels per day.

In the United States, the company operates approximately 11,000 oil and natural gas wells in hundreds of fields occupying across the Permian Basin, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. In 2010, Chevron was the fourth-largest producer in the region. In February 2011, Chevron celebrated the production of its 5 billionth barrel of Permian Basin oil. The Gulf of Mexico is where the company&#x27;s deepest offshore drilling takes place at Tahiti and Blind Faith. The company also explored and drilled in the Marcellus Shale formation under several northeastern US states; these operations were sold to the Pittsburgh-based natural gas firm EQT Corporation in 2020.

Chevron&#x27;s largest single resource project is the $43 billion Gorgon Gas Project in Australia. It also produces natural gas from Western Australia. The $43 billion project was started in 2010, and was expected to be brought online in 2014. The project includes construction of a 15 million tonne per annum liquefied natural gas plant on Barrow Island, and a domestic gas plant with the capacity to provide 300 terajoules per day to supply gas to Western Australia.

It is also developing the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas development in Western Australia. The foundation phase of the project is estimated to cost $29 billion; it will consist of two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of 8.9 million tons per annum, a domestic gas plant and associated offshore infrastructure. In August 2014 a significant gas-condensate discovery at the Lasseter-1 exploration well in WA-274-P in Western Australia, in which Chevron has a 50% interest was announced. The company also has an interest in the North West Shelf Venture, equally shared with five other investors including BP, BHP Petroleum, Shell, Mitsubishi/Mitsui and Woodside. Presently, Chevron is looking to convert its Gorgon Island operations from upstream production to carbon capture and storage.

In the onshore and near-offshore regions of the Niger Delta, Chevron operates under a joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, operating and holding a 40% interest in 13 concessions in the region. In addition, Chevron operates the Escravos Gas Plant and the Escravos gas-to-liquids plant.

Chevron has interests in four concessions in Angola, including offshore two concessions in Cabinda province, the Tombua–Landana development and the Mafumeira Norte project, operated by the company. It is also a leading partner in Angola LNG plant.

In Kazakhstan, Chevron participate the Tengiz and Karachaganak projects. In 2010, Chevron became the largest private shareholder in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium pipeline, which transports oil from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea.

As of 2013, the Rosebank oil and gas field west of Shetland was being evaluated by Chevron and its partners. Chevron drilled its discovery well there in 2004. Production was expected in 2015 if a decision was made to produce from the field. The geology and weather conditions are challenging.

===Midstream===
As of 2019, outside of maritime shipping, Chevron did not own significant midstream assets; that year it attempted to purchase Anadarko Petroleum, which owned pipelines, but was outbid by Occidental Petroleum. In 2021, Chevron completed its purchase of Noble Midstream Partners LP, which has crude oil, produced water and gas gathering assets in the Permian Basin in West Texas and the DJ Basin in Colorado. Noble Midstream also has 2 crude oil terminals in the DJ Basin as well as freshwater delivery systems.

==== Transport ====

Chevron Shipping Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, provides the maritime transport operations, marine consulting services and marine risk management services for Chevron Corporation. Chevron ships historically had names beginning with &quot;Chevron&quot;, such as &quot;Chevron Washington&quot; and &quot;Chevron South America&quot;, or were named after former or serving directors of the company. Samuel Ginn, William E. Crain, Kenneth Derr, Richard Matzke and most notably Condoleezza Rice were among those honored, but the ship named after Rice was subsequently renamed as &quot;Altair Voyager&quot;.

===Downstream===
==== Refining ====
Chevron&#x27;s downstream operations manufacture and sell products such as fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. The company&#x27;s most significant areas of operations are the west coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. In 2010, Chevron sold an average of of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The company operates approximately 19,550 retail sites in 84 countries. Chevron&#x27;s Asia downstream headquarters is in Singapore, and the company operates gas stations (under the Caltex brand) within the city state, in addition to some gas stations in Western Canada. Chevron owns the trademark rights to Texaco and Caltex fuel and lubricant products.

Chevron, with equal partner Singapore Petroleum Company, also owns half of the Singapore Refining Company (SRC) plant, a complex refinery capable of cracking crude oil. The investment was first made in 1979 when Caltex was a one-third partner.

In 2010, Chevron processed of crude oil. It owns and operates Five active refineries in the United States (Richmond, CA, El Segundo, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, Pascagoula, MS, Pasadena, TX ). Chevron is the non-operating partner in seven joint venture refineries, located in Australia, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, and New Zealand. Chevron&#x27;s United States refineries are located in Gulf and Western states. Chevron also owns an asphalt refinery in Perth Amboy, New Jersey; however, since early 2008 that refinery has primarily operated as a terminal.

==== Chemicals ====
Chevron&#x27;s primary chemical business is in a 50/50 joint venture with Phillips 66, organized into the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. Chevron also operates the Chevron Oronite Company, which develops, manufactures and sells fuel and lubricant additives.

==== Retail ====

In the United States, the Chevron brand is the most widely used, at 6,880 locations as of September 2022 spread across 21 states. Chevron&#x27;s highest concentration of stations branded as Chevron are in California (mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area, Central Valley, and Greater Los Angeles), Las Vegas, Anchorage, the Pacific Northwest (especially Seattle), Phoenix, Atlanta, the Texas Triangle, and South Florida. The world&#x27;s largest Chevron gas station is located at Terrible&#x27;s Road House in Nevada.

Chevron also utilizes the Texaco brand within the United States, though its locations are much more sparsely-spread than that of Chevron. Texaco is used at 1,346 locations across 17 states, mostly in Washington, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Hawaii. Additionally, Texaco licenses its brand to Valero Energy to use in the United Kingdom, and over 730 Texaco stations exist in Britain.

Chevron primarily uses the Caltex brand outside of the United States, primarily in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Pakistan, New Zealand, and South Africa. In 2015, Chevron sold its 50% stake in Caltex Australia, while allowing the company to continue using the Caltex brand. In 2019, Chevron announced it would re-enter the Australian market by purchasing Puma Energy&#x27;s operations in the country. The acquisition was completed in July 2020. Chevron relaunched the Caltex brand in Australia in 2022, after the expiration of Caltex Australia&#x27;s license to use the Caltex brand.

===Alternative energy===

Chevron&#x27;s alternative energy operations include geothermal solar, wind, biofuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen. In 2021 it significantly increased its use of biofuel from dairy farms, like biomethane.

Chevron has claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest producer of geothermal energy. The company&#x27;s primary geothermal operations were located in Southeast Asia, but these assets were sold in 2017.

Prior, Chevron operated geothermal wells in Indonesia providing power to Jakarta and the surrounding area. In the Philippines, Chevron also operated geothermal wells at Tiwi field in Albay province, the Makiling-Banahaw field in Laguna and Quezon provinces.

In 2007, Chevron and the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) started collaboration to develop and produce algae fuel, which could be converted into transportation fuels, such as jet fuel. In 2008, Chevron and Weyerhaeuser created Catchlight Energy LLC, which researches the conversion of cellulose-based biomass into biofuels. In 2013, the Catchlight plan was downsized due to competition with fossil fuel projects for funds.

Between 2006 and 2011, Chevron contributed up to $12 million to a strategic research alliance with the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop cellulosic biofuels and to create a process to convert biomass like wood or switchgrass into fuels.
Additionally, Chevron holds a 22% stake in Galveston Bay Biodiesel LP, which produces up to of renewable biodiesel fuel a year.

In 2010, the Chevron announced a 740 kW photovoltaic demonstration project in Bakersfield, California, called Project Brightfield, for exploring possibilities to use solar power for powering Chevron&#x27;s facilities. It consists of technologies from seven companies, which Chevron is evaluating for large-scale use. In Fellows, California, Chevron has invested in the 500 kW Solarmine photovoltaic solar project, which supplies daytime power to the Midway-Sunset Oil Field. In Questa, Chevron has built a 1 MW concentrated photovoltaic plant that comprises 173 solar arrays, which use Fresnel lenses. In October 2011, Chevron launched a 29-MW thermal solar-to-steam facility in the Coalinga Field to produce the steam for enhanced oil recovery. As of 2012, the project is the largest of its kind in the world.

In 2014, Chevron began reducing its investment in renewable energy technologies, reducing headcount and selling alternative energy-related assets.

In 2015, the Shell Canada Quest Energy project was launched of which Chevron Canada Limited holds a 20% share. The project is based within the Athabasca Oil Sands Project near Fort McMurray, Alberta. It is the world&#x27;s first CCS project on a commercial-scale.

===Headquarters and Offices===

==== Texas ====

Chevron&#x27;s corporate headquarters operates from office towers in downtown Houston, Texas, where it purchased 1500 Louisiana Street and 1400 Smith Street.

Upon Chevron announcing that it was selling its San Ramon headquarters in 2022, the company offered to cover moving costs for employees who wished to relocate to Texas.

On August 2, 2024, Chevron announced that it would be relocate its headquarters from California to Houston, Texas, by January 2025, citing a number of factors.

==== California ====
Chevron has a corporate office located in San Ramon, California, at 5001 Executive Parkway.

The company’s earlier headquarters was located at 555 Market Street in San Francisco, California, the city where it had been located since its inception in 1879. Then in 2002, Chevron moved to a 92-acre campus in San Ramon, California, located at 6001 Bollinger Canyon Road.

Chevron sold its San Ramon headquarters to the local Sunset Development Co. in September 2022, from whom it originally bought the land which the Bollinger Canyon Road office previously stood, and leases a space in San Ramon&#x27;s Bishop Ranch, also owned by Sunset, as its new office, as it continues to shift more operations to Texas.

===Political contributions===
Since January 2011 Chevron has contributed almost $15 million on Washington lobbying. On October 7, 2012, Chevron donated $2.5 million to the Republican Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC that is closely tied to former House Speaker John Boehner.

According to watchdog group Documented, in 2020 Chevron contributed $50,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fund-raising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association.

==Criticism and concerns==
Chevron has been widely criticized and attacked for scandals, accidents, and activities mostly related to climate change. Chevron has been fined by the governments of Angola, for oil spills within its waters, and the United States through its EPA for violations of the US Clean Air Act and pollutive activities arising out of its Richmond Refinery in California. On multiple instances, authorities in oil-heavy countries have fired rounds onto protestors against Chevron. Environmental activists have held annual anti-Chevron protests, usually within a week of Chevron&#x27;s annual meeting of shareholders.

One case heavily promoted on social media is about work done in the Lago Agrio oil field by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001. Texaco dumped 18 billion tons of toxic waste and spilled of petroleum. Texaco&#x27;s activities were the subject of an Ecuadorian court case brought by Steven Donziger, which claimed an $18 billion and later reduced $9.5 billion judgment.

<doc id="284752" wikidata="Q486609" url="?curid=284752" title="Anastasia (1997 film)">
<text>Anastasia is a 1997 American animated musical historical fantasy film produced and directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman from a screenplay by the writing teams of Susan Gauthier and Bruce Graham, and Bob Tzudiker and Noni White, and based on a story adaptation by Eric Tuchman. It features songs written by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens and a musical score composed and conducted by David Newman. The film stars the voices of Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria, Bernadette Peters, Kirsten Dunst, and Angela Lansbury. The film shares its plot with the 1956 film &quot;Anastasia&quot;, which in turn was based on a play by Marcelle Maurette. Unlike those treatments, this version adds Grigori Rasputin as the main antagonist.

&quot;Anastasia&quot; was the first 20th Century Fox animated feature to be produced by its own animation division, 20th Century Fox Animation, through its subsidiary Fox Animation Studios. The film premiered at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on November 14, 1997, and was released in the United States on November 21. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation, voice performances, and soundtrack, though it attracted criticism from some historians for its fantastical retelling of the Grand Duchess. &quot;Anastasia&quot; grossed $140 million worldwide, making it the most profitable film from Bluth and Fox Animation Studios. It received nominations for several awards, including for Best Original Song (&quot;Journey to the Past&quot;) and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the 70th Academy Awards.

The success of &quot;Anastasia&quot; spawned various adaptations of the film into other media, including a direct-to-video spin-off film in 1999 and a stage musical in 2016.

==Plot==
In 1916, at a ball celebrating the Romanov Tricentennial, Dowager Empress Maria “Marie” Romanov, gives a music box as well as a pendant that says &quot;Together in Paris&quot; to Grand Duchess Anastasia Romanov, her youngest granddaughter. The ball is interrupted by Grigori Rasputin, the Romanovs’ former royal advisor, who was exiled for treason. Having sold his soul in exchange for a powerful reliquary, he vows to Tsar Nicholas II that his family will be killed with a curse, which starts the Russian Revolution. As Bolsheviks invade the palace, Maria and Anastasia are aided by Dimitri, a servant boy, who shows them a secret passageway. Anastasia drops her music box; she tries to retrieve it, but Dimitri pushes her through the passageway. Rasputin confronts them outside on the frozen Little Nevka River but falls through the ice, drowning. Maria gets on a moving train, but Anastasia falls and hits her head on the platform, giving her amnesia.

Ten years later, Russia is now part of the Soviet Union. There are rumors that Anastasia may have escaped her family&#x27;s execution, so Marie offers 10 million roubles in exchange for her return. Now a conman, Dimitri and his partner-in-crime, Vladimir, plot to obtain the reward with an imposter. The actual Anastasia—now going by &quot;Anya&quot;—leaves the orphanage where she has lived ever since she got amnesia and begins a search for her family. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names Pooka, Anya heads for Paris but finds she cannot leave the Soviet Union without an exit visa. She is advised to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace. There, the two men are impressed by her resemblance to the &quot;real&quot; Anastasia and decide to take her with them to Paris, with Dimitri convincing Anya that they are trying to reunite her with her grandmother, unaware of Anya&#x27;s true identity.

While watching the meeting, Rasputin&#x27;s albino bat, Bartok, notices the reliquary revived by Anya&#x27;s presence. It drags him down to limbo, where he finds an undead Rasputin. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped his curse, Rasputin sends demonic minions from the reliquary to kill Anya. The minions try to sabotage the trio&#x27;s train as they leave Leningrad by overheating the boiler of the train engine and later destroying the bridge on which the tracks lay. The minions later try to lure Anya into sleepwalking off their ship headed from Germany en route to France. The trio unwittingly foil the attempts, forcing Rasputin to try to kill Anya himself.

As Dimitri and Vladimir reteach Anya about court etiquette and her family&#x27;s history, she and Dimitri begin to fall in love. The trio finally arrive in Paris and see Maria, who has decided to give up hope of reuniting with her granddaughter after having met no one except numerous impostors. Despite this, Maria&#x27;s first cousin and lady-in-waiting, Sophie, quizzes Anya to confirm her identity. Though she gives correct coached answers to every question, Dimitri realizes Anya is the real Anastasia when she vaguely recalls how he had helped her and Maria escape the palace. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Maria at the Palais Garnier. There, Dimitri tries to get Maria to see Anya, but she refuses, having heard of Dimitri&#x27;s scheme to con her. Anya overhears the conversation and leaves, furious that she fell for Dimitri’s scheme. Dimitri abducts Maria in her car to force her to see Anya. She agrees when he presents Anastasia&#x27;s music box. As Maria and Anya talk, Anya begins to regain her memories before she recognizes the music box and recalls the lullaby. Recognizing Anya as the true Anastasia, Maria tearfully reunites with her granddaughter.

Maria offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who helped them, but Dimitri declines it and leaves, planning to return to the Soviet Union and the Russian SFSR. At the celebration for her return, Anya is informed by her grandmother of Dimitri&#x27;s gesture, leaving her torn between staying with Maria or going with him. Upon noticing Pooka run off to the garden maze, Anya goes after him and ends up at the Pont Alexandre III, where Rasputin attacks her, while Bartok abandons Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save Anya but is knocked unconscious by a Pegasus statue enchanted by Rasputin. Anya smashes the reliquary, and the minions turn on and destroy Rasputin.

Anya and Dimitri elope. Anya sends a farewell letter to Maria and Sophie, promising to visit them. Meanwhile, Bartok falls in love with a female bat and briefly breaks the fourth wall to bid the audience goodbye.

In May 1994, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman had signed a long-term deal to produce animated features with 20th Century Fox, with the studio channeling more than $100 million in constructing a new animation studio. They selected Phoenix, Arizona, for the location of Fox Animation Studios because the state offered the company about $1 million in job training funds and low-interest loans for the state-of-the-art digital animation equipment. It was staffed with 300 artists and technicians, a third of whom worked with Bluth and Goldman in Dublin, Ireland, for Sullivan Bluth Studios. For their first project, the studio insisted they select one out of a dozen existing properties which they owned where Bluth and Goldman suggested adapting &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, though Bluth and Goldman felt it would be impossible to improve on Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s performance and Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s score. Following several story suggestions, the idea to adapt &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1956) originated from Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO Bill Mechanic. They would later adapt story elements from &quot;Pygmalion&quot; with the peasant Anya being molded into a regal woman.

Early into production, Bluth and Goldman began researching the actual events through enlisting former CIA agents stationed in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Around this same time, screenwriter Eric Tuchman had written a script. Eventually, Bluth and Goldman decided the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film. In 1995, Bruce Graham and Susan Gauthier reworked Tuchman&#x27;s script into a light-hearted romantic comedy. When Graham and Gauthier moved onto other projects, the husband-and-wife screenwriting team Bob Tzudiker and Noni White were hired for additional rewrites. Actress Carrie Fisher also made uncredited rewrites of the film, particularly the scene in which Anya leaves the orphanage for Paris.

For the villains, Bluth also did not take into consideration depicting Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and initially toyed with the idea of a police chief with a vendetta against Anastasia (an idea which the musical adaptation revived in the form of Gleb Vaganov). Instead, they decided to have Grigori Rasputin as the villain with Goldman explaining it was because of &quot;all the different things they did to try to destroy Rasputin and what a horrible man he really was, the more it seemed appetizing to make him the villain&quot;. In reality, Rasputin was already dead when the Romanovs were assassinated. In addition to this, Bluth created the idea for Bartok, the albino bat, as a sidekick for Rasputin: &quot;I just thought the villain had to have a comic sidekick, just to let everyone know that it was all right to laugh. A bat seemed a natural friend for Rasputin. Making him a white bat came later – just to make him different&quot;. Composers Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens recalled being at the Au Bon Pain in New York City where Rasputin and Bartok were pitched. They were dismayed at the decision to go down a historically inaccurate route; they made their stage musical adaption &quot;more sophisticated, more far-reaching, more political&quot; to encompass their original vision.

===Casting===
Bluth stated that Meg Ryan was his first and only choice for the title character, but Ryan was indecisive about accepting the role due to its dark historical events. To persuade her, the animation team took an audio clip of Annie Reed from &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and created an animation reel based on it which was screened for her following an invitation to the studio. Ryan later accepted the role; in her words &quot;I was blown away that they did that&quot;. Before Ryan was cast, Broadway singer and actress Liz Callaway was brought in to record several demos of the songs hoping to land a job in background vocals, but the demos were liked well enough by the songwriters that they were ultimately used in the final film.

After he was cast, John Cusack openly admitted that he couldn&#x27;t sing; his singing duties were performed by Jonathan Dokuchitz. Goldman had commented that originally, as with the rest of the cast, they were going to have Ryan record her lines separately from the others, with Bluth reading the lines of the other characters to her. However, after Ryan and the directors were finding the method to be too challenging when her character was paired with Dimitri, she and Cusack recorded the dialogue of their characters together, with Goldman noting that &quot;it made a huge difference&quot;.

Peter O&#x27;Toole was considered for the role of Rasputin, but Christopher Lloyd was hired because of his popularity from the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy. Bartok was initially written for Woody Allen, but the studio was reluctant to hire him following revelations of his relationship with his ex-partner Mia Farrow&#x27;s adoptive daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Martin Short was also considered, but Hank Azaria won the role ten minutes into his audition.

===Musical score and soundtrack album===

The film score was composed, co-orchestrated, and conducted by David Newman, whose father, Alfred Newman, composed the score of the 1956 film of the same name. The songs, of which &quot;Journey to the Past&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, were written by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The first song they wrote for the project was &quot;Once Upon a December&quot;; it was written during a heatwave &quot;so [they were] sweating and writing winter imagery&quot;. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released in CD and audio cassette format on October 28, 1997.

==Release==

20th Century Fox scheduled for &quot;Anastasia&quot; to be released on November 21, 1997, notably a week after the re-release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Disney claimed it had long-planned for the re-release to coincide with a consumer products campaign leading into Christmas and the film&#x27;s home video release in March 1998, as well continue the tradition of re-releasing their animated films within a seven-to-eight year interval. In addition to this, Disney would release several competing family films including &quot;Flubber&quot; on the following weekend, as well as a double feature of &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;. To avoid branding confusion, Disney banned television advertisements for &quot;Anastasia&quot; from being aired on the ABC program &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

Commenting on the studios&#x27; fierce competition, Disney spokesman John Dreyer brushed off allegations of studio rivalry, claiming: &quot;We always re-release our movies around holiday periods&quot;. However, Fox executives refused to believe Dreyer&#x27;s statement with Bill Mechanic responding that &quot;it&#x27;s a deliberate attempt to be a bully, to kick sand in our face. They can&#x27;t be trying to maximize their own business; the amount they&#x27;re spending on advertising is ridiculous... It&#x27;s a concentrated effort to keep our film from fulfilling its potential&quot;.

Despite this, the film is constantly confused to have been made by Disney due to its then contemporary films. This is not helped by the fact that 20th Century Fox, the film&#x27;s primary distributor, was eventually purchased by the Walt Disney Company in 2019, thus adding the film to the studio&#x27;s library and increasing confusion even more.

===Marketing===
&quot;Anastasia&quot; was accompanied by a marketing campaign of more than $50 million with promotional sponsors from Burger King, Dole Food Company, Hershey, Chesebrough-Ponds, Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Shell Oil, and the 1997 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Overall, the marketing costs exceeded that of &quot;Independence Day&quot; by more than 35 percent. For merchandising, Fox selected Galoob to license dolls based on Anastasia. Many storybooks adapted from the film were released by Little Golden Books. In August 1997, the SeaWorld theme parks in San Diego and Orlando featured a 40-foot-long, 20-foot-high inflatable playground for children called &quot;Anastasia&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;.

After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, in December 2022 Disney released its first merchandise based on the film in the form of a mug to honor its 25th anniversary.

===Home media===
On April 28, 1998, April 6, 1999 and November 16, 1999, &quot;Anastasia&quot; was released on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD respectively and sold eight million units. The film was first rereleased on February 19, 2002 as part of the Fox Family Features lineup alongside &quot;Thumbelina&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The film was again rereleased on a two-disc &quot;Family Fun Edition&quot; DVD with the film in its original theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen format on March 28, 2006. The first disc featured an optional audio commentary from directors/writers Bluth and Goldman, and additional bonus material. The second included a making-of documentary, music video and making-of featurette of Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Past&quot;, and additional bonus content. The film was released on Blu-ray on March 22, 2011; this included &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot; in the special features.

====Streaming====
Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 20th Century Fox on March 20, 2019, &quot;Anastasia&quot; became available on Disney+. In the U.S., it was removed from Disney+ on March 1, 2022, and transferred to Starz on March 18; contrary to popular belief, the film&#x27;s disappearance bears no connection to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine (Disney had suspended theatrical releases in Russia such as the then-upcoming &quot;Turning Red&quot;, which led to confusion that &quot;Anastasia&quot; withdrawal was related). &quot;Anastasia&quot; eventually returned to Disney+ on June 2, 2023.

==Reception==
&quot;Anastasia&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 84% based on 58 reviews and an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Beautiful animation, an affable take on Russian history, and strong voice performances make &quot;Anastasia&quot; a winning first film from Fox Animation Studios&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 61 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, praising &quot;the quality of the story&quot; and writing the result as entertaining and sometimes exciting. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave &quot;Anastasia&quot; three stars, calling the lead character &quot;pretty and charming&quot; but criticized the film for a lack of historical accuracy. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Though originality is not one of its accomplishments, &quot;Anastasia&quot; is generally pleasant, serviceable and eager to please. And any film that echoes the landscape of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; is hard to dislike for too long&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; noted the film was &quot;dazzlingly colorful&quot;, but felt that &quot;all the ingredients thrown into the pot don&#x27;t congeal entirely congenially, and the artistic touch applied doesn&#x27;t allow the whole to become more than the sum of its various, but invariably familiar, elements&quot;. Margaret McGurk, reviewing for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, described the film as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot;, and calling &quot;Anastasia&quot; as a tasty tale about a fairy-tale princess. Lisa Osbourne of &quot;Boxoffice&quot; called the film &quot;pure family entertainment&quot;. Awarding the film three out of five stars, &quot;Empire&quot;″s Philip Thomas wrote that despite historical inaccuracies, &quot;Anastasia&quot; manages to be a charming little movie.

Several critics have drawn positive comparisons between &quot;Anastasia&quot; and the Disney films released during the Disney Renaissance, noting similarities in their story and animation styles. Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; awarded the film three out of five stars. Likening its quality to that of a Disney animated film, Baumgarten wrote that &quot;Anastasia&quot; &quot;may not beat Disney at its own game, but it sure won&#x27;t be for lack of trying&quot;. Baumgarten continued that &quot;[t]his sumptuous-looking film clearly spared no expense in its visual rendering; its optical flourishes and attention to detail aim for the Disney gold standard and, for the most part, come pretty darn close&quot;. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; Jeffrey Gantz jokingly stated: &quot;[I]f imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, then the folks at Disney should feel royally complimented by Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s new animated feature about Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s youngest daughter&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Fox has a beautifully animated musical that can challenge Disney&#x27;s peer, but also said that &quot;Anastasia&quot; has inferior animation style compared to Disney&#x27;s and lacks its magic.

===Russian critical response===
Critical reception in Russia was also, for the most part, positive despite the artistic liberties that the film took with Russian history. Gemini Films, the Russian distributor of &quot;Anastasia&quot;, stressed the fact that the story was &quot;not history&quot;, but rather &quot;a fairy tale set against the background of real Russian events&quot; in the film&#x27;s Russian marketing campaign so that its Russian audience would not view &quot;Anastasia&quot; as a historical film. As a result, many Russians praised the film for its art and storytelling and saw it as not a piece of history but another Western import to be consumed and enjoyed.

Some Russian Orthodox Christians, on the other hand, found &quot;Anastasia&quot; to be an offensive depiction of the Grand Duchess, who was canonized as a new martyr in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Many historians echoed their sentiments, criticizing the film as a sanitized, sugar-coated reworking of the story of the Czar&#x27;s youngest daughter. While the filmmakers acknowledged the fact that &quot;&quot;Anastasia&quot; uses history only as a starting point&quot;, others complained that the film would provide its audience with misleading facts about Russian history, which, according to the author and historian Suzanne Massie, has been falsified for so many years. Similarly, the amateur historian Bob Atchison said that &quot;Anastasia&quot; was akin to someone making a film in which Anne Frank &quot;moves to Orlando and opens a crocodile farm with a guy named Mort&quot;.

Some of Anastasia&#x27;s contemporary relatives also felt that the film was distasteful, but most Romanovs have come to accept the &quot;repeated exploitation of Anastasia&#x27;s romantic tale... with equanimity&quot;.

===Box office===
A limited release of &quot;Anastasia&quot; at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on the weekend of November 14, 1997, grossed $120,541. The following weekend, the wide release of &quot;Anastasia&quot; in the United States earned $14.1 million, ranking second behind &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;. By the end of its theatrical run, &quot;Anastasia&quot; had grossed $58.4 million in the United States and Canada and $81.4 million internationally. The worldwide gross totaled up to about $139.8 million, making it Don Bluth&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date and beating out his next highest-grossing film, &quot;An American Tail&quot;, by about $55 million. This was Don Bluth&#x27;s first financially successful film since &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score and Best Original Song (for &quot;Journey to the Past&quot;). The R&amp;B singer Aaliyah performed the pop version at the ceremony.

==Adaptations and other media==
===Ice Follies===
&quot;Anastasia on Ice&quot; is a licensed adaptation produced by Feld Entertainment&#x27;s Ice Follies that ran from at least 1998 to 1999.

===Spin-off film===
In 1999, a direct-to-video standalone spin-off titled &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot; was released which focused on the character of Bartok.

===Stage musical adaptation===

Hartford Stage developed a stage production of &quot;Anastasia&quot;, with the book by Terrence McNally, lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, music by Stephen Flaherty and directed by Darko Tresnjak. The production ran from May 13 through June 19, 2016.

It is an original musical combining both the 1956 Arthur Laurents film and the 1997 animated film. The musical features six songs from the animated film and 16 new songs. Additionally, there have been some newly rewritten characters including Checkist secret police officer Gleb Vaganov (in the place of Rasputin), and Lily, who has been renamed in the place of Sophie. McNally said: &quot;This is a stage version for a modern theatre audience... The libretto&#x27;s &#x27;a blend&#x27; of old and new... There are characters in the musical that appear in neither the cartoon nor the Ingrid Bergman version&quot;.

The Hartford production featured Christy Altomare as Anastasia / Anya, Derek Klena as Dimitri, Mary Beth Peil as The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, Manoel Felciano as Gleb Vaganov, John Bolton as Vladimir, Caroline O&#x27;Connor as Lily, and Nicole Scimeca as Young Anastasia. The musical transferred to Broadway with much of the original Hartford cast, opening on April 24, 2017, at the Broadhurst Theater to mixed reviews.

<text>James Thomas &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell (May 17, 1903 – March 7, 1991) was an American center fielder and pitcher in Negro league baseball and the Mexican League from 1922 to 1946. He is considered to have been one of the fastest men ever to play the game. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. He ranked 66th on a list of the greatest baseball players published by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1999.

==Early life==
Bell was born on May 17, 1903, in Starkville, Mississippi, to Jonas Bell and Mary Nichols. The 1910 U.S. Census shows him as the fourth of seven children living with his widowed mother, Mary Nichols, in Sessums Township, just outside Starkville. His brother Fred Bell also played baseball. As a teenager, Bell worked at the creamery at Mississippi Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College, now Mississippi State University, and at the school&#x27;s agricultural experiment station.

At the age of 17, he moved to St. Louis to live with older brothers and attend high school. However, rather than attending night school as planned, Bell spent most of his time playing baseball in the neighborhood. He signed as a knuckleball pitcher with the Compton Hill Cubs, a black semi-pro baseball team, until the team broke up in August 1921. He played with Compton Hill on Sundays and holidays while he worked for a packing company during the week. For 1922, Bell moved to the East St. Louis Cubs, a semi-pro team that paid him $20 weekly to pitch on Sundays.

==Baseball career==

===Negro National League and East-West League===

Bell joined the St. Louis Stars of the Negro National League (NNL) as a pitcher in 1922. Bell earned his nickname in his first Negro league season; he was referred to as &quot;Cool&quot; after striking out standout player Oscar Charleston and added &quot;Papa&quot; to the nickname because it sounded better. At first, Bell made only occasional appearances in the outfield. By 1924, at the urging of manager Bill Gatewood, Bell began working on his defensive skills and appearing more in the outfield. And some sources say that it was Gatewood who first gave Bell his nickname.

Bell ultimately made a permanent move to center field and stopped pitching. Before becoming an outfielder, Bell batted right-handed and threw left-handed. His transition to the outfield was aided by learning to bat as a switch hitter. When he batted left-handed, his baserunning speed was even more trouble for opponents because he was a couple of steps closer to first base. Biographer Shaun McCormack points out that Bell did not have a strong throwing arm. However, Bell&#x27;s speed allowed him to play very shallow in the outfield and to still catch balls that were hit behind him.

Pitchers tried to avoid issuing walks to Bell, because he was often able to steal both second base and third base, scoring a run on the next play. Bell could also sometimes score a run if he was on first base and the batter got a base hit. Bell described the style of play on the occasions when the Negro league players faced white teams in exhibitions: &quot;We played a different kind of baseball than the white teams. We played tricky baseball. We did things they didn&#x27;t expect. We&#x27;d bunt and run in the first inning. Then when they would come in for a bunt we&#x27;d hit away. We always crossed them up. We&#x27;d run the bases hard and make the fielders throw too quick and make wild throws. We&#x27;d fake a steal home and rattle the pitcher into a balk.&quot;

Bell led the Stars to league titles in 1928, 1930, and 1931. While with the Stars, he played alongside close friend and shortstop Willie Wells and first baseman Mule Suttles. He moved to the Detroit Wolves of the East-West League when the NNL disbanded. The Wolves were owned by former Negro league star Cumberland Posey and they jumped to a first-place lead with a 29–13 win–loss record before the league disbanded. Attendance figures had remained too low in the wake of the Great Depression.

Bell bounced to the Kansas City Monarchs and the Mexican league until finding a home with the Pittsburgh Crawfords in the reorganized NNL. In Pittsburgh, he played with Ted Page and Jimmie Crutchfield to form what is considered by many to have been the best outfield in the Negro leagues. On the 1936 Crawfords team, Bell was one of six players who were subsequently inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

===Latin America===
Bell left the Crawfords in 1937 when owner Gus Greenlee defaulted on player salaries. Bell, Satchel Paige and other Crawfords players went to the Dominican Republic to play on a team assembled by dictator Rafael Trujillo. Trujillo felt that a baseball championship would strengthen his ruling power and he kept the players under armed supervision. Outside of Negro league players, the club featured Puerto Rican star Petrucho Cepeda, father of future Major League Baseball (MLB) Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda. They were led by Cuban manager Lázaro Salazar, who was later elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame.

While playing for Trujillo, the team members began to fear that losing might threaten their lives. Author Mark Ribowsky describes an experience with the team that was related to him by Crutchfield. After one loss, the players were said to have been met at the hotel by an Army officer who warned the team not to lose again, firing gunshots at the walls of the hotel courtyard. Bell was said to have been crying and wanting to leave the Dominican Republic. One of the Cubans on the team later denied any incidents involving gunfire, and Ribowsky points out that even Paige&#x27;s detailed writings never mentioned actual gunfire.

Ultimately, the team won the league championship, finishing ahead of two other clubs by four games or less. The second-place team featured several Negro league players, Cuban star Luis Tiant, Sr. and manager Martin Dihigo, a future Hall of Famer. The third-place club was intentionally composed of mostly Dominican players and only two Negro leaguers were on its roster. Trujillo was disappointed that a $30,000 team of Americans had barely beaten the competition, so his league was disbanded the next year and no organized baseball was played in the Dominican Republic for 12 years.

Bell went to the Mexican League, which was integrated, between 1938 and 1941. He spent the first two seasons with the team in Tampico, hitting for batting averages of .356 and .354. He split the 1940 season between teams in Torreón and Veracruz. In that season, Bell became the first Mexican League player to win the Triple Crown, leading the league with a .437 batting average, 12 home runs, and 79 runs batted in. He finished that year with 167 hits and eight of his home runs were inside-the-park home runs. Veracruz won the pennant that year. He spent his last Mexican League season in Monterrey. His career Mexican League batting average was .367.

===Return to the United States===
Bell came back to the United States in 1942 to play for the Chicago American Giants of the Negro American League. He joined the Homestead Grays in the NNL in 1943. The Grays won league championships in Bell&#x27;s first two seasons. In an attempt at a third consecutive title in 1945, the Grays lost in the league&#x27;s World Series. The 43-year-old hit .396 for the 1946 Grays. Bell became a player-manager for Negro league farm teams until 1950. He finished his Negro league career with a .341 batting average; he hit .391 in exhibitions against MLB players. Bell was a part-time scout for the St. Louis Browns from 1951 to 1954, when the team moved to Baltimore.

Though statistics were not meticulously maintained for most of Bell&#x27;s career, it is clear that he was known as one of the best players in Negro league baseball. As Paige noted in his autobiography, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Pitch Forever&quot;, &quot;If schools had known Cool Papa was around and if Cool Papa had known reading real good, he&#x27;d have made the best track man you ever saw.&quot; Anecdotes about Bell&#x27;s speed are still widely circulated; some are not easily believable, while others are thought to be true. Paige liked to refer to a story from one hotel at which he and Bell stayed. There was a short delay between flipping the light switch off and the lights actually going off due to faulty wiring, sufficient for Bell to jump into bed in the interim. Leaving out the explanatory details, Paige liked to say that Bell was so fast he could turn off the light and be under the covers before the room got dark. Legend also holds that Bell hit a ball up the middle of the field and that he was struck by the ball as he slid into second base.

In Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;Baseball&quot;, Bell was described as being so fast that he once scored from first on a sacrifice bunt. In an exhibition game against white all-stars, Bell is said to have broken for second on a bunt and run with Paige at the plate. By the time the ball reached Paige, Bell was almost to second and seeing the third baseman had broken towards home to field the bunt, rounded the bag. The catcher, Roy Partee of the Boston Red Sox, ran to third to cover the bag and an anticipated return throw from first. To his surprise, Bell rounded third and brushed by him on the way home; pitcher Murry Dickson of the St. Louis Cardinals had not thought to cover home with the catcher moving up the line, and Bell scored standing up. Bell once circled the bases in 13.1 seconds on a soggy field in Chicago; he claimed that he had done it in as few as 12 seconds in dry conditions.

Teammate Ted Page commented on the clean off-the-field lifestyle that Bell lived. He said that Bell was &quot;an even better man off the field than he was on it. He was honest. He was kind. He was a clean liver. In fact, in all of the years I&#x27;ve known him, I&#x27;ve never seen him smoke, take a drink or even say one cuss word.&quot;

==Later life and legacy==

After Bell&#x27;s playing and managing days were over, Bell lived in an old red-brick apartment in St. Louis. He worked as a scout for the St. Louis Browns for four years, then he served as a security officer and custodian at St. Louis City Hall until 1970. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. His Hall of Fame plaque highlights the fact that Bell&#x27;s contemporaries regarded him as the fastest runner on the base paths. He was the fifth Negro league player inducted into the Hall of Fame. Negro league players Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Monte Irvin and Buck Leonard were inducted between 1971 and 1973.
Bell suffered a heart attack and he died at Saint Louis University Hospital on March 7, 1991; his wife Clara had died a few weeks earlier. In his honor, Dickson Street, on which he lived, was renamed James &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell Avenue. He was also inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Cool Papa Bell Drive is the road leading into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in Jackson, of which he is a member. The St. Louis Cardinals have recognized Bell&#x27;s contributions by erecting a bronze statue of him outside Busch Stadium along with other Hall of Fame St. Louis baseball stars, including Stan Musial, Lou Brock and Bob Gibson.

References to Bell appeared in &quot;Hanging Curve&quot; by Troy Soos, a 1999 novel about the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. He was also noted in the 1994 movie &quot;Cobb&quot;, in which Ty Cobb, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is chided for being a lesser player than Bell. His character makes a brief appearance in the 2009 feature film &quot;The Perfect Game&quot;, encouraging and aiding the 1957 Little League World Series champion team from Monterrey, Mexico; the role is played by Lou Gossett Jr.

In 1999, Bell was ranked 66th on The Sporting News list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players, one of five players so honored who played all or most of his career in the Negro leagues, and was nominated for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

He is the subject of the song &quot;Cool Papa Bell&quot; on Paul Simon&#x27;s 13th studio album &quot;Stranger to Stranger&quot;.

He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his &quot;significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.&quot; as part of the Homestead Grays on August 10, 2010.

On May 13, 2021, Mississippi State University unveiled the Cool Papa Bell Plaza and mural honoring Bell&#x27;s life and accomplishments at famed Dudy Noble Field.

In August 2022, a harness racing horse named Cool Papa Bell won the $1 million Hambletonian in the biggest upset in the 97-year history of the race. The horse received the Dan Patch Award for Three-Year-Old Male Trotter that year.

Sculptor Gareth Curtiss was commissioned by Starkville to create a statue in his honor. The statue will be in Starkville&#x27;s Cornerstone Park.

<doc id="284758" wikidata="Q1322045" url="?curid=284758" title="G4S">
<text>G4S is a British multinational private security company headquartered in London, England. The company was set up in July 2004 when London-based Securicor amalgamated with Danish firm Group 4 Falck. The company offers a range of services, including the supply of security personnel, monitoring equipment, response units and secure prisoner transportation. G4S also works with governments overseas to deliver security services.

G4S is the world&#x27;s largest security company measured by revenues. It has operations in more than 90 countries. With over 533,000 employees, by 2012 it was the largest European and African private employer.

The company has been criticised and involved in numerous controversies. Formerly a dual-listed company with listings on the Copenhagen and London stock exchanges, G4S was purchased by Allied Universal in April 2021.

==History==
===Origins===
G4S has its origins in a guarding business founded in Copenhagen in 1901 by Marius Hogrefe, originally known as &quot;København Frederiksberg Nattevagt&quot; (&quot;Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Night Watch&quot;) and subsequently renamed Falck.

In 2000, Group 4, a security firm formed in the 1960s, merged with Falck to form Group 4 Falck and by 2000 the company was described as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest private security systems company&quot;. In 2002 Group 4 Falck went on to buy The Wackenhut Corporation in the United States.

===2004 to 2010===
G4S was formed in July 2004, when Group 4 Falck&#x27;s security business merged with Securicor to create Group 4 Securicor and began trading on both the Copenhagen and London Stock Exchanges. In 2005, Lars Nørby Johansen was succeeded as chief executive by Nick Buckles and, in 2006, the new G4S brand identity, designed by Russell Johnson of UK design agency Stylus, was rolled out across its business worldwide. In the same year, Alf Duch-Pedersen succeeded Jørgen Philip-Sørensen to become the non-executive chairman of the business.

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, G4S was the subject of a global campaign by union workers alleging that its subsidiaries undermine labour and human rights standards. Some of these groups were organised under the banner of the SEIU-funded Focus on Group 4 Securicor. This group supported protests at Group 4 Securicor&#x27;s annual general meeting in London in 2005.

The 2006, &quot;US State Department Report on Human Rights in Indonesia&quot;, released in March 2006, featured the ongoing dispute in Jakarta with Group4/Securicor. In July 2006, the Indonesian Securicor workers had a substantial win – but the campaigners continue to support other Group 4 Securicor workers. The company disputed these claims and pointed to its strong relationships with unions around the world, including the GMB in Britain. In March 2008, it was announced that G4S were taking over Scottish Rock Steady Group – who steward at major sporting and music events mostly in the UK. Rock Steady events have included Live8 concerts in London, Scottish Cup Final and the Download Festival. In April 2008, G4S acquired RONCO Consulting Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s premier humanitarian and commercial mine action, ordnance disposal and security companies.

In May 2008, G4S acquired ArmorGroup International. GSL, a provider of outsourced justice services, was also acquired by G4S in May 2008. Also, in the same month, G4S acquired Serbian company Progard Securitas. In 2008, G4S also acquired Touchcom, Inc. for US$23 million. Touchcom, Inc. is located in the Burlington/Bedford, Massachusetts, area. The rebranding of Touchcom, Inc. to G4S was completed by 1 January 2012. In December 2008, G4S and UNI Global Union, announced the launch of an &quot;Ethical Employment Partnership&quot;, which will drive improvements in standards across the global security industry. Simultaneous to this, G4S and the SEIU reached an agreement to end their long dispute and establish a framework to work together in the interest of employees.

In 2009, G4S continued to acquire companies: Secura Monde International and Shiremoor International Engineering, together, the UK&#x27;s leading specialist banknote and high security technical and commercial advisory companies; All Star International for $60 million, one of the premier facilities management and base operations support companies providing services to the US government; Adesta, US-based provider of integrated security systems and communication systems; and Hill &amp; Associates Consultants Limited, Asia&#x27;s leading provider of specialist risk-mitigation consulting services. The Västberga helicopter robbery occurred on 23 September 2009 at 05:15 CET when a G4S cash service depot was robbed in Västberga in southern Stockholm, Sweden. In the autumn of 2009, G4S personnel in Australia went on strike, arguing that the company had subjected them to low pay and poor working conditions. The strike imperiled the operations of the court system in the state of Victoria. The guards provided entry-point screening for weapons and bombs in both the County Court and Magistrates Court, as well as additional security in the court rooms themselves.

===Since 2010===
G4S acquired the South African cash in transit company Skycom in September 2010. Then in April 2011, it bought the Cotswold Group, a surveillance and investigations company.

====Acquisitions of Guidance Monitoring and Chubb====
In April 2011, G4S acquired Guidance Monitoring, an international designer and manufacturer of electronic monitoring technologies, including hardware and software used for offender monitoring and tracking. In December 2011, G4S acquired the assets of Chubb Emergency Response, a large key holding company in the UK. The deal was finalised on 17 December 2011. The business has now been integrated into their existing key holding and response service.

====Aborted acquisition of ISS====
On 17 October 2011, G4S announced it would purchase the Denmark-based facilities management group ISS for £5.2 billion. The acquisition would have created the world&#x27;s largest facilities management company. Within two weeks, the deal was dropped due to lack of shareholder support. G4S&#x27;s chief, Nick Buckles, recounted the events of the failed acquisition, which cost the company tens of millions of dollars, as &quot;...one of the most bruising experiences of my life&quot;. A combination of institutional investors who led the response and the minority shareholders who followed, objected to a variety of factors, not the least of which was the additional leverage and debt the deal would introduce to G4S&#x27;s balance sheet. General consensus is that lack of planning for shareholder response on the G4S side doomed the deal. Furthermore, many investors and analysts questioned why the company would want to purchase a firm so far removed from its area of expertise. Alf Duch-Pedersen resigned as G4S chairman after the failure of this acquisition and was replaced by John Connolly.

====Management and other changes====
In March 2012, G4S announced that it would sell the &quot;struggling&quot; G4S Government Solutions business (the former Wackenhut (WSI) and All Star business) to exit the US government services. In May 2013, Buckles resigned as chief executive of G4S with £1.2 million payoff and was replaced by Ashley Almanza.

====Failure to meet London 2012 Security Contract====
On 12 July 2012, it was announced that 3,500 British troops would be deployed at the 2012 Summer Olympics due to a shortage of adequately trained G4S security staff, with Labour MP Keith Vaz claiming that, &quot;G4S has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops&quot;. Shares in G4S later dropped nine percent after the firm claimed it faced a possible £50 million loss as a result of failing to provide sufficient trained staff for the 2012 Olympic Games. On 17 July, the company&#x27;s chief executive, Nick Buckles, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee, where he apologised for the organisational failings, expressed regret at having taken on the Olympic security contract, and agreed in principle to pay bonuses to soldiers drafted at the last moment as replacement security staff. Pressed by Labour MP David Winnick, he was forced to admit that organisational situation had become a &quot;humiliating shambles&quot;.

In Newcastle, G4S was replaced by 500 staff from local security firms for Olympic events.
In Scotland, G4S was stripped of the security role with it passing to Strathclyde Police. At Dorney Lake, the Olympic rowing and canoeing venue, a G4S manager reported G4S radios were not working, so staff were relying on personal mobile phones to communicate; G4S confirmed the venue was being manned by military personnel after 66 percent of rostered G4S staff were failing to show. The venue manager reported parts of the CCTV system had already been replaced by Army patrols and a complete army takeover was &quot;on the cards&quot;.

On 22 July 2012, a contractor reported that a third of his expected staff had not turned up; instead, he was sent a group of mainly female, teenage students with minimal training, whom he turned away as he did not feel comfortable leaving them for night duties. On 8 August 2012, G4S announced that it had finally contracted enough employees to fully fulfil its contract for the Olympic games. Although missing its initial target of 10,000, G4S announced the sending of 7,000 personnel each day to Olympic venues, in a way they felt would allow them to fully secure each venue. Subsequent to the Olympics contract failures, the chief constables of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire were to recommend abandoning outsourcing work to G4S. They were backed by Jim Paice, the agriculture minister and Conservative MP for South East Cambridgeshire. Following the Olympic Games, G4S provided a donation of £2.5 million to military charities as a goodwill gesture.

====Sale of Wackenhut Pakistan====
G4S announced in late August 2012 that it would be selling its Pakistan division, Wackenhut Pakistan Limited, to its chairman Ikram Sehgal for a figure of around $10 million, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.
Sehgal disputed this figure, calling it &quot;speculative&quot;, according to the &quot;Express Tribune&quot;.

====Public Eye Award====
G4S was one of the nominees for the 2013 Public Eye Award, a counter-event created by NGOs, which awards the worst company of the year.

====Employee Omar Mateen and Orlando massacre connection====
G4S was in the news in June 2016 because of employee Omar Mateen, the gunman behind one of the worst mass-shooting incidents in United States history (where 49 were killed), who was employed as a security guard by the company. In October 2006, Mateen had begun working as a recruit for the Florida Department of Corrections, being assigned to the Martin Correctional Institution. In a letter explaining his juvenile record as part of his successful application, Mateen explained the incident of when he was arrested at school when he was fourteen. Following the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007, Mateen suggested in a corrections officer training class that he would bring a gun to class. P.H. Skipper, who was the warden at institution, wrote that &quot;in light of the tragic events at Virginia Tech officer Mateen&#x27;s inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing&quot;. Days later on 27 April 2007, Mateen &quot;was involuntarily dismissed&quot; from the program and never became a certified corrections officer.

Mateen then worked for British-based security firm G4S Secure Solutions in Jupiter, Florida, from September 2007 until his death. The company said two screenings of Mateen—one conducted upon hiring and the other in 2013—had raised no red flags. Nonetheless, G4S removed Mateen from his job post at a courthouse because of threats he made towards coworkers, including one threat where he claimed he would have al-Qaeda kill a deputy&#x27;s family. Mateen had claimed that his coworkers and courthouse deputies were making racist comments towards him. Despite this, G4S &quot;kept Mateen as an employee&quot; but moved him &quot;to a kiosk at a gated community in Palm Beach County.&quot; They never informed the community or its property management company about why he was transferred there.

Mateen held an active concealed carry permit and an armed security guard licence. He was said to have passed a psychological test and medical exam performed by Dr. Syed Shafeeq Rahman, who had close ties with Mateen&#x27;s family. It was also noted that Mateen had no criminal record. According to licensing records, he was a proficient shooter who scored in the 98th percentile with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.

After the shooting, a psychologist, who was said to have evaluated and cleared Mateen for his firearms licence in 2007, according to the records of the security company G4S, denied ever meeting him or having lived in Florida at the time, and said she had stopped her practice in Florida in January 2006. G4S admitted Mateen&#x27;s form had a &quot;clerical error&quot;, and clarified that he had instead been cleared by Rahman, who was from the same firm that bought the wrongly-named doctor&#x27;s practice. Rahman had not interviewed Mateen, but evaluated the results of a standard test used in the screening he undertook before being hired.

====Birmingham Prison====
On 16 December 2016, some 600 prisoners took part in a riot at HM Prison Birmingham, a prison in Birmingham, England, operated by G4S. The disturbance was described as the worst in Britain since the 1990 Strangeways riot. The national chairman of the Prison Officers Association said more than 30 officers at the prison had quit in the weeks before the riot and that further prison convulsions were inevitable.

In a statement to Parliament, Secretary of State for Justice Liz Truss said that insufficient staffing lay at the root of the twelve-hour Birmingham riot and that G4S would have to pay the costs of deploying ten highly trained public sector Tornado elite teams, who were sent to quell the riot. John Thornhill, the president of the independent monitoring board, agreed that insufficient staff had caused rising levels of violence in prisons in England and Wales, leading to &quot;unrestrained violence&quot; and the transfer of a &quot;large number of prisoners ... to other prisons that are already stretched with their own problems and staffing issues.&quot;

In August 2018 its contract to run Birmingham Prison was revoked, after Peter Clarke, the Government&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons reported that it was the worst he had ever visited.

====Profit margins====
Ben Saunders, the head of two British immigrant centres that have been the focus of abuse of detainees was put on leave in September 2017. A parliamentary committee chair and the Opposition Labour shadow home secretary complained that G4S&#x27;s contract with the Home Office limited it to a 6.8% profit on operations, but instead the pre-tax profit margins appear to have ranged from 20% to 30%. Saunders had previously directed the Medway Secure Training Centre where juveniles had been found to have been abused before G4S had divested itself of its youth detention component.

====Acquisition by Allied Universal====
In late 2020 GardaWorld and Allied Universal made takeover offers for the company. In February 2021 the Allied Universal offer was accepted with G4S delisted from the Copenhagen and London Stock Exchanges. In April 2021, the acquisition was completed.

==Operations==
===Activities===

G4S&#x27;s core services include &#x27;manned security services&#x27; – where it provides trained and screened security officers. The company also provides &#x27;security systems&#x27; such as access control, CCTV, intruder alarms, fire detection, video analytics and security and building systems integration technology. &#x27;Monitoring and response services&#x27; is another core service, where G4S provides key holding, mobile security patrol and response services and alarm receiving and monitoring facilities. G4S also provides &#x27;secure facilities services&#x27; which includes integrated facilities services for entire sites or estates for commercial customers and governments. The business provides &#x27;risk management and consultancy services&#x27; which also includes mine detection and clearance services. G4S also provides electronic tagging and monitoring of offenders at home or in the community. The company provides back-office support functions for police forces, support for front-line policing, including the provision of custody suite services and forensic medical services. It also manages juvenile and adult custody centres. This includes the management of all aspects of a facility and those held within the facility – similar centres are also used for the detention of asylum applicants. Prisoner escorting is another core service. G4S transports prisoners and asylum applicants between courts, police stations and custody centres.

In the early 2000s, the company (then still known as Group 4 Falck) bid unsuccessfully for the right to operate several railway franchises in the United Kingdom.

In 2013, G4S Forensic and Medical Services were awarded a three-year contract to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands. It has been working in this area since 2005. The firm provides patient transport services for NHS Trusts including Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust; Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust; St George&#x27;s Healthcare NHS Trust (£2.7 million a year), and Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust (£3.5 million a year).

In 2014, the Austrian Ministry of the Interior awarded G4S a contract to run a detention center in Vordernberg; this was the first privately operated prison in Austria.

One of G4S&#x27; more interesting contracts may be securing the perimeter of Homey Airport, more commonly known as Area 51, the secret United States Air Force base in Nevada. The base is guarded by civilians forces referred to by those who watch the base as Camo Dudes.

As of 2018, G4S operates two private prisons in Australia: Mount Gambier Prison and Port Phillip Prison.

===Operating structure===
G4S segments its business into two areas:
* &quot;Secure Solutions&quot; which includes services for commercial and government organisations in areas such as risk consulting, manned security, and security systems.
* &quot;Cash Solutions&quot; which is the outsourcing of cash-cycle management for banks, financial institutions and retailers – making up 18 percent of G4S&#x27;s turnover.

==Corporate social responsibility==
In 2011, G4S became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, the international standard to promote socially responsible business behaviour including human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. In 2013, G4S launched a Human Rights Policy, co-authored by human rights expert Dr Hugo Slim, aiming to align the company&#x27;s practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to introduce additional global guidelines for areas not currently covered by existing standards.

G4S is a founder signatory of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (ICoC), a multi-stakeholder initiative convened by the Swiss government.

==Sponsorships==
In 2007, G4S began the G4S 4teen, an award-winning program to support 14 young athletes around the world. G4S provided financial, social and logistical support to a number of athletes taking part in London 2012, including Colombian cyclist and 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medallist Mariana Pajón, Kenyan long-distance runner Pauline Korikwiang, and Estonia&#x27;s former discus thrower and shot-putter, now-Indianapolis Colts defensive end Margus Hunt.

==Controversies==

Controversies involving the company have included use of immigrant-detainee labour in prisons, extreme misconduct in child custodial institutions in the UK and the US, allegations of police telephone data manipulation, its troubled nine-year employment of Orlando, Florida terrorist Omar Mateen, the escape of Thabo Bester from Mangaung Prison in South Africa, and the 2016 riot at Birmingham Prison in Birmingham, England.

G4S has also been a target of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement for its involvement in Israel. In June 2023, it was reported that G4S would be divesting completely from Israel in response to years of campaigning pressure and “reputational damage”. G4S’ parent company, Allied Universal, was also said to have divested from Israel.

<text>A private prison, or for-profit prison, is a place where people are imprisoned by a third party that is contracted by a government agency. Private prison companies typically enter into contractual agreements with governments that commit prisoners and then pay a per diem or monthly rate, either for each prisoner in the facility, or for each place available, whether occupied or not. Such contracts may be for the operation only of a facility, or for design, construction and operation.

==Global spread==
In 2013, countries that were currently using private prisons or in the process of implementing such plans included Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, and South Korea. However, at the time, the sector was still dominated by the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

==Australia==
Australia opened its first private prison, Borallon Correctional Centre, in 1990.

In 2018, 18.4% of prisoners in Australia were held in private prisons.
=== Arguments for and against ===
A 2016 article by Anastasia Glushko (a former worker in the private prison sector) argues in favor of privately owned prisons in Australia. According to Glushko, private prisons in Australia have decreased the costs of holding prisoners and increased positive relationships between inmates and correctional workers. Outsourcing prison services to private companies has allowed for costs to be cut in half. Compared with $270 a day in a government-run West Australian jail, each prisoner in the privately operated Acacia Prison near Perth costs the taxpayer $182. Glushko also says positive prisoner treatment was observed during privatisation in Australia by including more respectful attitudes to prisoners and mentoring schemes, increased out-of-cell time and more purposeful activities.

However, a 2016 report from the University of Sydney found that in general, all states of Australia lacked a comprehensive approach to hold private prisons accountable to the government. The authors said that of all the states, Western Australia had the &quot;most developed regulatory approach&quot; to private prison accountability, as they had learnt from the examples in Queensland and Victoria. Western Australia provided much information about the running of private prisons in the state to the public, making it easier to assess performance. However the authors note that in spite of this, overall it is difficult to compare the performance and costs of private and public prisons as they often house different kinds and numbers of prisoners, in different states with different regulations. They note that Acacia Prison, sometimes held up as an example of how private prisons can be well run, cannot serve as a general example of prison privatisation.

=== Private immigration prisons ===
Several Australian immigration prisons are privately operated, including the Nauru Regional Processing Centre which is located on the pacific island country of Nauru and operated by Broadspectrum on behalf of the Australian Government, with security sub-contracted to Wilson Security. Immigration prisons typically hold people who have overstayed or lack a visa, or otherwise broken the terms of their visas. Some, such as the facility on Nauru, hold asylum seekers, refugees and even young children who can be detained indefinitely. In many cases people have been detained for years without charge or trial. This, as well as poor conditions, neglect, harsh treatment and deaths in some of the centers, has been the source of controversy in Australia and internationally.

==Canada==
There have been three notable private detention facilities in Canada to date, and all have either gone defunct or reverted to government control.

The only private adult prison in Canada was the maximum-security Central North Correctional Centre in Penetanguishene, Ontario, operated by the U.S.-based Management and Training Corporation from its opening in 2001 through the end of its first contract period in 2006. The contract was held by the Ontario provincial Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. A government comparison between the Central North &quot;super-jail&quot; and a nearly identical facility found that the publicly run prison had measurably better outcomes.

Two youth detention centres in Canada were operated by private companies, both at the provincial level. The Encourage Youth Corporation operated Project Turnaround in Hillsdale, Ontario under contract from the Government of Ontario from 1997 to 2004, after which the facility was shut down. In New Brunswick, the multinational private prison firm GEO Group constructed and operated the Miramichi Youth Detention Centre under contract with the province&#x27;s Department of Public Safety before its contract was ended in the 1990s following public protests.

As of mid-2012, private prison companies continued to lobby the Correctional Service of Canada for contract business.

==France==
The involvement of the private sector in prisons in France grew significantly between 1987 and the late 2000s, as reported by French scholar Fabrice Guilbaud. France&#x27;s system is semi-private: so-called non-sovereign missions (kitchen, laundry, maintenance) are delegated to private companies, while guard and security functions are left to the State. Organization of inmate labor in prison workshops is another task that has been delegated to prison management companies. There are however no prisons in France in which every aspect of the prison is run by the private sector, as in the UK. The French approach to privatisation therefore necessarily divorces security and production functions.
Prison is a space of forced confinement where the overriding concern is security. The fact is that at several levels, and depending on the type of prison (high security or not), production logic clashes with security logic. Structural limitations of production in a prison can restrict private companies’ profit-taking capacities. A field study conducted by Guilbaud in 2004 and 2005 in five prisons chosen by prison and management type shows that the intensity of the tension between production and security, and the various ways in which this tension arises and is handled, vary by type of prison (short-stay, for convicts awaiting sentencing, or relatively long-stay for sentence-serving inmates) and type of management. The production/security tension seems better integrated in public-sector prisons than in those managed by the private sector in the sense that it produces fewer conflicts in them. This result runs counter to the widespread understanding that shaped the 1987 reform, the idea that introducing private enterprise and the professionalism associated with it into prisons would improve inmate employment and prison operation.

It is worth noting that in the UK, this problem is overcome by handing over all aspects of management, including both security and prisoners&#x27; work, to the operating company, thereby achieving the integration of the two.

==Israel==
=== Initial attempt ===
In 2004, the Israeli Knesset passed a law permitting the establishment of private prisons in Israel. The Israeli government&#x27;s motivation was to save money by transferring prisoners to facilities managed by a private firm. The state would pay the franchisee $50 per day for inmate, sparing itself the cost of building new prisons and expanding the staff of the Israel Prison Service. In 2005, the Human Rights Department of the Academic College of Law in Ramat Gan filed a petition with the Israeli Supreme Court challenging the law. The petition relied on two arguments; first, it said transferring prison powers to private hands would violate the prisoners&#x27; fundamental human rights to liberty and dignity. Secondly, a private organization always aims to maximize profit, and would therefore seek to cut costs by, such means as skimping on prison facilities and paying its guards poorly, thus further undermining the prisoners&#x27; rights. As the case awaited decision, the first prison was built by the concessionaire, Lev Leviev&#x27;s Africa Israel Investments, a facility near Beersheba designed to accommodate 2,000 inmates.

===Israeli Supreme Court rejection===
In November 2009, an expanded panel of 9 judges of the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that privately run prisons are illegal, and that for the State to transfer authority for managing the prison to a private contractor whose aim is monetary profit would severely violate the prisoners&#x27; basic human rights to dignity and freedom.

Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch wrote: &quot;Israel&#x27;s basic legal principles hold that the right to use force in general, and the right to enforce criminal law by putting people behind bars in particular, is one of the most fundamental and one of the most invasive powers in the state&#x27;s jurisdiction. Thus when the power to incarcerate is transferred to a private corporation whose purpose is making money, the act of depriving a person of [their] liberty loses much of its legitimacy. Because of this loss of legitimacy, the violation of the prisoner&#x27;s right to liberty goes beyond the violation entailed in the incarceration itself.&quot;

==New Zealand==
The use of private prisons has also been tried, stopped and reintroduced. New Zealand&#x27;s first privately run prison, the Auckland Central Remand Prison, also known as Mt. Eden Prison, opened under contract to Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) in 2000. In 2004, the Labour Government, opposed to privatisation, amended the law to prohibit the extension of private prison contracts. A year later, the 5-year contract with ACM was not renewed. In 2010, the National Government again introduced private prisons and international conglomerate Serco was awarded the contract to run the Mt Eden Prison. 

On 16 July 2015, footage of &quot;fight clubs&quot; within the prison emerged online and was reported by TVNZ. Serco was heavily criticized for not investigating until after the footage was screened. On 24 July 2015, Serco&#x27;s contract to run the Mount Eden prison was revoked due to numerous scandals and operation was given back to the New Zealand Department of Corrections. Serco was ordered to pay $8 million to the New Zealand government as a result of problems at Mount Eden Prison while it was under Serco&#x27;s management.

Serco has also been given the contract to build and manage a 960-bed prison at Wiri. The contract with Serco provides for stiff financial penalties if its rehabilitation programmes fail to reduce re-offending by 10% more than the Corrections Department programmes. The prison is estimated to cost nearly NZ$400 million. In response, Charles Chauvel, the Labour Party&#x27;s spokesperson for justice, and the Public Service Association both questioned the need for a new private prison when there were 1,200 empty beds in the prison system. In March 2012, Corrections Minister Anne Tolley announced that the new Wiri prison would enable older prisons such as Mt Crawford in Wellington and the New Plymouth prison to be closed. Older units at Arohata, Rolleston, Tongariro/Rangipo and Waikeria prisons will also be shut down.

The Auckland South Corrections Facility was opened on 8 May 2015. The contract to operate the prison ends in 2040. As of 2016, 10% of prisoners in New Zealand were housed in private prisons.

==South Korea==
Somang Correctional Institution in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, is the only private prison for adult inmates in South Korea. The correctional institution was set up with an investment of 30 billion won (US$27 million) from the Christian Agape Foundation and opened on 1 December 2010. It is capable of accommodating up to 400 prisoners with convictions for violent crimes, but inmates at the prison usually serve sentences of less than seven years or have less than a year remaining on longer terms.

==United Kingdom==
===Number of prisoners===
* In 2018, 18.46% of prisoners in England and Wales were housed in private prisons.
* 15.3% of prisoners in Scotland were housed in private prisons.

===Development===
The privatization of prisons can be traced to the contracting out of confinement and care of prisoners after the American Revolution. Deprived of the ability to ship criminals and undesirables to the Colonies, Great Britain began placing them on hulks (used as prison ships) moored in English ports.

In the modern era, the United Kingdom was the first European country to use for-profit prisons. Wolds Prison opened as the first privately managed prison in the UK in 1992. This was enabled by the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 which empowered the Home Secretary to contract out prison services to the private sector.

In addition, a number of the UK&#x27;s Immigration Removal Centres are privately operated, including the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre, Yarl&#x27;s Wood Immigration Removal Centre, and Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre.

In 2007 the new Scottish National Party Government in Scotland announced that it was opposed to privately run prisons and would not let any more contracts. Since then, new prisons in Scotland have been built and run by the public sector. The last contract let in England and Wales was for HM Prison Northumberland, which transferred from the public sector to Sodexo in 2013. The most recent new prison to be built in England and Wales, HM Prison Berwyn near Wrexham, was given to the public sector to operate without any competition when it opened in 2017. Since 2017, it has been Labour Party policy not to commission any new private prisons in England and Wales.

On 5 November 2018, the prisons minister, Rory Stewart, told the House of Commons that two new prisons at Wellingborough, Northants, and Glen Parva, Leicestershire, would be built using conventional public finance, but their operation would be contracted out. On 29 November, he announced a framework competition, under which private operators would seek to be placed on a list of companies which would be eligible to bid in future competitions, including the planned programme for 10,000 new places to replace old prisons, and also for prisons currently operated privately, when those contracts end. It was implied that the public sector would be excluded from all such competitions. He said: &quot;This Government remains committed to a role for the private sector in operating custodial services. The competition launched today will seek to build on the innovation and different ways of working that the private sector has previously introduced to the system. The sector has an important role to play, and currently runs some high-performing prisons, as part of a decent and secure prison estate...A balanced approach to custodial services provision, which includes a mix of public, voluntary and private sector involvement has been shown to introduce improvements and deliver value for money for taxpayers.&quot;

The Secretary of State for Justice announced on 9 July 2019 that 6 companies had been accepted on to the Prison Operators Service Framework: G4S Care and Custody Services UK Limited, Interserve Investments Limited, Management and Training Corporation Works Limited, Mitie Care &amp; Custody, Serco Limited, and Sodexo Limited. Of the two new contenders, Interserve had operated offender services in the community as part of the Purple Futures consortium: the Chief Inspector of Probation had rated 4 out of their 5 operations as ‘requiring improvement’. The other, MTC, has run prisons in the USA, several of which have been the subject of serious failures and scandals.

The Secretary of State added: &quot;The Government is committed to a mixed market of custodial services. The Prison Operator Framework will increase the diversity and resilience of the custodial services market in England and Wales, by creating a pool of prison operators who can provide high quality, value for money, custodial and maintenance services and enable us to effectively and efficiently manage a pipeline of competition over the next six years.&quot;

On 26 June 2020 the Government announced plans for a further 4 prisons, although a site only exists for one of them. It claimed, without evidence, that the new prisons would cut reoffending. It stated that at least one of the four would be publicly run.

===Contractual arrangements===
In the UK there are three ways in which a private company may take on management of a prison:

# Companies compete to finance, design, build and run a new prison under the private finance initiative. Most prisons in the UK are of this kind, although the use of PFI has now been abandoned.
# The Government builds a prison and then contracts out its operation.
# A prison formerly operated by the public sector prison service may be contracted out after competition (&quot;market testing&quot;).

Prisons may be re-competed at the end of the contract. Increasingly, a range of services within all prisons, whether public or privately run, are contracted out on a regional basis: this includes works and FM services, and rehabilitation programmes.

===Governance and accountability===
Privately run prisons are run under contracts which set out the standards that must be met. Payments may be deducted for poor performance against the contract. Government monitors (&quot;controllers&quot;) work permanently within each privately managed prison to check on conditions and treatment of prisoners. The framework for regulation and accountability is much the same for privately run prisons as for publicly run ones. In England and Wales they are subject to unannounced inspection by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, to monitoring by local Independent Monitoring Boards and prisoner complaints are dealt with by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman. Similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

===Evaluation===

There has been little systematic, objective evaluation of private prisons in the UK. The best study, by the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge University, using direct observation of staff and prisoner behaviour, found that public sector staff tended to be more knowledgeable and confident, while the private sector treated prisoners more respectfully, though one private prison scored well on both. Earlier, cruder, studies came to broadly the same conclusion. Another study found marked improvements in prisoner quality of life at Birmingham prison after transfer from public to private sector (though subsequently, conditions at Birmingham deteriorated to such a degree that the contract was ended and the prison returned to public operation). An analysis of performance assessments of individual prisons by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and by the Prison Service suggested no consistent difference in service quality between sectors The same study showed that construction and operating costs were for many years much lower in the private sector, but that the gap has narrowed. In May 2019, the Labour Party spokesman on prisons published data showing that the rate of assaults in privately run local prisons is around 40% higher than in publicly run ones.

===Controversies===

In early 2012, Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform said Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Prisons encountered an almost nine-fold rise in restraint used in the previous year at Ashfield Young Offenders Institution, which holds 15- to 18-year-olds. She cited &quot;many incidents of strip searching children unnecessarily&quot;. Force had been used almost 150 times a month compared to 17 times monthly the prior year, recalling it had &quot;chilling echoes&quot; of circumstances in the choking death of a 15-year-old at Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre after restraints had been applied. Frequent use of force followed failure of wards to obey staff instructions. Three years earlier the institution recorded more than 600 attacks on inmates in one year - the highest number of every jail, including adults, in the country. Crook claimed &quot;This jail has a history of failing children and the public.&quot; Managers claimed the increase was due to better reporting of the use of restraints. The institution had been half full during the previous unannounced inspection in 2010. The chief inspector of prisons noted &quot;some staff lacked confidence in challenging poor behaviour.&quot; The director of the prison and the YOI admitted there is &quot;room for improvement.&quot;

Six members of staff were dismissed from G4S-operated Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre for children in Rugby in May 2015 following a series of incidents of gross misconduct. G4S took the action in response to an Ofsted inspection that reported some staff being on drugs while on duty, colluding with detainees and behaving &quot;extremely inappropriately&quot;. The behaviour allegedly included causing distress and humiliation to children by subjecting them to degrading treatment and racist comments.

Four G4S team leaders of Medway Secure Training Centre in Rochester were arrested in January 2016 and four other staff members were placed on restricted duties, following an investigation by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; TV programme into the centre. Allegations in the television programme included foul language and use of unnecessary force – such physical violence, overuse of restraint techniques (causing one teenager to have difficulties breathing) – on 10 boys aged 14 to 17, as well as a cover-up involving members of staff by avoiding surveillance cameras in order not to be recorded, and purposefully misreporting incidents in order to avoid potential fines and punishment; for example, in one exchange, it was claimed some staff don&#x27;t report &quot;two or more trainees fighting&quot; because it indicates they&#x27;ve &quot;lost control of the centre&quot;, resulting in a potential fine.

G4S-run Medway managers received performance-related pay awards in April 2016, despite the chief inspector of prisons weeks saying weeks earlier that &quot;managerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm at the jail.&quot; In January, &quot;Panorama&quot; showed an undercover reporter working as a guard at the Medway secure training centre (STC) in Kent. The film showed children allegedly being mistreated and claimed that staff falsified records of violent incidents. No senior managers were disciplined or dismissed. Prior to the Panorama programme&#x27;s broadcast, the Youth Justice Board (YJB), which oversees youth custody in England, stopped placing children in Medway. In February, a Guardian investigation revealed that, in 2003, whistleblowers had warned G4S, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the YJB that staff were mistreating detained children. Their letter, forwarded by Prof John Pitts, a youth justice expert, was ignored. When the prisons inspectorate carried out a snap inspection at Medway it found detainees reported staff had used insulting, aggressive or racist language toward them and felt unsafe in facility portions not covered by closed circuit TV. Reviewers agreed to the legitimacy of evidence presented by Panorama showing, &quot;...targeted bullying of vulnerable boys,&quot; by employees, and that, &quot;A larger group of staff must have been aware of unacceptable practice but did not challenge or report this behaviour.&quot;
In an earlier Ofsted report on Medway, inspectors said staff and middle managers reported feeling a lack of leadership and having &quot;low, or no confidence in senior managers.&quot; Nick Hardwick, at the time the chief inspector of prisons said, &quot;Managerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm. Effective oversight is key to creating a positive culture that prevents poor practice happening and ensuring it is reported when it does.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper learned that senior managers at Medway received performance-related pay awards in April amounting to between 10-25% of their annual salaries, according to seniority. One 15-year-old girl placed at Medway in 2009 said she was frequently unlawfully restrained over 18 months, citing an occasion in which her face was repeatedly slammed into icy ground. &quot;I assumed the senior management team would be sacked... But now it looks like they have been rewarded for allowing children to be abused in prison,&quot; she said. Former Labour MP Sally Keeble has complained about G4S maltreatment in STC&#x27;s for over ten years, stating: &quot;This is people making personal profit out of tragedy. I hope that justice minister Liz Truss would intervene and make sure these bonuses are not being paid by a Ministry of Justice contractor.&quot; Notwithstanding the results of the investigations no senior managers at Medway were disciplined or dismissed. In May, the MoJ said the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) would take over the running of Medway. In July, it formally assumed control of the STC. In February 2016, G4S had announced that it was to sell its children&#x27;s services business, including the contract to manage two secure training centres. The company hoped to complete the process by the end of 2016.

Following release of an extremely critical report regarding a G4S-operated jail, the Labour party&#x27;s shadow justice secretary said they would be inclined to take control of for-profit prisons if the industry competitors had not met deadlines imposed upon them. Sadiq Khan&#x27;s response stressed the need for better contracting, to include liquidated damages provisions. The chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick, recommended the crafting of a takeover contingency plan. &quot;It&#x27;s not delivering what the public should expect of the millions being paid to G4S to run it.&quot; Khan said, &quot; I see no difference whether the underperformance is in the public, private or voluntary sector... We shouldn&#x27;t tolerate mediocrity in the running of our prisons.&quot; Khan continued: &quot;We can&#x27;t go on with scandal after scandal, where the public&#x27;s money is being squandered and the quality of what&#x27;s delivered isn&#x27;t up to scratch. The government is too reliant on a cosy group of big companies. The public are rightly getting fed up to the back teeth of big companies making huge profits out of the taxpayer, which smacks to them of rewards for failure.&quot;

==United States==
In 2018, 8.41% of prisoners in the United States were housed in private prisons. On January 25, 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to stop the United States Department of Justice from renewing further contracts with private prisons, although most facilities are run by the states so the order will only apply to about 14,000 inmates housed in federal prisons.

===Early history===
One of the earliest examples of prison privatization in the US was in Louisiana in 1844, where a company produced clothing in a factory with inmate labor. In 1852, on the northwest San Francisco Bay in California, inmates of the prison ship Waban began building a contract facility to house themselves at Point Quentin. The prison became known as San Quentin, which is still in operation today, though it was partially transferred from private to public administration.

During Reconstruction (1865–1876) in the south after the Civil War, plantations and businessmen sought to continue exploiting Blacks after the United States ratified the 13th Amendment, which abolished all forms of slavery &quot;except as punishment for a crime&quot;. This exception allowed continued enslavement of Black people through convict leases.
Southern prisoners laid railroad tracks, worked on plantations, mined coal and performed other labor while enduring terrible conditions including torture as a form of punishment. The system was extremely profitable for former slaveowners and the states. For example, ten percent of Alabama’s budget came from convict leases between 1880 and 1904. This system of unpaid labor remained in place until the early 20th century.

====1980s–2009====
Federal and state governments have a long history of contracting out specific services to private firms, including medical services, food preparation, vocational training, and inmate transportation. However, the 1980s ushered in a new era of prison privatization as the War on Drugs increased prison populations. Overcrowding and rising costs became increasingly problematic for local, state, and federal governments. Private business interests saw an opportunity to expand beyond simple contracting of services into the management and operation of entire prisons.

Modern private prisons first emerged in 1984 when the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), now known as CoreCivic, was awarded a contract to take over operation of a jail in Hamilton County, Tennessee. The following year, CCA gained further public attention when it offered to take over the entire state prison system of Tennessee for $200 million. The bid was ultimately defeated due to strong opposition from public employees and the skepticism of the state legislature. Sixty-six additional private prisons were opened in the US between 1984 and 1990.

CCA&#x27;s $52 million January 1997 purchase of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s $100 million Central Treatment Facility was &quot;the first time a prison has been sold outright (although under a lease-back arrangement, ownership is supposed to revert to D.C. after 20 years).&quot;

====2010s====
Statistics from the U.S. Department of Justice show that, as of 2019, there were 116,000 state and federal prisoners housed in privately owned prisons in the U.S., constituting 8.1% of the overall U.S. prison population. Broken down to prison type, 15.7% of the federal prison population in the United States is housed in private prisons and 7.1% of the U.S. state prison population is housed in private prisons.

As of 2017, after a period of steady growth, the number of inmates held in private prisons in the United States has declined modestly and continues to represent a small share of the nation&#x27;s total prison population. Companies operating such facilities include the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the GEO Group, Inc. (formerly known as Wackenhut Securities), Management and Training Corporation (MTC), and Community Education Centers. In the past two decades CCA has seen its profits increase by more than 500 percent. The prison industry as a whole took in over $5 billion in revenue in 2011.

According to journalist Matt Taibbi, Wall Street banks took notice of this influx of cash, and are now some of the prison industry&#x27;s biggest investors. Wells Fargo has around $100 million invested in GEO Group and $6 million in CCA. Other major investors include Bank of America, Fidelity Investments, General Electric and The Vanguard Group. CCA&#x27;s share price went from a dollar in 2000 to $34.34 in 2013. Sociologist John L. Campbell and activist and journalist Chris Hedges respectively assert that prisons in the United States have become a &quot;lucrative&quot; and &quot;hugely profitable&quot; business.

In June 2013, students at Columbia University discovered that the institution owned $8 million worth of CCA stock. Less than a year later, students formed a group called Columbia Prison Divest, and delivered a letter to the president of the University demanding total divestment from CCA and full disclosure of future investments. By June 2015, the board of trustees at Columbia University voted to divest from the private prison industry.

CoreCivic (previously CCA) has a capacity of more than 80,000 beds in 65 correctional facilities. The GEO Group operates 57 facilities with a capacity of 49,000 offender beds. The company owns or runs more than 100 properties that operate more than 73,000 beds in sites across the world.

Most privately run facilities are located in the southern and western portions of the United States and include both state and federal offenders. For example, Pecos, Texas is the site of the largest private prison in the world, the Reeves County Detention Complex, operated by the GEO Group. It has a capacity of 3,763 prisoners in its three sub-complexes,

Private prison firms, reacting to reductions in prison populations, are increasingly looking away from mere incarceration and are seeking to maintain profitability by expanding into new markets previously served by non-profit behavioral health and treatment-oriented agencies, including prison medical care, forensic mental hospitals, civil commitment centers, halfway houses and home arrest.

A 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice asserts that privately operated federal facilities are less safe, less secure and more punitive than other federal prisons. Shortly thereafter, the DoJ announced it will stop using private prisons. Nevertheless, a month later the Department of Homeland Security renewed a controversial contract with the CCA to continue operating the South Texas Family Residential Center, an immigrant detention facility in Dilley, Texas.

Stock prices for CCA and GEO Group surged following Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 elections. On February 23, the DOJ under Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned the ban on using private prisons. According to Sessions, &quot;the (Obama administration) memorandum changed long-standing policy and practice, and impaired the bureau&#x27;s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system. Therefore, I direct the bureau to return to its previous approach.&quot; Additionally, both CCA and GEO Group have been expanding into the immigrant detention market. Although the combined revenues of CCA and GEO Group were about $4 billion in 2017 from private prison contracts, their number one customer was ICE.

=== Impact ===
According to a 2021 study, private prison inmates serve longer time in prison than comparable inmates in public prisons. According to Elizabeth S. Anderson, private prisons generate profits by &quot;maximizing the number of beds filled per day&quot; and &quot;primarily by cutting salaries, staff numbers, and staff training.&quot; As a result of the latter, according to a 2016 report by the OIG on privatized federal prisons, privatized facilities see prisoner-on-prisoner assault rates that are 32 percent higher, prisoner-on-staff assault rates 260 percent higher, and rates of prisoner-on-staff sexual assault 500 percent higher when compared to state-run facilities. She says while the state-run facilities are &quot;horrific&quot; for both staff and prisoners, &quot;the profit motive in privatized punishment merely adds to the unconscionable harms and injustices of the American system of mass incarceration.&quot;

=== Increase in the prison population ===
From 1925 to 1980 the prison population stayed consistent with the general population. The private prison population began to increase at an disproportional rate in 1983 (the year that private prisons began operation in the United States). From 1925 to 1980 the prison population had a gradual increase from 150,000 to 250,000. However, From 1983 to 2016 the prison population has increased from 250,000 to 1,500,000.

The exact causes for this overwhelming increase cannot be assigned to individual policies as even similar types of criminal sentencing policies were associated with wildly different rates of incarceration in different communities due to powerful external factors such as income disparity, racial makeup, and even the party affiliation of the lawmakers Correlated with the rise of incarceration rates in the United States was the abolition of loose sentencing guidelines for crimes. Before 1970 in the United States judges were given generally wide sentencing frames (2–20 years), allowing judges ample room for judicial discretion. Liberal Americans argued that this system left room for discrimination in sentencing while conservatives argued that this discretion led to unduly lenient sentences. Under pressure from both sides, many states adopted presumptive sentencing practices or presumptive sentencing guidelines. These policies presented a single recommended sentence among the wider statutory range. This left judges with some room to increase or reduce the sentence in response to mitigating or aggravating circumstances but generally limited their discretion under penalty of automatic appeal through appellate review. Accompanying this change was the adoption of determinate sentencing practices. These acted in the same way as presumptive sentencing but instead concerned release. Adoption of these type of laws effectively ended discretionary parole release for all offenses and made mandatory minimum sentences the norm. Researchers have had mixed results in trying to determine whether these policies themselves led to increased incarceration rates and the results largely depended on the demographics of the community in question. Based on a correlation matrix assembled by Stemen and Rengifo it was shown that the percentage of black residents in a community had a much higher correlation with an increased incarceration rate than the area&#x27;s choice of sentencing policy. Determinate sentencing was however linked with increased drug arrests which correlated highly with increased incarceration rate and minority population percentage. Determinate and structured sentencing policies on their own lead to more stable jail times as they leave less room for judicial input. In doing so they embody the attitudes of the population at the time they were created. As a result of their static nature these policies were not well adapted to face the wave of drug related offenses created by the crack epidemic of the 1980s and the modern opioid crisis.

When Reagan&#x27;s War on Drugs lead to a massive rise in numbers in prisons, private prison operators were quick to seize the opportunity. According to statistics from &quot;The Problem with Private Prisons—Justice Policy Institute&quot;, from 1990 to 2005 there was a 1600 percent increase in the American private prison population. However, the vast majority of prisoners, over 90 percent, remain in publicly-run prisons

=== Cost–benefit analysis ===
To properly compare the benefits of private versus public prisons, the prisons must share common factors such as similar levels of security, number of staff, and population in the prisons. Studies, some partially industry-funded, often conclude that states can save money by using for-profit prisons. However, academic or state-funded studies have found that private prisons tend to keep more low-cost inmates and send high-cost back to state-run prisons. This is counterproductive to the cost benefit analysis of the Private Prisons and contradicts the original selling point of the CCA and other private prisons; &quot;to mitigate the cost of running prisons&quot;. In practice these companies have not been shown to definitively reduce costs and have created several unintended outcomes. The supposed benefit of outsourcing correctional services takes root in the liberal economic idea that having multiple companies compete to provide a service would naturally make the companies innovate and find ways to increase their efficiency to win more contracts than the others. Few companies ever got involved in the business. In the United States CoreCivic, GEO Group Incorporated, and Management and Training Corporation house all the privately held federal inmates and most state inmates across the United States. (United States, Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General,1 ) Naturally, this means there is little competition within the industry.

When comparing the quality of the services that private prisons provide versus their public counterparts a 2016 report from the Office of the Inspector General found that private facilities underperformed their public counterparts in several key safety areas. 14 private prisons were surveyed in this study and compared to 14 federally operated facilities of the same security level in this study. Privately run facilities were found to have higher rates of inmate on inmate and inmate on staff assaults per capita. Twice as many weapons and eight times as many contraband phones were confiscated per capita at private facilities versus their public counterparts.

Determining the quality per dollar spent by private prisons is a difficult proposition. At a surface level the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) reports that private prisons expended an average of $22,488 annually per capita from 2011-2014 while BOP institutions expended $24,426. This may seem like a clear indication of savings but there is a critical lack of information about how the money supplied to private institutions is being spent each month. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) which oversees both federal and private prisons in the United States does not receive cost information broken out by function or department for private institutions, leaving them no way to compare the expenditures made in key cost-saving areas such as food and medical care. Without this data federal overseers cannot adequately evaluate the efficiency of the programs offered at private institutions. Several Research studies have indicated that the cost savings indicated in these reports may come from lower wages, lower staffing levels and reduced employee training at these private facilities. Another consideration when examining these cost savings is the disparity in the inmates housed at private facilities versus those that are publicly funded. Private institutions often have a laundry list of internal rules about the kinds of prisoners they will house. These rules are designed to prevent private companies from taking on prisoners that will be particularly costly to house. Christopher Petrella a researcher at the University of California investigated some of the rules set forth by CoreCivic in their contract with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Based on their agreement CoreCivic could refuse the intake of prisoners over a multitude of health issues such as HIV of Hepatitis C positive status as well as mental health concerns. This is indicative of a greater trend across the United States. Private prisons tend to house prisoner that carry lower risk levels and require fewer services than their public counterparts making direct comparisons of savings unreliable.

According to a 2020 study of private prisons in Mississippi, &quot;private prison inmates serve 90 additional days... The delayed release erodes half of the cost savings offered by private contracting and is linked to the greater likelihood of conduct violations in private prisons.&quot;

===Costs===
Proponents of privately run prisons contend that cost-savings and efficiency of operation place private prisons at an advantage over public prisons and support the argument for privatization, but some research casts doubt on the validity of these arguments, as evidence has shown that private prisons are neither demonstrably more cost-effective, nor more efficient than public prisons. An evaluation of 24 different studies on cost-effectiveness revealed that, at best, results of the question are inconclusive and, at worst, there is no difference in cost-effectiveness.

A study by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the cost-savings promised by private prisons &quot;have simply not materialized&quot;. Some research has concluded that for-profit prisons cost more than public prisons. Furthermore, cost estimates from privatization advocates may be misleading, because private facilities often refuse to accept inmates that cost the most to house. A 2001 study concluded that a pattern of sending less expensive inmates to privately run facilities artificially inflated cost savings. A 2005 study found that Arizona&#x27;s public facilities were seven times more likely to house violent offenders and three times more likely to house those convicted of more serious offenses. A 2011 report by the American Civil Liberties Union point out that private prisons are more costly, more violent and less accountable than public prisons, and are actually a major contributor to increased mass incarceration. This is most apparent in Louisiana, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world and houses the majority of its inmates in for-profit facilities. Marie Gottschalk, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that the prison industry &quot;engages in a lot of cherry-picking and cost-shifting to maintain the illusion that the private sector does it better for less.&quot; In fact, she notes that studies generally show that private facilities are more dangerous for both correctional officers and inmates than their public counterparts as a result of cost-cutting measures, such as spending less on training for correctional officers (and paying them lower wages) and providing only the most basic medical care for inmates.

A 2014 study by a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley shows that minorities make up a greater percentage of inmates at private prisons than in their public counterparts, largely because minorities are cheaper to incarcerate. According to the study, for-profit prison operators, in particular CCA and GEO Group, accumulate these low-cost inmates &quot;through explicit and implicit exemptions written into contracts between these private prison management companies and state departments of correction&quot;.

Recidivism rates, how many prisoners are re-arrested after release, are not usually considered to measure performance. A study in 2005 found that out of half of the federal prisoners released that year, 49.3% were arrested again later on. Pennsylvania became one of the first states to offer a financial incentive to corrections facilities that were privately operated and could lower their recidivism rates in 2013. In order for these facilities to gain a 1% bonus, they had to lower rates to 10% below the baseline. Together, all 40 of these facilities in the state had an average of 16.4% reduction in their recidivism rates.

===Inadequacies including being understaffed===
Evidence suggests that lower staffing levels and training at private facilities may lead to increases in the incidence of violence and escapes. A nationwide study found that assaults on guards by inmates were 49 percent more frequent in private prisons than in government-run prisons. The same study revealed that assaults on fellow inmates were 65 percent more frequent in private prisons.

An example of private prisons&#x27; inadequate staff training leading to jail violence was reported by two Bloomberg News journalists, Margaret Newkirk and William Selway in Mississippi regarding the now-closed Walnut Grove Correctional Facility (WGCF). According to the journalists, the ratio of staff to prisoners in this prison was only 1 to 120. In a bloody riot in this prison, six inmates were rushed to the hospital, including one with permanent brain damage. During the riot, the staff of the prison did not respond but waited until the melee ended, because prisoners outnumbered staff by a ratio of 60–1. The lack of well-trained staff does not only lead to violence but also corruption. According to a former WGCF prisoner, the corrections officers were also responsible for smuggling operations within the prison. To make more money, some provided prisoners with contraband, including drugs, cellphones and weapons. Law enforcement investigations led to the exposure of a far wider web of corruption.

===Bureaucratic corruption scandals===
At the Walnut Grove C.F., intense corruption was involved in the construction and operation of, and subcontracting for medical, commissary and other services. After exposure of the rape of a female transitional center prisoner by the mayor, who also served as a warden, a bribery scheme was uncovered. It had paid millions to the corrupt Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps and his conduits. Ten additional officials and consultants, including three former state legislators (two Republicans and one Democrat), were indicted in the Department of Justice&#x27;s Operation Mississippi Hustle prosecution.

Prior to the Mississippi investigations and prosecutions, a similar investigation began in 2003, dubbed &quot;Operation Polar Pen&quot;, exposed a wide-ranging bribery scheme of what legislative members themselves called the &quot;Corrupt Bastards Club&quot; (CBC). It initially involved for-profit corrections, then extended to include fisheries management and oil industry taxation. At least fifteen targets of the investigation, including ten sitting or former elected officials, the governor&#x27;s chief of staff, and four lobbyists were considered for possible prosecution, and a dozen were indicted. Investigation of a Democratic state senator found nothing amiss, but ten indictments were issued that included six Republican state legislators, two halfway house lobbyists, two very wealthy contractors and the U.S. Senator, Ted Stevens. The seven felony convictions against Stevens were overturned, as were verdicts involving three other legislators and the governor&#x27;s Chief of Staff, one directly due to the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturning part of the existing &quot;Honest Services Fraud&quot; in the case of Representative Bruce Weyhrauch. Weyhrauch pleaded guilty to a state misdemeanor. Others also had their verdicts overturned, in part because the prosecution failed to completely disclose exculpatory evidence to their defense, but three of those also pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Though they were implicated, the Department of Justice also declined to prosecute a former state senator and the U.S. Congressman, Don Young, who spent over a million dollars on his defense, though he was never indicted.

===Judicial corruption scandal===
In the kids for cash scandal, Mid-Atlantic Youth Services Corp, a private prison company which runs juvenile facilities, was found guilty of paying two judges, Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan, $2.8 million to send 2,000 children to their prisons for such alleged crimes as trespassing in vacant buildings and stealing DVDs from Wal-Mart. Sentenced to 28 years in federal prison, Ciavarella will spend his time in Kentucky at Federal Correctional Institution Ashland. The two judges were not the only ones at fault though, seeing as the First National Community Bank never reported the suspicious activity, causing the scandal to go on even longer. In the end, FNCB was fined $1.5 million for failing to report the suspicious activities including transactions that went on over a total of 5 years.

===Lobbying===

“From 1999-2010, the Sentencing Project found that Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) spent on average, $1.4 million per year on lobbying at the federal level and employed a yearly average of seventy lobbyists at the state level.”

The influence of the for-profit prison industry on the government has been described as the prison–industrial complex.

CoreCivic (previously CCA), MTC and The GEO Group have been members of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a Washington, D.C.–based public policy organization that develops model legislation that advances free-market principles such as privatization. Under their Criminal Justice Task Force, ALEC has developed model bills which State legislators can then consult when proposing &quot;tough on crime&quot; initiatives including &quot;Truth in Sentencing&quot; and &quot;Three Strikes&quot; laws. By funding and participating in ALEC&#x27;s Criminal Justice Task Forces, critics argue, private prison companies influence legislation for tougher, longer sentences. Writing in &quot;Governing&quot; magazine in 2003, Alan Greenblatt states:

According to Cooper, Heldman, Ackerman, and Farrar-Meyers (2016), ALEC has been known to push for the expansion of the private prison industry by promoting greater use of private prisons, goods, and services; promoting greater use of prison labor; and increasing the size of prison populations. ALEC has had a hand in not only broadening the definition of existing crimes, but also in the creation of new crimes. ALEC is known for developing policies that may threaten civil liberties by increasing the probabilities of incarceration and lengthy sentences (Cooper et al., 2016).

According to a 2010 report by &quot;NPR&quot;, ALEC arranged meetings between the Corrections Corporation of America and Arizona&#x27;s state legislators such as Russell Pearce at the Grand Hyatt in Washington, D.C. to write Arizona SB 1070, which would keep CCA&#x27;s immigrant detention centers stuffed with detainees.

CCA and GEO have both engaged in state initiatives to increase sentences for offenders and to create new crimes, including, CCA helping to finance Proposition 6 in California in 2008 and GEO lobbying for Jessica&#x27;s Law in Kansas in 2006. In 2012, The CCA sent a letter to 48 states offering to buy public prisons in exchange for a promise to keep the prisons at 90% occupancy for 20 years. States that sign such contracts with prison companies must reimburse them for beds that go unused; in 2011, Arizona agreed to pay Management &amp; Training Corporation $3 million for empty beds when a 97 percent quota wasn&#x27;t met. In 2012 it was reported that the DEA had met up with the CCA to incorporate laws that would increase the CCA&#x27;s prison population and in turn increased the CCA&#x27;s prison population. CCA, now CoreCivic, closed their facility in Estancia, New Mexico as the lack of prisoners made them unable to turn a profit, which left 200 employees without jobs.

OpenSecrets reported that private prison corporations donated a record breaking 1.6 million in federally disclosed contributions in the 2018 midterm elections.

===Opposition===
Many organizations have called for a moratorium on construction of private prisons, or for their outright abolition. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and United Methodist Church have also joined the call, as well as a group of Southern Catholic Bishops.

As of 2013, there has been a modest pushback against the private prison industry, with protests forcing GEO Group to withdraw its $6 million offer for naming rights of FAU Stadium, and Kentucky allowing its contract with the CCA to expire, ending three decades of allowing for-profit companies to operate prisons in that state. In 2014, Idaho will be taking over the operation of the Idaho Correctional Center from the CCA, which has been the subject of a plethora of lawsuits alleging rampant violence, understaffing, gang activity and contract fraud. Idaho governor Butch Otter said &quot;In recognition of what&#x27;s happened, what&#x27;s happening, it&#x27;s necessary. It&#x27;s the right thing to do. It&#x27;s disappointing because I am a champion of privatization.&quot;

In the final quarter of 2013, Scopia Capital Management, DSM North America, and Amica Mutual Insurance divested around $60 million from CCA and GEO Group. In a Color of Change press release, DSM North America President Hugh Welsh said:

===Attempts to limit privatization and increase oversight===
Some U.S. states have imposed bans, population limits, and strict operational guidelines on private prisons:

* Banning privatization of state and local facilities – Illinois in 1990 (Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act), and New York in 2000, enacted laws that ban the privatization of prisons, correctional facilities and any services related to their operation. Louisiana enacted a moratorium on private prisons in 2001. In September 2019, the California legislature passed a bill that would prohibit private prison companies from operating in the state; however, ICE later extended a contract to continue the use of private prisons into the future due to it being exempt from state laws as it is a federal agency pursuant to the Supremacy Clause and due to the fact that Congress has not banned the use of private prisons.
* Banning speculative private prison construction – For-profit prison companies have built new prisons before they were awarded privatization contracts in order to lure state contract approval. In 2001, Wisconsin&#x27;s joint budget committee recommended language to ban all future speculative prison construction in the state. Such anticipatory building dates back to at least 1997, when Corrections Corporation of America built a 2,000-bed facility in California at a cost of $80–100 million with no contract from the California Department of Corrections; a CCA official was quoted as saying, &quot;If we build it, they will come&quot;.
* Banning exportation and importation of prisoners – To ensure that the state retains control over the quality and security of correctional facilities, North Dakota passed a bill in 2001 that banned the export of Class A and AA felons outside the state. Similarly, Oregon allowed an existing exportation law to sunset in 2001, effectively banning the export of prisoners. Several states have considered banning the importation of prisoners to private facilities.
* Requiring standards comparable to state prisons – New Mexico enacted legislation that transfers supervision of private prisons to the state Secretary of Corrections, ensuring that private prisons meet the same standards as public facilities. In 2001, Nebraska legislation that requires private prisons to meet public prison standards was overwhelmingly approved by the legislature, but pocket-vetoed by the governor. Oklahoma passed a law in 2005 that requires private prisons to have emergency plans in place and mandates state notification of any safety incidents.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons announced its intent to end for-profit prison contracts.

* Terminating federal contracts. On August 18, 2016, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates announced that the Justice Department intended to end its Bureau of Prisons contracts with for-profit prison operators, because it concluded &quot;...the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services...&quot; than the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In response, Issa Arnita, the spokesperson for the third largest U.S. for-profit prison operator Management and Training Corporation, said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; to learn about the DOJ&#x27;s decision. &quot;If the DOJ&#x27;s decision to end the use of contract prisons were based solely on declining inmate populations, there may be some justification, but to base this decision on cost, safety and security, and programming is wrong.&quot; In a memorandum, Yates continued, for-profit &quot;...prisons served an important role during a difficult period, but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own Bureau facilities. They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department&#x27;s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security. The rehabilitative services that the Bureau provides, such as educational programs and job training, have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety. Also, the recidivism rates of the private prisons, &quot;Within three years of release, about two-thirds (67.8 percent) of released prisoners were rearrested. Within five years of release, about three-quarters (76.6 percent) of released prisoners were rearrested. Of those prisoners who were rearrested, more than half (56.7 percent) were arrested by the end of the first year.&quot; These private prison recidivism rates, compared to the public prison&#x27;s recidivism rates, are virtually identical and in return have minuscule benefits . At the time, the Justice Department held 193,000 inmates, about 22,000 of whom were in 14 private prisons. Criminal justice reform had caused the prison population to drop by about 25,000 inmates over the previous few years. Separately the Department of Homeland Security intends to continue to hold some suspected illegal aliens in private prisons.

===Media coverage in the United States===
====Documentary====
* Kids for cash scandal was featured in &quot;&quot;, the 2009 documentary by Michael Moore.
* A full-length documentary covering the kids for cash scandal entitled &quot;Kids for Cash&quot; was released in February 2014.
* &quot;13th&quot; is an Oscar-nominated 2016 documentary that examines the role of private prison contracts in the mass incarceration of blacks and Latinos, primarily, in the United States. The name refers to the Thirteenth Amendment which abolished slavery, yet allows for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime.

====Drama====
* Kids for Cash scandal has also led to several portrayals in fictional works. Both the &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; episode &quot;Crush&quot; and an episode of &quot;The Good Wife&quot; featured corrupt judges sending children to private detention centers. An episode of &quot;Cold Case&quot; titled &quot;Jurisprudence&quot; is loosely based on this event.
* Season 3 of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; portrays the transformation of the prison from federally owned to a privately owned prison for-profit.
* An episode of &quot;Elementary&quot; focuses on private prisons competing with each other in New Jersey to win a bid for another prison.
* An episode of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; sees a 15-year-old former inmate suing a private prison over an alleged rape by one of its corrections officers.

<doc id="284767" wikidata="Q109255" url="?curid=284767" title="Bernard Hinault">
<text>Bernard Hinault (; born 14 November 1954) is a French former professional road cyclist. With 147 professional victories, including five times the Tour de France, he is often named among the greatest cyclists of all time. In his career, Hinault entered a total of thirteen Grand Tours. He abandoned one of them while in the lead, finished in 2nd place on two occasions and won the other ten, putting him one behind Merckx for the all-time record. No rider since Hinault has achieved more than seven.

Hinault started cycling as an amateur in his native Brittany. After a successful amateur career, he signed with the Gitane–Campagnolo team to turn professional in 1975. He took breakthrough victories at both the Liège–Bastogne–Liège classic and the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage race in 1977. In 1978, he won his first two Grand Tours: the Vuelta a España and the Tour de France. In the following years, he was the most successful professional cyclist, adding another Tour victory in 1979 and a win at the 1980 Giro d&#x27;Italia. Although a knee injury forced him to quit the 1980 Tour de France while in the lead, he returned to win the World Championship road race later in the year. He added another Tour victory in 1981, before completing his first Giro-Tour double in 1982.

After winning the 1983 Vuelta a España, a return of his knee problems forced him to miss that year&#x27;s Tour de France, won by his teammate Laurent Fignon. Conflict within the Renault team led to his leaving and joining La Vie Claire. With his new team, he raced the 1984 Tour de France, but lost to Fignon by over ten minutes. He recovered the following year, winning another Giro-Tour double with the help of teammate Greg LeMond. In the 1986 Tour de France, he engaged in an intra-team rivalry with LeMond, who won his first of three Tours. Hinault retired at the end of the season. he is the most recent French winner of the Tour de France. After his cycling career, Hinault turned to farming, while fulfilling enforcement duties for the organisers of the Tour de France until 2016.

All through his career, Hinault was known by the nickname &quot;Le Blaireau&quot; (&quot;The Badger&quot;); he associated himself with the animal due to its aggressive nature, a trait he embodied on the bike. Within the peloton, Hinault assumed the role of &quot;patron&quot;, exercising authority over races he took part in.

==Early life and family==
Hinault was born on 14 November 1954 in the Breton village of Yffiniac, the second oldest of four children to Joseph and Lucie Hinault. The family lived in a cottage named La Clôture, built shortly after Hinault was born. His parents were farmers, and the children often had to help out at harvest time. His father later worked as a platelayer for the national rail company SNCF. Hinault was described as a &quot;hyperactive&quot; child, with his mother nicknaming him &quot;little hooligan&quot;. Hinault was not a good student, but visited the technical college in Saint-Brieuc for an engineering apprenticeship. He started athletics there, becoming a runner and finishing tenth in the French junior cross-country championship in 1971.

In December 1974, just before turning professional, Hinault married Martine, who he had met at a family wedding the year before. Their first son, Mickael, was born in 1975, with a second, Alexandre, in 1981. Hinault and his family lived in Quessoy, close to Yffiniac, while he was a professional cyclist. After his retirement, they moved to a farm away in Brittany. Hinault had bought the property near Calorguen in 1983. Martine later served as mayor of Calorguen.

Although they share the same birthplace and surname, he is not related to the younger cyclist Sébastien Hinault.

==Amateur career==

Hinault came to cycling through his cousin René, who rode weekend races. At first he had to use the shared family bike, which he rode devotedly. He received his own bike when he was 15 as a reward for passing his school examinations, and used it to travel to college. During the summer of 1971 he made training rides with René, who had problems keeping up with the sixteen-year-old Bernard, even though he was an experienced amateur rider. Hinault received his racing licence from Club Olympique Briochin in late April1971 and entered his first race on 2May in Planguenoual. Advised only to try to stay with the other riders, Hinault won the event. Hinault won his first five races, amassing twelve wins from twenty races by the end of the year. Also during the summer of 1971, Hinault was at odds with his father about his choice to pursue cycling as a career. Joseph Hinault relented only after his son ran away from home for three days to stay with his cousins, sleeping on straw in the barn.

For 1972, Hinault was allowed to race with the over-18s. At a race in Hillion, he and René escaped from the field and reached the finish alone. They crossed the line together to share the victory, to the dismay of the race organisers. The young Hinault was heavily influenced by his trainer at the Club Olympique Briochin, Robert Le Roux, who had earlier worked with 1965 World Champion Tom Simpson. Hinault won nineteen races in his second season as an amateur, including the national junior championship against opposition a year older than him, such as future professional Bernard Vallet. He was conscripted into the military at age 18, and did not race throughout 1973. He was unable to join the army&#x27;s training centre for young athletes and instead served in Sissonne with the 21st Marine Infantry Regiment. Returning to competition overweight, Hinault managed to win his first race of 1974. This was his last season as an amateur and again was highly successful, including a victory in his home town of Yffiniac towards the end of the year, where an alliance formed by four other riders was unable to hold him back. He also competed in track cycling, winning the national pursuit championship. On the road, he took part in the Étoile des Espoirs, a race open to amateurs and young professionals. Hinault finished fifth overall, and second on the time trial stage behind reigning pursuit world champion Roy Schuiten. Towards the end of the season, Hinault turned down an offer to race with the prestigious Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt, instead deciding to turn professional in 1975.

== Professional career ==

=== 1975–1977: Gitane ===
In January 1975, Bernard Hinault turned professional with the Gitane–Campagnolo team, run by former World Champion Jean Stablinski, on a lean wage of 2,500francs per month. The decision to turn professional relatively early was in part taken as, had Hinault raced the 1975 season as an amateur, he would have likely been prevented by the French cycling federation from turning professional before the 1976 Summer Olympics to be part of the French team there. Early on, he showed no interest in adhering to the unwritten rules of the peloton, whereby younger riders were expected to show respect towards older ones. At a criterium race in August1975 he went up against a coalition of senior riders, who had decided to divide the prize money between them. Hinault won all the intermediate cash prizes until five-time Tour de France winner Eddy Merckx declared that Hinault was included in the pact. His results in his first season were impressive, with a seventh place at Paris–Nice and a victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, earning him the Promotion Pernod, the prize for the best new professional in France. However, Hinault showed little willingness to learn the basic trades of cycling from Stablinski, often escaping early in the race instead of learning how to ride inside the peloton. Together with Stablinski entering Hinault into too many races, this led to conflicts between them.

For 1976, Hinault stayed with Gitane, as former professional Cyrille Guimard, who had just retired from cycling, took over the team and became &quot;directeur sportif&quot;. Guimard and Hinault got along well, and the latter was kept out of the high-profile races for 1976, instead focussing on a steady improvement in lesser known races such as Paris–Camembert, which he won. That year, Guimard spurred Lucien Van Impe to his only win in the Tour de France. Hinault&#x27;s progress was visible, with a second consecutive victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, a third place at the Grand Prix du Midi Libre and a win at the Tour de l&#x27;Aude, ensuring him the Prestige Pernod, the award for the best French rider of the season. In total, Hinault won 15 races in 1976. At the end of the year, he came sixth at the World Championship Road Race, being beaten to the line for fifth by Eddy Merckx.

During the spring classics season of 1977, Hinault left the Tour of Flanders before it had even started, not wanting to risk his health in a rain- and cold-affected race on cobbled roads. This drew him a formal warning by Guimard for his conduct. Three weeks later, Hinault won Gent–Wevelgem in a solo effort after an attack from the finish. Five days later, at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Hinault followed an attack by favourite André Dierickx, and beat him in the two-man sprint to take his first victory in one of cycling&#x27;s &quot;monuments&quot;. In accordance with Guimard&#x27;s plan to build Hinault up slowly, he did not enter the Tour de France. He did however start the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, seen as the most important preparation event for the Tour. While in the leader&#x27;s jersey on the penultimate stage to Grenoble, Hinault attacked up the Col de Porte, leading Van Impe and Bernard Thévenet by 1:30 minutes when crossing the summit. On the descent, he misjudged a hairpin corner and crashed down the mountainside. A tree saved him from falling far down, while his bike was lost. Hinault then climbed back onto the road, took a new bike and without showing any hesitation, continued on. Up the finishing climb in Grenoble, he briefly dismounted, still shocked from the near-death experience and pushed his bike for about , before remounting and winning the stage eighty seconds ahead of Van Impe. This also secured him the overall victory ahead of eventual Tour winner Thévenet.

This incident was mentioned from a semi-pro rider&#x27;s perspective in the Tim Krabbé book De Renner (The Rider) when the main character is about to descend a Col in the Tour de Mont Aigoual: 

At the end of the season, Hinault won the Grand Prix des Nations, an individual time trial, with a substantial margin of 3:15 minutes ahead of favourite Joop Zoetemelk.

=== 1978–1983: Renault ===
====1978: Grand Tour breakthrough====

At the beginning of 1978, the Gitane team was taken over by its parent company, the state-owned car manufacturer Renault, becoming . Hinault started the season with second place at Paris–Nice. He then competed in the Critérium National de la Route. Trailing Raymond Martin by more than two minutes before the final time trial, he made up his significant deficit and won the event.

Hinault then competed in his first three-week Grand Tour, at the Vuelta a España, then held at the end of April. He won the opening prologue time trial in Gijón, but then let the leadership switch to Ferdi Van Den Haute. He won stage 11b, a mountain time trial in Barcelona, and regained the race lead the next day, when he won the stage to La Tossa de Montbui after an escape with teammate Jean-René Bernaudeau. He ensured his overall victory by winning stage 18 to Amurrio. On that stage, he bridged over to escapee Andrés Gandarias, who had earlier asked for Hinault&#x27;s permission to attack. Hinault claimed to have been annoyed into attacking by one of Gandarias&#x27;s teammates and offered to carry him to the finish. However, the Spaniard was unable to follow his wheel, saying: &quot;This guy has made me suffer like a dog, he&#x27;s tougher than Eddy Merckx!&quot; In all, Hinault won five stages of the Vuelta. A sixth win was prevented on the final day of the Grand Tour, on which a short time trial was raced in the afternoon, held at San Sebastián in the Basque Country. The stage was marred by protests and obstructions by supporters of the Basque separatist group ETA. Hinault himself had sand thrown into his eyes, but won the stage nonetheless, only to find that the results would not count due to the surrounding circumstances.

Ahead of his first Tour de France, Hinault raced in the Tour de Suisse, where he did not feature prominently. He then travelled to the French Road Race Championship, held at Sarrebourg. He launched an escape, on which he rode solo, leading the rest of his competitors by more than six minutes by the start of the last lap. However, he had forgotten to eat enough and suffered from hypoglycemia during the last part of the race, crossing the finish line to take the title severely weakened. His victory allowed him to wear the French &quot;tricolore&quot; jersey for the following year.
In the Tour de France, Hinault fell behind early to challenger Zoetemelk when Renault lost two minutes to Mercier during the team time trial. On stage 8, the first longer individual time trial, Hinault gained back 59 seconds on Zoetemelk, while the previous two Tour winners, Van Impe and Thévenet, lost so much time that they were now counted out from chances of an overall win. Hinault rode conservatively in the Pyrenees to stay within striking distance of Zoetemelk. On stage 12a, from Tarbes to Valence-d&#x27;Agen, he firmly imprinted his authority on the race, although not by riding. The riders had been complaining about split stages, where more than one would be held on one day, as was the case on 12July. When they reached the finishing town, they dismounted their bikes and walked to the finish line in protest. Hinault was chosen by his fellow competitors to be the spokesperson of the strike. Journalist Felix Magowan wrote: &quot;Before today&#x27;s strike, people were asking if the Tour had a boss. Today that was answered. His name is Hinault.&quot; Following the strike, Hinault had trouble sleeping and was caught out the next day, a stage in the Massif Central, forcing his team into a long chase. Thus weakened and slowed by spectator interference at a bike change, he lost 1:40 minutes to Zoetemelk on the following day&#x27;s uphill time trial. Hinault countered the next day &quot;en route&quot; to Saint-Étienne during stage 15, breaking away with Hennie Kuiper. By the finish, the two had been reeled back, but Hinault contested the finishing sprint, winning the stage. The following day, stage 16 to Alpe d&#x27;Huez, ended with Zoetemelk, Hinault and the temporary leader of the general classification and thus yellow jersey wearer Michel Pollentier separated by only 18 seconds. However, Pollentier was disqualified for trying to cheat his doping test, leaving Hinault and Zoetemelk to fight out the overall victory. On the final mountain stage, Hinault put his rival under pressure, but was unable to make up any time. He then clinched the yellow jersey in the final time trial, gaining more than four minutes to win his first Tour de France with an advantage of 3:56 minutes. Following his Tour win, he finished fifth at the World Championships, before once more winning the Grand Prix des Nations, this time ahead of Francesco Moser.

====1979: Second Tour victory and Classics success====
The 1979 season started slowly for an off-form Bernard Hinault. He bounced back at the La Flèche Wallonne classic in April, when he caught up to a breakaway by Giuseppe Saronni and Bernt Johansson, outsprinting the former to win the race. He then beat Zoetemelk to victory at the Dauphiné Libéré, winning four stages. He won the race by over ten minutes, also taking the points and mountain classifications. In the coming weeks ahead of the Tour, he proved his willingness to assist his teammates to ensure their loyalty, helping Lucien Didier win the Tour de Luxembourg and finishing second behind Roland Berland in the National Championship race.

The Tour de France was again a two-way battle between Hinault and Zoetemelk. In the prologue, Hinault was fourth, on the same time as the Dutchman. The mountain stages started immediately thereafter, with Hinault winning the mountain time trial on stage 2, taking over the yellow jersey. He also won the next stage into Pau. The team time trial on stage4 again went Zoetemelk&#x27;s way, as his Mercier team took back 41 seconds on Hinault&#x27;s Renault squad. Zoetemelk now was only 12 seconds behind Hinault. On stage 8, in another team time trial, Renault fared much better, and Hinault extended his advantage to 1:18 minutes. The next day however, on a stage containing cobbled sections, Hinault suffered two punctures, losing almost four minutes and the race lead to Zoetemelk. He took back 36 seconds on the time trial in Brussels on stage 11 before regaining the race lead after another time trial, uphill to Avoriaz on stage 15. At this stage, he led Zoetemelk by 1:48 minutes, with third-placed Kuiper already more than 12 minutes behind. Hinault gained another minute on stage 16, before Zoetemelk regained 47 seconds up Alpe d&#x27;Huez three days later. The final time trial of the Tour went Hinault&#x27;s way once again, extending his advantage by a further 69 seconds. He also took the next stage in a slightly uphill sprint finish. On the final stage towards the Champs-Élysées in Paris, traditionally a ceremonious affair without attacks, Zoetemelk and Hinault broke away, with both gapping the field and Hinault taking another stage victory. Zoetemelk finished 3:07 minutes behind Hinault, but then had ten minutes added to his time for failing a doping test. The next finisher, Joaquim Agostinho, was almost half an hour behind the winner.

Towards the end of the season, Hinault won his second cycling monument, the Giro di Lombardia. He had escaped from the field from the finish, but was later joined by some other riders. Only Silvano Contini finished with him, with the next group more than three minutes behind. The victory also secured that Hinault won his first of four consecutive Super Prestige Pernod International competitions, the award handed to the best rider of the season.

====1980: Attempt at the Triple Crown====
As was often the case, Hinault started the season slowly in 1980, withdrawing from Paris–Nice. He then entered Paris–Roubaix, partly to prepare for the cobbled sections in the upcoming Tour de France, and finished fourth. A week later, he scored one of his most memorable wins at Liège–Bastogne–Liège. As soon as the riders left Liège, snow began to fall, soon turning into a blizzard. Hinault wanted to abandon, as had many others, including all but one of his teammates. He was convinced to carry on until the feeding station at Bastogne, where the snow had turned into rain. Only 21 riders were left by this point. Hinault removed his rain cape and attacked, catching up to the leaders and carried on by himself, winning with a margin of almost ten minutes ahead of Kuiper. The victory came at a price, as his right index and middle fingers took weeks to recover from frostbite, and caused him pain for several years.

Hinault and Guimard then turned their attention to the only Grand Tour he had not won yet: the Giro d&#x27;Italia. They hoped that Hinault would be able to reproduce a feat Eddy Merckx had achieved in 1974, winning the Giro, the Tour and the World Championship in the same year. This is commonly referred to as the Triple Crown of Cycling.

Hinault started the Giro d&#x27;Italia as odds-on favourite, pitted against local riders Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni, who had the home crowd on their side. Following a fourth place at the prologue in Genoa, Hinault made a spontaneous visit to Fausto Coppi&#x27;s home of Castellania, paying respect to the first rider ever to have won Giro and Tour in the same year. On stage 5, a time trial to Pisa, Hinault took over the race leader&#x27;s pink jersey. He then relinquished his lead to Roberto Visentini, who was not considered to be a contender for the final victory. On stage 14, he attacked when the peloton relaxed after an intermediate sprint, winning the stage ahead of Wladimiro Panizza, who took the race lead. Hinault then made the decisive move of the race on stage 20, when he attacked on the tough climb of the Stelvio Pass. He caught up with his teammate Bernaudeau, and both carried on for the remaining of the stage together. Hinault gifted the stage victory to his teammate, while he clinched the overall victory almost six minutes ahead of Panizza.

In the Tour de France, Hinault was once again set to duel with Joop Zoetemelk, who had moved to the dominant squad. Hinault won the prologue in Frankfurt, Germany, five seconds ahead of Gerrie Knetemann. On stage5 from Liège to Lille, which contained cobbled sections used in Paris–Roubaix, conditions were poor with rain and heavy winds. Hinault called for the field to take a slow tempo, but when Zoetemelk&#x27;s teammate Jan Raas attacked, he went after him. He eventually found himself in a group with several other riders, while Zoetemelk was distanced. At from the finish, he followed another attack from Kuiper and won the sprint at the line. The next stage was set to contain more cobbled roads, but on Hinault&#x27;s protest, most of the worst parts were taken out. Hinault had however suffered damage to his left knee on the stage to Lille. Hinault finished only fifth on stage 11&#x27;s individual time trial, won by Zoetemelk. While he regained the yellow jersey, Zoetemelk was second, only 21 seconds behind. With his tendinitis worsening, he carried on until the end of stage 12, just before the race was headed for the first high mountains in the Pyrenees. That night, Hinault and Guimard told the race organisers, Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan, that he would abandon the race, while still in the lead. He left the race at night, not informing the press, which led to a fallout with the media that took years to recover. In Hinault&#x27;s absence, Zoetemelk duly won his only Tour de France. Insinuations that Zoetemelk&#x27;s victory had been a gift through Hinault&#x27;s absence were countered by Hinault himself: &quot;My problems were of my own making. It is always the absent rider who is at fault. I was absent and he took my place.&quot;
Hinault returned from the disappointment of the Tour to start at the World Championship road race, held on a very tough parcours in Sallanches, France, often named the hardest course in the history of the event. Hinault had broken away about from the finish with several riders. On the last lap, he dropped his last companion, Gianbattista Baronchelli, on the steepest part of a climb and soloed to victory. It had been a race of attrition with only 15 out of 107 riders reaching the finish.

====1981: Winning a third Tour de France====
Hinault had never made his dislike for riding on cobbled roads a secret. The most prominent race of this character, Paris–Roubaix, was met with particular disdain, even though he never finished lower than thirteenth. After the 1980 edition, he had said to organiser Goddet: &quot;You will never see me in this circus again.&quot; However, he returned for 1981, saying that he did so out of respect for his stature as World Champion. He suffered seven crashes and tyre punctures, but reached the finish at the velodrome with the lead group, where he outsprinted favourites Roger De Vlaeminck and Moser. One and a half weeks earlier, he had already added a victory at the Amstel Gold Race. Furthermore, he also won the Critérium International and again dominated the Dauphiné Libéré, winning by twelve minutes ahead of Agostinho.

At the Tour de France, Hinault took an early lead by winning the prologue, then relinquished the yellow jersey to Knetemann and later to Phil Anderson. On the time trial to Pau on stage 7, he regained the lead and never lost the jersey, beating Van Impe by almost a quarter of an hour. He won five stages, including all four individual time trials. Amidst media criticism that he was riding too defensively in the mountains, he also took victory in the Alps on a stage to Le Pleynet.

At the World Championship in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Hinault failed to defend his title. Having bridged a two-and-a-half-minute gap to a strong lead group on his own, he came third in the final sprint, behind Freddy Maertens and Saronni.

====1982: Achieving the Giro-Tour double====

Hinault returned to the Giro in 1982. He looked set for victory after the first two weeks, having taken a significant lead after wins in the stage3 time trial and stage 12 to Campitello Matese. However, on stage 17 to Boario Terme, Guimard and the Renault team misjudged the toughness of the climb and Hinault lost the lead to Silvano Contini. He hit back the next day, winning the stage to Montecampione, turning the race in his favour.

In &quot;his most uneventful Tour&quot;, Hinault never looked in trouble on his way to completing the Giro-Tour double at the Tour de France. He won the prologue in Basel, Switzerland, before the lead briefly turned to Ludo Peeters and Phil Anderson. Hinault regained the yellow jersey after the first time trial and won the overall classification easily. He took four stages, including again the final one on the Champs-Élysées, this time from a bunch sprint. His participation in the final-stage sprint was seen as an answer to critics, who had once again lamented that Hinault had ridden the Tour without &quot;panache&quot;. Zoetemelk was again the runner-up, more than six minutes behind Hinault. Later in the season, Hinault added another victory at the Grand Prix des Nations.

====1983: Second Vuelta and the ascent of Fignon====
Since 1981, Hinault had been joined at Renault by two young talents, Laurent Fignon and the American Greg LeMond. Both joined Hinault for the Vuelta a España, where he faced stiff competition from local riders like Marino Lejarreta, Julián Gorospe, and Alberto Fernández. Six days before the race started, he had won La Flèche Wallonne for a second time. On stage4 of the Vuelta, Fignon attacked and won, but Lejarreta, the defending champion, had followed him and gained time on Hinault. Hinault came back and took the lead the following day on the mountain stage to Castellar de n&#x27;Hug. However, a day later, the Spanish teams jointly attacked and Lejarreta moved ahead of Hinault, who was 22 seconds down. At the uphill time trial at Balneario de Panticosa, he suffered and finished more than two minutes behind Lejarreta. Hinault joined forces with Kuiper and Saronni to attack on stage 10 to Soria, affected by crosswinds. He was in trouble again on stage 14, affected by returning pain in his knee; at one point he trailed his rivals by more than five minutes, but regained contact. In the time trial around Valladolid on stage 15b, Hinault won, now just ten seconds behind Gorospe, the new leader in the general classification. The following day brought the last mountain stage and Renault put pressure on Gorospe from early on. Hinault, joined by Lejarreta and Vicente Belda, escaped for , distancing Gorospe by over twenty minutes with Hinault taking victory in Ávila, sealing his second Vuelta victory. Due to the tightly fought battle between Hinault and his Spanish competitors, the 1983 race is described on the Vuelta&#x27;s website as &quot;one of the most beautiful and spectacular&quot; editions.

During the Vuelta, Hinault&#x27;s tendinitis returned. After the race, he made two failed attempts to get back into racing, but eventually announced that he would miss the Tour de France. In his absence, teammate Fignon won the event on his first attempt. Hinault tried another comeback at a post-Tour criterium, but the pain returned and he did not race for the remainder of the season.

=== 1984–1986: La Vie Claire ===
====1984: Defeat at Fignon&#x27;s hands====
By 1983, the relationship between Hinault and Guimard had deteriorated to a point where the former described their relationship as &quot;war&quot;. Hinault forced a choice on the Renault team to either release him or oust Guimard. The team decided to stick with their &quot;directeur sportif&quot;, leading Hinault to search for a new team. He joined forces with businessman Bernard Tapie to form the new squad. Their &quot;directeur sportif&quot; became Swiss coach Paul Köchli, who had made a name for himself with innovative and effective training methods, leaving Hinault a lot of freedom while at the same time scientifically measuring his progress. As part of his connection with Tapie, Hinault also contributed to the development of the clipless pedal, created by Look, another company owned by Tapie.

Hinault returned to racing at the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, where he won the final stage. He then took victory at the Four Days of Dunkirk. But his spring campaign lacked major successes. At the Dauphiné Libéré, he came second to Martín Ramírez, who later claimed that Hinault and his team had tried to intimidate him during the final stage of the race. A memorable episode occurred during the Paris–Nice, a race he finished third overall. During stage5 to La Seyne-sur-Mer, Hinault was descending in a lead group with several other favourites. As they reached the valley, the road was blocked by protesters, unhappy with the announced closure of a dockyard at La Ciotat. While the other riders stopped, he drove into the group head-on, dismounted, and punched the protester closest to him. In the ensuing fist fight, Hinault sustained a broken rib.

The Tour de France was made out to be the big duel between Hinault and Fignon, who had just won the French National Championship. Hinault won the prologue, but Renault took the team time trial, 55 seconds ahead of La Vie Claire. He lost another 49 seconds to Fignon in the first long individual time trial, a discipline he had previously dominated. Following the second time trial, Hinault was only seventh on general classification, two minutes behind his adversary. The next stage led to Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Hinault attacked on the Rampe de Laffrey, but Fignon was able to respond. The two exchanged attacks on the way up the climb, but it was in the valley that Hinault was able to draw out a gap of about a minute. On Alpe d&#x27;Huez itself, he was first passed by eventual stage winner Luis Herrera. When he started to slow, Fignon caught up to him and eventually dropped Hinault, who lost a further three minutes. He ultimately finished the Tour in second place, a significant ten minutes behind Fignon.

Hinault managed to bounce back from his Tour defeat in the fall. In late September, he took his fifth and final victory at the Grand Prix des Nations, riding the time trial at a then record speed of . Fignon could only manage fourth, more than two minutes behind. Next, he won the Trofeo Baracchi, a two-man time trial, in which he competed with Moser. He then won the Giro di Lombardia for a second time, breaking away from the group of favourites from the finish.

====1985: The second Giro-Tour double====
For 1985, Greg LeMond switched teams from Renault to join Hinault at La Vie Claire. Together, they entered the Giro d&#x27;Italia. During the race, Hinault was met with hostility from the home crowd, who supported local rider Francesco Moser. On the stage 12 time trial, Hinault took the pink jersey and opened the decisive gap to Moser, who would eventually finish second. During the stage however, Hinault was spat at by spectators and almost knocked over, even though his team car rode behind him with the door opened the entire time to ensure that bystanders would have a harder time impeding him. Hinault won his third Giro with a margin of just over a minute.

In the Tour de France, Fignon did not take part due to an Achilles heel injury. Hinault therefore entered the race as the favourite. He took victory in the prologue in his native Brittany. La Vie Claire won the stage3 team time trial by over a minute. The next day, Hinault&#x27;s teammate Kim Andersen took over the yellow jersey. Hinault supported him over the next days, even going so far as dropping back when Andersen punctured to lead him back into the peloton, showing his loyalty to riders who would later have to assist him. On stage 8, a time trial to Strasbourg, Hinault took back the race lead, winning the stage by more than two minutes ahead of Stephen Roche. While the race travelled through the Alps and in a second time trial, he consolidated his lead, building an advantage of five and a half minutes on LeMond, who was now second overall.
On stage 14 to Saint-Étienne, LeMond finished two minutes ahead of a group containing Hinault. Involved in a crash with other riders, Hinault crossed the finish line with a broken nose. Around the same time, he started to experience symptoms of bronchitis. On stage 17, he showed signs of weakness and was unable to stay with the other leaders on the Col du Tourmalet. LeMond meanwhile followed an attack by Roche, but was forbidden by the team to cooperate to distance Hinault. LeMond would later claim that the team had deceived him by telling him that Hinault was closer behind than he actually was. Hinault eventually finished the stage just over a minute behind LeMond. The time LeMond waited may have been enough so that the two teammates would have contested the Maillot Jaune in the penultimate time trial. In the penultimate day&#x27;s time trial, LeMond won the stage, but only five seconds ahead of Hinault, not enough to surpass him. This secured Hinault a record-equalling fifth Tour victory, by just under two minutes over his younger teammate. After the finish, he publicly pledged that he would support LeMond&#x27;s bid for a first Tour victory the following year.

====1986: The final season====

On 21 January 1986, Hinault was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour (&quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;) by French president François Mitterrand. He had, in 1982, announced that he would retire from cycling on his 32nd birthday, in November 1986.

Even though Hinault had pledged support for LeMond for the Tour de France, a lot of public attention was given to the possibility of him winning a record sixth Tour. Their La Vie Claire team was seen as dominant, with Laurent Fignon as the most likely challenger. Hinault finished third in the prologue, two seconds ahead of LeMond and Fignon. In the team time trial on stage 2, Fignon and gained almost two minutes on La Vie Claire, partly due to Hinault deciding that the squad would wait for two struggling riders, Niki Rüttimann and Guido Winterberg. Hinault then won the time trial on stage 9, gaining an additional 44 seconds on LeMond, who suffered a broken wheel and had to change his bike. Meanwhile, Fignon fell behind and later abandoned the race. On stage 12, from Bayonne to Pau, Hinault attacked with Pedro Delgado. The pair gained more than four and a half minutes on LeMond, with Delgado taking the stage win. Hinault was now in the lead of the general classification, 5:25 minutes ahead of LeMond. Even though his lead was significant, he attacked again the following day, on the descent of the Col du Tourmalet, the first climb of the day. By the top of the next climb, the Col d&#x27;Aspin, he led the rest of the field by two minutes. However, joint effort behind brought him back before the final ascent up to the ski station of Superbagnères. Hinault then cracked, coming in ninth, 4:39 minutes behind stage winner LeMond. He now led his teammate by only forty seconds in the general classification.

The race then moved over to the Alps. On stage 17, Hinault got left behind on the Col d&#x27;Izoard and lost the yellow jersey to LeMond, falling to third in the overall rankings, 2:47 minutes behind his teammate. Stage 18 featured three major climbs, the Col du Galibier, the Croix de Fer and the final ascent up to Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Hinault attacked repeatedly, but reached the bottom of Alpe d&#x27;Huez with LeMond. He led the way up the climb, lined by approximately 300,000 spectators and crossed the finish line hand in hand with LeMond, in an apparent display of comradery. Urs Zimmermann, who had been second overall at the start of the day, lost more than five minutes. Any signs of appeasement between the rivalling teammates was shattered by Hinault in a television interview shortly after the stage finish, when he declared that the race was not yet over, even though he trailed LeMond by 2:45 minutes.

Stage 20 saw the final time trial and the last chance for Hinault to overcome LeMond&#x27;s advantage. Aided by a crash from LeMond, Hinault won the stage, but gained back only 25 seconds, conceding defeat after the stage. He lost an additional 52 seconds on stage 21. In his last Tour de France stage into Paris, he took part in the final sprint, taking fourth place. He ended his final Tour de France second overall, 3:10 minutes behind LeMond. He won the mountains classification and was also given the super-combativity award. Hinault&#x27;s repeated attacks during the race and refusal to concede defeat irritated LeMond, who felt betrayed by Hinault&#x27;s lack of loyalty.

After the Tour, Hinault won the Coors Classic race in the United States, ahead of LeMond. He rode the World Championships Road Race, held in Colorado Springs. He aimed to win, showing a lot of effort in his preparation. However, he finished the race in 59th place. On 19 September, he won his last competitive race, a criterium in Angers, France. Hinault&#x27;s retirement from professional cycling on 14 November 1986 was celebrated in Quessoy with a symbolic race of 3,600 riders, a concert and fireworks. A total of 15,000 people attended the event.

== Retirement ==

After his retirement from professional cycling, Bernard Hinault moved to his farm and bred dairy cows, assisted by his cousin René, who had become an agricultural engineer. Just two weeks after he ended his career, the Tour de France organisers, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), approached Hinault and invited him to join the race management team. He held several positions, including race regulator and route advisor. After Jean-Marie Leblanc took over the role as general director, Hinault was named the Tour&#x27;s ambassador. Included in his duties was being present during podium ceremonies. During the podium for stage3 of the 2008 Tour de France, a protester jumped on stage and disturbed proceedings. Hinault leapt forward and shoved him off. He stepped down from the role after the 2016 Tour de France. His role as ASO&#x27;s brand ambassador was taken over by Stephen Roche, winner of the 1987 Tour de France.

Unlike many of his competitors, Hinault never became a &quot;directeur sportif&quot; (team manager) after his cycling career. Offers from Bouygues Télécom and a Chinese investor in the mid-2000s fell through. He was the selector of the France national team from 1988 to 1993. 

On 13 July 2007, Hinault was promoted to an Officer of the Legion of Honour (&quot;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;) by President Nicolas Sarkozy.

Hinault took a role as &quot;patron&quot; with the British squad for the 2014 season. In June 2020, Hinault became part of a group of businessmen investing into saving the cycling equipment company Mavic, who are a long-time sponsor of the Tour de France. Mavic was put into receivership earlier in the year due to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Public image and riding style ==
===Riding style and legacy===
During his active career, Hinault was known as the &quot;patron&quot; of the field, meaning the rider with the highest authority. His biographer William Fotheringham has described him as &quot;the last of the sport&#x27;s &quot;patrons&quot;&quot;. In this role, Hinault would use his influence with race organisers, control the pace of the peloton, and allow or refuse other riders the chance to attack. The riders&#x27; strike at Valence d&#x27;Agen in the 1978 Tour is cited as the first instance in which Hinault assumed this role. His fellow riders stated that he, even though he did not talk much, was able to exert a high amount of certainty and therefore strength, which brought him respect and sometimes fear from his competitors. To signal his authority, Hinault often symbolically rode at the front of the field, instead of in the slipstream of his teammates. His riding style has been described as &quot;fighting, full of aggression&quot;, and he stated that when he did not feel good in a race, his reaction would be to attack. Hinault described his own role as follows:
Hinault was however not always successful in his endeavours. During the 1980 Tour de France, he sought to remove the rule which excluded riders outside the time limit on each stage. He urged the riders to protest and ride slowly, but some did not follow his example, forcing Hinault to chase them down before he eventually left the race. His enigmatic exit from the 1980 Tour created tensions with the press that would persist during the rest of his active career. By 1982, debates about his personality started to appear more and more in the media. Particular interest was given to an alleged lack of &quot;panache&quot; during his Tour wins and his behaviour towards fans and officials, whom he treated with open disgust. Fotheringham suggests that Hinault only regained popularity with the French public after his knee problems and his Tour defeat in 1984. Fellow racer Robert Millar suggested that in 1986 in particular, Hinault attempted to win over the French public by riding aggressively.

Hinault was not known to particularly enjoy going on training rides, unless he was specifically preparing for an event. He would often greet his training partners in a night gown when they arrived on time for training or have an easy day of training that included stops at a bakery for cake. His distaste for training became even more evident in the winter, when he would gain a lot of weight. Laurent Fignon described the first training camps of the year as follows: &quot;He looked as if he had been inflated. If you didn&#x27;t know the Badger you would wonder how long it would take for him to get back to what he had been. You would be making a huge mistake.&quot; Hinault was capable of suffering through the training camp and returning to winning form within a month. Unlike a rider like Eddy Merckx, Hinault would not aim to win every race he entered. Millar described his approach as such: &quot;Hinault either cared or he didn&#x27;t. When he didn&#x27;t care about winning he&#x27;d bumble round and hurt you now and again just to remind you he was there.&quot;

With a résumé of victories that includes all three Grand Tours (all of them more than once), the World Road Championships and a number of classics, Hinault has often been cited among the greatest cyclists of all time. The &quot;Historical Dictionary of Cycling&quot; describes him as &quot;one of the best riders ever&quot;. Comparisons are often drawn with Eddy Merckx, against whom Hinault rode at the beginning of his career. Lucien Van Impe commented: &quot;Merckx was the greatest, but Bernard [Hinault] was the most impressive.&quot; A study conducted in 2006, ranking Tour de France riders from 1953 to 2004 by different performance indicators, put Hinault as the top Tour rider of that period, ahead of Merckx and Lance Armstrong.

Prior to the start of the 2022 Tour de France, &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; held a poll to vote on the greatest French cyclist of all time. The third and fourth places were Louison Bobet and Raymond Poulidor both of whom were a good distance behind Hinault and Jacques Anquetil in the voting. Hinault was a member of the jury and his vote turned out to be decisive as he narrowly defeated Anquetil. When asked about it, he made the argument that if Anquetil were in the same position he would likely vote for himself in a similar manner. He also explained, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult for me to analyze... It has always been said that I was the second greatest behind Eddy Merckx at the world level, so it is logical to find myself first at the French level.&quot;

=== Nickname ===
Hinault was nicknamed &quot;le &quot; in French, a term that can be translated into English as either &quot;the shaving brush&quot; or &quot;the badger&quot;. According to Fotheringham, the nickname originates from Hinault&#x27;s early training partners, Maurice Le Guilloux and Georges Talbourdet, who would use the term to tease the young rider. Le Guilloux used it once in front of Pierre Chany, a writer for &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, and the name stuck. According to Hinault himself, the term in the first place was supposed to mean no more than &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;buddy&quot;. However, Hinault later embraced the association with the wild animal. In 2003, he commented: &quot;A badger is a beautiful thing. When it&#x27;s hunted it goes into its sett and waits. When it comes out again, it attacks. That&#x27;s the reason for my nickname. When I&#x27;m annoyed I go home, you don&#x27;t see me for a month. When I come out again, I win.&quot; Hinault, as early as 1983, owned a stuffed badger to demonstrate his association with the animal.

=== Stance on doping ===
Hinault never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during his professional career and was never implicated in any doping practices. He did, however, lead a riders&#x27; protest during a criterium race in Callac in 1982 against the sudden introduction of doping controls. He was handed a one-month suspended ban and fined CHF 1,110, though the penalty was never enforced.

Bernard Hinault has been outspoken about several prominent doping cases in the past years. In 2013, he heavily criticised French senators for revealing the results of tests conducted in 2004 on samples from the 1998 Tour de France. He called the initiative &quot;bullshit&quot; and urged lawmakers &quot;to stop bringing out the dead&quot;, claiming they &quot;want to kill the Tour&quot;. In the same year, he reacted to comments made by Lance Armstrong, a rider stripped of seven Tour victories due to doping offences. Armstrong suggested that it would be impossible to win the Tour de France without performance-enhancing substances. To counter this claim, Hinault replied: &quot;He must not know what it was like to ride without doping.&quot; Armstrong later clarified that he had spoken about the time when he was riding (1999–2005). In early 2018, Hinault also spoke out about the adverse analytical result for salbutamol of four-time Tour winner Chris Froome at the 2017 Vuelta a España. He criticised Froome for taking part in the 2018 Giro d&#x27;Italia while the investigation was still ongoing. In addition, he commented that Froome could not be &quot;listed among the cycling greats&quot;. Froome would win the Giro and become the first rider since Hinault to hold all three Grand Tour Jerseys at once. Before the 2018 Tour de France, with Froome&#x27;s case still ongoing, he urged the other riders to strike in protest if Froome competed. Froome was later cleared of the charges and started the Tour where he finished third behind teammate Geraint Thomas and Tom Dumoulin.

<text>Airport security includes the techniques and methods used in an attempt to protect passengers, staff, aircraft, and airport property from malicious harm, crime, terrorism, and other threats.

Aviation security is a combination of measures and human and material resources in order to safeguard civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference. Unlawful interference could be acts of terrorism, sabotage, threat to life and property, communication of false threat, bombing, etc.

==Description==
Large numbers of people pass through airports every day. This presents potential targets for terrorism and other forms of crime because of the number of people located in one place. Similarly, the high concentration of people on large airliners increases the potentially high death rate with attacks on aircraft, and the ability to use a hijacked airplane as a lethal weapon may provide an alluring target for terrorism (such as during the September 11 attacks).

Airport security attempts to prevent any threats or potentially dangerous situations from arising or entering the country. If airport security does succeed then the chances of any dangerous situation, illegal items or threats entering into an aircraft, country or airport are greatly reduced. As such, airport security serves several purposes: to protect the airport and country from any threatening events, to reassure the traveling public that they are safe and to protect the country and their people. 

Travellers are prohibited to pass the security checkpoint with liquids, including water, that are over . This is due to the risk of liquid explosives such as nitroglycerin which is colourless and indistinguishable from water. It is undetectable with the security X-ray and would pose great threat if brought on board.

Monte R. Belger of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration notes &quot;The goal of aviation security is to prevent harm to aircraft, passengers, and crew, as well as support national security and counter-terrorism policy.&quot;

==Airport enforcement authority==
While some countries may have an agency that protects all of their airports (such as Australia, in which the Australian Federal Police polices the airport), in other countries the protection is controlled at the state or local level. The primary personnel will vary and can include:
*A police force hired and dedicated to the airport e.g. the Irish Airport Police Service
*A branch (substation) of the local police department stationed at the airport
*Members of the local police department assigned to the airport as their normal patrol area
*Members of a country&#x27;s airport protection service. E.g., US TSA
*Police dog services for explosive detection, drug detection and other purposes

Other resources may include:
*Security guards
*Paramilitary forces
*Military forces

==Process and equipment==
Some incidents have been the result of travelers carrying either weapons or items that could be used as weapons on board aircraft so that they can hijack the plane. In passenger security screening, travelers are screened by metal detectors and/or millimeter wave scanners. Explosive detection machines used include X-ray machines and explosives trace-detection portal machines (a.k.a. &quot;puffer machines&quot;). In some cases, detection of explosives can be automated using machine learning techniques. In the United States, the TSA is working on new scanning machines that are still effective searching for objects that are not allowed in the airplanes but that do not depict the passengers in a state of undress that some find embarrassing. Explosive detection machines can also be used for both carry-on and checked baggage. These detect volatile compounds given off from explosives using gas chromatography.

Computed tomography and walk-through body scanning (Thz radiation) may also be done. Artificial intelligence systems are also being used, for example for translation service on information stations around the airport and for reducing the time airplanes spend at the gate between flights (by monitoring and analyzing everything that happens after the aircraft lands). In the future, it may also be used in conjunction with CT machines and Thz radiation detectors. It may also be used for use with biometric deployment across touchpoints and of new solutions, such as risk-based screening and intelligent video analytics.

A recent development is the controversial use of backscatter X-rays to detect hidden weapons and explosives on passengers. These devices, which use Compton scattering, require that the passenger stand close to a flat panel and produce a high resolution image. A technology released in Israel in early 2008 allows passengers to pass through metal detectors without removing their shoes, a process required as walk-through gate detectors are not reliable in detecting metal in shoes or on the lower body extremities. Alternately, the passengers step fully shoed onto a device which scans in under 1.2 seconds for objects as small as a razor blade.
In some countries, specially trained individuals may engage passengers in a conversation to detect threats rather than solely relying on equipment to find threats.

A single backscatter scan exposes the target to between 0.05 and 0.1 microsievert of radiation. In comparison, the exposure from a standard chest x-ray is almost 100 times higher.

While airport security measures are crucial for ensuring passenger safety, they inadvertently introduce hygiene challenges. A study at Helsinki-Vantaa airport during the 2015-2016 flu season pinpointed the plastic security screening trays, frequently used in security checks, as a significant vector for the spread of respiratory viruses. The study emphasizes the need for enhanced sanitation practices in these areas.
Generally people are screened through airport security into areas where the exit gates to the aircraft are located. These areas are often called &quot;secure&quot;, &quot;sterile&quot; and airside (in contrast to &quot;landside&quot; outside security). Passengers are discharged from airliners into the sterile area so that they usually will not have to be re-screened if disembarking from a domestic flight; however they are still subject to search at any time. Airport food outlets have started using plastic glasses and utensils as opposed to glasses made out of glass and utensils made out of metal to reduce the usefulness of such items as weapons. Many airports issue an airside pass to their employees, a secure keycard that allows employees to enter the secure area. Employees requiring an airside pass are subject to numerous security checks, including a criminal records check and proof of identity. They are of course not allowed to use it when they shall fly themselves. Also aircraft crew shall be screened.

In the United States non-passengers were once allowed on the concourses to meet arriving friends or relatives at their gates, but this is now greatly restricted due to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Non-passengers must obtain a gate pass to enter the secure area of the airport. The most common reasons that a non-passenger may obtain a gate pass is to assist children and the elderly as well as for attending business meetings that take place in the secure area of the airport. In the United States, at least 24 hours notice is generally required for those planning to attend a business meeting inside the secure area of the airport. Other countries, such as Australia do not restrict non-travellers from accessing the airside area, however non-travellers are typically subject to the same security scans as travellers.

Sensitive areas in airports, including airport ramps and operational spaces, are restricted from the general public. Called a SIDA (Security Identification Display Area), these spaces require special qualifications to enter. Systems can consist of physical access control gates or more passive systems that monitor people moving through restricted areas and sound an alert if a restricted area is entered.

Throughout the world, there have been a few dozen airports that have instituted a version of a &quot;trusted traveler program&quot;. Proponents argue that security screening can be made more efficient by detecting those people who are threats and then searching them. They argue that searching trusted, verified individuals should not take the amount of time it does. Critics argue that such programs decrease security by providing an easier path to carry contraband through.

Another critical security measure used by several regional and international airports is that of fiber optic perimeter intrusion detection systems. These security systems allow airport security to locate and detect any intrusion on the airport perimeter, ensuring real-time, immediate intrusion notification that allows security personnel to assess the threat and track movement and engage necessary security procedures. This has notably been utilised at Dulles International Airport and U.S. Military JFPASS.

==Notable incidents==
On May 30, 1972, three members of the Japanese Red Army undertook a terrorist attack, popularly called the Lod Airport massacre, at the Lod Airport, now known as the Ben Gurion International Airport, in Lod. Firing indiscriminately with automatic firearms and throwing grenades, they managed to kill 24 people and injure 78 others before being neutralized (one of them through suicide). One of the three terrorists, Kozo Okamoto, survived the incident.

The world&#x27;s first terrorist attack while in flight was Cubana Flight 455 on October 6, 1976, when the airliner flying from Barbados to Jamaica was brought down by two time bombs, killing 73 people. Evidence implicated several Central Intelligence Agency-linked anti-Castro Cuban exiles and members of the Venezuelan secret police DISIP, including Luis Posada Carriles.

The single deadliest airline catastrophe resulting from the failure of airport security to detect an onboard bomb was Air India Flight 182 in 1985, which killed 329 people.

Another onboard bomb that slipped through airport security was the one on Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, which killed 270 people; 259 on the plane, and 11 residents of Lockerbie, Scotland.

Another notable failure was the 1994 bombing of Philippine Airlines Flight 434, which turned out to be a test run for a planned terrorist attack called Operation Bojinka. The explosion was small, killing one person, and the plane made an emergency landing. Operation Bojinka was discovered and foiled by Manila police in 1995.

The Rome and Vienna airport attacks in December 1985 were two more instances of airport security failures. The attacks left 20 people dead when gunmen threw grenades and opened fire on travelers at El Al airline ticket counters.

The September 11 attacks are the most widely recognized terrorist attacks in recent times involving air travel. On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 members of the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda took control of four airplanes on the east coast of the United States and deliberately crashed two into both World Trade Center towers in New York City and the third into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. A fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, not reaching Washington, D.C., for its intended target, either the U.S. Capitol or the White House. The attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people, including the 245 civilians, a law enforcement officer, and the 19 hijackers on board the four airplanes.

On July 5, 2002, a gunman opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport (Israel&#x27;s El Al Ticket Counter). The shooter killed two people and injured four.

On August 10, 2006, security at airports in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States was raised significantly due to the uncovering by British authorities of a terror plot aimed at detonating liquid explosives on flights originating from these countries. This is also notable as it was the first time the U.S. Terror Alert Level ever reached &quot;red&quot;. The incident also led to tighter restrictions on carrying liquids and gels in hand luggage in the EU, Canada, and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;1546/2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2020, Southwest Airlines Flight 1392 struck and killed a pedestrian while landing on runway 17R at Austin–Bergstrom International Airport. No injuries were reported to the 53 passengers and 5 crew aboard the aircraft. The victim, who was not a badged airport employee, was subsequently confirmed to have breached airport security in reaching the runway. The accident is under investigation.

==Airport security forces by country/region==
===Canada===
All restrictions involving airport security are determined by Transport Canada and some are implemented by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) in conjunction with the Airport Operator. Since the September 11 attacks, as well as the Air India bombing in 1985 and other incidents, airport security has tightened in Canada in order to prevent any attacks in Canadian Airspace.

CATSA uses x-ray machines to verify the contents of all carry-ons as well as metal detectors, explosive trace detection (ETD) equipment and random physical searches of passengers at the pre-board screening points. X-ray machines, CTX machines, high-resolution x-rays and ETDs are also used to scan checked bags. All checked baggage is always x-rayed at all major commercial airports.

CATSA launched its Restricted Area Identity Card (RAIC) program in January 2007. RAIC is the world&#x27;s first dual biometric access control system for airports. This program replaces the old Airport Restricted Area Passes issued to airport employees after security checks by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Transport Canada with new cards (issued after the same checks are conducted) that contain biometric information (fingerprints and iris scans) belonging to the person issued the RAIC.

While CATSA is responsible for pre-board passenger and random non-passenger screening, they contract out to third-party &quot;service providers&quot; such as G4S, Securitas and GardaWorld to train, manage and employ the screening officers. In addition, individual airport authorities which were privatized in the 1990s by the Canadian Government are responsible for general airport security rather than CATSA and normally contract out to private companies and in the case of large airports, pay for a small contingent of local police officers to remain on site as well.

Safety and security at Canada&#x27;s airports are provided by local police forces. The RCMP once used to provide this service at most airports, but remains so only for a few today:

* Vancouver International Airport — RCMP Richmond detachment
* Calgary International Airport — Calgary Police Service Airport Unit (1997)
* Edmonton International Airport — RCMP Edmonton International Airport detachment
* Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport — Winnipeg Police Service (1997)
* Toronto Pearson International Airport — Peel Regional Police Airport Division (1997) with assistance from the RCMP Toronto Airport detachment
* Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport — Ottawa Police Service Airport Policing Section (1997)
* Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport — Airport Unit of the Montreal Police Service with assistance from the RCMP Airport Unit
* Halifax Stanfield International Airport — Halifax Regional Police

===European Union===
Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes common rules in the European Union to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference. The regulation&#x27;s provisions apply to all airports or parts of airports located in an EU country that are not used exclusively for military purposes. The provisions also apply to all operators, including air carriers, providing services at the aforementioned airports. It also applies to all entities located inside or outside airport premises providing services to airports.
The standards of regulation 300/2008 are implemented by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.

The regulation no 2320/2002 from 2002 introduced the requirement to have security checks for all passenger flights, also domestic. Some EU countries had no checks for domestic flights until around 2005 (introducing full security checks took some time since terminals might need expansion).

====Finland====
Passenger, luggage and freight security checking and security guard duties are outsourced to contractors. General public security is the responsibility of the Finnish Police, which has an airport unit at Helsinki Airport. The airport unit has a criminal investigation, a canine and a TEPO (terrorist and bomb) squad, and a PTR (police, customs and border guard) intelligence component. Furthermore, units of the Finnish Border Guard units at airports often arrest wanted individuals or fugitives at the border, and the Finnish Customs seizes e.g. weapons, false documents or explosives in addition to wanted individuals.

====France====
French security has been stepped up since terrorist attacks in France in 1986. In response France established the Vigipirate program. The program uses troops to reinforce local security and increases requirements in screenings and ID checks. Since 1996 security check-points have transferred from the Police Nationale and Gendarmerie de l&#x27;Air to private companies hired by the airport authorities.

====Iceland====
As a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland has adopted EC regulation No 300/2008 into national law and thus complies with EU standards on airport security for all international flights. Domestic flights within Icelandic territory are however exempted from the security rules. The exemption was granted by the EEA Joint Committee citing the geographical remoteness of the country as well as its low population density and small size of aircraft used in domestic operations.

====Netherlands====
Airport security in the Netherlands is provided by the Koninklijke Marechaussee, Royal Military Constabulary. In addition to the Royal Military Constabulary, security services in and around airports in the Netherlands are provided by multiple Private security companies. Since early 2020, security staff at Schiphol Airport make use of CT-scans on all passenger filters, allowing passengers to keep their liquids and electronics inside of their bags as opposed to having to take them out.
====Spain====
Airport security in Spain is provided by police forces, as well as private security guards. The Policía Nacional provides general security as well as passport (in international airports) and documentation checking. In Catalonia and Basque Country, the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra and the Ertzaintza, respectively, have replaced the Policía Nacional except for documentation functions. The Guardia Civil handles the security and customs checking, often aided by private security guards. Local police provide security and traffic control outside the airport building.

Security measures are controlled by the state-owned company Aena, and are bound to European Commission Regulations, as in other European Union countries.

====Sweden====
Airport security is handled by security guards provided by the airport itself, with police assistance if needed. The Swedish Transport Agency decides the rules for the check, based on international and European regulations. Airports are generally defined by law as &quot;vital installations&quot;, which give protection guards extra authority, like demanding identity documents and search people&#x27;s belongings. Sweden has traditionally seen itself as a low-crime country with little need for security checks. Sweden introduced security checks for international departures when international regulations demanded that around the 1970s/1980s. In September 2001, there was a decision to introduce security checks also for domestic flights. This took a few years to implement as domestic airports and terminals were not prepared with room for this. At smaller airports fire fighters can also be security guards.

===United Kingdom===

The Department for Transport (DfT) is the governing authority for airport security in the United Kingdom, with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also responsible for certain security regulatory functions. In September 2004, with the Home Office, DfT started an initiative called the &quot;Multi Agency Threat and Risk Assessment&quot; (MATRA), which was piloted at five of the United Kingdom&#x27;s major airports — Heathrow, Birmingham, East Midlands Airport, Newcastle and Glasgow. Following successful trials, the scheme has now been rolled out across all 44 airports.

Since the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, the United Kingdom has been assessed as a high risk country due to its support of the United States in its invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq.

From January 7, 2008, travellers are no longer limited to a single piece of carry-on luggage at most of the UK&#x27;s major airports. Currently, hand luggage is not limited by size or weight by the DfT/CAA, although most airlines do impose their own rules.

The UK trialed a controversial new method of screening passengers to further improve airport security using backscatter X-ray machines that provide a 360-degree view of a person, as well as &quot;see&quot; under clothes, right down to the skin and bones. They are no longer used and were replaced by millimeter wave scanners which shows any hidden items while not showing the body of the passenger.

===Hong Kong===

The Hong Kong International Airport is secured by the Hong Kong Police Force and Aviation Security Company (AVSECO). Within the police force, the Airport District is responsible for the safety and security of the airport region. Airport Security Units are deployed around the airport and are armed with H&amp;K MP5 A3 sub-machine guns and Glock 17 pistols. The security of the restricted area is the responsibility of the police and AVSECO.

While the airport is under the control of the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), the security power has been delegated to the AVSECO staffs. All persons and baggages carried by them must be X-Rayed and checked at the security screening points of the AVSECO (with a few exceptions at the Tenant Restricted Area).

The Immigration Department will check incomers passport and other identities, while the Customs and Excise Department will check passengers and crews&#x27; luggage to discourage smuggling of drugs and contraband from entering Hong Kong.

===India===
India stepped up its airport security after the 1999 Kandahar hijacking. The Central Industrial Security Force, a paramilitary organisation, is in charge of airport security under the regulatory framework of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (Ministry of Civil Aviation). CISF formed an Airport Security Group to protect Indian airports. Every airport has now been given an APSU (Airport Security Unit), a trained unit to counter unlawful interference with civil aviation. Apart from the CISF, every domestic airline has a security group who looks after the aircraft security.

Terrorist threats and narcotics are the main threats in Indian airports. Another problem that some airports face is the proliferation of slums around the airport boundaries in places like Mumbai. Before boarding, additional searching of hand luggage is likely. Moreover, other than this, the CISF has many other duties in context of aviation security. The cargo security and screening is done by the Regulated Agents or airlines&#x27; and airports&#x27; own security staff who are tested and certified by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), an aviation security regulator.

===Israel===
El Al Airlines is headquartered in Israel. The last hijacking occurred on July 23, 1968, and no plane departing Ben Gurion Airport, just outside Tel Aviv, has ever been hijacked.

It was in 1972 that terrorists from the Japanese Red Army launched an attack that led to the deaths of at least 24 people at Lod Airport. Since then, security at the airport relies on a number of fundamentals, including a heavy focus on what Raphael Ron, former director of security at Ben Gurion Airport, terms the &quot;human factor&quot;, which may be generalized as &quot;the inescapable fact that terrorist attacks are carried out by people who can be found and stopped by an effective security methodology.&quot;

On December 27, 1985, terrorists simultaneously attacked El Al ticket counters at the Rome, Italy and Vienna, Austria airports using machine guns and hand grenades. Nineteen civilians were killed and many wounded. In response, Israel developed further methods to stop such massacres and drastically improved security measures around Israeli airports and even promised to provide plainclothes armed guards at each foreign airport. The last successful airline-related terrorist attack was in 1986, when a security agent found a suitcase full of explosives during the initial screening process. While the bag did not make it on board, it did injure 13 after detonating in the terminal.

As part of its focus on this so-called &quot;human factor,&quot; Israeli security officers interrogate travelers using racial profiling, singling out those who appear to be Arab based on name or physical appearance. Additionally, all passengers, even those who do not appear to be of Arab descent, are questioned as to why they are traveling to Israel, followed by several general questions about the trip in order to search for inconsistencies. Although numerous civil rights groups have demanded an end to the profiling, Israel maintains that it is both effective and unavoidable. According to Ariel Merari, an Israeli terrorism expert, &quot;it would be foolish not to use profiling when everyone knows that most terrorists come from certain ethnic groups. They are likely to be Muslim and young, and the potential threat justifies inconveniencing a certain ethnic group.

Passengers leaving Israel are checked against a computerized list. The computers, maintained by the Israeli Ministry of Interior, are connected to the Israeli police, FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol in order to catch suspects or others leaving the country illegally.

Despite such tight security, an incident occurred on November 17, 2002, in which a man apparently slipped through airport security at Ben Gurion Airport with a pocketknife and attempted to storm the cockpit of El Al Flight 581 en route from Tel Aviv to Istanbul, Turkey. While no injuries were reported and the attacker was subdued by guards hidden among the passengers 15 minutes before the plane landed safely in Turkey, authorities did shut down Ben Gurion for some time after the attack to reassess the security situation and an investigation was opened to determine how the man, an Israeli Arab, managed to smuggle the knife past the airport security.

At a conference in May 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Reuters interviewers that the United States will seek to adopt some of the Israeli security measures at domestic airports. He left his post in January 2009, a mere 6 months after this statement, which may or may not have been enough time to implement them.

On a more limited focus, American airports have been turning to the Israeli government and Israeli-run firms to help upgrade security in the post-9/11 world. Israeli officials toured Los Angeles Airport in November 2008 to re-evaluate the airport after making security upgrade recommendations in 2006. Calling Ben Gurion &quot;the world&#x27;s safest airport,&quot; Antonio Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles, has implemented the Israeli review in order to bring state-of-the-art technology and other tactical measures to help secure LAX, considered to be the state&#x27;s primary terrorist target and singled out by the Al Qaeda network. New Age Security Solutions, led by the former director of security at Ben Gurion and based in Washington, D.C., consults on aviation security at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport.

Other U.S. airports to incorporate Israeli tactics and systems include Port of Oakland and the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. &quot;The Israelis are legendary for their security, and this is an opportunity to see firsthand what they do, how they do it and, as importantly, the theory behind it,&quot; said Steven Grossman, director of aviation at the Port of Oakland. He was so impressed with a briefing presented by the Israelis that he suggested a trip to Israel to the U.S. branch of Airports Council International in order to gain a deeper understanding of the methods employed by Israeli airport security and law enforcement.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan Airports Security Force (ASF) is responsible for protecting the airports and the facilities and the planes. ASF safeguards the civil aviation industry against unlawful interference, adopting counter terrorism measures, preventing crime and maintaining law and order within the limits of airports in Pakistan.

===Singapore===

Security for the country&#x27;s two international passenger airports comes under the purview of the Airport Police Division of the Singapore Police Force, although resources are concentrated at Singapore Changi Airport where scheduled passenger traffic dominates. Seletar Airport, which specialises in handling non-scheduled and training flights, is seen as posing less of a security issue. Since the September 11 attacks, and the naming of Changi Airport as a terrorism target by the Jemaah Islamiyah, the airport&#x27;s security has been stepped up. With that, security screening is using X-ray machines for now, whereas the C3 scanners were being explored. Security screening is within the transition zone from public to sterile area and is guarded under the &quot;Infrastructure Protection Act&quot;.

Since 8 May 2007, the liquid restrictions of 100 ml cap is enforced, following the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Passengers are advised to check in liquids, gels and aerosols above 100 ml, failing which they will be confiscated by airport security and have to post it back to oneself. Anything that is in the security areas is allowed. In general practice, unacceptable materials are also confiscated and have to post it back to yourself (excluding nail clippers, nail files, umbrellas and racquets).
===United States===

Prior to the 1970s, American airports had minimal security arrangements to prevent acts of terrorism. For some flights with unassigned seating, no reservations were required, and fares were collected in the air. Federal security personnel started serving on high-risk flights in 1962 as the FAA Peace Officers Program; sky marshals began working out of the Miami field office of the United States Marshals Service in 1969. (Hijackers typically wanted to defect to Cuba, making flights from Florida common targets.) There were insufficient numbers to protect every flight, and hijackings continued to take place. The first hijacking resulting in a fatality occurred on Eastern Air Lines Shuttle Flight 1320 in 1970. Later in 1970, sky marshal staffing was increased, and some passengers fitting a behavioral profile were screened for weapons (including with handheld metal detectors).

On November 10, 1972, a trio of hijackers threatened to fly Southern Airways Flight 49 into a nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. As a direct response to this incident, the Federal Aviation Administration required all airlines to begin screening passengers and their carry-on baggage by January 5, 1973. This screening was generally contracted to private security companies. Private companies would bid on these contracts. The airline that had operational control of the departure concourse controlled by a given checkpoint would hold that contract. Although an airline would control the operation of a checkpoint, oversight authority was held by the FAA. C.F.R. Title 14 restrictions did not permit a relevant airport authority to exercise any oversight over checkpoint operations. The 1974 film, &quot;The Parallax View&quot;, shows an early airport security checkpoint in operation.

The September 11 attacks prompted even tougher regulations, such as limiting the number of and types of items passengers could carry on board aircraft and requiring increased screening for passengers who fail to present a government-issued photo ID.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act generally required that by November 19, 2002, all passenger screening must be conducted by federal employees. As a result, passenger and baggage screening is now provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Provisions to improve the technology for detecting explosives were included in the Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Often, security at category X airports, the U.S. largest and busiest as measured by volume of passenger traffic, is provided by private contractors. Because of the high volume of passenger traffic, category X airports are considered vulnerable targets for terrorism.

Following the failed 2006 liquid bomb plot, United States Homeland Security banned all liquids and gels except baby formula and prescription medicines in the name of the ticket holder in carry-on luggage on all flights and started requiring all passengers to remove their shoes for screening.

From 13 August 2006, airline passengers in the United States could take up to of non-prescription medicine, glucose gel for diabetics, solid lipstick, and baby food aboard flights. Eventually passengers were allowed to carry only of liquid in their hand luggage, TSA standards required all non-medical liquids to be kept in a quart-sized plastic bag, with only one bag per passenger.

With the increase in security screening, some airports saw long queues for security checks. To alleviate this, airports created Premium lines for passengers traveling in First or Business Class, or those who were elite members of a particular airline&#x27;s Frequent Flyer program.

The &quot;Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques&quot; (SPOT) program is operating at some U.S. airports.

In 2023 US DHS Science and Technology Directorate&#x27;s screening-at-speed program announced that is transforming the current single line screening process into a self-screening flow similar to self-checkout at a US grocery store.

<doc id="284774" wikidata="Q750220" url="?curid=284774" title="Huedin">
<text>Huedin (, ; ; ) is a town in Cluj County, Transylvania, Romania.

Huedin is located at the northern edge of the Apuseni Mountains. It is surrounded by the villages of Nearșova, Domoșu, Horlacea, and others. The town administers one village, Bicălatu (&quot;Magyarbikal&quot;). Lately, Huedin has started to be known for its ecotourism initiatives.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, Huedin had a population of 8,069. The 2011 census data of the town&#x27;s population counted 9,346 people, of which 59.32% were ethnic Romanians, 28.88% ethnic Hungarians, and 11.45% ethnic Roma.

==History==
The town of Huedin was founded in the Middle Ages. It is home to a 13th-century Gothic Reformed Church. From 1330 up until 1848, the landlords of the town were the Bánffy family, whence the town&#x27;s Hungarian name of Bánffyhunyad. The town was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1526, Huedin became part of the Principality of Transylvania and, until 1867, of the Grand Duchy of Transylvania.

The town boasts a strong historical Hungarian heritage. On September 26, 1895, Emperor Franz Joseph visited Bánffyhunyad following the end of Hungarian Army manoeuvres in Transylvania and was given an enthusiastic welcome by the townspeople, who built an arch decorated with the region&#x27;s flowers and plants for the occasion. In 1910, the town&#x27;s population was 5,194, of whom 90.5% spoke Hungarian. At that time, 57.5% were Calvinist, 20.7% Jewish, and 10% Roman Catholic. 

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Huedin in December 1918, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The town officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. During the interwar period, the town was the headquarters of plasa Huedin, within Cluj County. In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Huedin) from Romania. Towards the end of World War II, however, the town was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944. After 1950, the town became the headquarters of Huedin raion within the Cluj Region. Following the administrative reform of 1968, Huedin became once more part of Cluj County.

* Dezideriu Horvath (born 1970), speed skater
* Atilla Kiss B. (born 1963), operatic tenor 
* (1899–1983), painter, graphic designer, and sculptor

==Accessibility==
The town is accessible by CFR trains from Cluj-Napoca and other cities, such as Oradea, Timișoara, Satu Mare, Brașov, Ploiești, Bucharest, and Budapest. The Huedin railway station serves the CFR Line 300, which connects Bucharest to the Hungarian border near Oradea.

<text>Predeal (; ) is a town in Brașov County, Muntenia, Romania. Predeal, a mountain resort town, is the highest town in Romania. It is located in the Prahova Valley, Muntenia at an elevation of over . The town administers three villages: Pârâul Rece, Timișu de Jos, and Timișu de Sus. Predeal is twinned with Macugnaga, Italy.

Beginning in the 2000s, the area experienced a boom in construction, and now many wealthy families own mountain retreats in Predeal. During the 2013 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival, it hosted the cross-country skiing and snowboarding competitions.

==Name==
The name Predeal is derived from the Slavic word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;border&quot;.

== History ==
The town was severely damaged during the Battle of Predeal Pass in World War I. Although the town itself was lost to the attacking Central Powers&#x27; forces, the battle ultimately resulted in a Romanian defensive victory.

== Geography ==
Predeal is situated in the Centru development region of Romania, in the Prahova Valley, in the southern part of Brașov County. Neighboring towns include Azuga to the south, Bușteni to the southwest, Râșnov to the northwest, and the city of Brașov to the north.

The town is mountainous, with the Piatra Mare Mountains to the north, the Bucegi Mountains to the southwest, and the Postăvarul Massif to the northwest. The woods around Predeal have a rich and diversified fauna, including a high number of wild boars, European pine martens, bears, foxes, gray wolves, deer, squirrels, rabbits, badgers, and heather cocks.

==Climate==
Predeal has a warm summer and cold winter (with a lot of snow) humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

== Tourism ==
The town of Predeal is a well-known tourist destination in Romania, especially in winter. It has five major ski runs, each with a difficulty grade. Most of them have snowmaking guns, and some are fitted with floodlights and ski lifts. The slopes range from (Clăbucet variantă) to (Cocoșul).

Some of the town&#x27;s tourist attractions include the 3 Brazi Chalet, the Susai Chalet, and the Poiana Secuilor Chalet. In close proximity to Predeal are several tourist destinations, including the Peleș Castle, Râșnov Citadel, Bran Castle, the Old Town of Brașov, Biserica Neagră, and the Seven Ladders Canyon.

The town has been certified as a climate resort by government decree (H.G. 226/1992) due to the strongly ionized air rich in ultraviolet radiation and the low atmospheric pressure. Because of this, Predeal is popular within the holistic healing community.

== Infrastructure ==
The town is crossed by two national roads (DN1 and DN73A) and one national railway (Căile Ferate Române Line 300, one of the main lines in Romania). Predeal is one of the cities which will be crossed by the future Bucharest – Brașov motorway.

<doc id="284782" wikidata="Q1702716" url="?curid=284782" title="Jomsborg">
<text>Jomsborg or Jómsborg () was a semi-legendary Viking stronghold at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (medieval Wendland, modern Pomerania), that existed between the 960s and 1043. Its inhabitants were known as Jomsvikings. Jomsborg&#x27;s exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was located on the eastern outlet of the Oder river. Historian Lauritz Weibull dismissed Jomsborg as a legend.

The only source that mentions a precise location of Jomsborg () is the controversial &quot;Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; that was discovered in the autumn of 2019.

== Location ==
Jomsborg is often thought to be identical with the present-day town of Wolin (also Wollin) on the southeastern tip of the isle of Wolin in northwestern Poland, probably located at Srebrna Góra hill north of the town. In the Early Middle Ages, modern Wolin was the site of a multi-ethnic emporium (then known as &quot;Jumne&quot; or &quot;Julin&quot;). The Nordic sagas use &quot;Jómsborg&quot; exclusively, while medieval German histories use &quot;Jumne&quot; or &quot;Julin&quot;, with the alternate names, some of which may be spelling variants, &quot;vimne&quot;, &quot;uimne&quot;, &quot;Jumneta&quot;, &quot;Juminem&quot;, &quot;Julinum&quot;, &quot;uineta&quot;, &quot;Vineta&quot; and &quot;Vinneta&quot;.

In 1931/32, Pomeranian historian Adolf Hofmeister (1883-1956) suggested, through comparison of the events reported by the different chronicles, that all these terms describe the same place, which is at or near the modern town of Wolin. However, this is by no means universally accepted; professor and historian Steven Fanning writes: &quot;The Trelleborg-type fortresses of Denmark have been taken to be actual examples of Jómsborg-style camps of such warriors and Wolin in Poland was believed to be the actual Jómsborg. However, all such attempts to locate Jómsborg or encampments of the Jómvikings have failed, leading many to doubt that Jómvikings ever existed outside of literature.&quot; According to Władysław Filipowiak there are several dated sources which attest to the presence of a company of armed Vikings at the end of the 10th century in Wolin, who may have been installed there as mercenaries by the Polish king Bolesław the Brave. Ruins discovered in Wolin in 2023 are being investigated as a possible site of Jomsborg.

Other theories see Jomsborg in the northwest of nearby Usedom island, on lands now submerged. The small islands in this area are remnants of a long stretch of land between Usedom and Rügen, which fell victim to storm floods in the early 14th century. Suspected locations in this area are the Veritas grounds between the petty islands of Ruden and Greifswalder Oie, and the Peenemünde shoals. While Viking Age jewelry has been found at the site, archaeological evaluation of these theories has not yet been possible.

== Fortress ==
According to the &quot;Knytlingasaga&quot; and &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, Jomsborg was built by the Danish king Harold Bluetooth (910-985/86) in the 960s. The Jomsvikinga Saga mentions Danish Viking Palnatoki as its founder.

In medieval records, Jomsborg is described as a fortress with a harbour. The harbour was overseen by a stone tower mounted with catapults, built on an arch spanning over the harbour entrance which could be closed by an iron gate. According to the oldest records, the harbour had space for three ships; later records give a capacity of up to 360 ships.

According to the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Jomsborg was destroyed in 1043 by Dano-Norwegian king Magnus the Good. The fortress was burned down, and many of the inhabitants were killed.

== Jomsvikings ==

The Jomsborg Vikings (Jomsvikings) were composed of selected warriors who adhered to a special codex and were loyal only to their leader. Most records list as jarl of Jomsborg, Sigvald(i), son of petty king Strut-Harald of then Danish Scania. Sigvald died some time before 1010.

== The Curmsun Disc and the &quot;Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; ==

A golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsborg appeared in Sweden in autumn 2014, first presented by Swedish archaeologist Sven Rosborn. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25.23 grams. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: &quot;+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+&quot; and translates as &quot;Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, diocese of Aldinburg&quot;.

It is claimed that the disc was a part of a Viking hoard found in 1841 in the Polish village Wiejkowo near the town of Wolin by Heinrich Boldt.

Following the find of the disc, Sven Rosborn also found a text that purports to be modern Polish translation of an otherwise unknown Latin chronicle, &quot;Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;, which in addition to providing details on the Jomsvikings and Jomsborg, attributes to Jomsborg a location near Paprotno, Poland, at . Rosborn has visited the location and confirms that it matches the descriptions of Jomsborg from the various sagas and chronicles, and that various artifacts found on the surface of the location seem to match the period of time in which Jomsborg existed.

However, both the disc and the chronicle has been criticized for their unclear provenance. Archaeologist Jes Wienberg has criticized Rosborn for not allowing other scholars direct access to the finds, and that it thus is not possible to properly evaluate them. Historians Kurt Villads Jensen and Wojtek Jezierski have claimed that they are forgeries, noting that the disc has no known analogue, and that the chronicle contains several anachronisms.

== Historical events ==
* Harald Bluetooth died at Jomsborg in 985/86. 
* Styrbjörn the Strong of Sweden and a force of Jomsvikings departed from Jomsborg to reclaim the Swedish throne from Eric the Victorious, yet were defeated in the Battle of Fýrisvellir near Gamla Uppsala in the mid 980s, probably in 986.
* Sweyn Forkbeard and a force of Jomsvikings departed from Jomsborg to eliminate jarl Haakon Sigurdsson of Norway, but were defeated in the Battle of Hjörungavágr (~990).
* Olaf I of Norway and a Jomsviking contingent departed from Jomsborg for the Battle of Svolder in 999 or 1000 AD.

<text>Cornus is a genus of about 30–60 species of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, commonly known as dogwoods or cornels, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, and distinctive bark. Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and some species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species.

Species include the common dogwood &quot;Cornus sanguinea&quot; of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood &quot;(Cornus florida)&quot; of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood &quot;Cornus nuttallii&quot; of western North America, the Kousa dogwood &quot;Cornus kousa&quot; of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), &quot;Cornus canadensis&quot; and &quot;Cornus suecica&quot; respectively.

Depending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine genera or subgenera; a broadly inclusive genus &quot;Cornus&quot; is accepted here.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Cornus&quot; is the Latin word for the cornel tree, &quot;Cornus mas&quot;.
The name &quot;cornel&quot; dates to the 1550s, via German from Middle Latin &quot;cornolium&quot;, ultimately from the diminutive &quot;cornuculum&quot;, of &quot;cornum&quot;, the Latin word for the cornel cherry. &quot;Cornus&quot; means &quot;horn&quot;,
presumably applied to the cherry after the example of κερασός, the Greek word for &quot;cherry&quot;, which itself is of pre-Greek origin but reminiscent of κέρας, the Greek word for &quot;horn&quot;.

The name &quot;dog-tree&quot; entered the English vocabulary before 1548, becoming &quot;dogwood&quot; by 1614. Once the name dogwood was affixed to this kind of tree, it soon acquired a secondary name as the hound&#x27;s tree, while the fruits came to be known as &quot;dogberries&quot; or &quot;houndberries&quot; (the latter a name also for the berries of black nightshade, alluding to Hecate&#x27;s hounds).

The name was explained, from as early as the 16th century itself, as derived from &quot;dag&quot; &quot;skewer&quot;, as the wood of the tree was said to have been used to make butcher&#x27;s skewers. This is uncertain, as the form &quot;*dagwood&quot; was never attested. It is also possible that the tree was named for its berry, called &quot;dogberry&quot; from at least the 1550s, where the implication could be that the quality of the berry is inferior, as it were &quot;fit for a dog&quot;.
An older name of the dogwood in English is &quot;whipple-tree&quot;, occurring in a list of trees (as &quot;whipultre&quot;) in Geoffrey Chaucer &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.
This name is cognate with the Middle Low German &quot;wipel-bom&quot; &quot;cornel&quot;, Dutch &quot;wepe, weype&quot; &quot;cornel&quot; (the &quot;wh-&quot; in Chaucer is unetymological, the word would have been Middle English &quot;wipel&quot;). The tree was so named for waving its branches, c.f. Middle Dutch &quot;wepelen&quot; &quot;totter, waver&quot;, Frisian &quot;wepeln&quot;, German &quot;wippen&quot;.

The name &quot;whippletree&quot;, also &quot;whiffle-tree&quot;, now refers to an element of the traction of a horse-drawn cart linking the draw pole of the cart to the harnesses of the horses in file. In this sense it is first recorded in 1733. This mechanism was usually made from oak or ash (and not from dogwood), and it is unlikely that there is a connection to the name for &quot;whipple-tree&quot; for Cornus.

==Description==
Dogwoods have simple, untoothed leaves with the veins curving distinctively as they approach the leaf margins. Most dogwood species have opposite leaves, while a few, such as &quot;Cornus alternifolia&quot; and &quot;C. controversa,&quot; have their leaves alternate. Dogwood flowers have four parts. In many species, the flowers are borne separately in open (but often dense) clusters, while in various other species (such as the flowering dogwood), the flowers themselves are tightly clustered, lacking showy petals, but surrounded by four to six large, typically white petal-like bracts.

The fruits of all dogwood species are drupes with one or two seeds, often brightly colorful. The drupes of species in the subgenus &quot;Cornus&quot; are edible. Many are without much flavor. &quot;Cornus kousa&quot; and &quot;Cornus mas&quot; are sold commercially as edible fruit trees. The fruits of &quot;Cornus kousa&quot; have a sweet, tropical pudding like flavor in addition to hard pits. The fruits of &quot;Cornus mas&quot; are both tart and sweet when completely ripe. They have been eaten in Eastern Europe for centuries, both as food and medicine to fight colds and flus. They are very high in vitamin C. By contrast, the fruits of species in subgenus &quot;Swida&quot; are mildly toxic to people, though readily eaten by birds.

Dogwoods are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of butterflies and moths, including the emperor moth, the engrailed, the small angle shades, and the following case-bearers of the genus &quot;Coleophora&quot;: &quot;C. ahenella&quot;, &quot;C. salicivorella&quot; (recorded on &quot;Cornus canadensis&quot;), &quot;C. albiantennaella&quot;, &quot;C. cornella&quot; and &quot;C. cornivorella,&quot; with the latter three all feeding exclusively on &quot;Cornus.&quot;

==Uses==
Dogwoods are widely planted horticulturally, and the dense wood of the larger-stemmed species is valued for certain specialized purposes. Cutting boards and fine turnings can be made from this fine grained and beautiful wood. Over 32 different varieties of game birds, including quail, feed on the red seeds.

===Horticulture===
Various species of &quot;Cornus,&quot; particularly the flowering dogwood &quot;(Cornus florida),&quot; are ubiquitous in American gardens and landscaping; horticulturist Donald Wyman stated, &quot;There is a dogwood for almost every part of the U.S. except the hottest and driest areas&quot;. In contrast, in Northwest Europe the lack of sharp winters and hot summers makes &quot;Cornus florida&quot; very shy of flowering.

Other &quot;Cornus&quot; species are stoloniferous shrubs that grow naturally in wet habitats and along waterways. Several of these are used along highways and in naturalizing landscape plantings, especially those species with bright red or bright yellow stems, particularly conspicuous in winter, such as &quot;Cornus stolonifera&quot;.

The following cultivars, of mixed or uncertain origin, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017):
* &#x27;Eddie&#x27;s White Wonder&#x27;
* &#x27;Norman Hadden&#x27;
* &#x27;Ormonde&#x27;
* &#x27;Porlock&#x27;

===Fruits===
The species &quot;Cornus mas&quot; is commonly cultivated in southeastern Europe for its showy, edible berries, that have the color of the carnelian gemstone. Cornelian-cherries have one seed each and are used in syrups and preserves.

===Wood===
Dense and fine-grained, dogwood timber has a density of 0.79 and is highly prized for making loom shuttles, tool handles, roller skates and other small items that require a very hard and strong wood. Though it is tough for woodworking, some artisans favor dogwood for small projects such as walking canes, arrow making, mountain dulcimers and fine inlays. Dogwood wood is an excellent substitute for persimmon wood in the heads of certain golf clubs (&quot;woods&quot;). Dogwood lumber is rare in that it is not readily available with any manufacturer and must be cut down by the person(s) wanting to use it.

Larger items have also been occasionally made of dogwood, such as the screw-in basket-style wine or fruit presses. The first kinds of laminated tennis rackets were also made from this wood, cut into thin strips.

Dogwood twigs were used by U.S. pioneers to brush their teeth. They would peel off the bark, bite the twig and then scrub their teeth.

=== Traditional medicine ===
The bark of &quot;Cornus&quot; species is rich in tannins and has been used in traditional medicine as a substitute for quinine. During the American Civil War, confederate soldiers made a tea from the bark to treat pain and fevers, and used dogwood leaves in a poultice to cover wounds.

The Japanese cornel, &quot;C. officinalis&quot;, is used in traditional Chinese medicine as &quot;shān zhū yú&quot; for several minor ailments.

==Cultural references==
The inflorescence of the Pacific dogwood &quot;(Cornus nuttallii)&quot; is the official flower of the province of British Columbia. The flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;) and its inflorescence are the state tree and the state flower respectively for the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia. It is also the state tree of Missouri and the state flower of North Carolina, and the state memorial tree of New Jersey. The term &quot;dogwood winter&quot;, in colloquial use in the American Southeast, especially Appalachia, is sometimes used to describe a cold snap in spring, presumably because farmers believed it was not safe to plant their crops until after the dogwoods blossomed.

Anne Morrow Lindbergh gives a vivid description of the dogwood tree in her poem &quot;Dogwood&quot;.

Nicole Dollanganger released a song titled &quot;Dogwood&quot; on her 2023 album Married in Mount Airy.

<text>Scrubbirds are shy, secretive, ground-dwelling birds of the family Atrichornithidae. There are just two species. The rufous scrubbird is rare and very restricted in its range, and the noisy scrubbird is so rare that until 1961 it was thought to be extinct. Both are native to Australia.

The scrubbird family is ancient and is understood to be most closely related to the lyrebirds, and probably also the bowerbirds and treecreepers. All four families originated with the great corvid radiation of the Australia-New Guinea region.

The population of the noisy scrubbird was estimated at 40 to 45 birds in 1962. Conservation efforts succeeded in increasing the population to around 400 birds by the mid-1980s, and they have subsequently been reintroduced to several sites, but remain endangered. As of 2002, the population had recovered to around 1,200 birds.

==Description==
Birds of both species are about the same size as a common starling (roughly 20 cm long) and cryptically coloured in drab browns and blacks. They occupy dense undergrowth—the rufous scrubbird in temperate rain forests near the Queensland-New South Wales border, the noisy scrubbird in heaths and scrubby gullies in coastal Western Australia—and are adept at scuttling mouse-like under cover to avoid notice. They run fast, but their flight is feeble.

The males&#x27; calls, however, are powerful: ringing and metallic, with a ventriloquial quality, so loud as to be heard from a long distance in heavy scrub and almost painful at close range. Females build a domed nest close to the ground and take sole responsibility for raising the young.

<text>The PIC16C84, PIC16F84 and PIC16F84A are 8-bit microcontrollers of which the EEPROM based PIC16C84 was the first introduced in March 16 1993 at the suggested retail price of $3.72 in quantities of 10,000. It is a member of the PIC family of controllers, produced by Microchip Technology. The memory architecture makes use of bank switching. Software tools for assembler, debug and programming were only available for DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.X operating systems.

== Description ==
The PIC16x84 is a microcontroller in the PIC family of controllers produced by Microchip Technology (originally named &quot; Arizona Microchip&quot;). It was Microchip&#x27;s first microcontroller that utilised &quot;EEPROM&quot; memory technology for the program memory. 
The use of &quot;EEPROM&quot; technology for program memory has now been disused in favour of &quot;FLASH&quot; memory that is considerably cheaper to manufacture, releases less toxins into the atmosphere and is much more reliable than &quot;EEPROM&quot;. Both &quot;EEPROM&quot; and &quot;FLASH&quot; utilise similar forms of &quot;floating gate&quot; technologies to operate. 
The device features one 8-bit timer, and 13 I/O pins. The PIC16x84 became popular in many hobbyist applications because it uses a serial programming algorithm that lends itself to very simple programmers. Additionally, the PIC16C84 uses EEPROM memory, so it is easy to erase and requires no special tools to do so. 
The PIC16F84 and its updated version, the PIC16F84A both utilised FLASH program memory. The PIC16C84, PIC16C84A, PIC16F84 and the PIC16F84A all contain an additional 64 Bytes of EEPROM addressed from the &quot;DATA&quot; memory map. 
This additional memory is intended for use as &quot;user data&quot;, hence the reason it can only be addressed from the &quot;DATA&quot; memory mapping.

== F-version ==
The PIC16F84/PIC16F84A is an improved version of the PIC16C84, and almost completely compatible, with better program security and using flash memory instead of EEPROM memory for program memory. The PIC16F84/PIC16F84A has 68 bytes of RAM whilst the PIC16C84 has 36 bytes.

Since the two chips are so similar they are often referred to by the term PIC16x84 (x is used as a wildcard when referring to chips).

== History ==
The PIC16C84 was introduced in 1993 and has been hailed as the first PIC microcontroller to feature a serial programming algorithm and EEPROM memory (it was preceded by the Motorola MC68HC805B6 and MC68HC805C4 along with the MC68HC11E2 with serial bootloader and EEPROM program storage released in the late 1980s). These chips lend themselves to hobby use: only a simple and cheap programmer is required to program, erase and reprogram the chip. As PIC16C84 supplies became limited due to it being discontinued, the PIC16F84 became popular as it is an almost drop-in replacement. New programming software was needed as the programming algorithm is different but the programming hardware required was the same.

Even later (1998) Microchip Technology introduced the improved PIC16F84A which allowed for faster clock speeds (up to 20 MHz), faster programming, and decreased the current draw of the chip.

The PIC16x84 microcontroller is a member of Microchip&#x27;s 14-bit series (the instruction word size is 14 bits for all instructions), making the &#x27;84 a good development prototype for other similar but cheaper one-time-programmable 14-bit devices.

== Recent pin-compatible variants ==
Microchip&#x27;s product line has gone through many revisions since the 16x84 and more powerful, flexible, cheaper pin-compatible PICs have been developed.

Existing PIC 16x84 code may require some modifications for these variants, namely making sure pins with multiple functions have been set up properly.

* PIC 16F84A - 1K program memory, 68 bytes data memory, 64 bytes EEPROM, 1× timer (listed as a comparison)
* PIC 16F628A - 2K program memory, 224 bytes data memory, 128 bytes EEPROM, 3× timers, hardware PWM, onboard 4 MHz/37 kHz RC oscillator.
* PIC 16F648A - Same as 16F628A with 4K program memory.
* PIC 16F88 - Nanowatt Technology variant, 4K program memory, 368 bytes data memory, 256 bytes EEPROM, 3× timers, hardware PWM, on-board 8 MHz/37 kHz precision oscillator, 7-input 10-bit ADC, synchronous serial port supporting SPI and I²C.
* PIC 16F1827 - Nanowatt XLP Technology variant, 4K program memory, 368 bytes data memory, 256 bytes EEPROM, 5× timers, hardware PWM, onchip 32 MHz/31 kHz precision oscillator, 12-input 10-bit ADC, 4× PLL.
* PIC 16F1847 - Nanowatt XLP Technology variant, 8K program memory, 1024 bytes data memory, 256 bytes EEPROM, 5× timers, hardware PWM, onchip 32 MHz/31 kHz precision oscillator, 12-input 10-bit ADC, 4× PLL. 5-bit DAC.

The latter two are 8-bit enhanced mid-range core with 14 additional instructions and optimizations for the C Programming Language.

<text>Daejeon (; ) is South Korea&#x27;s fifth-largest metropolis, with a population of nearly 1.5 million as of 2023. Located in a central lowland valley between the Sobaek Mountains and the Geum River, the city is known both as a technology and research center, and for its close relationship with the natural environment. Daejeon serves as a hub of transportation for major rail and road routes, and is approximately 50 minutes from the capital, Seoul, by KTX or SRT high speed rail.

Daejeon (along with Seoul, Gwacheon and Sejong City) is one of South Korea&#x27;s administration hubs. The city is home to 23 universities and colleges, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungnam National University, as well as government research institutes, and research and development centers for many chaebols such as Samsung, LG, mostly located in the city&#x27;s &quot;Daedeok Yeongu Danji.&quot;

From the 1980s, multiple national administrative functions were moved from Seoul to Daejeon, most of which are now located in the Daejeon Government Complex, resulting in another population increase. The city was a sub host for the 1986 Asian Games, hosted the Expo 1993, the International Mathematical Olympiads in 2000 and will be the main host city of the 2027 Summer World University Games, and was elevated to the status of Metropolitan City in 1989.

Daejeon is situated in a lowland valley with three major rivers, all of them eventually flowing into the Yellow Sea by way of the Geum river. The city is surrounded by several small mountains, and is located approximately south of Seoul and north of Busan, and east of the Yellow Sea. Daejeon experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate with wet, hot summers and drier, cold winters.

Daejeon is bordered to the east by Boeun County and Okcheon County in North Chungcheong Province, to the west by Gongju and Gyeryong in South Chungcheong Province, to the south by Geumsan County and Nonsan in South Chungcheong Province, and to the north by Sejong Special Self-Governing City and Cheongju in North Chungcheong Province. Its geographical coordinates range from 127°14′ to 127°33′ east longitude and 36°10′ to 36°29′ north latitude. Daejeon covers an area of 539.98 square kilometers and has a population of 1,518,775 as of 2015. Administratively, the city is divided into five districts and 79 administrative neighborhoods (177 legal neighborhoods). The metropolitan city hall is located in Dunsan-dong, Seo District, Daejeon.

== Etymology ==
The earliest record of the modern name &#x27;Daejeon&#x27; is in the 1481 geography book, Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam. &#x27;Daejeon&#x27; (대전 大田) is a Hanja translation of the native placeword for the area, &#x27;Hanbat&#x27; (), meaning ″&quot;Great fields&quot;″. ″&quot;Hanbat&quot;″, is a compound word that adds &#x27;Han&#x27; (한/often transcribed in Hanja as 韓, as in &quot;Korea)&quot; ,that means Great or big, and the word &#x27;Bat&#x27; (), meaning field, leading to Big/Great Field(s).&quot;The &#x27;Han&#x27; () translated into &#x27;Dae&#x27; (大) - both meaning big, and &#x27;Bat&#x27; () translated to &#x27;Jeon&#x27; (田), both meaning fields.&quot;

The name Hanbat is still in use as a road name for Hanbat-daero (), or &quot;Hanbat road&quot;, a road of 12.7 kilometers connecting Daejeon&#x27;s Yuseong district to Dong-gu.

==History==

=== Ancient history to the Later Three Kingdoms Era===
It is unclear exactly when humans first inhabited the Daejeon area. However, the Paleolithic site of &quot;Seokjang-ri&quot; in nearby Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do, and the &quot;Yongho-dong&quot; site in Daedeok District, Daejeon, suggest that people lived here from around that time. From the Bronze Age, artifacts such as bronze items, dwelling sites, and pottery have been excavated, providing concrete evidence of sustained human habitation.

During the Proto–Three Kingdoms Period, the area was part of &quot;Mahan&quot;, one of the Three Han states. It is believed to have been home to &quot;Sinheunguk&quot; (臣釁國), one of the small states that made up Mahan. However, some theories place Sinheunguk in Seosan or Yesan County in South Chungcheong Province, so its exact location is uncertain. Proponents of the Daejeon theory speculate that &quot;Sinheung&quot; is related to Jinhyeon-hyeon, which will be discussed later and eventually connects to the place name Jinjam-dong. Meanwhile, the area around the now Yuseong District is thought to have been the site of Naebiri-guk (內卑離國) of Mahan. This is because the Three Kingdoms-era place name for Yuseong District, Nosaji, is also recorded as Naesaji (內斯只), and both names share the element &quot;Nae&quot; (內).

In the Three Kingdoms Period, the area became part of Baekje&#x27;s territory and was known as Usul-gun (雨述郡),centered around Eumnae-dong in Daedeok District and including Hoedeok-dong. &quot;Also on Usul-gun,in the city exists the remains of Bakjae&#x27;s mountain fortress Usul-fortress&quot; ()&quot;, which was declared a city-designated monument in 1989&quot;. This name is a transcription of the native Korean place name &quot;Bisul&quot; or &quot;Bisuri,&quot; where they took the meaning &quot;rain&quot; from the character 雨 and the sound &quot;sul&quot; from 述. At Gyejoksan Mountain in Jang-dong, Daedeok District, there is a legend that &quot;when the mountain cries during severe drought, rain comes,&quot; leading to the place name &quot;beak-dal-san&quot; or &quot;beakdal&quot; mountain, and &quot;Bisuri,&quot; () meaning &quot;rainy peak.&quot; This legend is also recorded in early Joseon-era texts like the &quot;Geographical Appendix to the Annals of King Sejong&quot; and the &quot;Sinjŭng Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam&quot; (), the version of Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam, updated in 1530.

Under Usul-gun, there were Nosaji-hyeon (奴斯只縣) in the area of Guseong-dong, Yuseong District; Sobipo-hyeon (所比浦縣) in Deokjin-dong; and Jinhyeon-hyeon (眞峴縣) in Bonggok-dong, Seo-gu. Among these, Jinhyeon-hyeon was the only one not under Usul-gun but belonged to Hwangdeungyasangun (黃等也山郡), centered around Yeonsan-myeon in Nonsan, South Chungcheong Province. Based on the Five Divisions established during King Seong(성왕;year 504 ~557 july)&#x27;s reign(523 may~ 554 july), the area around Gongju was the Northern Division, and the area around Nonsan was the center of the Eastern Division, so it likely belonged to one of these two. Considering that the Daejeon area later generally moved in conjunction with Gongju, the dominant theory is that it belonged to the Northern parts of regional classification.

During this period, the area was one of the main frontlines among Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, resulting in many mountain fortress ruins in Daejeon, leading to an oral tradition that the name of Sikjang Mountain originated from the Baekje army storing provisions on the mountain. There are also numerous fortifications that are closer to small forts than large mountain fortresses. Notably, after Baekje&#x27;s King Gaero had Wiryeseong captured by Goguryeo&#x27;s King Jangsu, Baekje faced a critical crisis due to continued southward advances by Goguryeo. The Goguryeo army reached as far as the Daejeon area, creating an unprecedented situation where Baekje&#x27;s Ungjin Fortress was pressured from both the northeast (Sejong) and southeast (Daejeon). Relics left by the Goguryeo army from this time can be found in Wolpyeong-dong in Seo District, Daejeon, as well as in Bugaang-myeon, Saerom-dong, and Naseong-dong in Sejong.

It was not until the reign of King Dongseong that Baekje, allied with Silla, succeeded in driving out the Goguryeo forces from the Daejeon area. Baekje recovered the entirety of Sejong, most of Cheongju, and most of Daejeon. However, they had to tolerate Silla&#x27;s occupation of the entire Goesan area—which was originally part of Hanseong Baekje&#x27;s territory—as well as the northern half of now Daedeok District and the southwestern part of Cheongju. Goesan was recovered from Silla during the reign of King Uija of Baekje, but the Sintanjin area and the southwestern part of Cheongju were never regained until Baekje fell. Therefore, the northern region of Daedeok District has deep historical connections not only with Baekje but also with Silla.

During the wars for the unification of the Three Kingdoms in 660, there is a record that the Silla army stationed at Nosurisan (怒受利山) during the Battle of Hwangsanbeol, which broke out on July 9. Given the phonetic similarity to Nosaji-hyeon located in Yuseong District, it is considered to be the same place. As the Daejeon area was a border region adjacent to Hwangdeungyasangun (Nonsan), a fierce battleground, it would have been suitable for the Silla army to set up camp.

After the fall of Baekje, the area became the backdrop for the Baekje Revival Movement. The Ongsanseong (甕山城), where the revival forces blocked the Silla army&#x27;s path and fought around August 661, is presumed to be Gyejoksanseong Fortress on Gyejoksan Mountain in Jang-dong, Daedeok District. After a three-day siege, Ongsanseong fell on September 27. Subsequently, Usul-gun was attacked by Kim Pumil, the governor of Sangju, and over 1,000 people were executed. According to records, Jo Bok (助服), the last military commander of Usul-gun and a second-rank Dalsol, surrendered to Silla along with a third-rank Eunsol named Paga (波伽) and their followers. Later, in August 662, remnants of the revival forces gathered and fortified themselves at Naesajiseong (內斯只城),presumed to be the fortress located in the aforementioned Nosaji-hyeon (奴斯只縣) which corresponds to the now Yuseong District area ,and resisted, prompting the dispatch of 19 generals, including Kim Heumsun, to defeat them.

In the Unified Silla period, based on Silla&#x27;s &quot;nine provinces and five secondary capitals&quot; policy, the area belonged to Ungcheonju (熊川州). Later, due to King Gyeongdeok&#x27;s Sinicization policy in 757, Usul-gun was renamed Bipung-gun (比豊郡), Nosaji-hyeon became Yuseong-hyeon (儒城縣), Sobipo-hyeon became Jeokjo-hyeon (赤鳥縣), and Jinhyeon-hyeon was renamed Jinryeong-hyeon (鎭嶺縣). Jinryeong-hyeon still belonged separately to Hwangsan-gun (黃山郡), the renamed Hwangdeungyasangun. Ungcheonju was also renamed Ungju (熊州).

During the Later Three Kingdoms period in the early 900s, the area came under the territory of Later Baekje. Compared to the original Baekje, Later Baekje&#x27;s domain extended much further east beyond Daejeon, deeply into Gyeongsang-do, and had also reclaimed the northern part of Daedeok District, which had previously been occupied by Silla. Therefore, the area of Daejeon belonged to Later Baekje until its collapse in 936.

=== Goryeo Dynasty ===
Entering the Goryeo period, Bipung-gun (比豊郡) was renamed Hoedeok-hyeon (懷德縣), Jeokjo-hyeon (赤鳥縣) became Deokjin-hyeon (德津縣), and Jinryeong-hyeon (鎭嶺縣) was changed to Jinjam-hyeon (鎭岑縣), while Yuseong-hyeon remained unchanged. According to the ten provinces established during King Seongjong&#x27;s reign, the Daejeon area belonged to Hanam-do. All four prefectures were subordinate to Gongju-mok (公州牧), which had been elevated to one of the twelve administrative districts known as &quot;mok.&quot;

Later, during King Hyeonjong&#x27;s reign, the implementation of the Five Provinces and Two Frontier Regions system placed the four prefectures under Yanggwang-do. Gongju-mok was downgraded back to simply Gongju, but the four prefectures remained its subordinate counties.

Subsequently, during King Myeongjong&#x27;s reign, Hoedeok-hyeon and Jinjam-hyeon were promoted to &quot;ju-hyeon&quot; (main counties), and officials known as &quot;Gamwu&quot; (監務) were dispatched, initiating independent administration. This autonomy continued into the Joseon Dynasty, where they remained separate districts. However, Yuseong-hyeon and Deokjin-hyeon did not gain independence and continued as subordinate counties of Gongju.

Meanwhile, there were special administrative districts called &quot;hyang,&quot; &quot;bugok,&quot; and &quot;so.&quot; Among these, the most famous was Myeonghakso (鳴鶴所), known as the site of the Mang Yi and Mang Soi Rebellion. This area is believed to have been located in what is now Tanbang-dong in Seo-gu.

=== Joseon Dynasty ===
During the Joseon period, Hoedeok-hyeon and Jinjam-hyeon were each elevated to Hoedeok-gun and Jinjam-gun, respectively. The area that is now the central part of Daejeon remained a small rural village within Gongju, which had been re-elevated to Gongju-mok during the reign of King Chung-hye of Goryeo. Notable figures like Song Si-yeol of the Eunjin Song clan lived in this vicinity, and the place name Songchon-dong, related to them, still exists as one of Daejeon&#x27;s districts. Additionally, the Hoedeok Hwang clan established their base in the Hoedeok-hyeon area. Meanwhile, the name &quot;Daejeon&quot; (大田), which is the Hanja transcription of the native term &quot;Hanbat&quot; () for &quot;Great Fields&quot;, first appeared in records in the early Joseon period,in &quot;Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam,&quot; and continues to be used today.

Until 1906, the current central area of Daejeon was part of Gongju, not Hoedeok or Jinjam, before it was incorporated into Hoedeok-gun. Of course, that elongated territory of Gongju wasn&#x27;t Gongju land in the narrow sense; rather, as the concept of subordinate prefectures (sokhyeon) like Yuseong-hyeon and Deokjin-hyeon disappeared and were absorbed into Gongju itself, the territory expanded accordingly.

However, the now Yuseong area remained part of Gongju until it was transferred during the establishment of Daejeon-gun in 1914. With Yuseong joining Daejeon-gun, the region roughly restored the combined territory of the central area and its subordinate prefectures from the times of Usul-gun and Bipung-gun.

What transformed the history of Daejeon was the finalization of the Gyeongbu Line railway route in 1900. After Daejeon Station was established in Daejeon-ri, Sannae-myeon, Gongju County, in 1904, population influx began and urbanization took off. In 1906, when Sannae-myeon was incorporated into Hoedeok County, the Hoedeok County Office also moved from its original location in Hoedeok town to the urban area of Daejeon.

=== Japanese Occupation ===
In 1914, during the major reorganization of administrative districts by the Japanese Governor-General of Korea, the existing Hoedeok County and Jinjam County, along with Yuseong-myeon (Yuseong Township) of Gongju County, were merged to form Daejeon County (大田郡). Had the name Hoedeok County been retained, the city might be called &quot;Hoedeok Metropolitan City&quot; today. Instead, the name &quot;Daejeon,&quot; which was simply the name of the village where the train station was located, was adopted as the new county name, replacing the traditional name Hoedeok.

=== Modern day ===
In 1963, Daejeon expanded its territory by incorporating the entire Yucheon-myeon of Daedeok-gun, and parts of Sannae and Hoedeok-myeon. From this point, Sannae-myeon of Daedeok-gun became an actual exclave.

In 1973, Buk-myeon and Yuseong-myeon of Daedeok-gun were each elevated to Sintanjin-eup and Yuseong-eup, respectively. In 1977, the ward system (gu-je) was implemented in Daejeon, establishing two wards: Jung-gu and Dong-gu. In 1983, Daejeon further expanded by incorporating the entire areas of Yuseong-eup and Hoedeok-myeon of Daedeok-gun, and parts of Tan-dong, Gujeok, Jinjam, and Giseong-myeon. At this time, Daedeok-gun was split into two separate parts. This situation continued until 1989, when Daedeok-gun was abolished and Daejeon was elevated to a Directly Governed City. Just before this elevation in 1988, Seo-gu was separated from Jung-gu. In 1989, Daedeok-gun was abolished and merged into Daejeon, and the integrated Daejeon of Chungcheongnam-do was elevated to Daejeon Directly Governed City. Simultaneously, Yuseong District was separated from Seo-gu, and Daedeok District from Dong-gu, completing the current system of five districts.

In 1993, the city hosted the 1993 Daejeon Expo, which increased its national profile. The yellow alien mascot &quot;Kumdori&quot; appeared in various products such as plush toys and animations, becoming one of Daejeon&#x27;s mascots. After the Expo ended, the facilities and site were utilized to open the Expo Science Park, but some exhibition halls are now almost closed. Although it had the smallest population among the five Directly Governed Cities, it surpassed Gwangju Metropolitan City in population in 1995. In the same year, it was renamed to the current Daejeon Metropolitan City.

In the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Special City (&quot;Jikhalsi&quot;), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City ().

In the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the Daejeon Government Complex in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office, Korail, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and Patent Court of Korea.

The population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center. With the construction of Sejong Special Self-Governing City in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in Seoul were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes.

<text>The Pomatostomidae (Australo-Papuan or Australasian babblers, also known as pseudo-babblers) are small to medium-sized birds endemic to Australia-New Guinea. For many years, the Australo-Papuan babblers were classified, rather uncertainly, with the Old World babblers (Timaliidae), on the grounds of similar appearance and habits. More recent research, however, indicates that they are too basal to belong the Passerida – let alone the Sylvioidea where the Old World babblers are placed – and they are now classed as a separate family close to the Orthonychidae (logrunners). Five species in two genus are currently recognised, although the red-breasted subspecies &quot;rubeculus&quot; of the grey-crowned babbler may prove to be a separate species.

==Description==
The Australo-Papuan babblers are medium-sized terrestrial birds with sombre plumage and long decurved bills. They range in size from in length and in weight. The wings are short and round, and the tail is long and often held fanned which makes it look broad as well. The feet and legs are strong and adapted to a terrestrial existence. There is no sexual dimorphism in the plumage, which is composed of brown, russet and grey colours, with all but the Papuan babbler having striking white markings on the face and throat. The plumage of juvenile birds is similar to that of adults.

==Behaviour and ecology==
All five species are ground-feeding omnivores and highly social. Babblers live in family groups and small flocks of up to about 20 individuals and forage communally, calling loudly to one another all day long. They feed principally on insects and other invertebrates, but will also take seeds, fruits and small vertebrates. Most food is obtained on the ground, although they will also forage in low bushes; the grey-crowned babbler and Papuan babbler feed more extensively in vegetation than the other species. The long bill is used to probe and overturn large objects. They will also hold objects with one foot and hammer them with the bill in order to extract food.

===Breeding===
Australo-Papuan babblers are monogamous breeders which defend territories. The breeding pair will be aided in breeding by a number of helpers from its group. This is similar to the cooperative breeding system used by the fish species &quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot; with the difference being that &quot;N. pulcher&quot; are polygynous instead of monogamous. A number of groups may have more than one breeding pair. Extra male helpers aid the male in his responsibilities whereas the females aid the main breeding female in hers. They have an extended breeding season. Australo-Papuan babblers construct large nests for communal roosting, and these nests may be used for breeding, or new nests may be constructed. There may be a large number of nests used by the group in a small area. When the female is breeding she alone uses the breeding nest. Construction, both of roosting and breeding nests, is undertaken by all birds in the group. Between one and six eggs are laid (the number and range varies by species) and are usually incubated by the breeding female alone (although a helper female may aid occasionally). The breeding male and other helper males feed the breeding female during incubation. Incubation lasts between 19 and 25 days. The female broods the chicks until they are able to thermoregulate, and the chicks fledge after 16–23 days. After leaving the nest, the chicks will continue to be fed by the adults for a number of months.

<doc id="284824" wikidata="Q25447263" url="?curid=284824" title="Sapphism">
<text>Sapphism is an umbrella term for any woman attracted to women or in a relationship with another woman, regardless of their sexual orientations, and encompassing the romantic love between women.

The term is inclusive of individuals who are lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, aromantic, asexual, or queer. There are also sapphic people who are non-binary.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;sapphism&quot; has been used since the 1890s, and derives from Sappho, a Greek poet whose verses mainly focused on love between women and her own homosexual passions. She was born on the Greek island Lesbos, which also inspired the term lesbianism.

Sappho&#x27;s work is one of the few ancient references to sapphic love. Her poetry, significant in quality, is a rare example of female sexuality separated from reproduction in history.

== Use ==
The term &quot;sapphic&quot; encompasses the experiences of lesbians and bisexual women, for example, among other plurisexual and multiromantic individuals. Asexual and aromantic women who are attracted to a woman are also sapphic.

Using the term more broadly, some sapphic individuals may be non-binary. There are also equivalent terms for relationships between men (Achillean, named in reference of Achilles and Patroclus, or Vincian, referencing sexuality of Leonardo da Vinci), between a man and a woman (duaric), and involving at least one non-binary person (diamoric or enbian).

&quot;Sapphic&quot; is also used in LGBT literature for works involving at least one relationship between women, regardless of whether they are lesbian or not.

<text>Veturi Sundararama Murthy (29 January 1936 – 22 May 2010), known mononymously by his surname Veturi, was an Indian poet and lyricist who is known for his works in Telugu literature and cinema. Veturi is a recipient of the National Film Award, various Nandi Awards, Filmfare Awards, and other state honors. His career in Telugu cinema spanned more than four decades.

==Early life==
Veturi was born to Chandrasekhar Sastry and Kamalamba in Pedakallepalli, near Challapalli, Krishna into a Telugu Brahmin family. Veturi was a nephew of the Telugu Research Scholar Veturi Prabhakara Sastri. His grandfather Veturi Sundara Sastry was also a poet.

===Education===
Veturi completed his schooling in Diviseema, Jaggayyapeta, near Vijayawada in Krishna district, and SSLC in his grandmother&#x27;s village. Later, Veturi went to Chennai for his intermediate studies and came back to Vijayawada where he completed his degree at S.R.R. Government College. He was a student of the legendary Viswanatha Satyanarayana at this college.

==Career as a journalist==
Veturi joined &quot;Andhra Prabha&quot; as a journalist in 1952, after his education. He learned the basics of editing a news article from his senior at Andhra Prabha, Narla Venkateswara Rao, whom he considers his first teacher. In 1959, he joined a weekly called Andhra Patrika, where Bapu and Mullapudi Venkata Ramana were his colleagues. He was the in-charge of the Cinema section at &quot;Andhra Patrika&quot;. He also worked for the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee&#x27;s official daily newspaper, called &quot;Andhra Janata&quot;, as an editor.

In 1962, he became the first and only Telugu journalist to interview the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who came to inaugurate the Srisailam Hydroelectricity project. He covered the speeches of national leaders like Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. In 1964, he worked as an assembly reporter.

His articles are said to be very catchy and witty. For instance, he referred to the meeting of MLAs in Hotel Dwaraka, near the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly as &quot;Adigo Dwaraka - Ivigo Alamandalu&quot; (&quot;This is Dwaraka and here are the cattle&quot;) (). His writing style caught the attention of the film industry due to his use of traditional poetic rules related to alliteration and rhyme for describing current affairs.

==Career as a lyricist==

===Entry into films===

Veturi had contacts with the Telugu film industry during his days as a journalist. He used to meet veteran lyric writer Dasarathi often. Legendary director V. Nagayya offered him a role in his film, &quot;Naa Illu&quot; (1953). However, two days before the shooting began, Veturi decided not to act as he felt that he was not fit for acting, and wrote a letter of apology to Nagayya for rejecting his offer. N. T. Rama Rao, has invited him to join the film industry as a lyricist. In 1974, he wrote his first song, &quot;Bharatanaari Charitamu&quot; (), in the form of Harikatha, for &quot;O Seeta Katha&quot; (1974) under the direction of K. Viswanath.

===1970s===

In 1978, K Viswanath&#x27;s &quot;Siri Siri Muvva&quot; proved his prowess in expressing diverse emotions with poetry. 
In 1977, actor Sr. N.T.R&#x27;s &quot;Adavi Ramudu&quot; showcased Veturi&#x27;s talent for penning inspirational and romantic lyrics. The album was an instant hit among various audiences. Acharya Aatreya, the leading lyricist in those days, was known to take days for writing a song. Veturi became the first choice for directors and producers too because of his ability to write a song to the director&#x27;s taste in a few minutes. He went on to pen more than 5,000 songs in his career. He wrote more mass numbers for movies like &quot;Vetagadu&quot; and &quot;Driver Ramudu&quot;, and classics for movies like &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; and Sagara Sangamam. In particular, &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; stood as a landmark in the Telugu film industry.

===1980s===

After the surge of his popularity during the 1970s, he went on to work with a variety of directors and actors in the 1980s. He wrote classics for directors like Singeetam Srinivasa Rao, Dasari Narayana Rao, Bapu, Jandhyala, Vamsy and mass numbers for directors like Raghavendra Rao, A. Kodandarami Reddy, Vijaya Bapineedu. He delivered a number of hits for senior actors like Sr. N.T.R, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Ghattamaneni Krishna, Shobhan Babu, Krishnam Raju and upcoming stars like Chiranjeevi, Nandamuri Balakrishna, Nagarjuna, Daggubati Venkatesh. This golden period in his career saw memorable albums like &quot;Saptapadi&quot;, &quot;Subhodayam&quot;, &quot;Subhalekha&quot;, &quot;Sagara Sangamam&quot;, &quot;Meghasandesam&quot;, &quot;Mudda Mandaram&quot;, &quot;Malle Pandiri&quot;, &quot;Nalugu Stambhalata&quot;, &quot;Rendu Jalla Seeta&quot;, &quot;Amarajeevi&quot;, &quot;Sreevariki Prema Lekha&quot;, &quot;Ananda Bhairavi&quot;, &quot;Srivari Sobhanam&quot;, &quot;Mogudu Pellalu&quot;, &quot;Chantabbai&quot;, &quot;Sitaara&quot;, &quot;Anveshana&quot;, &quot;Alapana&quot;, &quot;Mayuri&quot;, &quot;Amavasya Chandrudu&quot;, &quot;Janaki Ramudu&quot; and &quot;Geetaanjali&quot;.

===1990s===

During the late 1980s, Veturi&#x27;s mass numbers garnered a lot of response from the public resulting in directors demanding more and more of them. However, Veturi still maintained his balance between classics and mass-numbers with movies like &quot;Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari&quot;, &quot;Sarigamalu&quot;, &quot;Sitaramayya Gaari Manavaralu&quot;, &quot;Matru Devo Bhava&quot;, and &quot;Mechanic Alludu&quot;. Veturi was given the opportunity to dub many Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi movies. Some of his dubbed albums, for instance &quot;Iruvar&quot; and &quot;Devaraagam&quot;, received wide acclaim.

===2000s===

During this period, Veturi created classics like &quot;Gangotri&quot; and &quot;Swarabhishekam&quot;. His association with young directors like Sekhar Kammula and Gunasekhar produced some memorable albums, like &quot;Anand&quot;, &quot;Godavari&quot;, &quot;Varudu&quot;, &quot;Arjun&quot;, &quot;Premishte&quot; (Dubbed version of Kaadhal) and &quot;Leader&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Veturi received several national and regional awards for his contributions to literature and films. He has been conferred an honorary Doctorate in the 23rd convocation of Acharya Nagarjuna University. In 2007, he received the Jandhyala Memorial Award.
===National Awards===

He got the National Film Award for Best Lyrics for the song &quot;Ralipoye Puvva&quot; () in the film Matrudevobhava, making him the second Telugu film lyricist to achieve the distinction after the revolutionary poet, Sri Sri. In 2006, he declared that he would return the National Award if Telugu is not given the status of Classical Language by the Government of India. In 2008, the Government of India declared Telugu as a classical language.

===Filmfare Awards===

He received filmfare award for the song, &quot;Uppongele Godavari&quot; () in the 2006 movie, Godavari. In 2008, he received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award.

===Nandi Awards===

He received the Nandi award for best lyrics, from the Government of Andhra Pradesh, six times. They are listed here.

==Books==

===&quot;Sirikaakolanu Chinnadi&quot;===

This book was originally a &quot;musical play&quot; telecasted on the All India Radio. The story describes the culture and people during the time of the king Krishna Deva Raya through the story of a Devadasi. The original play has music by the great music director Pendyala Nageswara Rao. One can see the beauty of the Telugu language in this book.
Veturi was introduced to the director K. Viswanath through this book and later their combination was a big hit. N.T.Rama Rao was so impressed by the story of this book that he wanted to make it as a movie. It is believed that there were some discussions on the script but the movie was never produced.

===&quot;Kommako Kommako Sannaayi&quot;===

A book titled &quot;komma kommakO sannAyi&quot; was published by &quot;Veturi Sahitii Samiti&quot;. This book contains 27 articles written by Veturi celebrating his association with some famous personalities in the Telugu film industry. It also contains descriptions of some of his songs. The personalities covered include the following:
# Music directors: Pendyala Nageswara Rao, S. Rajeswara Rao, K. V. Mahadevan, Adi Narayana Rao, Ramesh Naidu, Rajan – Nagendra, Chakravarty, Ilayaraja, MM Keeravaani &amp; A.R.Rahman
# Singers: S._P._Balasubrahmanyam
# Lyricists: Daita Gopalam, Samudrala (Sr), Atreya, Dasarathi,
# Actors: Nagayya, Jagayya, N. T. Rama Rao &amp; Relangi
# Directors and producers: Nagi Reddy, Jandhyala, Bapu – Ramana

Many of these articles were originally published in a Telugu magazine called &quot;Haasam&quot;. Veturi&#x27;s prowess in the Telugu language &amp; literature and his vast knowledge of Carnatic music can be seen in this book. Veturi often quotes many of his own lyrics in this book and those examples offer a glimpse of his genius. In particular, his explanation of the song &quot;Swararaaga gangaa pravaahamE&quot; (Movie: &quot;Sarigamalu&quot;) is a masterpiece.

==Personal life==
Veturi was married to Seeta Maha Lakshmi and has three sons: Ravi Prakash, Chandrasekhar and Nanda Kishore
==Controversies==
In March 2010, Veturi openly criticized the Film Nagar Cooperative Society officials for not handing over the 1000 sq.yard land that was allotted to him about 28 years ago. He alleged that several juniors and ineligible people were given plots ahead of him. He was allegedly offered a double bedroom flat for 1.5 million.

After his death, noted singer Mano and senior actor Vijay Chandar demanded the government to give the land to his family.

==Death==
Veturi died of a pulmonary hemorrhage at a private hospital in Hyderabad on 22 May 2010, aged 74, at about 9:30 p.m. local time. He was admitted to the hospital two days earlier and was kept in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) there as his health was deteriorating.

K. Viswanath, who introduced Veturi to the film industry, stated that &quot;his works would please even the gods&quot;. Director Sekhar Kammula, who worked with him to deliver some critically acclaimed songs, wrote a four-page article in the daily &quot;Sakshi&quot; describing Veturi&#x27;s death as his &quot;personal loss&quot;.

==Legacy==
Appaji Ambarisha Darbha, a creative digital-media professional turned actor made a font with the name &quot;Veturi&quot; which was inaugurated by Telugu lyricist Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry in 2018.

<doc id="284827" wikidata="Q1434575" url="?curid=284827" title="Testicular torsion">
<text>Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord (from which the testicle is suspended) twists, cutting off the blood supply to the testicle. The most common symptom in children is sudden, severe testicular pain. The testicle may be higher than usual in the scrotum and vomiting may occur. In newborns, pain is often absent and instead the scrotum may become discolored or the testicle may disappear from its usual place.
Most of those affected have no obvious prior underlying health problems. Testicular tumor or prior trauma may increase risk. Other risk factors include a congenital malformation known as a &quot;bell-clapper deformity&quot; wherein the testis is inadequately attached to the scrotum allowing it to move more freely and thus potentially twist. Cold temperatures may also be a risk factor. The diagnosis should usually be made based on the presenting symptoms but requires timely diagnosis and treatment to avoid testicular loss. An ultrasound can be useful when the diagnosis is unclear.
Treatment is by physically untwisting the testicle, if possible, followed by surgery. Pain can be treated with opioids. Outcome depends on time to correction. If successfully treated within six hours of onset, it is often good. However, if delayed for 12 or more hours the testicle is typically not salvageable. About 40% of people require removal of the testicle.
It is most common just after birth and during puberty. It occurs in about 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 25,000 males under 25 years of age each year. Of children with testicular pain of rapid onset, testicular torsion is the cause of about 10% of cases. Complications may include an inability to have children. The condition was first described in 1840 by Louis Delasiauve.

==Signs and symptoms==
Testicular torsion usually presents with severe testicular pain or pain in the groin and lower abdomen. Pain generally begins suddenly and typically involves only one side. There is often associated nausea and vomiting. The testicle may lie higher in the scrotum due to twisting and subsequent shortening of the spermatic cord or may be positioned in a horizontal orientation. Mild warmth and redness of the overlying area may be present. Elevation of the testicle may worsen the pain. Urinary symptoms, such as pain or increased frequency of urination are also typically absent. Symptom onset often follows physical activity or trauma to the testes or scrotum. Children with testicular torsion may awaken with testicular or abdominal pain in the middle of the night or in the morning. There may be a history of previous, similar episodes of scrotal pain due to prior transient testicular torsion with spontaneous resolution.

===Complications===

* Testicular infarction: Testicular damage occurs as a consequence of decreased blood flow, and therefore decreased oxygen and nutrient supply, to the testicle. If the testicle is not viable during surgical exploration, it must be removed to prevent further necrosis, or tissue death.
* Infertility: The impact of testicular torsion on long-term fertility is not yet fully understood. However, testicular torsion may cause abnormal sperm function on semen analysis, although these abnormalities are more likely to be found in adolescents and adults. Torsion does not seem to affect long-term sperm function in neonates. The cause of abnormal sperm function is thought to be due to the following mechanisms:
** Immunological theory, also known as &quot;sympathetic orchidopathia&quot;: It is thought that following injury to the testicle, the body&#x27;s immune system is activated to clean up damaged cells. In the process, it creates anti-testicular cell antibodies, or proteins that cross the injured blood-testis barrier and damage both the affected and contralateral testicles.
** Abnormalities in microcirculation within the testicle 
** Reperfusion injury: This type of injury is seen in tissues that have been deprived of blood supply for a prolonged period.
* Gangrene, or a type of tissue damage caused by lack of blood supply, of the testis.
* Sepsis, in extremely rare cases (0.03%), if not treated for a long period, it could lead to sepsis and severe life-threatening infections and injuries through the blood and organs, which could lead to death.
* Recurrence of torsion may occur even after surgical fixation, although this is very unlikely.
* Psychological impact of losing a testicle.

==Risk factors==
Most of those affected with testicular torsion have no prior underlying health problems or predisposing conditions. However, there are certain factors that may increase the risk of testicular torsion. A larger testicle either due to normal variation or testicular tumor increases the risk of torsion. Similarly, the presence of a mass or malignancy involving the spermatic cord can also predispose to torsion.

Age is also an important risk factor for torsion. Torsion most commonly occurs either in the newborn or just before or during puberty. Testicular torsion often occurs before or during puberty, before complete testicular descent. Epididymitis is more commonly a postpubertal condition.

Several congenital anatomic malformations or variations in the testicle or the surrounding structures may allow for increased scrotal rotation and increase the risk of testicular torsion. A congenital malformation of the processus vaginalis known as &quot;bell-clapper deformity&quot; accounts for 90% of all cases. In this condition, rather than the testes attaching posteriorly to the inner lining of the scrotum by the mesorchium, the mesorchium terminates early and the testis is free floating in the tunica vaginalis. Other anatomic risk factors include a horizontal lie of the testicle or a spermatic cord with a long intrascrotal portion. Cryptorchidisim is also a risk factor for torsion with some studies proposing a 10-fold higher risk.
Testicular torsion may also be caused by trauma to the scrotum or exercise (in particular, bicycle riding); however, only about 4–8% of cases are the result of trauma. There is thought to be a possible genetic basis for predisposition to torsion, based on multiple published reports of familial testicular torsion. There is controversy whether cold weather months are associated with an increased risk.

==Pathophysiology==
Testicular torsion occurs when there is a mechanical twisting of the spermatic cord, which suspends the testicle within the scrotum and contains the testicular artery and vein. Twisting of the cord reduces or eliminates blood flow to the testicle. The degree of arterial and venous obstruction depends on the duration and severity of the torsion event. Typically, venous blood flow is compromised first. The increase in venous pressure subsequently causes decreased arterial blood flow, leading to decreased oxygen supply to the testicle, and if untreated, testicular infarction.

It is also believed that torsion occurring during fetal development can lead to so-called neonatal torsion or vanishing testis, and is one of the causes of an infant being born with monorchism (one testicle).

===Intermittent testicular torsion===
Intermittent testicular torsion (ITT) is a less serious but chronic variant of torsion. It is characterized by intermittent scrotal or testicular pain, followed by eventual spontaneous detorsion and resolution of pain. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Though less pressing, such individuals are at significant risk of complete torsion and possible subsequent orchiectomy and the recommended treatment is elective bilateral orchiopexy. Ninety-seven percent of patients who undergo such surgery experience complete relief from their symptoms.

===Extravaginal testicular torsion===
Torsion occurring outside of the tunica vaginalis, when the testis and gubernaculum can rotate freely, is termed an extravaginal testicular torsion. This type occurs exclusively in newborns, however, newborns can be affected by other testicular torsion variants as well. Neonates experiencing such a torsion typically present with painless scrotal swelling, discoloration, and a firm, painless mass in the scrotum. Such testes are usually necrotic from birth and must be removed surgically. The exact cause of or specific risk factors for extravaginal torsion in this population remains unclear.

=== Intravaginal testicular torsion ===
Intravaginal testicular torsion occurs when the testicle rotates on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis. This variant more commonly occurs in older children and adults. The &quot;bell-clapper deformity,&quot; in which there is inappropriately high attachment of the tunica vaginalis over the spermatic cord and failure of the normal posterior attachment of the testicle to the inner scrotum, which allows the testicle to move freely within the tunica vaginalis and predisposes to intravaginal testicular torsion.

===Torsion of the testicular appendix===
The testicular appendix is located in the upper pole of the testicle. It is an embryonic remnant that has no known function but is at risk for torsion events. This type of torsion is the most common cause of acute scrotal pain in boys ages 7–14. Its appearance is similar to that of testicular torsion but the onset of pain is typically more gradual. Palpation reveals a small firm nodule on the upper portion of the testis which displays a characteristic &quot;blue dot sign&quot;. This is the appendix of the testis which has become discolored and is noticeably blue through the skin. Unlike other torsions, however, the cremasteric reflex is still active. Typical treatment involves the use of over-the-counter analgesics and the condition resolves within 2–3 days.

=== Torsion of the undescended testicle ===
The undescended testis is at increased risk of testicular torsion. The mechanism for torsion in the undescended testicle is not fully understood, though it may be due to abnormal contractions of the cremaster muscle, which covers the testicle and spermatic cord and is responsible for raising and lowering the testicle to regulate scrotal temperature. The undescended testicle is also at higher risk for testicular tumor, which due to the increased weight and size compared to a healthy testicle can predispose to torsion.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis should generally be made based on the presenting symptoms. An ultrasound can be useful when the diagnosis is unclear. However, imaging should not delay surgical intervention as complications develop with prolonged ischemia. Immediate surgery is recommended regardless of imaging findings if there is a high degree of suspicion based on history and physical examination.

Given the treatment implications of testicular torsion, it is important to distinguish testicular torsion from other causes of testicular pain, such as epididymitis, which can present similarly. While both conditions can cause testicular pain, the pain of epididymitis is typically localized to the epididymis at the rear pole of the testicle. Epididymitis may also be characterized by discoloration and swelling of the testis, and fever. The cremasteric reflex in epididymitis is usually present. Testicular torsion, or more probably impending testicular infarction, can also produce a low-grade fever. There is often an absent or decreased cremasteric reflex.

===Clinical exam===
The absence of the cremasteric reflex in an acutely painful testicle is most indicative of testicular torsion (the twisting of the spermatic cord of the testicle makes reflexive responses all but impossible). The cremasteric reflex normally causes elevation of the testicle by stroking the inner thigh. Absence is especially common in children, but its presence does not exclude a diagnosis of testicular torsion.

On physical examination, the testis can be swollen, tender, high-riding, and with an abnormal transverse lie.

Prehn&#x27;s sign, a classic physical exam finding, has not been reliable in distinguishing torsion from other causes of testicular pain such as epididymitis. The individual will not usually have a fever, though nausea is common.

===Imaging===
A Doppler ultrasound scan of the scrotum can identify the absence of blood flow in the twisted testicle and is nearly 90% accurate in diagnosis. It can also help distinguish torsion from epididymitis.

Radionuclide scanning (scintigraphy) of the scrotum is the most accurate imaging technique, but it is not routinely available, particularly with the urgency that might be required. The agent of choice for this purpose is technetium-99m pertechnetate. Initially it provides a radionuclide angiogram, followed by a static image after the radionuclide has perfused the tissue. In the healthy patient, initial images show symmetric flow to the testes, and delayed images show uniformly symmetric activity. In testicular torsion, the images may show heterogeneous activity within the affected testicle.

==Treatment==
Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention to restore the flow of blood to the testicle. If treated either manually or surgically within six hours, there is a high chance (approximately 90%) of saving the testicle. At 12 hours the rate decreases to 50%; at 24 hours it drops to 10%, and after 24 hours the ability to save the testicle approaches 0, although salvage of the testicle has been reported beyond 24 hours. About 40% of cases result in loss of the testicle.

With prompt diagnosis and treatment, the testicle can often be saved. Typically, when a torsion takes place, the surface of the testicle has rotated towards the midline of the body. Non-surgical correction can sometimes be accomplished by manually rotating the testicle in the opposite direction (i.e., outward, towards the thigh); if this is initially unsuccessful, a forced manual rotation in the other direction may correct the problem. The success rate of manual detorsion is not known with confidence.

When salvage of the testicle is accomplished, long-term testicular damage is common. Testicular size is often diminished, and injury to the unaffected testicle is common. The effect of a torsion event on long-term fertility is not fully understood.

A repeat doppler ultrasound scan may confirm restoration of blood flow to the testicle following manual detorsion. However, surgical exploration is often performed in order to assess the health and viability of the testicle. An orchiopexy is performed to both the affected and unaffected testicles in order to prevent recurrence. If the testis is not viable, it is removed (orchiectomy).

==Epidemiology==
Torsion is most frequent among adolescents with about 60% of cases presenting between 10 and 18 years of age. It is the most common cause of rapid onset testicular pain and swelling in people under 18 years old. It occurs in about 1 in 4,000 to 1 per 25,000 males per year before 25 years of age; but it can occur at any age, including infancy.

<text>Raquel Johanna Rosaly Guillermety (born January 13, 1948) is a Puerto Rican actress, singer, and television host.

==Early years==
Johanna Rosaly was born in Santurce, a district of San Juan. In 1956 at the age of eight, she started taking acting lessons with Argentinians Luis A. Negro and Elba Mania, and dancing lessons with Beatriz Trujillo. In 1957, she made her acting debut as a child, on stage, at Teatro Tapia, in Old San Juan, in &quot;Mientras los Niños Juegan&quot; (&quot;While the Children Play&quot;). That same year, she made her debut on television, with Channel 2&#x27;s children&#x27;s production of &quot;Los Amigos de Pinocho&quot; (&quot;Pinocho&#x27;s Friends&quot;) as well as in the film &quot;Con Los Pies Descalzos&quot; (an Osvaldo Agüero production, starring the Catalan actor Ricardo Palmerola).

==Teenage years==
Rosaly started taking singing lessons when she became a teenager. Then, she participated on stage in Spanish zarzuelas such as “El Caserío”, and “Black el Payaso”; operettas, such as “La duquesa del Bal Tabarin”, and musicals performed in English, such as “My Fair Lady”, “The Sound of Music” and “I Do, I Do”.

In 1966, already in her early years in college, she made her TV debut in the telenovela &quot;El Retrato de Angela&quot;, broadcast by Telemundo. In this soap opera, she played a mute girl.

==Singing career==
During the late 1970s and early 80s, Johanna Rosaly had a short but notable career as a singer. In 1978 she signed with the Venezuelan Velvet Records label, and began touring all over Latin America, to promote her two albums under that label and following the popularity of the soap operas she had starred in.
In 1980 she would sign with CBS International label, now Sony Discos, and recorded two more albums for them, doing shows in many US cities with high Hispanic populations.

==Television acting career==
Rosaly performed in 15 soap operas altogether from 1966 - 1980. However, the leading roles she is mostly remembered for were, 1973&#x27;s &quot;El Hijo de Angela María&quot;, alongside Rolando Barral, Mona Marti, Ángela Meyer, and Lucy Boscana, among others. This performance led her to carry out the same leading role, &quot;Marisela Perdomo&quot;, in the film based on the telenovela, in Mexico, opposite Iranian-Mexican actress Irán Eory.
Her crossover as a singer/actress was in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Cristina Bazán&quot;, opposite José Luis Rodríguez &quot;El Puma&quot;, and alongside Alba Nydia Díaz, Esther Sandoval, and Adamari López, at the early age of 6, among others.

In 1979 Johanna Rosaly left Telemundo (WKAQ-TV)for WAPA-TV, where she performed she starred in the 1980 soap operas: “Vida”,&quot;Amame&quot;, opposite Dominican-Mexican Andrés García, and “El Amor Nuestro de Cada Día”, opposite Venezuelan Jean Carlo Simancas. For each one she sang the musical theme, namely “Yo Soy Un Barco” (composed by [[Lou Briel), “Amándote” and “El Amor Nuestro de Cada Día”, respectively. &quot;Amándote&quot; (Loving You), respectively.

==Anchor woman &amp; TV host==
As the 1980s came about, Rosaly made a short parenthesis in her acting career, working as an [[Senior management|executive]] in [[WAPA-TV]], and shortly moved to Telemundo again, becoming first a Cultural and Arts News reporter for Telenoticias, and eventually in 1982 an anchor woman and host in the talk-show, &quot;En Vivo a las Cinco&quot;. She also starred in the five-hours-long game show &quot;Super Sábados&quot;, which for several years was aired via satellite to many Hispanic enclaves in the US.
In 1993, Johanna Rosaly joined [[WIPR-TV]] channel 6, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Government TV channel, hosting several shows, such as &quot;Mucho Gusto&quot;, “Cultura Viva” and “¿Y Cómo Fue”.

==Films==
In 1989, she performed alongside [[Tommy Muñiz]] in the motion picture film &quot;[[Lo que le Pasó a Santiago]]&quot;, produced and directed by [[Jacobo Morales]], which was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] as the best foreign film.
In 1993 she performed in, &quot;Shortcut to Paradise&quot;, and in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Linda Sara&quot;, alongside [[Chayanne]] and [[Dayanara Torres]]. Other film credits include “Dios Los Cría II”, “El Bailao de Julia y Berto”, “Con los Pies Descalzos”, “Jugando en Serio” and “Force of Nature”.

==Recent years==
Since the 1990s, she has devoted herself mostly to the stage, to critical acclaim for works such as &quot;[[Master Class]]&quot;, “Punto y Coma” (W;t), “Buenas Noches, Mamá (“‘Night, Mother”, “Relaciones Peligrosas” (Liaisons Dangereuses), among many others. Altogether, she has performed in over 100 plays during her very long acting career .

In 2010, she made her debut on the New York stage, in &quot;Sabina y Lucrecia&quot;. Rosaly and New York-based actress [[Eva Cristina Vásquez]] starred in this play by [[Alberto Adellach]], &quot; a tale of two very different mentally ill women who escape an asylum.&quot;

Rosaly played &quot;Mrs. Warren&quot; in the San Juan revival of &quot;[[Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession|La profesión de la Sra. Warren]]&quot;, as part of the International Festival of the Puerto Rican Culture Institute.

==Personal life==
On January 11, 2008, Rosaly married José Manuel Saldaña, the former president of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. The couple announced their separation in June 2011.

During the [[2018 California wildfires]], Rosaly was at the residence of her son, film director José Gilberto Molinari, and her daughter in law as well as her two-month old grandchild in [[Agoura Hills, California|Agoura Hills]]. She escaped the [[Woolsey Fire]] with her family by taking refuge in a hotel. Molinari&#x27;s house only suffered minor damages. A day later, close to the hotel the Rocky Fire started, however, it was soon controlled and the family did not have to flee for a second time.

=== Honors ===
She has received multiple honors, among them, the &quot;Puerto Rican Culture Institute&quot; (ICP), dedicated their 1997 International Theater Festival to her, honoring her more than 40 years as an actress.

<doc id="284831" wikidata="Q1710069" url="?curid=284831" title="Subbuteo">
<text>Subbuteo ( ) is a tabletop football game in which players simulate association football by flicking miniature players with their fingers. The name is derived from the Neo-Latin scientific name &quot;Falco subbuteo&quot; (a bird of prey commonly known as the Eurasian hobby), after a trademark was not granted to its creator Peter Adolph (1916–1994) to call the game &quot;Hobby&quot;.

While most closely associated with the football game, versions of Subbuteo based on other team sports such as cricket, both codes of rugby and hockey have also been produced.

== History ==
Subbuteo was invented by Peter Adolph (1916–1994), who was demobbed from the Royal Air Force after the end of World War II. Searching for a new business opportunity he turned his attention to creating a new table-top football game. He adapted his game from Newfooty, a table football game that had been invented in 1929 by William Lane Keeling of Liverpool. He made numerous improvements, including changing the heavy lead bases under the model players to lighter materials, using for his prototype a button from his mother&#x27;s coat and a washer.

In August 1946 Peter Adolph filed an outline patent application for the game, which was not finalised until May 1947. The August 1946 edition of &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; first announced Subbuteo&#x27;s availability and offered to send details, but sets were not available until March 1947. According to rumours, after the early adverts, orders started to pour in as Adolph set about converting his patent idea into a deliverable product.

The first Subbuteo sets, known as the Assembly Outfits, consisted of goals made of wire with paper nets, a cellulose acetate ball, cardboard playing figures in two basic kits (red shirts with white shorts, and blue shirts with white shorts) and bases made from buttons weighed down with lead washers. The story is that Peter found one of his mother&#x27;s coat buttons and used Woolworth buttons for the early set bases. No pitch was provided: instead, the purchaser was given instructions on how to mark out (with chalk, provided) a playing area on to a blanket (an old army blanket was recommended). The first sets were eventually available in March 1947, several months after the original advertisement appeared. The first figures were made of flat cardboard cut out of a long strip. Later these card players came in press-out strips before being replaced with two-dimensional celluloid figures, known to collectors as &quot;flats&quot;.

Early production of Subbuteo was centred in Langton Green, near Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Following the advent of the OO scale players the player figures were individually hand painted by local outworkers in their own homes.

In its early years, Subbuteo had a fierce rivalry with Newfooty. In the run-up to Christmas 1961, Adolph introduced a three-dimensional handpainted plastic figure into the range. After several design modifications, this figure evolved by 1967 into the classic &quot;heavyweight&quot; figure pictured. Newfooty ceased trading in 1961 after a failed television advertising campaign but its demise is thought to be linked to the launch of the moulded Subbuteo players. There were several further evolutions of figure design. In 1978 the &quot;zombie&quot; figure was introduced to facilitate the machine painting of figures. After much negative feedback, the zombie figure was replaced in 1980 by the &quot;lightweight&quot; figure that continued until the 1990s when Hasbro acquired Waddingtons Games, which owned Subbuteo.

After Hasbro bought Waddington Games in 1994, Subbuteo sales declined from about 150,000 sets per year to 3,000 in 2002 and just 500 sets in 2003, when production was stopped.

Hasbro relaunched Subbuteo in 2005 with flat photorealistic card-style figures on bases, rather than three-dimensional figures. The relaunch was not a success and was again discontinued.

In 2012, Hasbro licensed Subbuteo to Eleven Force and it returned to the shops with a new style of three-dimensional rubber figures, launching Subbuteo into its eighth decade of production. Subbuteo also made other things for the collector, such as stands to create a stadium, cups, crowds, policemen and much more.

In 2020, Hasbro awarded the licence to Longshore, although Eleven Force remained Subbuteo&#x27;s Spanish distributor. It was reported that Hasbro had been unhappy with Elevenforce&#x27;s lack of interest in markets outside Spain. In May 2020, Subbuteo World, a long-term UK seller of Subbuteo, announced it was advising Longshore, and that there would be new teams, a Subbuteo VAR set, and new fences.

== Gameplay ==

Playing Subbuteo is a physical simulation of association football, involving dexterity and skill in flicking the playing figures, which stand on weighted bases, across the tabletop pitch towards the ball.

Hundreds of team kits and accessories are available, almost all representing real teams, with the exception of comic book team Melchester Rovers. Along with major teams such as Chelsea, Manchester City, and Real Madrid, unpainted models are also available. There are also many additional accessories, such as new balls and goals, special figures for free kicks and throw-ins, stands and crowd, linesmen, ball-boys, streakers and policemen, floodlights and TV cameras.

The rules are designed to correspond closely with those of association football, albeit with some simplifications and alterations. Players maintain possession as long as the figure they flick makes contact with the ball and the ball does not subsequently hit an opposing figure, although the same figure cannot be used for more than three consecutive flicks. Shots at goal can be taken only once the ball is over the &#x27;shooting line&#x27;, a line parallel to and equidistant between the goal line and half-way line. The goalkeeper figures are attached to, and manoeuvered with, a rod that fits underneath the back of the goal. The offside law is in effect, but only pertaining to figures that are forward of the opposing team&#x27;s shooting line (as opposed to the half-way line, as in actual football).

==Subbuteo World Cup==
There is a Subbuteo World Cup competition. In 2024, it was hosted by Royal Tunbridge Wells to commemorate the town being the birthplace of the game.

Here are the previous winners of the Subbuteo World Cup.
==FISTF==
International Sports Table Football (FISTF) was founded on 16 June 1992 in Hamburg (Germany).

Merging:

* European Tablesoccer (Football) Federation (ETF 1963-1993) 
* Federation of International Subbuteo Associations (FISA 1979-1996).
* European Tablesoccer Federation (ETF)
* Federation of International Subbuteo Associations (FISA)
FISTF lays down the playing rules of Table Football.

==Video game==
A digital version was released by Goliath Games in 1990 for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; gave the game a rating of 95% and said &quot;Goliath have managed to distill the essential elements of the original game and transfer them across to the Amiga.&quot;

<text>Northern Samar (; ), officially the Province of Northern Samar, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region. Its capital is Catarman, the most populous town in the province and is located at the northern portion of the island of Samar. Bordering the province to the south are the provinces of Samar and Eastern Samar. To the northwest, across the San Bernardino Strait is Sorsogon; to the east is the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean and to the west is Samar Sea.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Historian William Henry Scott wrote that a &quot;Samar datu by the name of Iberein was rowed out to a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbor in 1543 by oarsmen collared in gold; while wearing on his own person earrings and chains.&quot; In the local epic called &quot;siday&quot; entitled Bingi of Lawan as written in the article of Scott, Lawan is a prosperous settlement in Samar.

In 1596, many names, such as Samal, Ibabao, and Tandaya, were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of Cebu.

In 1614, the Jesuits established a mission residence in Palapag among the Ibabao populace. These missionaries stayed until the late 17th century when they were expelled from the Philippines in 1768 and were replaced by the Franciscans.

As the San Bernardino Strait was along the route of the Spanish galleons plying between Manila and Acapulco, Mexico, a royal port was established in Palapag where the richly laden Manila Galleons were protected from unfavorable winds and troubled seas.

In the early years of the 16th century, shipbuilders were drafted from Palapag to the Cavite shipyards for the construction of galleons and vessels for the conservation of defense of the island. It was also at this time that these recruits ignited the Sumoroy insurrection, which signaled a general uprising against Spain in the Visayas and Mindanao. The insurrection simultaneously flared northward to Albay and southward to the northern coasts of Mindanao and then Cebu. It took over a year before the Spaniards were able to subdue the rebellion.

Samar and Leyte were separated from Cebu in 1735. They were split in 1747 but was reversed in 1762 with the approval of the King of Spain, following complaints from the Jesuits. The province of Samar was later established as a distinct province in 1768 after it got separated from the province of Leyte. In 1777, Samar and Leyte split for the last time when it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.

===American invasion era===
Later in 1898, when the Americans landed on the beach of Catarman, they organized a revolutionary army led by General Vicente Lukban who fought the invaders armed with cannons and rifles with only bolos and &quot;paltik&quot;s. Although defeated, they, however, continued to harass the Americans through guerrilla warfare.

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, the people of Northern Samar organized a platoon of volunteers supported by voluntary contributions. The contingent became a part of the Philippine National Guard in Manila. The province also helped the government by purchasing a considerable amount of bonds floated to finance the National Commission for Independence, then organized by Manuel L. Quezon after a coalition of the Nacionalista and Democrata parties were formed.

===Philippine independence===
Samar Congressmen Eladio T. Balite (1st district), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd district), and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd district), authored &quot;Republic Act No. 4221&quot; which was approved by Congress in 1963. The law, ratified in a plebiscite on June 19, 1965, divided Samar into three: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar and (Western) Samar. The first provincial officials of Northern Samar, aside from the lone district congressman, were elected on November 14, 1967, and on January 1, 1968, they officially assumed office.

==Geography==

Northern Samar covers a total area of occupying the northern section of Samar Island in the Eastern Visayas region. The province is bounded by north by the San Bernardino Strait, on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the west by the Samar Sea, on the southwest by Samar and on the southeast by Eastern Samar. It ranks thirty-seventh (37th) in size among the 80 provinces of the Philippines and accounts for practically 1.2 percent of the total land area of the country. About 52 percent of the total land area is covered by forest, while 42 percent is classified as alienable and disposable.

The province is composed largely of low and extremely rugged hills and small lowland areas. It also has small and discontinuous areas along the coasts and its rivers are usually accompanied by alluvial plains and valleys. The province is endowed with relatively rich and fertile soil that most crops can grow on it.

===Topography===
Northern Samar has a very rugged terrain with restricted pocket plains and valleys. River valleys are low-lying and are often interrupted by hills, while the remaining portion is rolling, hilly, and mountainous. The interior of the mainland consists of highly dissected hills and mountain peaks. Low-lying hills are found between the coastal plains of Palapag, the river valley of Gamay, and Catubig Valley. There are lagoons and lakes (Cinco Forest), and falls near Catubig named Pinipisikan (citation tourism) too.

===Climate===
Northern Samar falls under the intermediate type climate, which has no distinct dry and wet seasons. The rainiest months are October to January, while the driest is the month of May.

===Administrative divisions===

Northern Samar is divided into three major geographical areas, namely: Balicuatro area, Central area, and Pacific area including Catubig Valley – the province&#x27;s rice granary. It comprises 24 towns or municipalities with 569 registered barangays. The province is divided into two legislative districts, the first district, covering the Balicuatro and most part of the Central Area, and the second district, covering the some part of the Central Area, the Pacific Area and the Catubig Valley.



==Demographics==
The population of Northern Samar in the 2020 census was 639,186 people, with a density of .

The people of Northern Samar were previously called &quot;Ibabaonon&quot;. They are predominantly Waray-Waray or Waray, the people of Eastern Visayas or Samar-Leyte region. To distinguish themselves from the Westehanon (people from Samar) and Estehanon (from Eastern Samar) when Samar Island was split into three provinces in 1965, and the Leyteños (the people from the Leyte Island), they now call themselves as &quot;Ninorte Samarenyo&quot; or &quot;Nortehanon&quot;. They are primarily speaking in Waray-Waray which is the main lingua franca of the province.

Bicolano and Masbateño inhabitants coming from respective neighboring provinces of Sorsogon and Masbate are also common at Northern Samar.

===Languages===
The majority of the people in the province speak the Ninorte Samarnon variation of Waray-Waray. About 4.5 percent of the population, especially in the island towns, speak Cebuano, particularly in the island town of San Antonio. Inabaknon, a unique language said to be one of the most preserved languages to date, is the native tongue of the populace in the island town of Capul.

Ninorte Samarnon usually is further subclassified into Balicuatro, Central and Pacific speakers.

Tagalog and English are also widely used and understood in Northern Samar.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
The communities of this province are predominantly Catholic (80%).

====Others====
Other religious groups are Members Church of God International (MCGI), Iglesia ni Cristo, Philippine Independent Church (Iglesia Filipina Independiente), Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Christian sects. A small number of population are Muslim.

===Socio-demographic situation===
Northern Samar is classified as a second class province, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the data gathered from the &quot;Department of Finance Department Order No.23-08&quot; (Effective July 29, 2008).

Catarman is the capital town of the province where most political and economic activities take place. It is the seat of administration and the center of trade and commerce as well as industry.

The province is considered a very rural area with 65% of its people residing in the countryside.

==Economy==
==Tourism==
Northern Samar has several tourism potentials that remain undiscovered by tourists. Some of these include old churches, waterfalls, rivers, caves, virgin forests, and beaches.

Among the last frontiers in the country, its rugged coastline of limestone cliffs along the Pacific Ocean is a historical landmark. During the Spanish colonial era, Samar island was the first Philippine landfall seen by the Manila galleons as they approached the end of their long voyage from Acapulco.

Entering the waters of the Philippine archipelago, the galleons called at the fortified island of Capul off Samar, offered thanks for a safe crossing at the Jesuit church, and then negotiated the rough waters of the narrow San Bernardino Strait toward Manila, their final destination.

Capul also became the last stop on Philippine soil of the departing galleons before the long, often treacherous trans-Pacific voyage to Acapulco in Mexico.

The Coat of Arms of Samar represents the political, geographical description, historical, economic, and social representation and allegorical ideas of the province. The letters &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot; represent Northern Samar. The &quot;map of Northern Samar&quot; represents the geography and 24 municipalities of the province, including the five island towns. The &quot;galleon&quot; represents the Spanish conquistadors that reached the land of the Ibabao to preach the gospel of Christianity, spread the Creed of Roman Catholicism and introduce civil governance thru the Royal Port of Palapag in 1640. &quot;Mount Bubuya&quot; (Palapag Mesa) represents the highest mountain range in Palapag, where Agustin Sumuroy and his men retreated to and encamped after killing Fr. Miguel Balberan, thus starting the Sumuroy Rebellion. The &quot;rice field&quot;, &quot;abaca&quot;, &quot;timber&quot;, and &quot;coconut&quot; are all economic representations.

The following are the allegorical ideas of the province: &quot;Blue&quot;, the color is symbolic of vast marine and aquatic resources, a source of livelihood for the fisher folks of the coastal towns. &quot;Tangerine&quot; represents the cheerfulness, high spirits, and optimism of the people of the province. &quot;Yellow&quot; represents golden harvest, and abundance of resources. &quot;White&quot; symbolizes transparency in governance.

<text>Eastern Samar (Waray-Waray: &quot;Sinirangan Samar&quot;; ), officially the Province of Eastern Samar, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region. Its capital is the city of Borongan, which is the most populous. Eastern Samar occupies the eastern portion of the island of Samar. Bordering the province to the north is the province of Northern Samar and to the west is Samar province. To the east lies the Philippine Sea, part of the vast Pacific Ocean, while to the south lies Leyte Gulf.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
During his circumnavigation of the globe, Ferdinand Magellan had set foot on the tiny island of Homonhon in the southern part of the province. On March 16, 1521, the area of what is now Eastern Samar is said to be the first Philippine landmass spotted by Magellan and his crew.

In 1596, many names, such as Samal, Ibabao, and Tandaya, were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of Cebu. Samar and Leyte were later separated from Cebu in 1735. They were split in 1747 but was reversed in 1762 with the approval of the King of Spain, following complaints from the Jesuits. The province of Samar was later established as a distinct province in 1768 after it got separated from the province of Leyte. In 1777, Samar and Leyte split for the last time when it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.

===American colonial era===
==== Philippine-American War ====

Maj. Eugenio Daza Area Commander of General Lukbán&#x27;s forces for Southeastern Samar

====Balangiga Massacre====
====Pacification of Samar====
===Japanese occupation===
In 1944, combined Filipino-American troops involved in the liberation of the Philippines from Japan built in the town of Guiuan the largest military base in the Pacific. In the same town in 1949, approximately 5,000 Russian refugees escaping from communist China temporarily settled on Tubabao Island until 1951, when they were transferred to Australia and the United States.

===Philippine independence===
====Foundation====
Eastern Samar, as a province, was created from Samar province through &quot;Republic Act No. 4221&quot; on June 19, 1965. Approved by Congress in 1963, it was authored by Samar congressmen Eladio T. Balite (1st district), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd district), and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd district). The law, ratified in a plebiscite on June 19, 1965, divided Samar into three: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar and (Western) Samar. The first provincial officials of Eastern Samar, aside from the lone district representative, were elected on November 14, 1967, and on January 1, 1968, they officially assumed office.

===Contemporary===

The capital town of Borongan became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9394&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 21, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011, declaring the cityhood law constitutional.

Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, made its first landfall in the coastal town of Guiuan in November 2013.

==Geography==
Eastern Samar covers a total area of occupying the eastern section and majority of southern Samar&#x27;s coast of Samar Island in the Eastern Visayas region. The province is bordered to the north by Northern Samar and to the west by Samar. To the east lies the Philippine Sea, part of the vast Pacific Ocean, while to the south lies Leyte Gulf.

Because it faces the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean, Eastern Samar suffers heavily from powerful typhoons.

===Administrative divisions===
Eastern Samar comprises 22 municipalities and one city, all encompassed by an lone congressional district and two provincial districts that elect a representative and provincial board members, respectively.



==Demographics==

In the 2000 Census, Warays comprised of the total provincial population of 375,124 at that time. Kapampangan came second at , &quot;Bisaya&quot;/&quot;Binisaya&quot; , Cebuano at , and Tagalog at .

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
The people of the province are devoted catholics where a majority adhere to Roman Catholicism. The dominant Catholic faith influences the events of the provincial education, politics and social functions of the people.

====Others====
Other Christians usually form the remaining groups of believers such as the Born-again Christians, Protestants, Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayan church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Iglesia ni Cristo, Baptists, Methodists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Seventh-day Adventists. Non Christians (mostly Muslims) are also found.
==Transportation==
The province has one operational airport; Borongan Airport located in the capital city. Currently, only Leascor operates out of Borongan Airport with flights weekly to serve locals and tourists to and from Cebu.

By land, mini buses and vans ply from the regional center in Tacloban, Catbalogan, and Calbayog in Samar province and to some towns in Eastern Samar. From Borongan, buses ply to Metro Manila. Motorized boats plies through Leyte Gulf ferrying passengers going to Tacloban City seaport.

==Economy==

Commercial activities in the province are centered on the provincial capital of Borongan while tourism activities are centered in Guiuan town where Calicoan Island and the historical Homonhon Island are located. Generally, the province&#x27;s major economic resource is fishery and agriculture which include production of coconut, copra, corn, rice, sugar, and vegetables. Tourism potential is untapped on the northern part of the province.

<text>Grayanotoxins are a group of closely related neurotoxins named after &quot;Leucothoe grayana&quot;, a plant native to Japan and named for 19th-century American botanist Asa Gray. Grayanotoxin I (grayanotoxane-3,5,6,10,14,16-hexol 14-acetate) is also known as andromedotoxin, acetylandromedol, rhodotoxin and asebotoxin. Grayanotoxins are produced by &quot;Rhododendron&quot; species and other plants in the family Ericaceae. Honey made from the nectar and so containing pollen of these plants also contains grayanotoxins and is commonly referred to as mad honey. 

Consumption of the plant or any of its secondary products, including mad honey, can cause a rare poisonous reaction called grayanotoxin poisoning, mad honey disease, honey intoxication, or rhododendron poisoning. It is most frequently produced and consumed in regions of Turkey and Nepal as a recreational drug and traditional medicine.

== Origin ==

Grayanotoxins are produced by plants in the family Ericaceae, specifically members of the genera &quot;Agarista&quot;, &quot;Craibiodendron&quot;, &quot;Kalmia&quot;, &quot;Leucothoe&quot;, &quot;Lyonia&quot;, &quot;Pieris&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron&quot;. The genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; alone encompasses over 750 species that grow around the world in parts of Europe, North America, Japan, Nepal and Turkey. They can grow at a variety of altitudes, ranging from sea level to more than . While many of these species contain grayanotoxins, only a few contain significant levels. Species with high concentrations of grayanotoxins, such as &quot;R. ponticum&quot; and &quot;R. luteum&quot;, are most commonly found in regions of Turkey bordering the Black Sea, and in Nepal.
 Nearly all parts of grayanotoxin-producing rhododendrons contain the molecule, including the stem, leaves, flower, pollen and nectar. Grayanotoxins can also be found in secondary plant products, such as honey, labrador tea, cigarettes, and herbal medicines.

==Chemical structure==

Grayanotoxins are low molecular weight hydrophobic compounds. They are structurally characterized as polyhydroxylated cyclic diterpenes. The base structure is a 5/7/6/5 ring system that does not contain nitrogen. More than 25 grayanotoxin isoforms have been identified from &quot;Rhododendron&quot; species&quot;,&quot; but grayanotoxin I and III are thought to be the principal toxic isoforms. Different &quot;Rhododendron&quot; species contain multiple different grayanotoxin isoforms, contributing to differences in plant toxicity.

== Mechanism of action ==

The toxicity of grayanotoxin is derived from its ability to interfere with voltage-gated sodium channels located in the cell membrane of neurons. The Na&quot;v&quot;1.&quot;x&quot; channels consist of four homologous domains (I-IV), each containing six transmembrane alpha-helical segments (S1-S6). Grayanotoxin has a binding affinity (IC50) of approximately 10 μM and binds the group II receptor site located on segment 6 of domains I and IV (IS6 and IVS6). Other toxins that bind to this region include the alkaloids veratridine, batrachotoxin and aconitine.

Experiments using squid axonal membranes indicate that sodium channel binding likely occurs on the internal face of the neuron. Additionally, grayanotoxin only binds to the activated conformation of sodium channels. Normally, voltage gated sodium channels are activated (opened) only when the cell membrane potential reaches a specific threshold voltage. This activated conformation allows for an influx of sodium ions resulting in cell depolarization, followed by the firing of an action potential. At the peak of the action potential, voltage-gated sodium channels are quickly inactivated and are only reset once the cell has repolarized to resting potential. When grayanotoxin is present, binding induces further conformational changes that prevent sodium channel inactivation and lead to a prolonged depolarization. Owing to its transient ability to activate channels and increase membrane permeability to sodium ions, grayanotoxin is classified as a reversible Na&quot;v&quot;1.&quot;x&quot; agonist.

==Clinical effects ==
Although mad honey is used in traditional medicine in Turkey, the majority of grayanotoxin poisoning cases occur in middle-aged males who use the honey for perceived sexual enhancement. Slowing of heart rate and lowering of blood pressure are typical effects reported in one review of cases. Dizziness, nausea, fainting, and weakness were reported as common neurological outcomes. Other early-onset symptoms may include doubled and blurred vision, hypersalivation, perspiration, and paresthesia in the extremities and around the mouth. In higher doses, symptoms can include loss of coordination, severe and progressive muscular weakness, electrocardiographic changes of bundle branch block or ST-segment elevations as seen in ischemic myocardial threat, and nodal rhythm or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

The primary mediator of this grayanotoxin pathophysiology is the paired vagus nerve (tenth cranial nerve). The vagus nerve is a major component of the parasympathetic nervous system (a branch of the autonomic nervous system) and innervates various organs including the lungs, stomach, kidney and heart. Vagal stimulation of the heart is mediated by M2-subtype muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). In severe cases of grayanotoxin poisoning, atropine a non-specific &quot;mAChR antagonist&quot; or Muscarinic antagonist can be used to treat bradycardia and other heart rhythm malfunctions. In addition to correcting rhythm disorders, administration of fluids and vasopressors can also help treat hypotension and mitigate other symptoms.

Patients exposed to low doses of grayanotoxin typically recover within a few hours. In more severe cases, symptoms may persist for 24 hours or longer and may require medical treatment (as described above). Despite the risk from cardiac problems, grayanotoxin poisoning is rarely fatal in humans.

==Animal poisoning==
In contrast to humans, grayanotoxin poisoning can be lethal for other animals. Nectar containing grayanotoxin can kill honeybees, though some seem to have resistance to it and can produce honey from the nectar (see below). According to a team of researchers from the UK and Ireland, worker bumblebees are not harmed and may be preferable as pollinators because they transfer more pollen. Consequently, it may be advantageous for plants to produce grayanotoxin to be pollinated by bumblebees.

== Mad honey intoxication==

Bees that collect pollen and nectar from grayanotoxin-containing plants often produce honey that also contains grayanotoxins. This so-called &quot;mad honey&quot; is the most common cause of grayanotoxin poisoning in humans. Small-scale producers of mad honey typically harvest honey from a small area or single hive to produce a final product containing a significant concentration of grayanotoxin. In contrast, large-scale honey production often mixes honey gathered from different locations, diluting the concentration of any contaminated honey.

Mad honey is produced in specific world regions, notably the Black Sea region of Turkey (91% of poisoning cases in one analysis) and Nepal (5%). In Turkey, mad honey known as &quot;deli bal&quot; is used as a recreational drug and traditional medicine. It is most commonly made from the nectar of &quot;Rhododendron luteum&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; in the Caucasus region. In Nepal, this type of honey is used by the Gurung people for both its hallucinogenic properties and supposed medicinal benefits. 

In the 18th century, this honey was exported to Europe to add to alcoholic drinks to give them extra potency. In modern times, it is consumed locally and exported to North America, Europe and Asia.

===Other grayanotoxin sources===
In addition to various &quot;Rhododendron&quot; species, mad honey can also be made from several other grayanotoxin-containing plants. Honey produced from the nectar of &quot;Andromeda polifolia&quot; contains high enough levels of grayanotoxin to cause full body paralysis and potentially fatal breathing difficulties due to diaphragm paralysis. Honey obtained from spoonwood and allied species such as sheep-laurel can also cause illness. The honey from &quot;Lestrimelitta limao&quot; also produces a similar paralyzing effect to that of the honey from &quot;A. polifolia&quot; and is also toxic to humans.

=== Historical use ===
The intoxicating effects of mad honey have been suspected for centuries, including records from Xenophon, Aristotle, Strabo, Pliny the Elder and Columella, all reporting illness from eating &quot;maddening&quot; honey believed to be from the pollen or nectar of &quot;Rhododendron luteum&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot;. According to Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;, an invading Greek army was accidentally poisoned by harvesting and eating the local Asia Minor honey, but they all made a quick recovery without any fatalities. Having heard of this incident, and realizing that foreign invaders would be ignorant of the dangers of the local honey, King Mithridates later used the honey as a deliberate poison when Pompey&#x27;s army attacked the Heptakometes in Asia Minor in 69 BC. The Roman soldiers became delirious and nauseated after being tricked into eating the toxic honey, at which point Mithridates&#x27; army attacked.

<text>Samar, officially the Province of Samar (; ), or also known as Western Samar, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region. Its capital is the city of Catbalogan while Calbayog is the most populous city in the province. It is bordered by Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte and Leyte Gulf, and includes several islands in the Samar Sea. Samar is connected to the island of Leyte via the San Juanico Bridge.

In 1768, Leyte and modern Samar were created out of the historical province of Samar. In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.

Fishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.

On 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), particularly the towns of Basey, Marabut and Santa Rita.

==Etymology==
&quot;Samar&quot; is said to derive from the word &quot;Samad&quot;, a Visayan word for &quot;wound&quot; or &quot;cut&quot;, describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Some historians however believe that Samar came Samaria, the ancient homeland of the lequios tribe that settled in the Lakanate of Lawan. Datu Iberein is said to be responsible for naming the island Samar.

==History==
===Pre-history===
Around 2 million to 8000 B.C., based on geologic findings, during the ice ages (2 million years – 8000 B.C.), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.

===Early history===
In 8550 B.C., diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools. In 1200 A.D., other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1543, the explorer Ruy López de Villalobos, first came to the island and named it &quot;Las Islas Filipinas&quot;.

In 1596, many names, such as &quot;Samal&quot;, &quot;Ibabao&quot;, and &quot;Tandaya&quot;, were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of Cebu.

On October 15, 1596, the first Jesuit missionaries arrived in &quot;Tinago&quot; (now Dapdap) in Tarangnan. From Tinago, the missionaries, Fr. Francisco de Otazo, Bartolome Martes and Domingo Alonzo began teaching Catechism, healing the sick and spreading the Christian faith into the interior settlements.

On June 1, 1649, the people of Palapag led by Agustin Sumuroy revolted against the decree of Governor General Diego Fajardo requiring able bodied men from the Visayas for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like wildfire, the revolt quickly spread to the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, Surigao, Cebu, Camiguin and as far as Zamboanga. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the Spaniards, Lutaos, and Pampangos.

In 1735, Samar and Leyte were united into one province with Carigara, in Leyte, as the capital town. In 1747, Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness. In 1762, complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.

In 1768, Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768, and took over the administration of 14 of the 17 parishes which were under the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The administration of the remaining three parishes namely Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar were given to the Augustinians.

In 1777, the two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.

In 1803, Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests.

On August 11, 1841, Queen Isabella II of Spain signed a Royal Decree declaring Samar as a province.

===American invasion era===
The Battle of Catubig occurred on April 15–18, 1900 during the Philippine–American War.

On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of the US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.

In 1901, the Balangiga massacre occurred during the Philippine–American War.

On September 28, 1901, the people of Balangiga, Giporlos, Lawaan and Quinapondan in Eastern Samar surprised and attacked the American forces stationed there, killing 48 American soldiers. To avenge their defeat, American general Jacob H. Smith ordered his men to turn Samar into a &quot;howling wilderness&quot;.

On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anunciacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.

===Japanese occupation era===
In 1942, the occupying Imperial Japanese forces arrived in the province of Samar.

On October 24, 1944, the Battle off Samar took place as Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force warships clashed with several allied naval vessels in a collision course. His forces sank escort carrier , destroyers and , and escort destroyer , but at a cost of his cruisers &quot;Chikuma&quot;, , and . Despite being a tactical victory for the Imperial Japanese Navy, it did not alter the course of the Philippines campaign.

===Philippine independence===
On June 19, 1965, the Philippine Congress along with the three Samar Representatives, Eladio T. Balite (1st District), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd District) and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd District), approved &quot;Republic Act No. 4221&quot; dividing the region of Samar into three divisions: &quot;Northern Samar&quot;, &quot;Eastern Samar&quot;, and &quot;Western Samar&quot;. Each region adopted a new capital: Catbalogan (Western Samar), Borongan (Eastern Samar), and Catarman (Northern Samar). The law was later ratified by the majority of voters through a plebiscite held on November 9, 1965. Esteban Piczon, the last governor of undivided Samar, continued as the first governor of Western Samar, while the aforementioned representatives were re-elected for the new provinces in 1965. The first provincial officials of Western Samar were elected on November 14, 1967, and on January 1, 1968, they officially assumed office.

On June 21, 1969, under &quot;Republic Act No. 5650&quot;, &quot;Western Samar&quot; was renamed &quot;Samar&quot; with Catbalogan still as the capital.

===Contemporary===
The capital town Catbalogan became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9391&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 16, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the League of Cities of the Philippines questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the Surepeme Court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Typhoon Yolanda, hit Samar province. More than 300 people perished on the first day it hit the province.

In June 2018, a friendly fire incident happened between Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the administration of Rodrigo Duterte. The incident led to the death of numerous police officials of Waray ethnic origin.

On January 22, 2019, House Bill No. 8824 was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Edgar Mary Sarmiento to establish a new province called &quot;Northwestern Samar&quot;, consisting of nine municipalities and one city of Samar&#x27;s 1st congressional district, of which Calbayog would be the designated capital. The bill is yet to be reviewed.

==Geography==
Samar province covers a total area of occupying the central-western sections of the Samar island in the Eastern Visayas region. The province is bordered on the north by Northern Samar, east by Eastern Samar, south by Leyte and Leyte Gulf, and west by the Samar Sea.

===Topography===
Samar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the alluvial plains and deltas accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of Catubig and Catarman rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the Calbayog area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and Ulot rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to deforestation. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.

===Climate and rainfall===
Areas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast monsoon. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.

Areas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.

===Administrative divisions===
The province of Samar comprises two congressional districts, 24 municipalities and two component cities. It has a total of 952 barangays.



==Demographics==

The population of Samar (province) in the 2020 census was 793,183 people, with a density of .

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
Samar (Western Samar) is predominantly Roman Catholic. The &quot;Catholic Hierarchy&quot; (2014) states that 95 percent of its population adhere to Roman Catholicism.

====Others====
Some other Christian believers constitute most of the remainder such as Rizalista, Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Born-again Christians, Iglesia ni Cristo, Baptists, Methodists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Seventh-day Adventist, and Members Church of God International (MCGI). Muslims are also present and a few mosques are located within the province.

===Languages and dialects===
Residents of Samar are mostly Waray, the fifth largest cultural-linguistic group in the country. 90.2 percent of the household population speaks the Waray-Waray language, while 9.8 percent also speak Cebuano; 8.1 percent Boholano; 0.07 percent Tagalog; and 0.5 percent other languages.

There are two types of Waray spoken in the province, &quot;Waray Lineyte-Samarnon&quot; which is spoken from the southernmost tip of the province up to the municipality of Gandara and &quot;Waray Calbayog&quot;, an intermediary between the Waray of Northern Samar and the Waray of Samar, spoken in Calbayog, Santa Margarita, and in some parts of Tagapul-an, Santo Niño, Almagro and Matuguinao.

<text>Maurice Bernard Sendak (; June 10, 1928 – May 8, 2012) was an American author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books. His book &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; was first published in 1963. Born to Polish-Jewish parents, his childhood was impacted by the death of many of his family members during the Holocaust. Sendak wrote books including &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Outside Over There&quot;, and illustrated many works by other authors such as the &quot;Little Bear&quot; books by Else Holmelund Minarik.

==Early life==
Sendak was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Polish Jewish immigrants Sadie (née Schindler) and Philip Sendak, a dressmaker. Maurice said that his childhood was a &quot;terrible situation&quot; due to the death of members of his extended family during the Holocaust which introduced him at a young age to the concept of mortality. His love of books began when, as a child, he developed health issues and was confined to his bed. When he was 12 years old, he decided to become an illustrator after watching Walt Disney&#x27;s film &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

One of Sendak&#x27;s first professional commissions, when he was 20 years old, was creating window displays for the toy store FAO Schwarz. His illustrations were first published in 1947 in a textbook titled &quot;Atomics for the Millions&quot; by Maxwell Leigh Eidinoff. He spent much of the 1950s illustrating children&#x27;s books written by others before beginning to write his own stories. The Maurice Sendak Foundation credited editor Ursula Nordstrom and authors Ruth Krauss and Crockett Johnson as people who mentored Sendak. His older brother Jack Sendak also became an author of children&#x27;s books, two of which were illustrated by Maurice in the 1950s. In 2011, Maurice was working on a book about noses, and he attributed his love of the olfactory organ to his brother Jack, who—in Sendak&#x27;s opinion—had a great nose.

Maurice was the youngest of three siblings. Jack was born five years before him and Natalie was born nine years before him.

==Career==

Maurice Sendak began his children&#x27;s book career as an illustrator. His work appears in eight books by Ruth Krauss including &quot;A Hole is to Dig&quot;, published in 1952, which brought wide attention to his artwork. He illustrated the five original books in the &quot;Little Bear&quot; series by Else Holmelund Minarik which were published between 1957 and 1968.

Sendak gained international acclaim after writing and illustrating &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, edited by Ursula Nordstrom at Harper &amp; Row. It features Max, a boy who &quot;rages against his mother for being sent to bed without any supper&quot;. The book&#x27;s depictions of fanged monsters concerned some parents when it was first published, as his characters were somewhat grotesque in appearance. Sendak initially considered the title &quot;Where the Wild &quot;Horses&quot; Are&quot; but then decided against it. 

Sendak later recounted the reaction of a fan:

In 2012, &quot;School Library Journal&quot; identified &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; as its top picture book based on reader surveys. The librarian who conducted it observed that there was little doubt what would be voted number one and highlighted its designation by one reader as a watershed, &quot;ushering in the modern age of picture books&quot;. Another called it &quot;perfectly crafted, perfectly illustrated ... simply the epitome of a picture book&quot; and noted that Sendak &quot;rises above the rest in part because he is subversive.&quot;

When Sendak saw a manuscript of &quot;Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories&quot;, the first children&#x27;s book by Isaac Bashevis Singer, on the desk of an editor at Harper &amp; Row, he offered to illustrate the book. It was first published in 1966 and received a Newbery Honor. Sendak was delighted and enthusiastic about the collaboration. He once wryly remarked that his parents were &quot;finally&quot; impressed by their youngest child when he collaborated with Singer.

His book &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot;, originally issued in 1970, has often been subjected to censorship for its drawings of a young boy prancing naked through the story. The book has been challenged in several U.S. states including Illinois, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Texas. &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot; regularly appears on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of &quot;frequently challenged and banned books&quot;. It was listed number 21 on the &quot;100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999&quot;.

His 1981 book &quot;Outside Over There&quot; is the story of a girl named Ida and her sibling jealousy and responsibility. Her father is away, so Ida is left to watch her baby sister, much to her dismay. Her sister is kidnapped by goblins and Ida must go off on a magical adventure to rescue her. At first, she is not really eager to get her sister and nearly passes right by her when she becomes absorbed in the magic of the quest. In the end, she rescues her sister, destroys the goblins, and returns home committed to caring for her sister until her father returns. This rescue story includes an illustration of a ladder leaning out of the window of a home, which according to one report, was based on the crime scene in the Lindbergh kidnapping, &quot;which terrified Sendak as a child.&quot;

Sendak was an early member of the National Board of Advisors of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop during the development stages of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; television series. He created four animated stories for the series: &quot;Bumble Ardy&quot;, an animated sequence with Jim Henson as the voice of Bumble Ardy, &quot;Seven Monsters&quot;, &quot;Up &amp; Down&quot;, and &quot;Broom Adventures&quot;. Sendak later adapted &quot;Seven Monsters&quot; into the book &quot;Seven Little Monsters&quot;, which itself would be adapted into an animated television series.

Sendak produced an animated television production based on his work titled &quot;Really Rosie&quot;, featuring the voice of Carole King, which was broadcast in 1975 and is available on video (usually as part of video compilations of his work). An album of the songs was also produced. He contributed the opening segment to &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, a Christmas collection of six animated shorts shown on PBS in 1977 and later released on VHS in 1993. He adapted his book &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; for the stage in 1979. Additionally, he designed sets and costumes for many operas and ballets, including the award-winning (1983) Pacific Northwest Ballet production of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, Glyndebourne Festival Opera&#x27;s productions of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; (1982), Ravel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; (1987) and Oliver Knussen&#x27;s adaptation of Sendak&#x27;s own &quot;Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life&quot; (1985), Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s productions of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1981) and Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; (1997), Los Angeles County Music Center&#x27;s 1990 production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, and the New York City Opera&#x27;s productions of Janáček&#x27;s &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; (1981), and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Goose of Cairo&quot; (1984).

Also in 1993, Sendak published a picture book, &quot;We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy&quot;. Later in the 1990s, Sendak approached playwright Tony Kushner to write a new English-language version of the Czech composer Hans Krása&#x27;s Holocaust opera &quot;Brundibár&quot; which, remarkably, had been performed by children in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Kushner wrote the text for Sendak&#x27;s illustrated book of the same name, published in 2003. The book was named one of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;″s &quot;10 Best Illustrated Books of 2003&quot;.

In 2003, Chicago Opera Theatre produced Sendak and Kushner&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Brundibár&quot;. In 2005, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, in collaboration with Yale Repertory Theatre and Broadway&#x27;s New Victory Theater, produced a substantially re-worked version of the Sendak-Kushner adaptation. In 2004, Sendak worked with the Shirim Klezmer Orchestra in Boston on their project &quot;Pincus and the Pig: A Klezmer Tale&quot;. This Klezmer version of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s best-known musical story for children, &quot;Peter and the Wolf,&quot; featured Maurice Sendak as the narrator. He also illustrated the cover art.

In 2011, Sendak adapted his &quot;Sesame Street&quot; short &quot;Bumble Ardy&quot; into a children&#x27;s book, his first in over thirty years, and ultimately his last published work before his death.

==Personal life==
Sendak mentioned in a September 2008 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was gay and had lived with his partner, psychoanalyst Eugene David Glynn (February 25, 1926 – May 15, 2007), for 50 years before Glynn&#x27;s death in May 2007. Revealing that he never told his parents, he said, &quot;All I wanted was to be straight so my parents could be happy. They never, never, never knew.&quot; Sendak&#x27;s relationship with Glynn was referenced by other writers before (including Tony Kushner in 2003) and Glynn&#x27;s 2007 death notice identified Sendak as his &quot;partner of fifty years&quot;. After his partner&#x27;s death, Sendak donated $1 million to the Jewish Board of Family and Children&#x27;s Services in memory of Glynn, who treated young people there. The money will go to a clinic which is to be named for Glynn. 

Sendak was an atheist. In a 2011 interview, he said that he did not believe in God and explained that he felt that religion, and belief in God, &quot;must have made life much easier [for some religious friends of his]. It&#x27;s harder for us non-believers.&quot;

In the early 1960s, Sendak lived in a basement apartment at 29 West 9th Street in Greenwich Village where he wrote and illustrated &quot;Wild Things&quot;. Later he had a nearby &quot;pied-à-terre&quot; at 40 Fifth Avenue where he worked and stayed occasionally after moving full-time to Ridgefield, Connecticut.

===Influences===
Maurice Sendak drew inspiration and influences from a vast number of painters, musicians, and authors. Going back to his childhood, one of his earliest memorable influences was actually his father, Philip Sendak. According to Maurice, his father related tales from the Torah; however, he would embellish them with racy details. Not realizing that this was inappropriate for children, young Maurice was frequently sent home after retelling his father&#x27;s &quot;softcore Bible tales&quot; at school.

Maurice Sendak developed other influences growing up beginning with Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; and Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse was created in the year Sendak was born, 1928, and Sendak described Mickey as being a source of joy and pleasure for him while growing up. He has been quoted as saying, &quot;My gods are Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, Mozart. I believe in them with all my heart.&quot; Elaborating further, he has stated that reading Emily Dickinson&#x27;s works helps him to remain calm in an otherwise hectic world: &quot;And I have a little tiny Emily Dickinson so big that I carry in my pocket everywhere. And you just read three poems of Emily. She is so brave. She is so strong. She is such a passionate little woman. I feel better.&quot; Likewise, of Mozart, he has said, &quot;When Mozart is playing in my room, I am in conjunction with something I can&#x27;t explain. ... I don&#x27;t need to. I know that if there&#x27;s a purpose for life, it was for me to hear Mozart.&quot;

Ursula Nordstrom, director of Harper&#x27;s Department of Books for Boys and Girls from 1940 until 1973, was also an inspiration for Sendak.

===Death===
Sendak died at Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Connecticut on May 8, 2012, at age 83, due to complications from a stroke. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. 

Sendak&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that he was &quot;the most important children&#x27;s book artist of the 20th century.&quot; Author Neil Gaiman remarked, &quot;He was unique, grumpy, brilliant, wise, magical and made the world better by creating art in it.&quot; Author R. L. Stine called Sendak&#x27;s death &quot;a sad day in children&#x27;s books and for the world.&quot;

Comedian Stephen Colbert, who interviewed Sendak on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in one of his last public appearances, said of Sendak: &quot;We are all honored to have been briefly invited into his world.&quot; On a January 2012 episode of the show Sendak taught Colbert how to illustrate and provide a book blurb for Colbert&#x27;s own children&#x27;s book, &quot;I Am a Pole (And So Can You!)&quot;, and the day Sendak died was the book&#x27;s official release date.

The 2012 season of Pacific Northwest Ballet&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, for which Sendak designed the set and costumes, was dedicated to his memory. On May 12, 2012, the Nick Jr. Channel hosted a three-hour &quot;Little Bear&quot; marathon in his memory. The writer of the series Else Holmelund Minarik died herself only two months later on July 12, 2012, at the age of 91.

His final book, &quot;Bumble-Ardy&quot;, was published eight months before his death. A picture book, titled &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Book&quot;, was published in February 2013. The film &quot;Her&quot; was dedicated in memory of him and &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; co-star James Gandolfini. The film was directed by Spike Jonze, who also directed the 2009 feature film adaptation of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;.

==Maurice Sendak Collection==

In 1968, Sendak lent the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library in Philadelphia, the bulk of his work including nearly 10,000 works of art, manuscripts, books, and ephemera. From May 6, 2008, through May 3, 2009, the Rosenbach presented &quot;There&#x27;s a Mystery There: Sendak on Sendak&quot;. The major retrospective of over 130 pieces pulled from the museum&#x27;s vast Sendak collection featured original artwork, rare sketches, never-before-seen working materials, and exclusive interview footage.

Exhibition highlights included:

* Original color artwork from books such as &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot;, &quot;The Nutshell Library&quot;, &quot;Outside Over There&quot;, and &quot;Brundibar&quot;
* &quot;Dummy&quot; books filled with lively preliminary sketches for titles like &quot;The Sign on Rosie&#x27;s Door&quot;, &quot;Pierre&quot;, and &quot;Higglety, Pigglety, Pop!&quot;
* Never-before-seen working materials, such as newspaper clippings that inspired Sendak, family portraits, photographs of child models and other ephemera
* Rare sketches for unpublished editions of stories such as Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and Henry James&#x27; &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, and other illustration projects
* Unique materials from the Rosenbach collection that relate to Sendak&#x27;s work, including an 1853 edition of the tales of the Brothers Grimm, sketches by William Blake, and Herman Melville&#x27;s bookcase
* Stories told by the illustrator himself on topics like &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, his struggle to illustrate his favorite novels, hilarious stories of Brooklyn, and the way his work helps him exorcise childhood traumas

Since the items had been on loan to the Rosenbach for decades, many in the museum world expected that the Sendak material would remain there. But Sendak&#x27;s will specified that the drawings and most of the loans would remain the property of the Maurice Sendak Foundation. In 2014, representatives of his estate withdrew the works, saying they intended to follow Sendak&#x27;s directive in his will to create &quot;a museum or similar facility&quot; in Ridgefield, Connecticut, where he lived, and where his foundation is based, &quot;to be used by scholars, students, artists, illustrators and writers, and to be opened to the general public&quot; as the foundation&#x27;s directors saw fit.

The Rosenbach filed an action in 2014, in state probate court in Connecticut, contending that the estate had kept many rare books that Sendak had pledged to the library in his will. In a ruling in Connecticut probate court, a judge awarded the bulk of the disputed book collection to the Sendak estate, not to the museum.

In 2018, the Maurice Sendak Foundation chose the University of Connecticut to house and steward the Collection. Under an agreement with, and supported by a grant from, the Foundation, Sendak&#x27;s original artwork, sketches, books, and other materials (totaling close to 10,000 items) will be housed at UConn&#x27;s Archives and Special Collections in the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center. UConn will also host exhibits of and digitize Sendak materials. The Foundation will retain ownership of the materials.

==Awards and honors==
Internationally, Sendak received the third biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration in 1970, recognizing his &quot;lasting contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot;. He received one of two inaugural Astrid Lindgren Memorial Awards in 2003, recognizing his career contribution to &quot;children&#x27;s and young adult literature in the broadest sense&quot;. The citation called him &quot;the modern picture-book&#x27;s portal figure&quot; and the presentation credited &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; with &quot;all at once [revolutionizing] the entire picture-book narrative ... thematically, aesthetically, and psychologically.&quot; In the U.S., he received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the professional children&#x27;s librarians in 1983, recognizing his &quot;substantial and lasting contributions to children&#x27;s literature&quot;. At the time it was awarded every three years. Only Sendak and the writer Katherine Paterson have won all three of these premier awards.

* Caldecott Medal from the ALA as illustrator of &quot;the most distinguished American picture book for children&quot;, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, 1964 (Sendak was one of the Caldecott runners-up seven times from 1954 to 1982, more than any other illustrator, although some won multiple medals)
* &quot;The House of Sixty Fathers&quot;, a novel by Meindert DeJong, for which Sendak provided the spot, black-and-white illustrations, won the Child Study Association of America&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Award (now called the Josette Frank Award), 1956
* Hans Christian Andersen Award for children&#x27;s book illustration, 1970
* National Book Award in category Picture Books for &quot;Outside Over There&quot;, 1982
* Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for American children&#x27;s literature, 1983
* National Medal of Arts, 1996
* Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award for children&#x27;s literature, 2003 
* Honorary doctorate from the University of Connecticut, 1990
* Honorary doctorate from Goucher College, 2004
* Inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame in 2013

Sendak has two elementary schools named in his honor, one in North Hollywood, California, and PS 118 in Brooklyn, New York. He received an honorary doctorate from Princeton University in 1984.

On June 10, 2013, Google featured an interactive doodle where visitors could click on the video go triangle to see an animated movie-ette of Max and Sendak&#x27;s other main characters. On the cusp of the 125th anniversary of the Brooklyn Public Library it was revealed on November 16, 2022 that the most checked-out book in the collection was Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;.

<doc id="284850" wikidata="Q3541116" url="?curid=284850" title="True crime">
<text>True crime is a genre of non-fiction work in which an author examines a crime, including detailing the actions of people associated with and affected by the crime, and investigating the perpetrator&#x27;s motives. True crime works often deal with violent crimes such as murders and serial killers, including high-profile cases (such as JonBenét Ramsey, O. J. Simpson, and Pamela Smart), and more obscure or unsolved cases that the author wishes to bring wider attention to. A true crime work may use either a journalistic style with a focus on known facts, or a speculative style with a larger focus on the author&#x27;s personal conclusions regarding a crime.

True crime has taken the form of various media, including literature such as magazines and books, television series and documentaries (which may sometimes feature dramatized scenes of the crime based on published accounts), and digital media such as podcasts and internet video. A true crime series may be structured as an anthology of stories focusing on different cases, or cover a single case in a serialized format. True crime podcasts experienced a major growth in popularity in the mid-2010s, with &quot;Serial&quot; setting listenership records, and the genre as a whole having seen long-term gains in overall listenership. True crime works have been particularly popular among women.

True crime has been credited with helping to increase interest in crime among the general public, while decreasing trust in the criminal justice system. Some true crime series have influenced perceptions of specific cases among the public and authorities. The genre has faced criticism for often relying on sensationalism and shock value, with concerns that true crime works are disrespectful to crime victims and their families, may emphasize specific points over others in order to suit an author&#x27;s preferred narrative or opinion, or may contain fictionalized content.

==History==

Zhang Yingyu&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Swindles&quot; () is a late Ming dynasty collection of stories about alleged cases of fraud. Works in the related Chinese genre of court case fiction (&quot;gong&#x27;an xiaoshuo&quot;), such as the 16th-century &quot;Cases of Magistrate Bao&quot; were both fiction &amp; based on actual accounts.

Hundreds of pamphlets, broadsides, chapbooks and other street literature about murders and other crimes were published from 1550 to 1700 in Britain as literacy increased and cheap new printing methods became widespread. They varied in style: some were sensational, while others conveyed a moral message. Most were purchased by the &quot;artisan class and above&quot;, as the lower classes did not have the money or time to read them. Ballads were also created, the verses of which were posted on walls around towns, that were told from the perpetrator&#x27;s point of view in an attempt to understand the psychological motivations of the crime. Such pamphlets remained in circulation in the 19th century in Britain and the United States, even after widespread crime journalism was introduced via the penny press.

In 1807, Henry Tufts published &quot;A Narrative of the Life, Adventures, Travels and Sufferings of Henry Tufts&quot;, which is likely the first extensive biography of an American criminal. Thomas De Quincey published the essay &quot;On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts&quot; in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1827, which focused not on the murder or the murderer but on how society views crime. Starting in 1889, Scottish lawyer William Roughead wrote and published essays for six decades about notable British murder trials he attended, with many of these essays collected in the 2000 book &quot;Classic Crimes.&quot; Many regard Roughead &quot;as the dean of the modern true crime genre.&quot;

An American pioneer of the genre was Edmund Pearson, who was influenced in his style of writing about crime by De Quincey. Pearson published a series of books of this type starting with &quot;Studies in Murder&quot; in 1924 and concluding with &quot;More Studies in Murder&quot; in 1936. Before being collected in his books, Pearson&#x27;s true crime stories typically appeared in magazines like &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Inclusion in these high-class magazines distinguished Pearson&#x27;s crime narratives from those found in the penny press. The foreword of a 1964 anthology of Pearson&#x27;s stories contains an early mention of the term &quot;true crime&quot; as a genre. Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;non-fiction novel&quot; &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1965) is usually credited with establishing the modern novelistic style of the genre and the one that rocketed it to great profitability.

==Forms==
=== Magazines ===

The first true crime magazine, &quot;True Detective&quot;, was published in 1924. It featured fairly matter-of-fact accounts of crimes and how they were solved. During the genre&#x27;s heyday, before World War 2, 200 different true crime magazines were sold on newsstands, with six million magazines sold every month. By itself, &quot;True Detective&quot; had two million in circulation. The covers of the magazines generally featured women being menaced in some way by a potential criminal perpetrator, with the scenarios being more intense in the 1960s. Public interest in the magazines began declining in the 1970s, and by 1996, almost none were being published, including &quot;True Detective&quot;, which had been bought and shut down by a new owner.

=== Books ===
True crime books often center on sensational, shocking, or strange events, particularly murder. Even though murder makes up less than 20% of reported crime, it is present in most true crime stories. Typically, the crimes most commonly include murder; about 40 percent focus on tales of serial killers. Serial killers have been a highly profitable sub-genre. An informal survey conducted by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in 1993 concluded that the more popular true crime books focus on serial killers, with the more gruesome and grotesque content performing even better.

Some true crime works are &quot;instant books&quot; produced quickly to capitalize on popular demand; these have been described as &quot;more than formulaic&quot; and hyper-conventional. Others may reflect years of thoughtful research and inquiry and may have considerable literary merit. A milestone of the genre was Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; (1979), which was the first book in the genre to win a Pulitzer Prize.

Other prominent true crime accounts include Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;; the best-selling true crime book of all time, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, by the lead Manson family prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry; and Ann Rule&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot;, about Ted Bundy. Rule&#x27;s 1987 work, &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot;, tells the story of Diane Downs, an Oregon woman who in May 1983 murdered her daughter and attempted to murder her other two children. An example of a modern true crime book is &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone in the Dark&quot; by Michelle McNamara. Erik Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot; gives a novelistic account of H. H. Holmes&#x27; operations during the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair.

In 2006, Associated Content stated that since the start of the 21st century, the genre of writing that was growing the quickest was true crime. Much of this is due to the ease of recycling materials and the publication of numerous volumes by the same authors differing only by minor updates. The majority of readers of true crime books are women.

=== Films and television ===
True crime documentaries have been a growing medium in the last several decades. One of the most influential documentaries in this process was &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; (1988), directed by Errol Morris. This documentary, among others, feature reenactments, although other documentary filmmakers choose not to use them since they do not show the truth.

In the early 1990s, a boom of true crime films began in Hong Kong. These films ranged from graphic Category III–rated films such as &quot;The Untold Story&quot; and &quot;Dr. Lamb&quot; (based on serial killers Wong Chi Hang and Lam Kor-wan, respectively) to more general audience fare such as the film &quot;Crime Story&quot; (based on the kidnapping of businessman Teddy Wang Tei-huei), which featured action star Jackie Chan.

Multiple cable networks in the United States focus predominantly on true crime, including Investigation Discovery, and Oxygen—a network that originally aired a generalist format targeting women, but pivoted entirely to true crime in 2017 amid the success of series such as &quot;Snapped&quot; among the channel&#x27;s target demographic. An earlier example—Court TV—featured a mix of true crime-oriented programming (such as &quot;Forensic Files&quot;), as well as a daytime news block featuring coverage of legal news and notable jury trials. The channel later shifted to primarily airing reality television programming, and then relaunched as the more generalized TruTV in 2008. 

Turner Broadcasting later syndicated some of Court TV&#x27;s library to the digital multicast television network Justice Network (which itself rebranded as &quot;True Crime Network&quot; in 2022). In 2018, the rights to the Court TV brand and much of its library was sold to the E. W. Scripps Company, who subsequently relaunched the Court TV brand as a digital multicast television network. 

Streaming services have also carried true crime programming; Netflix experienced success with its 2015 series &quot;Making a Murderer&quot;, leading the service to make further investments into the genre to ride off its popularity.

==== Other prominent documentaries ====
* &quot;Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Making a Murderer&quot; 
* &quot;The Jinx&quot;
* &quot;The Sons of Sam: A Descent Into Darkness&quot;
* &quot;The Keepers&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27;t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer&quot;
* &quot;Evil Genius&quot;

=== Podcasts ===

Podcasts with a true crime theme are a recent trend. The 2014 true crime podcast &quot;Serial&quot; broke podcasting records when it achieved 5 million downloads on iTunes quicker than any previous podcast. As of September 2018, it had been downloaded more than 340 million times. Other notable true crime podcasts have included &quot;Criminal&quot;, &quot;Dirty John, My Favorite Murder, Someone Knows Something,&quot; and &quot;Up and Vanished&quot; among others.

Podcasts have now expanded to more platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and others. Spotify has an expanding number of true crime podcasts with &quot;Rotten Mango&quot;, &quot;Conviction American Panic&quot;, &quot;Bed of Lies&quot;, &quot;Catch &amp; Kill&quot; among many more. This genre has been on the rise as psychologist, Amanda Vicary, said her report found &quot;women were most drawn to true crime stories that gave them tips for spotting danger and staying alive&quot;. Apple Podcasts added a dedicated &quot;True Crime&quot; category in 2019, and until then the podcasts that would be moved into the section had existed across many other categories, such as History, News &amp; Politics, and even Comedy.

It has been speculated that fear could play a role in the popularity of true crime podcasts. These podcasts often recount horrific crimes, which triggers the fear response and the release of adrenaline in the body. Due to the possibility of binge-watching podcasts, adrenaline rushes can be experienced in quick bursts. Another explanation for the popularity of true crime podcasts is due to the serialized nature of crime, in which events happen one after another. Podcasts that explore a crime episodically can utilize this aspect in their storytelling. Another strength of these podcasts is use of typical sensationalist techniques, such as inclusion of direct dialogue and focus on victims and their families. Podcasts can use music or other sound cues to maximize the intended impact or shock value of a fact, as seen in &quot;Serial&quot;.

==== Trends in the United States ====
In the U.S. women are predominantly the consumers of digital true crime podcasts, in 2019 making up around 73% of the content audience. The 2019 Edison Research Report found that at the time of data collection, an estimated 90 million of the U.S. population older than 12 had listened to a podcast in the last month, and of those polled, around 28% were interested in true crime as a topic to listen to in a podcast.

In 2020, true crime podcasts held many of the U.S. top 50 spots for popularity by most listens, with &quot;Crime Junkie&quot; at 3, &quot;My Favorite Murder&quot; at No. 5, and others scattered among the top 50, such as; &quot;Serial&quot; at No. 13, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; at No. 22, and &quot;Criminal&quot; at No. 30. In that year, true crime ranked third overall for genres by listen behind both comedy and news. From November 2019 through May 2022, true crime podcast listening increased the most of the top three genres by percentage gain in listeners, with a 66% gain (from ~12.9 million to ~21.5 million) in current listeners, versus the 44% and 37% gain in listeners by comedy and news respectively.

On Apple Podcasts, True Crime podcasts make up just less than half a percent of the total number of podcasts on the platform. On a collated list of 432 podcasts from the most-visited results of a search for &quot;Top Podcasts of 2021&quot;, true crime podcasts made up more than 20% of the podcasts constituting the lists.

==== Trends in Australia ====
In 2017, as many as 30% of podcast listeners had listened to true crime podcasts, and in 2019, this had increased to up to 44%.

== Impact ==
True crime works can impact the crimes they cover and the audience who consumes it. Also, coverage of true crime events can have a direct effect on the aftermath of the crime and how it is dealt with by authorities or a given community. The Netflix show &quot;Making A Murderer&quot; has had a range of real-life effects, ranging from the show being shown in law schools as instructional material to increased mistrust in criminal investigators. The investigative process of the true crime genre can lead to changes in the cases being covered, such as when Robert Durst seemingly confessed to murder in the documentary &quot;The Jinx&quot; and was arrested.

A study conducted in 2011, in Nebraska, showed that consuming non-fiction crime shows is correlated with an increased fear of being a victim of crime. As the frequency of watching true crime shows increased, support for the death penalty increased, while support for the criminal justice system decreased. In Australia, the amount of reports given to the crime reporting network Crime Stoppers Australia that led to charges being pressed doubled from 2012 to 2017. This increased interest in crime is attributed to popular true crime podcasts.

The true crime genre has been criticized as being disrespectful to crime victims and their families and is described by some as trash culture. Author Jack Miles believes this genre has a high potential to cause harm and mental trauma to the real people involved. True crime media can be produced without the consent of the victim&#x27;s family, which can lead to them being re-traumatized. Recent discussions about the consumption of true crime media have also focused on the impact on the audience&#x27;s mental health.

Depending on the writer, true crime can adhere strictly to well-established facts in journalistic fashion or can be highly speculative. Writers can selectively choose which information to present and which to leave out in order to support their narrative. Artists have offered fact-based narratives blending fiction and historical reenactment. Author Christiana Gregoriou analyzed several books of the genre and concluded that tabloidization and fictionalization are pervasive in the works of some of the authors of true crime literature. In some cases, even books by the same author disagree on specifics about the same killer or events. For instance, some facts reported in Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; were challenged in 2013. Capote&#x27;s second attempt at a true crime book, &quot;Handcarved Coffins&quot; (1979), despite being subtitled &quot;Nonfiction Account of an American Crime&quot;, was already noted for containing significant fictional elements.

<text>Draco is a constellation in the far northern sky. Its name is Latin for dragon. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. The north pole of the ecliptic is in Draco. Draco is circumpolar from northern latitudes, meaning that it never sets and can be seen at any time of year.

== Features ==
=== Stars ===
Thuban (α Draconis) was the northern pole star from 3942 BC, when it moved farther north than Theta Boötis, until 1793 BC. The Egyptian Pyramids were designed to have one side facing north, with an entrance passage geometrically aligned so that Thuban would be visible at night. Due to the effects of precession, it will again be the pole star around the year AD 21000. It is a blue-white giant star of magnitude 3.7, 309 light-years from Earth. The traditional name of Alpha Draconis, Thuban, means &quot;head of the serpent&quot;.

There are three stars above magnitude 3 in Draco. The brighter of the three, and the brightest star in Draco, is Gamma Draconis, traditionally called Etamin or Eltanin. It is an orange giant star of magnitude 2.2, 148 light-years from Earth. The aberration of starlight was discovered in 1728 when James Bradley observed Gamma Draconis. Nearby Beta Draconis, traditionally called Rastaban, is a yellow giant star of magnitude 2.8, 362 light-years from Earth. Its name shares a meaning with Thuban, &quot;head of the serpent&quot;. Draco also features several interacting galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such massive cluster is Abell 2218, located at a distance of 3 billion light-years (redshift 0.171).

Draco is home to several double stars and binary stars. Eta Draconis (traditionally called Athebyne) is a double star with a yellow-hued primary of magnitude 2.8 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.2 located south of the primary. The two are separated by 4.8 arcseconds. Mu Draconis, traditionally called Alrakis, is a binary star with two white components. Magnitude 5.6 and 5.7, the two components orbit each other every 670 years. The Alrakis system is 88 light-years from Earth. Nu Draconis is a similar binary star with two white components, 100 light-years from Earth. Both components are of magnitude 4.9 and can be distinguished in a small amateur telescope or a pair of binoculars. Omicron Draconis is a double star divisible in small telescopes. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 4.6, 322 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 7.8. Psi Draconis (traditionally called Dziban) is a binary star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes, 72 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-white star of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.8. 16 Draconis and 17 Draconis are part of a triple star 400 light-years from Earth, visible in medium-sized amateur telescopes. The primary, a blue-white star of magnitude 5.1, is itself a binary with components of magnitude 5.4 and 6.5. The secondary is of magnitude 5.5 and the system is 400 light-years away. 20 Draconis is a binary star with a white-hued primary of magnitude 7.1 and a yellow-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3 located east-northeast of the primary. The two are separated by 1.2 arcseconds at their maximum and have an orbital period of 420 years. As of 2012, the two components are approaching their maximum separation. 39 Draconis is a triple star 188 light-years from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue star of magnitude 5.0, the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.4, and the tertiary is a star of magnitude 8.0; the tertiary appears to be a close companion to the primary. 40 Draconis and 41 Draconis are a binary star divisible in small telescopes. The two orange dwarf stars are 170 light-years from Earth and are of magnitude 5.7 and 6.1.

R Draconis is a red Mira-type variable star with a period of about 8 months. Its average minimum magnitude is approximately 12.4, and its average maximum magnitude is approximately 7.6. It was discovered to be a variable star by Hans Geelmuyden in 1876.

The constellation contains the star recently named Kepler-10, which has been confirmed to be orbited by Kepler-10b.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
One of the deep-sky objects in Draco is the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), a planetary nebula approximately 3,000 light-years away that was discovered by English astronomer William Herschel in 1786. It is 9th magnitude and was named for its appearance in the Hubble Space Telescope, though it appears as a fuzzy blue-green disk in an amateur telescope. NGC 6543 has a very complex shape due to gravitational interactions between the components of the multiple star at its center, the progenitor of the nebula approximately 1,000 years ago. It is located 9.6 arcminutes away from the north ecliptic pole to the west-northwest. It is also related to IC 4677, a nebula that appears as a bar 1.8 arcminutes to the west of the Cat&#x27;s Eye nebula. In long-term exposures, IC 4677 appears as a portion of a ring surrounding the planetary nebula.

There are several faint galaxies in Draco, one of which is the lenticular galaxy NGC 5866 (sometimes considered to be Messier Object 102) that bears its name to a small group that also includes the spiral galaxies NGC 5879 and NGC 5907. Another is the Draco Dwarf Galaxy, one of the least luminous galaxies with an absolute magnitude of −8.6 and a diameter of only about 3,500 light years, discovered by Albert G. Wilson of Lowell Observatory in 1954. Another dwarf galaxy found in this constellation is PGC 39058. 

Draco also features several interacting galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such massive cluster is Abell 2218, located at a distance of 3 billion light-years (redshift 0.171). It acts as a gravitational lens for even more distant background galaxies, allowing astronomers to study those galaxies as well as Abell 2218 itself; more specifically, the lensing effect allows astronomers to confirm the cluster&#x27;s mass as determined by x-ray emissions. One of the most well-known interacting galaxies is Arp 188, also called the &quot;Tadpole Galaxy&quot;. Named for its appearance, which features a &quot;tail&quot; of stars 280,000 light-years long, the Tadpole Galaxy is at a distance of 420 million light-years (redshift 0.0314). The tail of stars drawn off the Tadpole Galaxy appears blue because the gravitational interaction disturbed clouds of gas and sparked star formation.

Q1634+706 is a quasar that holds the distinction of being the most distant object usually visible in an amateur telescope. At magnitude 14.4, it appears star-like, though it is at a distance of 12.9 billion light-years. The light of Q1634+706 has taken 8.6 billion years to reach Earth, a discrepancy attributable to the expansion of the universe.

The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, possibly the largest known structure in the universe, covers a part of the southern region of Draco.

=== Mythology ===

&quot;Draco&quot; (also known as ) is one of the 48 constellations listed in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; (2nd century), adopted from the list by Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th century BC).

Draco was identified with several different dragons in Greek mythology. Gaius Julius Hyginus in &quot;De Astronomica&quot; reports that it was one of the Gigantes, who battled the Olympian gods for ten years in the Gigantomachy, before the goddess Athena killed it and tossed it into the sky upon his defeat. As Athena threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold north celestial pole before it could right itself. Aelius Aristides names him Aster or Asterius (&#x27;star&#x27; or &#x27;starry&#x27;) and says that Athens&#x27; Great Panathenaea festival celebrated Athena&#x27;s victory over him. The festival coincided with the culmination of the constellation&#x27;s head as seen from the Athenian Acropolis.

The &quot;Catasterismi&quot; attributed to Eratosthenes identify Draco as Ladon, the dragon who guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides. When Heracles was tasked with stealing the golden apples during his twelve labors, he killed Ladon and Hera transformed Ladon into a constellation. In the sky, Hercules is depicted with one foot on the head of Draco. Sometimes, Draco is represented as the monstrous son of Gaia, Typhon.

Traditional Arabic astronomy does not depict a dragon in modern-day Draco, which is called the Mother Camels. Instead, two hyenas, represented by Eta Draconis and Zeta Draconis are seen attacking a baby camel (a dim star near Beta Draconis), which is protected by four female camels, represented by Beta Draconis, Gamma Draconis, Nu Draconis, and Xi Draconis. The nomads who own the camels are camped nearby, represented by a cooking tripod composed of Upsilon, Tau, and Sigma Draconis. However Arabic astronomers also knew of the Greek interpretation of the constellation, referring to it in Arabic as &quot;At-Tinnin&quot; (, &#x27;the dragon&#x27;), which is the source of the formal name of Gamma Draconis, Eltanin, from &quot;raʾs al-tinnīn&quot; (&#x27;the head of the dragon&#x27;).

=== Meteor showers ===
The October Draconids, also called Giacobinids, is a meteor shower associated with the periodic comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. The shower peaks on 8 October and it has experienced storms in 1933 and 1946, when the zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) was up to 10,000 meteors per hour. Further outbursts were observed in 1985, 1998, and 2011. During the 2011 outburst, ZHR reached 400 meteors/hour, however it was largely unnoticed visually due to interference by the bright Moon.

The February Eta Draconids is a meteor shower that was discovered on February 4, 2011. Observers noted six meteors with a common radiant in a short period. Its parent is a previously unknown long-period comet.

== Namesakes ==
&quot;Draco&quot; was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the constellation. 

The main character in the 1996 film &quot;Dragonheart&quot; gets his name from this constellation. The film also reveals that Draco is actually a dragon heaven, where dragons go when their time in this world is complete, if they have upheld the oath of an ancient dragon to guard mankind, with dragons otherwise fading into nothing upon their deaths. At the conclusion of the film, Draco, the last dragon, ascends into the constellation after he sacrifices himself to destroy an evil king.

The Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense chess opening was also named after the constellation by Russian chess master Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky.

Draco Malfoy, an antagonist in the Harry Potter series, is named after the constellation as well.

<text>The Leslie speaker is a combined amplifier and loudspeaker that projects the signal from an electric or electronic instrument and modifies the sound by rotating a baffle chamber (&quot;drum&quot;) in front of the loudspeakers. A similar effect is provided by a rotating system of horns in front of the treble driver. It is most commonly associated with the Hammond organ, though it was later used for the electric guitar and other instruments. A typical Leslie speaker contains an amplifier, a treble horn and a bass speaker—though specific components depend upon the model. A musician controls the Leslie speaker by either an external switch or pedal that alternates between a slow and fast speed setting, known as &quot;chorale&quot; and &quot;tremolo&quot;.

The speaker is named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, who began working in the late 1930s to get a speaker for a Hammond organ that better emulated a pipe or theatre organ, and discovered that baffles rotating along the axis of the speaker cone gave the best sound effect. Hammond was not interested in marketing or selling the speakers, so Leslie sold them himself as an add-on, targeting other organs as well as Hammond. Leslie made the first speaker in 1941. The sound of the organ being played through his speaker received national radio exposure across the US, and it became a commercial and critical success. It soon became an essential tool for most jazz organists. In 1965, Leslie sold his business to CBS who, in 1980, sold it to Hammond. Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation subsequently acquired the Hammond and Leslie brands.

Because the Leslie is a sound modification device in its own right, various attempts have been made to simulate the effect using electronic effect units. These include the Uni-Vibe, the Neo Ventilator, or Hammond-Suzuki&#x27;s own simulator in a box.

==History==
Leslie worked as a radio service engineer at Barker Brothers Department Store in Los Angeles, which sold and repaired Hammond organs. He bought one in 1937, hoping it would be a suitable substitute for a pipe organ. He was disappointed, however, with the sound in his home compared to the large showroom where he originally heard it. Consequently, he attempted to design a speaker to overcome this. He initially tried making a cabinet similar to Hammond&#x27;s, but soon concluded that pipe organs produced a spatially varied sound because of the different location of each pipe. He set out to emulate this by making a moving speaker. He tried various combinations of speakers and speeds, and discovered that a single one running at what&#x27;s now known as the &quot;tremolo&quot; speed worked best. After further experimentation, he decided that splitting the signal into a rotating drum and horn helped accentuate bass and treble frequencies.

By 1940, Leslie decided his prototype was ready to market, and went to the Hammond Organ Company to demonstrate it. Laurens Hammond, however, was not impressed with Leslie&#x27;s attempt to better his own organ design, and declined to market it. The company even changed the speaker interface on their organs to make them &quot;Leslie-proof,&quot; though Leslie quickly worked around this. Leslie began manufacturing the speaker in 1941—initially under a variety of names, including &quot;Vibratone&quot;, &quot;Brittain Speakers&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Speakers&quot;, and &quot;Crawford Speakers&quot;. He returned to the name &quot;Leslie Vibratone&quot; in 1947. To counteract Hammond&#x27;s slogan &quot;Music&#x27;s Most Glorious Voice,&quot; Leslie added a similar slogan, &quot;Pipe Voice of the Electric Organ&quot; to the plates. He eventually owned nearly 50 patents on the speaker.

Leslie manufactured the speaker to work with other organs besides Hammond, including Wurlitzer, Conn, Thomas and Baldwin. He never particularly liked Hammond organs, once remarking &quot;I hate those damn things.&quot;

In 1965, Leslie sold his Electro Music company to CBS, which had also acquired the Fender guitar company. In 1980, the Hammond Corporation finally bought Electro Music and the Leslie name from CBS. After Hammond went out of business in 1986, a former engineer re-established Electro Music, licensing the name from Noel Crabbe, who had acquired the rights to Hammond. It was subsequently sold to Suzuki in 1992, who continue to manufacture the speaker.

==Features==
A Leslie speaker consists of a number of individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, consists of a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a variable speed.

The only control common to all Leslie speakers is a dial that controls the master volume. This is normally set up once and then left, since the organ&#x27;s expression pedal normally controls the volume. Leslie recommended playing the organ at full volume with all stops (drawbars) pulled out and adjusting the volume just before distortion occurs. However, the distorted sound of an overdriven vacuum tube amplifier can be a desirable sound, to the extent that modern Leslie simulators have an explicit &quot;overdrive&quot; setting.

Control of a Leslie speaker is normally catered for by an external two way switch, between two settings marked &quot;chorale&quot; and &quot;tremolo&quot;. The switch is mounted onto the controlling instrument, so the player can easily switch settings. Some earlier models were limited to &quot;off&quot; and &quot;tremolo&quot;, and some later models had all three settings. The switch can be used while notes are being played, and the sound of changing between the two settings is part of the characteristic sound. On both settings, the treble horn rotates slightly faster than the bass woofer; about 50 revolutions per minute (rpm) for &quot;chorale&quot; and 400 rpm for &quot;tremolo&quot;, compared to the woofer&#x27;s 40 rpm and 340 rpm respectively.

Unlike most popular music amplifiers, that use jack plugs to connect to instruments, Leslie speakers use an amphenol connector to interface directly to an organ via a console connector. The type and design of the connector depends on the organ and model of Leslie speaker.

Older models that used tube power amplifiers use a variety of six-pin connectors, while later models use nine-pin connectors. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care is taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.

A separate device, known as the &quot;combo preamp&quot;, is necessary to connect a vintage Leslie to another instrument such as a guitar. This combines a separate AC input and line level input onto a single amphenol connector, and provide a footswitch to select between the speeds of the Leslie. Modern products such as the Trek II UC-1A allow any instrument with a phone jack connection to use a variety of Leslie speakers.

Modern Leslie speakers have 11-pin interfaces that are safer to service, as the mains power is carried separately using standard IEC mains connectors. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in and line out jacks, so a combo preamp is no longer required. Its settings can also be controlled via MIDI.

==Models==

===Single speed===
The initial models of Leslie speakers did not have the &quot;chorale&quot; setting. The control switch was simply a choice between &quot;off&quot; and &quot;tremolo&quot;. The first model of Leslie produced was the 30A. It emulated Hammond&#x27;s DXR-20 tone cabinet, which used moving drums but only produced amplitude modulation, not frequency modulation. It contained a drum and the power amplifier was housed in the top of the unit, to allow easy repair. This was superseded between 1947 and 1949 by the 31H, also known as the &quot;Tall Boy&quot;. It was similar in appearance to the 30A, but contained additional louvres along the top of the cabinet. Also, reflectors were placed on the end of the horn, to allow the treble signal to exit the unit through the sides, rather than on the top.

The next models Leslie produced were the 21H and the 22H, which had a cabinet in a similar styling to the better known 122, with the same dimensions and louvres. They were powered by a 40 watt tube amplifier.

===Dual speed===
The 122 is the most popular Leslie. It was specifically designed for the Hammond organ and is the model most commonly identified with it. It is high, offers two different speeds for &quot;chorale&quot; and &quot;tremolo&quot;, and has a 40 watt tube amplifier. The 122 is the most adaptable to being recorded, as it has a balanced signal which eliminates mains hum and other noise. The 122RV was the same model, but with an additional reverb amplifier, which fed through to a separate static speaker. A slightly smaller version, the 142 was available. Hammond-Suzuki currently manufacture the 122A, a straight reissue of the 122, and the 122XB, which contains a modern 11-pin adapter, an IECC mains adaptor, line-in, and a jack socket for a footswitch to control the speed. This eliminates the need for a combo preamp.

The 147 is the &quot;universal&quot; version of the 122, designed for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and motor speed control, but is otherwise identical. The signal input is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The motor speed switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than the DC voltage control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122&#x27;s lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 is identical to the 147, except that it is housed in a cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond&#x27;s new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66. It contained seven different tab controls and six speakers. It has a completely different interface from other Leslies, using a 12-pin amphenol connector.

===Pro-Line===
By the late 1960s, gigging musicians were finding that older Leslies like the 122 were not loud enough for large venues, which led to the introduction of the &quot;Pro Line&quot; series. These Leslies had louder solid-state power amplifiers, and were mounted on casters for ease of portability. The first models Leslie manufactured were the 900 and 910, which contained a 100 watt, three-channel power amplifier. Both could split into two sections. The most popular version of the Pro-Line series was the 760. It was a smaller version of the 900 and 910, and contained a 40 watt treble and 50 watt bass amplifier. A smaller, more portable version of the 760 is the 820. It is a solid-state cabinet like the 760, and it connects to the organ with a 9-pin connector as well. However, it is only high and has only a single rotor with a full-range 12-inch speaker.

The Pro-Line series was durable and fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used solid-state amplifiers, they are not as highly regarded as the older tube-based Leslies, because they lack the characteristic sound when the amp is overdriven.

The smallest Leslie is the Model 16, made in 1970. It has a Fender-like speaker body and a rotating foam dispersion block. It was built for guitarists, portable, and had &quot;Leslie&quot; written on the front. It contained just a single 10-inch speaker, and was designed to be powered by an external amplifier, and contained an additional output for an extension speaker. Control of the speaker was via two switches, one of which controlled the speed and one switched the rotors on and off. It was also released later as the Fender Vibratone.

===Hammond-Suzuki===
As well as the 122A and 147A reissues, Hammond-Suzuki now makes smaller and transportable Leslies using modern technology. The 2101 is high and has a rotating horn as found on the 122 and 147, along with a pair of compression drivers and two woofers. The unit provides two separate inputs so different instruments can be plugged into the rotary and stationary components respectively. The 2121 is a stationary speaker that uses digital signal processing to emulate the rotating drum found in older Leslies. The 3300 is the same as the 2121, but with a 300 watt power amplifier.

==Sound generation==

The Leslie is specifically designed, via reproduction of the Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie&#x27;s rotor, a special brake circuit was added to the Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.

Much of the Leslie&#x27;s unique tone is due to the fact that the system is at least partially enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800 Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie&#x27;s sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie&#x27;s tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors—not merely by the spinning of rotors.

==Miking==
Because a Leslie speaker modifies as well as amplifies the sound, the output cannot simply be connected to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these is connected to the PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed on opposite sides of the horn and a single microphone on the drum.

Miking a Leslie is also important in a recording studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s on the horn and a Sennheiser MD 421 on the drum. Recording Magazine&#x27;s Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and the drum, but with the covers removed.

==Clones and simulations==
While the Leslie speaker is still made and sold, similar effects can now be obtained via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend not to be in good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.

Most modern keyboards that emulate the Hammond organ also include a Leslie simulator, including Hammond&#x27;s own XK-3c and the Nord Electro. However, there is still a market for standalone simulators. Hughes &amp; Kettner&#x27;s Rotosphere has received good reviews for accurately producing the sound of a Leslie speaker with a tube amplifier. The Neo Ventilator has been particularly praised for its accuracy in emulating the sound of a Leslie. &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;″s Mark Ashfield described it as &quot;quite simply the best Leslie speaker simulator to date&quot;, while a &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; reviewer was &quot;blown away by how authentic the Ventilator sounds&quot;. In 2013, Hammond-Suzuki started manufacturing their own Leslie simulator in a stomp box. California based company Strymon released the Lex pedal, a rotary speaker emulator pedal, suitable for a variety of applications, including guitar.

==Notable users==

===Early adopters===
Leslie never advertised his speakers. After demonstrating a prototype with Bob Mitchell, an organist with radio station KFI in Los Angeles, a contract was made to install another prototype in the station&#x27;s studios, where Mitchell would be the only organist authorized to use it. Mitchell was so impressed that he tried to patent the speaker, but discovered that he could not. Soon afterwards, Mitchell became an organist with the Mutual Broadcasting System, and played a Hammond with the Leslie on its shows, ensuring national exposure for the sound. The Leslie was subsequently a standard component of several notable jazz organists, including Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Shirley Scott. Graham Bond was the first notable British organist to play a Hammond through a Leslie.

===Pioneering usages===
Although the Beatles are often credited as such, they were not the first to experiment with processing other sounds through a Leslie speaker. Producer Lou Adler had been experimenting with the technique as early as 1963, and one of the first recordings to feature vocals recorded through a Leslie speaker was the 1964 single &quot;She Rides with Me&quot;, written by Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson and performed by singer Paul Petersen. According to Petersen, &quot;I got a call from Lou Adler on New Years Eve 1963 in Las Vegas. He asked me to come to LA right away to cut a Brian Wilson song. When I got to RCA&#x27;s studio, the track had already been cut by Brian. The only people there were Lou and two engineers. Lou rigged up the Leslie organ sound for the vocals, and that was it.&quot; Adler also used the effect on the simultaneously released &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; by Shelley Fabares. Wilson himself used the effect on the guitar sound for the Beach Boys&#x27; July 1965 song &quot;You&#x27;re So Good to Me&quot;.

Although &quot;She Rides with Me&quot; was not a hit record, Leslie-processed sounds soon became a prominent feature of psychedelic music. The Beatles first recorded with a Leslie in June 1965 when George Harrison was overdubbing one of his lead guitar parts on &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;. According to author Andy Babiuk, the band&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (1966) marked the first time that a vocal was recorded using a microphone wired directly into the input of a Leslie, after John Lennon had asked for his voice to sound &quot;as though I&#x27;m the Dalai Lama singing from the highest mountain top&quot;. They went on to use a Leslie throughout the sessions for &quot;Revolver&quot; in 1966.

The Beatles inspired others to use the speaker. Harrison played through a Leslie in his guest appearance on Cream&#x27;s song &quot;Badge&quot; (1969), and Richard Wright used a similar setup when recording with Pink Floyd.

<doc id="284872" wikidata="Q3034620" url="?curid=284872" title="Psophodidae">
<text>Psophodidae is a family of passerine birds native to Australia and nearby areas. It has a complicated taxonomic history and different authors vary in which birds they include in the family. In the strictest sense, it includes only the five or six species of whipbirds and wedgebills (&quot;Psophodes&quot; and &quot;Androphobus&quot;), but some authors also include the quail-thrushes (&quot;Cinclosoma&quot;), eight species of ground-dwelling birds found in Australia and New Guinea, and the jewel-babblers (&quot;Ptilorrhoa&quot;), three or four species found in rainforest in New Guinea. Others place them in their own family, the Cinclosomatidae. The Malaysian rail-babbler (&quot;Eupetes macrocerus&quot;) was formerly sometimes placed in this family, which would then be called Eupetidae.

==Taxonomy==
The quail-thrushes, jewel-babblers, whipbirds and wedgebills were traditionally included with the logrunners (&quot;Orthonyx&quot;) in the family Orthonychidae. Sometimes the Malaysian rail-babbler and blue-capped ifrit (&quot;Ifrita kowaldi&quot;) were also included in the family. In 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the logrunners were not related to the others and included only the logrunners in the Orthonychidae. They treated the others as the subfamily Cinclosomatinae within their expanded family Corvidae.

A number of authors later treated the quail-thrushes and allies as the family Cinclosomatidae, a name first coined by Gregory Mathews in 1921–1922. However, if the whipbirds are included in the family, the older name Psophodidae has priority. If the Malaysian rail-babbler is also included, the name Eupetidae has priority.

The Malaysian rail-babbler has now been shown to be unrelated to the others, probably being an early offshoot of the Passerida. Another study found the quail-thrushes and jewel-babblers to be related to each other but did not show them to have a close relationship with &quot;Psophodes&quot; or &quot;Ifrita&quot;.

==Description==
Whipbirds and wedgebills are 19–31 cm long. They are mainly olive-green or brown in colour and have a crest.

==Distribution and habitat==
The whipbirds and wedgebills are all found in Australia, occurring in a range of habitats from rainforest to arid scrub. The western whipbird is considered to be near-threatened because of habitat loss and fires while the Papuan whipbird is classed as data deficient.

==Behaviour==

They are terrestrial birds which fly fairly weakly and prefer to squat or run when disturbed. They forage on the ground feeding mainly on insects and other invertebrates. In the desert, quail-thrushes also eat some seeds.

They build a cup-shaped nest among shrubs or on the ground. Two or three eggs are laid.

<text>A carousel or carrousel (mainly North American English), merry-go-round (international), Galloper (international) or roundabout (British English) is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The &quot;seats&quot; are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music.

Carousels are commonly populated with horses, each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs (45 kg), but may include a variety of mounts, for example pigs, zebras, tigers, or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns. Sometimes, chair-like or bench-like seats are used, and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars.

The names &quot;roundabout&quot;, &quot;carousel&quot; and &quot;merry-go-round&quot; are also used, in varying dialects, to refer to a distinct piece of playground equipment.

==History==

===Early carousels===
The modern carousel emerged from early jousting traditions in Europe and the Middle East. Knights would gallop in a circle while tossing balls from one to another; an activity that required great skill and horsemanship. This game was introduced to Europe at the time of the Crusades from earlier Byzantine and Arab traditions. The word carousel originated from the Italian &quot;Carosella&quot; and Spanish &quot;Carosella&quot; (&quot;little battle&quot;, used by crusaders to describe a combat preparation exercise and game played by Turkish and Arabian horsemen in the 12th century). This early device was essentially a cavalry training mechanism; it prepared and strengthened the riders for actual combat as they wielded their swords at the mock enemies.

By the 17th century, balls were no longer used, and instead, the riders had to spear small rings that were hanging from poles overhead and rip them off. Cavalry spectacles that replaced medieval jousting, such as the ring tilt, were popular in Italy and France. The game began to be played by commoners, and carousels soon sprung up at fairgrounds across Europe. At the Place du Carrousel in Paris, an early make-believe carousel was set up with wooden horses for the children.

Another kind of carousel emerged in the 17th century in Belgium and France to celebrate special events. This was a ceremonial parade of knights and noblemen on horseback around a courtyard, accompanied by tournaments and various equestrian demonstrations and games, including the spearing of cardboard heads of &quot;Moors&quot; and &quot;Saracens&quot;. The most famous carousel of this kind was held by Louis XIV in June 1662, in the courtyard of the Tuileries Palace, to celebrate the birth of his son and heir. The site of the event, next to the Louvre, is still known as &quot;the Carrousel&quot;.

By the early 18th century carousels were being built and operated at various fairs and gatherings in central Europe and England. Animals and mechanisms would be crafted during the winter months and the family and workers would go touring in their wagon train through the region, operating their large menagerie carousel at various venues. Makers included Heyn in Germany and Bayol in France. These early carousels had no platforms; the animals would hang from chains and fly out from the centrifugal force of the spinning mechanism. They were often powered by animals walking in a circle or people pulling a rope or cranking.

By 1803 John Joseph Merlin had a carousel in his Mechanical Museum in London, where gentry and nobility liked to gather on winter evenings. The horses &quot;floated free over a pole&quot;. It was connected to a &quot;big musical instrument that played a fully orchestrated concerto&quot; and from the first note, the carousel would start turning while each horse would make a galloping movement with a visitor riding on its back. Merlin did not patent his inventions and engineers were allowed to come to create their own models of his creations.

===Direction of rotation===

Viewed from above, and from the riders&#x27; point of view, in the United Kingdom, merry-go-rounds, called &quot;gallopers&quot; by the showmen community when populated by model horses, usually turn from the left to the right or clockwise (from the outside, or from the spectators&#x27; point of view, animals face to the left and the carousel apparently turns from the right to the left, the spectators&#x27; sense of clockwise ), while in North America and Mainland Europe, carousels typically go counterclockwise, that is, from right to left (from the spectators&#x27; point of view, animals face to the right and the carousel is seen as turning from left to right, the spectators&#x27; sense of counterclockwise).

===Modern carousels===
By the mid-19th century, the platform carousel was developed; the animals and chariots were fixed to a circular floor that would suspend from a centre pole and rotate around. These carousels were called dobbies and were operated manually by the operator or by ponies.

In mid-19th-century England, the carousel became a popular fixture at fairs. The first steam-powered mechanical roundabout, invented by Thomas Bradshaw, appeared at the Pot Market fair in Bolton in about 1861. It was described by a &quot;Halifax Courier&quot; journalist as &quot;a roundabout of huge proportions, driven by a steam engine which whirled around with such impetuosity, that the wonder is the daring riders are not shot off like cannonball, and driven half into the middle of next month.&quot;

Soon afterwards, English engineer Frederick Savage began to branch out of agricultural machinery production into the construction of fairground machines, swiftly becoming the chief innovator in the field. Savage&#x27;s fairground machinery was exported all over the world. By 1870, he was manufacturing carousels with Velocipedes (an early type of bicycle) and he soon began experimenting with other possibilities, including a roundabout with boats that would pitch and roll on cranks with a circular motion, a ride he called &#x27;Sea-on-Land&#x27;.

Savage applied a similar innovation to the more traditional mount of the horse; he installed gears and offset cranks on the platform carousels, thus giving the animals their well-known up-and-down motion as they travelled around the centre pole – the galloping horse. The platform served as a position guide for the bottom of the pole and as a place for people to walk or other stationary animals or chariots to be placed. He called this ride the &#x27;Platform Gallopers&#x27;. He also developed the &#x27;platform-slide&#x27; which allowed the mounts to swing out concentrically as the carousel built up speed. Fairground organs (band organs) were often present (if not built-in) when these machines operated. Eventually electric motors were installed and electric lights added, giving the carousel its classic look.

These mechanical innovations came at a crucial time, when increased prosperity meant that more people had time for leisure and spare money to spend on entertainment. It was in this historical context that the modern fairground ride was born, with Savage supplying this new market demand. In his 1902 Catalogue for Roundabouts he claimed to have &quot;... patented and placed upon the market all the principal novelties that have delighted the many thousands of pleasure seekers at home and abroad.&quot;

In the United States, the carousel industry was developed by immigrants, notably Gustav Dentzel of Germany and Charles W.F. Dare from England, from the late 19th century. Several centres and styles for the construction of carousels emerged in the United States:
* Coney Island style – characterized by elaborate and sometimes faux-jeweled saddles, as well as mirrors to catch and reflect lights. This style was pioneered by Charles I. D. Looff.
* Philadelphia style – known for more realistically painted saddles, this style was pioneered by Dentzel and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company.
* Country Fair style – often with no saddles at all, this style was pioneered Allan Herschell and Edward Spillman of western New York, and Charles W. Parker of Kansas.

The golden age of the carousel in America was the early 20th century, with large machines and elaborate animals, chariots, and decorations being built.

==Antique and notable carousels==
The National Carousel Association maintains a list of Historic Carousel Award winners, primarily focused on carousels in Canada and the USA.

=== Pre-1869 ===
=== 1870–1879 ===
=== 1880–1889 ===
=== 1890–1899 ===
=== 1900–1909 ===
=== 1910–1919 ===
=== 1920–1929 ===
=== 1930–1939 ===
* The King Arthur Carrousel has existed since 1922 and was moved to Disneyland in 1954. It is an assembly of two carousels. Walt Disney wanted it to have four courses of all jumpers. The remaining chariot woodwork was repurposed as the &quot;Calliope&quot; tenders of &quot;Casey Jr. Circus Train&quot; powered gravity coaster.

=== 1940–1949 ===
* The carousel at Harper Motors is an iconic landmark on the North Coast of California. It was bought by the dealerships owner Harvey Harper in 1991, after purchase this 1947 Allan Herschell Carousel was shipped to Oakland by train and drive to Eureka in a semi-truck. It took a year to assemble on site. It was refurbished and repainted in 2013 which caused the ride to be closed for a month. It is open daily free of charge to the public from 12–4 except on holidays and when inclement weather doesn&#x27;t allow for riders.

=== Unique and record breaking ===
* The carousel at Phantasialand in Germany is one of the biggest in the world, made by Preston &amp; Barbieri one historical amusement ride factory in Italy.
* The world&#x27;s only two-row stationary carousel built from an original Dentzel blueprint left in existence, the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel and Shelter Building, is located in Highland Park in Meridian, Mississippi.
* In May 2005, William Henry Dentzel III, built the world&#x27;s first solar-powered carousel. The carousel operates during Solfest at the Solar Living Institute in Hopland, California.
* There is only one carousel in the world that rides in a waving motion – &quot;Over the Jumps: The Arkansas Carousel&quot; in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is also the only remaining wooden track carousel built by the Herschell &amp; Spillman Company, and one of only four track carousels still in existence.
* The carousel at Conneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania is the last T.M. Harton Carousel that is still in operation and its Artizan band organ is one of two known of the same model in the world.
* In 2007, SeaWorld Orlando opened Sea Carousel, Florida&#x27;s first aquatic carousel.
* In 2012, Buttonwood Park Zoo opened an Americana carousel by Chance Rides.
* In 2013, Palm Beach International Equestrian Center opened a Bertazzon Venetian Carousel as part of the Winter Equestrian Festival (the first carousel to be used in events besides South Florida Fair and the first Palm Beach County carousel built by Bertazzon)
* Binghamton, New York is considered the &quot;Carousel Capital of the World&quot; for the six original carousels in the Triple Cities area, donated by George F. Johnson, owner of the Endicott-Johnson Company early in the 20th century. These carousels, manufactured by the Allen Hershell Company in the &quot;country fair&quot; style, were donated with the express stipulation that they would never charge admission for anyone to ride them. Apparently when Mr. Johnson was a child he was frequently too poor to ride the local carousel and he vowed this would never happen to another child in the area. The carousel at the Ross park zoo in Binghamton, NY does charge admission, in a way, as it requires the child to drop one piece of litter found in the park into a trash barrel in order to ride. This is all written on a plaque at the entrance to the carousel.

* The two double-decker Columbia Carousels built by Chance Rides and located at Six Flags Great America and California&#x27;s Great America are the two tallest carousels in the world.
* The Merry-Go-Round at Bear Mountain State Park in New York, features hand-painted scenes of the Park and 42 hand-carved seats of native animals including a black bear, a wild turkey, a deer, a raccoon, a skunk, a Canada goose, a fox, a swan, a bobcat, a rabbit, and more.
* On Canada Day 2016, a new attraction was opened in Downtown Markham, Ontario. The Pride of Canada Carousel was commissioned by Christopher Bratty, current president of the real estate and development firm The Remington Group. The carousel was produced and originally envisioned by Shelley M. Shier of Broadway Bound Fine Arts and Entertainment for The Remington Group. The carousel sits inside a glass pavillon designed by Sheldon Levitt from Quardrangle Architects. The carousel itself features 44 ride-able reusable material sculptures representing different elements of Canadian culture. It was designed by artist Patrick Amiot who worked with the Brass Ring Carousel Company to build the ride.
* Ice floe carousels have been constructed on frozen lakes. For example, in 2017 an ice carousel was made in Finland. It was constructed by cutting the ice in a circle with a chainsaw.
==In popular culture==

* In &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, Mary, Bert, and the children ride a merry-go-round, then leave the carousel on their horses to go off on a fox hunt and a horse race.
* In the film &quot;Charade&quot;, near the end, there is a scene where appears a carousel in the background with the music of the main theme, a Parisian waltz composed by Henry Mancini (Charade carousel) played with bells.
* In the film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, the residents of a domed city of the future are doomed to die on their 30th birthday, unless they can be &quot;renewed&quot; in a ritual known as &quot;carousel&quot;.
* In &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; by Ray Bradbury, the carnival&#x27;s steam carousel can cause riders to become younger or older depending on the direction, left and right in which they ride.

<text>Foday Saybana Sankoh (17 October 1937 – 29 July 2003) was a Sierra Leonean rebel leader who was the founder and commander of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group, which was supported by Charles Taylor-led NPFL in the 11-year-long Sierra Leone Civil War, starting in 1991 and ending in 2002. An estimated 50,000 people were killed during the war, and over 500,000 people were displaced in neighboring countries.

==Early life and career==
Sankoh attended primary and secondary school in Magburaka, Tonkolili District and took on a number of jobs in Magburaka before he joined the Sierra Leone army in 1956. He undertook training in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. In 1971, then a corporal in the Sierra Leone army, he was cashiered from the army&#x27;s signal corps and imprisoned for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown for failing to inform authorities of an ultimately unsuccessful coup attempt against Siaka Stevens by his former ally John Amadu Bangura.

On his release he worked as an itinerant photographer in the south and east of Sierra Leone, eventually coming in contact with young radicals.

Sankoh and confederates Rashid Mansaray and Abu Kanu solicited support for an armed uprising to oust the APC government. They then traveled to Liberia, where they reportedly continued recruiting and served with Charles G. Taylor&#x27;s National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL).

==Civil war==

On 23 March 1991, the RUF, led by Foday Sankoh and backed by Charles Taylor, launched its first attack in villages in Kailahun District in the diamond-rich Eastern Province of Sierra Leone.

The RUF became notorious for brutal practices such as mass rapes and amputations during the civil war. Sankoh personally ordered many operations, including one called &quot;Operation Pay Yourself&quot; that encouraged troops to loot anything they could find. After complaining about such tactics, Kanu and Mansaray were summarily executed.

In March 1997, Sankoh fled to Nigeria, where he was put under house arrest and then imprisoned. From this time until Sankoh&#x27;s release in 1999, Sam Bockarie performed the task of director of military operations of the RUF. During the ten-year war, Sankoh broke several promises to stop fighting, including the Abidjan Peace Accord and the Lomé Peace Accord signed in 1999. Eventually the United Kingdom and ECOMOG intervened with their own small, but professional, military forces, and the RUF was eventually crushed.

=== Arrest and charges ===
Sankoh was later arrested on 17 May 2000 after his soldiers gunned down a number of protesters, killing 19 people, including journalist Saoman Conteh, outside his Freetown home on 8 May 2000. His arrest led to massive celebrations throughout Sierra Leone.

Sankoh was handed to the British. Under the jurisdiction of a UN-backed court, he was indicted on 17 counts for various war crimes, including use of child soldiers and crimes against humanity, including genocide, enslavement, rape and sexual slavery.

==Death==
Sankoh died in hospital of complications arising from a stroke whilst awaiting trial on the night of 29 July 2003. In a statement by the UN-backed war crimes court, chief prosecutor David Crane said that Sankoh&#x27;s death granted him &quot;a peaceful end that he denied to so many others&quot;.
