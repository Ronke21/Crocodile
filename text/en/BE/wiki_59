<text>A séance or seance (; ) is an attempt to communicate with spirits. The word &quot;séance&quot; comes from the French word for &quot;session&quot;, from the Old French , &quot;to sit&quot;. In French, the word&#x27;s meaning is quite general and mundane: one may, for example, speak of &quot;&quot; (). In English, however, the word came to be used specifically for a meeting of people who are gathered to receive messages from ghosts or to listen to a spirit medium discourse with or relay messages from spirits. In modern English usage, participants need not be seated while engaged in a séance.

Fictionalised conversations between the deceased appeared in &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; by George, First Baron Lyttelton, published in England in 1760. Among the notable spirits quoted in this volume are Peter the Great, Pericles, a &quot;North-American Savage&quot;, William Penn, and Christina, Queen of Sweden. The popularity of séances grew dramatically with the founding of the religion of Spiritualism in the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps the best-known series of séances conducted at that time were those of Mary Todd Lincoln who, grieving the loss of her son, organized Spiritualist séances in the White House, which were attended by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln, and other prominent members of society. The 1887 Seybert Commission report marred the credibility of Spiritualism at the height of its popularity by publishing exposures of fraud and showmanship among secular séance leaders. Modern séances continue to be a part of the religious services of Spiritualist, Spiritist, and Espiritismo churches today, where a greater emphasis is placed on spiritual values versus showmanship.

==Varieties==
The term &quot;séance&quot; is used in a few different ways, and can refer to any of four different activities, each with its own social norms and conventions, its own favoured tools, and its own range of expected outcomes.

===Religious===
In the religion of Spiritualism, and the religion of Divine Metaphysics (a federally recognized religious branch out of Spiritualism in the United States), it is generally a part of services to communicate with living personalities in the spirit world. Usually, this is only called &quot;séance&quot; by outsiders; the preferred term for Spiritualists is &quot;receiving messages&quot;. In these sessions, which generally take place in well-lit Spiritualist churches or outdoors at Spiritualist camps (such as Lily Dale in upstate New York or Camp Cassadaga in Florida), an ordained minister or gifted contact medium will relate messages from spirit personalities to those here in the physical form. Generally Spiritualist &quot;message services&quot; or &quot;demonstrations of the continuity of life&quot; are open to the public. Sometimes the medium stands to receive messages and only the sitter is seated; in some churches, the message service is preceded by a &quot;healing service&quot; involving some form of faith healing.

In addition to communicating with the spirits of people who have a personal relationship to congregants, some Spiritual Churches also deal with spirits who may have a specific relationship to the medium or a historic relationship to the body of the church. An example of the latter is the spirit of Black Hawk, a Native American warrior of the Fox tribe who lived during the 19th century. Black Hawk was a spirit who was often contacted by the Spiritualist medium Leafy Anderson and he remains the central focus of special services in the African American Spiritual Churches that she founded.

In the Latin American religion of Espiritismo, which somewhat resembles Spiritualism, séance sessions in which congregants attempt to communicate with spirits are called &quot;misas&quot; (literally &quot;masses&quot;). The spirits addressed in Espiritismo are often those of ancestors or Catholic saints.
===Stage mediumship===
Mediums who give performances on stage of contacting spirits, with audience members seated before them, are not literally holding a séance, because they themselves are not seated; however, this is still called &quot;séance&quot;. One of the foremost early practitioners of this type of contact with the dead was Paschal Beverly Randolph, who worked with the spirits of the relatives of audience members, but was also famed for his ability to contact and deliver messages from ancient seers and philosophers, such as Plato.

===Leader-assisted===
Leader-assisted séances are generally conducted by small groups of people, with participants seated around a table in a dark or semi-dark room. The leader is typically asserted to be a medium and he or she may go into a trance that theoretically allows the spirits to communicate through his or her body, conveying messages to the other participants. Other modes of communication may also be attempted, including psychography or automatic writing, numbered raps, levitation of the table or of spirit trumpets, apports, or even smell. It was thought spirits of the dead resided within the realm of dark and shadow, making the absence of light a necessity to invoke them. Skeptics were unwilling to accept this required condition. Saying,&quot;You would not buy an automobile if it was only presented in the dark.&quot;

This is the type of séance that is most often the subject of shock and scandal when it turns out that the leader is practicing some form of stage magic illusion or using mentalism tricks to defraud clients.

===Informal social===
Among those with an interest in the occult, a tradition has grown up of conducting séances outside of any religious context and without a leader. Sometimes only two or three people are involved, and, if they are young, they may be using the séance as a way to test their understanding of the boundaries between reality and the paranormal. It is in such small séances that the planchette and ouija board are most often utilized.

===Spiritualist===
Here spiritualists and practitioners (psychic and mediums) hold a seance so that all participants speak with various personalities in the spirit world. This held in a seating manner in a circle.

==Tools and techniques==

===Mediumship, trance, and channeling===
Mediumship involves an act where the practitioner attempts to receive messages from spirits of the dead and from other spirits that the practitioner believes exist. Some self-ordained mediums are fully conscious and awake while functioning as contacts; others may slip into a partial or full trance or into an altered state of consciousness. These self-called &quot;trance-mediums&quot; often state that, when they emerge from the trance state, they have no recollection of the messages they conveyed; it is customary for such practitioners to work with an assistant who writes down or otherwise records their words.

===Spirit boards, talking boards, and ouija boards===

Spirit boards, also known as talking boards, or ouija boards (after a well-known brand name) are flat tablets, typically made of wood, Masonite, chipboard, or plastic. On the board are a number of symbols, pictures, letters, numbers and/or words. The board is accompanied by a planchette (French for &quot;little board&quot;), which can take the form of a pointer on three legs or magnifying glass on legs; homemade boards may employ a shot glass as a planchette. A most basic Ouija board would contain simply the alphabet of whatever country the board is being used in, although it is not uncommon for whole words to be added.

The board is used as follows:
One or more of the participants in the séance place one or two fingers on the planchette which is in the middle of the board. The appointed medium asks questions of the spirit(s) with whom they are attempting to communicate.

===Trumpets, slates, tables, and cabinets===
During the latter half of the 19th century, a number of Spiritualist mediums began to advocate the use of specialized tools for conducting séances, particularly in leader-assisted sessions conducted in darkened rooms. &quot;Spirit trumpets&quot; were horn-shaped speaking tubes that were said to magnify the whispered voices of spirits to audible range. &quot;Spirit slates&quot; consisted of two chalkboards bound together that, when opened, were said to reveal messages written by spirits. &quot;Séance tables&quot; were special light-weight tables which were said to rotate, float, or levitate when spirits were present. &quot;Spirit cabinets&quot; were portable closets into which mediums were placed, often bound with ropes, in order to prevent them from manipulating the various aforementioned tools.

==Critical objections==

Scientific skeptics and atheists generally consider both religious and secular séances to be scams, or at least a form of pious fraud, citing a lack of empirical evidence. The exposure of supposed mediums whose use of séance tools derived from the techniques of stage magic has been disturbing to many believers in spirit communication. In particular, the 1870s exposures of the Davenport Brothers as illusionists and the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission brought an end to the first historic phase of Spiritualism. Stage magicians like John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Houdini made a side-line of exposing fraudulent mediums during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1976, M. Lamar Keene described deceptive techniques that he himself had used in séances; however, in the same book, Keene also stated that he still had a firm belief in God, life after death, ESP, and other psychic phenomena. In his 2004 television special &quot;Seance&quot;, magician Derren Brown held a séance and afterwards described some of the tricks used by him (and 19th-century mediums) to create the illusion of paranormal events.

Critics of channeling—including both skeptics and believers—state that since the most commonly reported physical manifestations of channeling are an unusual vocal pattern or abnormal overt behaviors of the medium, it can be quite easily faked by anyone with theatrical talent. Critics of spirit board communication techniques—again including both skeptics and believers—state that the premise that a spirit will move the planchette and spell out messages using the symbols on the board is undermined by the fact that several people have their hands on the planchette, which allows any of them to spell out anything they want without the others knowing. They say that this is a common trick, used on occasions such as teenage sleepover parties, to scare the people present.

Another criticism of spirit board communication involves what is called the ideomotor effect which has been suggested as an automatism, or subconscious mechanism, by which a Ouija-user&#x27;s mind unknowingly guides his hand upon the planchette, hence he will honestly believe he is not moving it, when, in fact, he is. This theory rests on the embedded premise that human beings actually have a &quot;subconscious mind,&quot; a belief not held by all.

The exposures of fraud by tool-using mediums have had two divergent results: skeptics have used historic exposures as a frame through which to view all spirit mediumship as inherently fraudulent, while believers have tended to eliminate the use of tools but continued to practice mediumship in full confidence of its spiritual value to them.

Jews and Christians are taught that it is sinful to attempt to conjure or control spirits in accordance with Deuteronomy 18:9–12.

==Psychology==

Research in anomalistic psychology has revealed the role of suggestion in seances. In a series of fake seance experiments (Wiseman &quot;et al.&quot;. 2003) paranormal believers and disbelievers were suggested by an actor that a table was levitating when, in fact, it remained stationary. After the seance, approximately one third of the participants incorrectly reported that the table had moved. The results showed a greater percentage of believers reporting that the table had moved. In another experiment the believers had also reported that a handbell had moved when it had remained stationary and expressed their belief that the fake seances contained genuine paranormal phenomena. The experiments strongly supported the notion that in the seance room, believers are more suggestible than disbelievers for suggestions that are consistent with their belief in paranormal phenomena.

==Notable mediums, attendees, and debunkers==
===Mediums===
Popular 19th-century trance medium lecturers include Cora Scott Hatch, Achsa W. Sprague, Emma Hardinge Britten (1823–1899), and Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875).

Among the notable people who conducted small leader-assisted séances during the 19th century were the Fox sisters, whose activities included table-rapping, and the Davenport Brothers, who were famous for the spirit cabinet work. Both the Foxes and the Davenports were eventually exposed as frauds.

In the 20th century, notable trance mediums also include Edgar Cayce, Arthur Ford and David Marius Guardino.

===Attendees===

Notable people who have attended séances and professed a belief in Spiritualism include the social reformer Robert Owen; the journalist and pacifist William T. Stead; William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister of Canada for 22 years, who sought spiritual contact and political guidance from his deceased mother, his pet dogs, and the late US President Franklin D. Roosevelt; the journalist and author Lloyd Kenyon Jones; and the physician and author Arthur Conan Doyle.

A number of artists, including abstractionists Hilma af Klint, the Regina Five, and Paulina Peavy have given partial or complete credit for some of their work to spirits that they contacted during seances. Paulina said that &quot;when she painted, she did not have control over her brush, that it moved on its own, and that it was Lacamo (the spirit) who was directing it.&quot;

Scientists who have conducted a search for real séances and believed that contact with the dead is a reality include chemist William Crookes, evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace, inventor of radio Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the telephone Alexander Graham Bell, experimental physicist Oliver Lodge, and inventor of television technology John Logie Baird, who said he had contacted the spirit of inventor Thomas Edison.

===Debunkers===

Among the best-known exposers of fraudulent mediumship acts have been the researchers Frank Podmore of the Society for Psychical Research, Harry Price of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, the professional stage magicians John Nevil Maskelyne (who exposed the Davenport Brothers) and Harry Houdini, who clearly stated that he did not oppose the religion of Spiritualism itself, but only the trickery by phony mediums that was being practiced in the name of the religion.

The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums such as those used in slate-writing, table-turning, trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading and spirit photography. The skeptic Joseph McCabe documented many mediums who had been caught in fraud and the tricks they used in his book &quot;Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?&quot; (1920).

Magicians have a long history of exposing the fraudulent methods of mediumship. Early debunkers included Chung Ling Soo, Henry Evans and Julien Proskauer. Later magicians to reveal fraud were Fulton Oursler, Joseph Dunninger, and Joseph Rinn. The researchers Trevor H. Hall and Gordon Stein have documented the trickery of the medium Daniel Dunglas Home. Tony Cornell exposed a number of fraudulent mediums including Rita Goold and Alec Harris.

<doc id="285904" wikidata="Q3532625" url="?curid=285904" title="Naidu">
<text>Naidu (also spelled Nayudu or Naidoo) is a title used by various social groups in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in India. It is derived from the Telugu word &quot;Nayaka,&quot; which originates from the Sanskrit term &quot;Nayaka,&quot; meaning &quot;protector&quot; or &quot;leader.&quot;

== Etymology and Usage ==

The term Naidu is etymologically related to Naicker in Tamil, Nayaka in Karnataka.

In Coastal Andhra the term Naidu primarily refers to the Kapu caste.

Naidu is both a caste name and a title primarily associated with the Kapu (Telaga/Balija Naidu/Ontari) community, which comprises approximately 18% of the population of Andhra Pradesh. The title &quot;Nayaka&quot; (Naidu) was historically conferred upon individuals from other Telugu-speaking communities, including the Boya, Golla and Kamma castes, particularly in the Chittoor and Nellore regions.

The title was used to denote a village or lineage headman. Various medieval Andhra dynasties, including the Vishnukundins and Chalukyas, as well as the Vijayanagara Empire, conferred the title &quot;Nayaka&quot; or &quot;Nayakudu&quot; upon military commanders, known as Danda-Nayakas (Army Commanders), or leaders of soldier bands.

== Historical Context ==

Originally, the Nayaka title was conferred upon Telugu communities. During the medieval period, the Kakatiya and Vijayanagara kingdoms had several prominent Nayakas from various castes. As the Vijayanagar Empire expanded, the title &quot;Nayaka&quot; was also conferred upon non-Telugu-speaking communities in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka who served in similar capacities. The title continues to be used by multiple communities across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.

The Nayaka title was historically given to warriors who were granted land under the Nayankara system during the Kakatiya dynasty. The system was one of approximately 25 titles used by the Kakatiyas to establish a new political infrastructure, reducing the influence of hereditary regional elites. The Nayankara system was later adopted by the Vijayanagar Empire, where Nayakas or Palayakarrars (Polygars) were granted land on the condition that they provided military service to the king.

== Use of the Naidu Surname ==

Over time, multiple communities adopted the Naidu surname. According to Edgar Thurston in &quot;Castes and Tribes of Southern India&quot; (Vol. 5, p. 138), the title &quot;Naidu&quot; or &quot;Nayudu&quot; was historically used by several Telugu castes in colonial India, including Kapu, Kamma, Balija, Boya, Gavara, Golla, Kalingi, Mudiraj, Velama, Reddy, Telaga, Uppiliyan, and Valmiki.

== Evolution of the Nayaka Title ==

The earliest recorded use of the Nayaka/Danda Nayaka title dates back to the Vishnukundina dynasty, which ruled from the Krishna and Godavari deltas in the 3rd century CE. The usage of this title expanded significantly during the 7th century, particularly with the incursion of the Western Chalukyas into Andhra territory. However, the most widespread use of the title occurred during the Vijayanagar rule, when it became a prominent designation for military and administrative leaders across South India.

In Coastal Andhra and Tamil Nadu the term Naidu primarily refers the Kapu caste.

<text>In mathematics, a fractal dimension is a term invoked in the science of geometry to provide a rational statistical index of complexity detail in a pattern. A fractal pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured. 
It is also a measure of the space-filling capacity of a pattern and tells how a fractal scales differently, in a fractal (non-integer) dimension.

The main idea of &quot;fractured&quot; dimensions has a long history in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by Benoit Mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self-similarity in which he discussed &quot;fractional dimensions&quot;. In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline&#x27;s measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick. There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale, see below.

Ultimately, the term &quot;fractal dimension&quot; became the phrase with which Mandelbrot himself became most comfortable with respect to encapsulating the meaning of the word &quot;fractal&quot;, a term he created. After several iterations over years, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: &quot;to use &quot;fractal&quot; without a pedantic definition, to use &quot;fractal dimension&quot; as a generic term applicable to &quot;all&quot; the variants&quot;.

One non-trivial example is the fractal dimension of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but it is by no means rectifiable: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively by thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore, its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which is often a number between one and two; in the case of the Koch snowflake, it is approximately 1.2619.

== Introduction ==

A fractal dimension is an index for characterizing fractal patterns or sets by quantifying their complexity as a ratio of the change in detail to the change in scale. Several types of fractal dimension can be measured theoretically and empirically (see Fig. 2). Fractal dimensions are used to characterize a broad spectrum of objects ranging from the abstract to practical phenomena, including turbulence, river networks, urban growth, human physiology,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1364/boe.1.000268&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1007/s11682-008-9057-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; medicine, and market trends. The essential idea of &quot;fractional&quot; or &quot;fractal&quot; dimensions has a long history in mathematics that can be traced back to the 1600s, but the terms &quot;fractal&quot; and &quot;fractal dimension&quot; were coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975.

&quot;Fractal dimensions&quot; were first applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms for which the details seemed more important than the gross picture. For sets describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical fractal dimension equals the set&#x27;s familiar Euclidean or topological dimension. Thus, it is 0 for sets describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 for sets describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 for sets describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 for sets describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). But this changes for fractal sets. If the theoretical fractal dimension of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have fractal geometry.

Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index can take non-integer values, indicating that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does. For instance, a curve with a fractal dimension very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves quite like an ordinary line, but a curve with fractal dimension 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface. Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume. This general relationship can be seen in the two images of fractal curves in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 the 32-segment contour in Fig. 2, convoluted and space-filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig. 3, which has a fractal dimension of approximately 1.2619.


The relationship of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling might be taken to mean fractal dimensions measure density, but that is not so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might hope to be able to measure their length and derivative in the same way as with ordinary curves. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary curves lack. The &quot;self-similarity&quot; lies in the infinite scaling, and the &quot;detail&quot; in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is infinite, no matter how close together the two points are, which means that it is impossible to approximate the length of such a curve by partitioning the curve into many small segments. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning that they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be meaningfully characterized by finding their lengths and derivatives. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.

The two fractal curves described above show a type of self-similarity that is exact with a repeating unit of detail that is readily visualized. This sort of structure can be extended to other spaces (e.g., a fractal that extends the Koch curve into 3D space has a theoretical &quot;D&quot; = 2.5849). However, such neatly countable complexity is only one example of the self-similarity and detail that are present in fractals. The example of the coast line of Britain, for instance, exhibits self-similarity of an approximate pattern with approximate scaling. Overall, fractals show several types and degrees of self-similarity and detail that may not be easily visualized. These include, as examples, strange attractors, for which the detail has been described as in essence, smooth portions piling up, the Julia set, which can be seen to be complex swirls upon swirls, and heart rates, which are patterns of rough spikes repeated and scaled in time. Fractal complexity may not always be resolvable into easily grasped units of detail and scale without complex analytic methods, but it is still quantifiable through fractal dimensions.

== History ==
The terms &quot;fractal dimension&quot; and &quot;fractal&quot; were coined by Mandelbrot in 1975, about a decade after he published his paper on self-similarity in the coastline of Britain. Various historical authorities credit him with also synthesizing centuries of complicated theoretical mathematics and engineering work and applying them in a new way to study complex geometries that defied description in usual linear terms. The earliest roots of what Mandelbrot synthesized as the fractal dimension have been traced clearly back to writings about nondifferentiable, infinitely self-similar functions, which are important in the mathematical definition of fractals, around the time that calculus was discovered in the mid-1600s. There was a lull in the published work on such functions for a time after that, then a renewal starting in the late 1800s with the publishing of mathematical functions and sets that are today called canonical fractals (such as the eponymous works of von Koch, Sierpiński, and Julia), but at the time of their formulation were often considered antithetical mathematical &quot;monsters&quot;. These works were accompanied by perhaps the most pivotal point in the development of the concept of a fractal dimension through the work of Hausdorff in the early 1900s who defined a &quot;fractional&quot; dimension that has come to be named after him and is frequently invoked in defining modern fractals.

&quot;See Fractal history for more information&quot;

== Role of scaling ==

The concept of a fractal dimension rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension. As Fig. 4 illustrates, traditional notions of geometry dictate that shapes scale predictably according to intuitive and familiar ideas about the space they are contained within, such that, for instance, measuring a line using first one measuring stick, then another 1/3 its size, will give for the second stick a total length 3 times as many sticks long as with the first. This holds in 2 dimensions as well. If one measures the area of a square, then measures again with a box of side length 1/3 the size of the original, one will find 9 times as many squares as with the first measure. Such familiar scaling relationships can be defined mathematically by the general scaling rule in equation , where the variable formula_1 stands for the number of measurement units (sticks, squares, etc.), formula_2 for the scaling factor, and formula_3 for the fractal dimension:
This scaling rule typifies conventional rules about geometry and dimension referring to the examples above, it quantifies that formula_4 for lines because formula_5 when formula_6, and that formula_7 for squares because formula_8 when formula_9


The same rule applies to fractal geometry but less intuitively. To elaborate, a fractal line measured at first to have one length, when remeasured using a new stick scaled by 1/3 of the old may be 4 times as many scaled sticks long rather than the expected 3 (see Fig. 5). In this case, formula_10 when formula_11 and the value of formula_3 can be found by rearranging equation :
That is, for a fractal described by formula_10, when formula_6, such as the Koch snowflake, formula_15, a non-integer value suggesting that the fractal has a dimension not equal to the space it resides in.

Of note, images shown in this page are not true fractals because the scaling described by formula_3 cannot continue past the point of their smallest component, a pixel. However, the theoretical patterns that the images represent have no discrete pixel-like pieces, but rather are composed of an infinite number of infinitely scaled segments and do indeed have the claimed fractal dimensions.

== &quot;D&quot; is not a unique descriptor ==

As is the case with dimensions determined for lines, squares, and cubes, fractal dimensions are general descriptors that do not uniquely define patterns. The value of &quot;D&quot; for the Koch fractal discussed above, for instance, quantifies the pattern&#x27;s inherent scaling, but does not uniquely describe nor provide enough information to reconstruct it. Many fractal structures or patterns could be constructed that have the same scaling relationship but are dramatically different from the Koch curve, as is illustrated in Fig. 6.
For examples of how fractal patterns can be constructed, see Fractal, Sierpinski triangle, Mandelbrot set, Diffusion-limited aggregation, L-system.

== Fractal surface structures ==

The concept of fractality is applied increasingly in the field of surface science, providing a bridge between surface characteristics and functional properties. Numerous surface descriptors are used to interpret the structure of nominally flat surfaces, which often exhibit self-affine features across multiple length-scales. Mean surface roughness, usually denoted RA, is the most commonly applied surface descriptor, however, numerous other descriptors including mean slope, root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) and others are regularly applied. It is found, however, that many physical surface phenomena cannot readily be interpreted with reference to such descriptors, thus fractal dimension is increasingly applied to establish correlations between surface structure in terms of scaling behavior and performance. The fractal dimensions of surfaces have been employed to explain and better understand phenomena in areas of contact mechanics, frictional behavior, electrical contact resistance and transparent conducting oxides.

== Examples ==
The concept of fractal dimension described in this article is a basic view of a complicated construct. The examples discussed here were chosen for clarity, and the scaling unit and ratios were known ahead of time. In practice, however, fractal dimensions can be determined using techniques that approximate scaling and detail from limits estimated from regression lines over log–log plots of size vs scale. Several formal mathematical definitions of different types of fractal dimension are listed below. Although for compact sets with exact affine self-similarity all these dimensions coincide, in general they are not equivalent:
* Box-counting dimension is estimated as the exponent of a power law:
*: formula_17
* Information dimension considers how the average information needed to identify an occupied box scales with box size (formula_18 is a probability):
*: formula_19
* Correlation dimension is based on formula_20 as the number of points used to generate a representation of a fractal and &quot;g&quot;ε, the number of pairs of points closer than ε to each other:
*: formula_21 
* Generalized, or Rényi dimensions: the box-counting, information, and correlation dimensions can be seen as special cases of a continuous spectrum of generalized dimensions of order α, defined by
*: formula_22
* Higuchi dimension
*: formula_23
* Lyapunov dimension
* Multifractal dimensions: a special case of Rényi dimensions where scaling behaviour varies in different parts of the pattern.
* Uncertainty exponent
* Hausdorff dimension: For any subset formula_24 of a metric space formula_25 and formula_26, the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional &quot;Hausdorff content&quot; of &quot;S&quot; is defined by formula_27 The Hausdorff dimension of &quot;S&quot; is defined by
*: formula_28
* Packing dimension
* Assouad dimension
* Local connected dimension
* Degree dimension describes the fractal nature of the degree distribution of graphs.
* Parabolic Hausdorff dimension

== Estimating from real-world data ==
Many real-world phenomena exhibit limited or statistical fractal properties and fractal dimensions that have been estimated from sampled data using computer-based fractal analysis techniques. 
Practically, measurements of fractal dimension are affected by various methodological issues and are sensitive to numerical or experimental noise and limitations in the amount of data. Nonetheless, the field is rapidly growing as estimated fractal dimensions for statistically self-similar phenomena may have many practical applications in various fields, including astronomy, acoustics, geology and earth sciences, diagnostic imaging,
ecology, electrochemical processes,
image analysis, biology and medicine, neuroscience,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.12688/f1000research.6590.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; network analysis, physiology, physics, and Riemann zeta zeros. Fractal dimension estimates have also been shown to correlate with Lempel–Ziv complexity in real-world data sets from psychoacoustics and neuroscience.

An alternative to a direct measurement is considering a mathematical model that resembles formation of a real-world fractal object. In this case, a validation can also be done by comparing other than fractal properties implied by the model, with measured data. In colloidal physics, systems composed of particles with various fractal dimensions arise. To describe these systems, it is convenient to speak about a distribution of fractal dimensions and, eventually, a time evolution of the latter: a process that is driven by a complex interplay between aggregation and coalescence.

<doc id="285909" wikidata="Q357946" url="?curid=285909" title="Hernando de Soto (economist)">
<text>Hernando de Soto Polar (commonly known Hernando de Soto ; born June 2, 1941) is a Peruvian economist known for his work on the informal economy and on the importance of business and property rights. His work on the developing world has earned him praise worldwide by numerous heads of state, particularly for his publication &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot; and &quot;The Other Path&quot;. He is the current president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), a think tank devoted to promoting economic development in developing countries located in Lima, Peru.

In Peru, de Soto&#x27;s advisory has been recognized as inspiring the economic guidelines—including the loosening of economic regulation, the introduction of austerity measures and the utilization of neoliberal policies—that were ultimately adopted by the government of Alberto Fujimori and established in the 1993 Constitution of Peru. The policies prescribed by de Soto resulted with Peru becoming macro-economically stable following the period of price controls and increased regulation established during the Lost Decade. De Soto would go on to support Alberto&#x27;s daughter, Keiko Fujimori, serving as an advisor during her presidential campaigns. De Soto worked closely with various Peruvian governments, even serving as a negotiator for the Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement. After years of speculation, de Soto ran for the Peruvian presidency in the 2021 presidential election, placing fourth in an atomized race of 18 nominees.

Internationally, de Soto helped inspire the Washington Consensus macroeconomic prescriptions and was credited by economist John Williamson, who coined the consensus&#x27; name. He also supported the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with George H.W. Bush praising his promotion of free trade when announcing the North American agreement. Other heads of state have recognized de Soto, including Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. The ILD has received praise from other people including Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, World Bank President James Wolfensohn, and former UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

==Early life and education==
De Soto was born on 2 June 1941 in Arequipa, Peru. His father José Alberto Soto was a Peruvian diplomat and lawyer. After the 1948 military coup in Peru, his parents chose exile in Europe, taking their two young sons with them. His father worked for the International Labour Organization following their exile and would often send de Soto back to Peru during the summer months.

In exile, de Soto was educated in Switzerland where he attended the International School of Geneva. He studied social psychology in National University of Saint Augustine in Arequipa, Peru. He returned to Geneva and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of Geneva. In 1967, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in international law and economics from Graduate Institute of International Studies, also in Geneva.

His younger brother Álvaro served in the Peruvian diplomatic corps in Lima, New York City and Geneva and was seconded to United Nations in 1982. He retired from the U.N. in 2007 with the title rank of Assistant Under-Secretary-General; his last position was as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process.

There is some controversy around his surname, as his father&#x27;s surname is &quot;Soto&quot;, while Hernando&#x27;s one is &quot;de Soto&quot;. According to the Peruvian writer, and Nobel prize winner, Mario Vargas Llosa, he changed the surname in order to sound more &quot;aristocratic&quot;.

==Economics career==
Following his post-graduate studies, he worked as an economist for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a precursor to the World Trade Organization, as well as president of the Committee of the Copper Exporting Countries Organization, CEO of Universal Engineering Corporation and a principal for Swiss Bank Corporation.

=== Founding of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy ===
De Soto returned to Peru on the behalf of gold placer investors at the age of 38 in 1979 at a time when neoliberal policy was moving from the fringes of economic theory to mainstream practice. Upon de Soto&#x27;s return in 1979, he met with Friedrich Hayek, a free market proponent who helped create the Mont Pelerin Society. Hayek, who sought to promote neoliberalism through a network of &quot;second hand dealers&quot;, choosing de Soto. After making connections with Hayek, de Soto was acquainted with Sir Antony Fisher, a British businessman who created the Atlas Network, a nonprofit libertarian umbrella group that consolidated funds and research from businesses in the United States and Europe in order to create neoliberal organizations in developing countries.

With the assistance and funding of Fisher and the Atlas Network, de Soto created the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) in 1981, one of the first neoliberal organizations in Latin America. De Soto would later state &quot;Anthony gave us enormous amounts of information and advice on how to get organized. ... It was on the basis of his vision that we designed the structure of the ILD&quot;. In 1984, de Soto received further assistance from the United States president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration, with the National Endowment for Democracy&#x27;s Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) providing ILD with funding and education for advertising campaigns. In 2003, the CIPE would later describe the ILD as being one of its most successful programs. Other funding was then provided by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Smith Richardson Foundation, with USAID assisting the ILD with staging international networks to propagate their ideals. The ILD would then seek popular support in Peru by making informal housing their main concern.

=== Fujimori government ===
Between 1988 and 1995, de Soto and the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) were mainly responsible for some four hundred initiatives, laws, and regulations that led to significant changes in Peru&#x27;s economic system. The ILD became involved with the Peruvian economy at the end of President Alan García&#x27;s term. De Soto&#x27;s group began to grow and advertised to the Peruvian public promoting their legislative goals, borrowing some advertisements from American lotteries.

De Soto then began to serve informally as &quot;the President&#x27;s personal representative&quot; for the first three years of the administration of Alberto Fujimori. De Soto had originally been a part of the economics advisory team of the unsuccessful presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa in 1990, but Fujimori later requested de Soto&#x27;s assistance in resolving the economic issues that were produced by the crisis of the 1980s. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described de Soto as an &quot;overseas salesman&quot; for the government of Alberto Fujimori in 1990, writing that he had represented the government when meeting with creditors and the United States representatives. Others dubbed de Soto as the &quot;informal president&quot; for Fujimori.

In a recommendation to Fujimori, de Soto called for a &quot;shock&quot; to Peru&#x27;s economy. De Soto convinced then-president Fujimori to travel to New York City in a meeting organized by the Peruvian Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, secretary-general of the United Nations, where they met with the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, who convinced him to follow the guidelines for economic policy set by the international financial institutions. The policies included a 300 percent tax increase, unregulated prices and privatizing two-hundred and fifty state-owned entities. The policies of de Soto caused macroeconomic stability and a reduction in the rate of inflation, though Peru&#x27;s poverty rate remained largely unchanged with over half of the population living in poverty in 1998. Peru would not see increased growth until the 2000s commodities boom.

University of Chicago political scientist Susan C. Stokes believes that de Soto&#x27;s influence helped change the policies of Fujimori from a Keynesian to a neoliberal approach. De Soto also inspired Fujimori&#x27;s anti-drug initiatives. The Cato Institute and &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine have argued that de Soto&#x27;s policy prescriptions brought him into conflict with and eventually helped to undermine the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) guerrilla movement. By granting titles to small coca farmers in the two main coca-growing areas, they argued that the Shining Path was deprived of safe havens, recruits and money, and the leadership was forced to cities where they were arrested. Attacks were launched against the ILD and de Soto in light of the statements by Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán, who saw ILD as a threat.

==== Land title initiative ====
Between 1992 and 1994, de Soto&#x27;s ILD piloted a land title program to formally register 200,000 Peruvian households and two years later, expanded the program to Lima and seven other metropolitan areas that held ninety percent of informal housing developments within Peru. The program concluded in 2004 with 1.4 million households being registered and 920,000 land titles being provided.

Contrary to de Soto&#x27;s claims, the land title project provided no change to the access of credit to poor Peruvians. The ILD&#x27;s figures reported that homeowners also saw their hours at work increase by seventeen percent, while working at home decreased by forty-seven percent and child labor was reduced by twenty-eight percent, with the group stating that the latter two statistics were due to homeowners and their children no longer being required to defend their homes from seizure. According to Timothy Mitchell, the ILD&#x27;s findings were &quot;implausible&quot; since the conclusion was already framed by the ILD, neighborhoods were already collective with limited property conflicts and those included in the project were already pursuing work outside of their homes when they chose to become involved. Following the findings, the ILD would distance itself from advocating credit access and instead promote increased work hours among formal landowners.

==== Resignation and condemnation of Fujimori ====
De Soto resigned from his post as the &quot;Personal Representative of the President&quot; in January 1992, two months prior to the 1992 Peruvian coup d&#x27;état, and condemned Fujimori&#x27;s motivations being influenced by Director of the National Intelligence Service Vladimiro Montesinos, hinting at signs of corruption. In his letter, he called into question &quot;the validity of the anti-drug agreement&quot; that Fujimori adopted. He stated his reasons to resigning as due to &quot;drug trafficking from within the State that sabotages efforts in the fight against drugs&quot;, and reportedly due to differences with Montesinos. Both Montesinos and Fujimori would later be indicted for corruption and violation of human rights.

Two months after de Soto resigned, Fujimori launched a self-coup which de Soto again condemned as &quot;stupid, unproductive and blatantly unconstitutional&quot;. According to de Soto, one month after the coup the Minister of Economy Carlos Boloña contacted de Soto in desperation, after dozens of countries sanctioned Peru economically by cutting it off from investment and credit in response to the undemocratic event. Boloña resigned from his ministerial post, and de Soto lastly travelled to the 1992 Organization of American States summit in the Bahamas with Fujimori and pressured him to accept democratic elections to prevent another macroeconomic crisis.

=== International policy ===

==== Washington Consensus ====
De Soto was a main contributor to the Washington Consensus, a set of ten economic prescription requirements set by International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and United States Department of the Treasury towards countries in economic crisis. Neoliberal economists in the United States utilized de Soto&#x27;s arguments as a way to promote the consensus. English economist John Williamson, who coined the term &quot;Washington Consensus&quot;, partly credited de Soto for the prescriptions, saying his work was &quot;the outcome of the worldwide intellectual trends to which Latin America provided&quot;. For United States presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, according to Kate Geohegan of Harvard University&#x27;s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, &quot;de Soto&#x27;s ideas offered a compelling new framework for explaining the problem of economic underdevelopment that seemed to affirm the wisdom of neoliberal policies like adjustment lending&quot;.

The Washington Consensus would result in socioeconomic exclusion and weakened trade unions in Latin America, resulting with unrest in the region. The consensus resulted with a shrinking middle class in Latin America that prompted dissatisfaction of neoliberalism, a turn to the political left and populist leaders by the late-1990s; in Bolivia, support for Evo Morales was established.

==== North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ====
Upon its signing, de Soto expressed support for the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). When announcing NAFTA at the Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group on 27 September 1989, President George H. W. Bush – who had adopted de Soto&#x27;s work for the United States&#x27; foreign policy towards the economies of developing countries – praised de Soto for helping inspire free trade.

In his speech announcing NAFTA at the 1989 meeting, Bush stated:

According to de Soto in 1993, &quot;the virtues of a modern society&quot; were able to be introduced to Latin America as a result of NAFTA. He would later say in 2001 that Mexico&#x27;s economy and institution would progress due to NAFTA, concluding &quot;All poor countries are lumped together and all rich countries are lumped together; there&#x27;s this imitation effect&quot;.

=== Advisory work ===

Following its foundation in Peru, de Soto&#x27;s institute, the ILD, has worked in dozens of countries. Heads of state in over 35 countries have sought the ILD&#x27;s services to discuss how ILD&#x27;s theories on property rights could potentially improve their economies. After the split with Fujimori, he and his institute designed similar programs in El Salvador, Haiti, Tanzania, and Egypt and has worked beside the World Bank, though the institute did not advocate for land title programs and instead promoted longer work hours. De Soto has received criticism of having relationships with controversial political leaders such as Alberto Fujimori and Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi, with de Soto responding to such statements saying &quot;I have advised dictators, but that is irrelevant&quot;.

In 2006, de Soto served as a personal representative of President Alan García, and negotiated the Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement after 11 rounds of negotiation. In 2009, the ILD turned its attention back to Peru and the plight of the indigenous peoples of the Peruvian Amazon jungle. In response to Peru&#x27;s President García&#x27;s call to all Peruvians to present their proposals toward solving the problems leading to the bloody incidents in Bagua, the ILD assessed the situation and presented its preliminary findings. ILD published a short videotaped documentary, &quot;The Mystery of Capital among the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon&quot;, summarizing its findings from indigenous communities in Alaska, Canada and the Peruvian jungle.

After previously working with her father Alberto, de Soto joined Keiko Fujimori with her election campaigns for the 2011 and 2016 Peruvian general election when Fujimori committed to implementing de Soto&#x27;s property rights reforms. In an interview during the first campaign ok Keiko Fujimori, he also stated that Osama bin Laden&#x27;s death was achieved thanks to land titling, a concept he holds as a way out of poverty. As part of the Fuerza Popular team, he harshly criticized Peruvians for Change candidate Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, whom he described as a &quot;deserter and coward.&quot; In an interview with the newspaper Perú21, De Soto said that Kuczynski &quot;is a gringo who does not know Peru, because there are those who do. He is a foreigner to the Peruvian reality.&quot;

== Political career ==
=== 2001 Peruvian general election ===
For the 2001 Peruvian general election, de Soto sought to run for president with his Popular Capital party, though he failed to register the party on time in order to participate. At the time, he sought support from left-wing political groups for his candidacy, though they disagreed with his liberal economic policies. He would later become a critic of such groups.

After learning about de Soto&#x27;s inability to register for the election, former president and leader of the APRA Alan Garcia offered the economist the APRA&#x27;s presidential nomination. De Soto declined the offer, claiming that he would have been &quot;a figurehead president susceptible to the whims of disciplined APRA congressmen&quot;. Later, Garcia offered de Soto the position of Prime Minister, a role that Alberto Fujimori had also offered de Soto. De Soto declined again, not wanting to be held accountable for Garcia&#x27;s government policies.

=== 2021 presidential campaign ===
De Soto announced his candidacy for president in September 2020 under the party Go on Country. Prior to the announcement, De Soto expressed hesitation to formally run for president lest politicizing and potentially delegitimizing work done by the ILD and himself on dead capital.

On 30 October 2020, De Soto presented his technical team, which included the former president of CONFIEP Miguel Vega Alvear, businessman Carlos Añaños, former Fujimori minister and first Vice President Francisco Tudela, former GEIN commander Marco Miyashiro, the former head of the Operation Chavín de Huantar José Williams, the diplomat Álvaro de Soto, among others.

On December 14, 2020, de Soto shared an alleged secret poll in Beto Ortiz&#x27;s show in Willax Televisión. That poll ranked him first. De Soto spoke in the interview that: &quot;The way this (the cadres) comes to us is because people very close to the state apparatus, it seems, were outraged at the enormous difference between the polls they handle.&quot;

In January 2021, a strike was filed that considered that the Go on Country electoral court had not been properly formed. This strike was declared unfounded by the JEE.

Another strike was filed against him by a citizen, because he points out that Hernando de Soto &quot;&quot;has entered in the Academic Training section of the resume, which has the academic degree &#x27;demi license en sciences economiques&#x27; awarded by the University of Geneva, which would have been obtained in 1964&quot;.”. But since this degree or title is not registered with SUNEDU, false information would be declared and it should be excluded from the candidacy.

On 24 February 2021, following an approach to advise Francisco Sagasti on the COVID-19 pandemic management in Peru, De Soto announced the first Peruvian shadow cabinet. Mainly composed of his campaign technical team, the main purpose of the opposition cabinet is to offer an alternative in order for the government to concur and apply during the crisis.

De Soto rejected the exclusion of Rafael López Aliaga, an electoral rival in the 2021 elections, for which he appeared at the demonstration of his followers on the outskirts of the JNE, in which Lopez Aliaga was, who praised him.

De Soto was caught in controversy surrounding Vacunagate, a scandal where political elites in Peru were able to be vaccinated against COVID-19 ahead of schedule. He initially denied having received a COVID-19 vaccine &quot;from any Peruvian&quot;, though it was later reported that he flew twice to the United States to be vaccinated. During presidential debates de Soto promised to work with the United Nations to prevent foreign &quot;criminals or poor people&quot; from entering Peru, stating &quot;Let their governments take care of them, we will take care of ours&quot;. He proposed reforming Peru&#x27;s education for less foreign reliance and increasing the health budget.

Ultimately, de Soto placed fourth in an atomized race of 18 nominees.

==Main thesis==
The main message of de Soto&#x27;s work and writings is that no nation can have a strong market economy without adequate participation in an information framework that records ownership of property and other economic information. Unreported, unrecorded economic activity results in that many small entrepreneurs lack legal ownership of their property, making it difficult for them to obtain credit, sell the business, or expand. They cannot seek legal remedies to business conflicts in court, since they do not have legal ownership. Lack of information on income prevents governments from collecting taxes and acting for the public welfare:

The existence of such massive exclusion generates two parallel economies, legal and extra legal. An elite minority enjoys the economic benefits of the law and globalization, while the majority of entrepreneurs are stuck in poverty, where their assets—adding up to more than US$10 trillion worldwide—languish as dead capital in the shadows of the law.

To survive, to protect their assets, and to do as much business as possible, the extralegals create their own rules. But because these local arrangements are full of shortcomings and are not easily enforceable, the extralegals also create their own social, political and economic problems that affect the society at large.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, responsible nations around the developing world have worked hard to make the transition to a market economy, but have in general failed. Populist leaders have used this failure of the free market system to wipe out poverty in the developing world to beat their &quot;anti-globalization&quot; drums. But the ILD believes that the real enemy is within the flawed legal systems of developing nations that make it virtually impossible for the majority of their people—and their assets—to gain a stake in the market. The people of these countries have talent, enthusiasm, and an astonishing ability to wring a profit out of practically nothing`.

What the poor majority in the developing world do not have is easy access to the legal system which, in the advanced nations of the world and for the elite in their countries, is the gateway to economic success, for it is in the legal system where property documents are created and standardized according to law. That documentation builds a public memory that permits society to engage in such crucial economic activities as identifying and gaining access to information about individuals, their assets, their titles, rights, charges and obligations; establishing the limits of liability for businesses; knowing an asset&#x27;s previous economic situation; assuring protection of third parties; and quantifying and valuing assets and rights. These public memory mechanisms in turn facilitate such opportunities as access to credit, the establishment of systems of identification, the creation of systems for credit and insurance information, the provision for housing and infrastructure, the issue of shares, the mortgage of property and a host of other economic activities that drive a modern market economy.

== Work and research ==

Since 2008, de Soto has been refining his thesis about the importance of property rights to development in response to his organization&#x27;s findings that a number of new global threats have &quot;property rights distortions&quot; at their root. In essays, that appeared from early 2009 into 2012 in media outlets in the U.S. and Europe, de Soto argued that the reason why the U.S. and European economies were mired in recession was the result of a &quot;knowledge crisis&quot; not a financial one. He has termed housing assets as &quot;dead capital,&quot; in his papers on household ownership and deeds.
&quot;Capitalism lives in two worlds,&quot; De Soto wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in January 2012. &quot;There is the visible one of palm trees and Panamanian ships, but it is the other – made up of the property information cocooned in laws and records – that allows us to organize and understand fragments of reality and join them creatively.&quot; De Soto argued that the knowledge in those public memory systems, which &quot;helped Capitalism triumph,&quot; was distorted over the past 15 years or so. &quot;Until this knowledge system is repaired,&quot; he wrote, &quot;neither US nor European capitalism will recover.&quot;

In another series of articles that appeared in US and Europe in 2011, de Soto used the findings of ILD field research in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya to make his case for &quot;the economic roots of the Arab Spring.&quot; The ongoing Arab revolutions, he argued, were &quot;economic revolutions&quot; driven mainly by the frustrations of 200 million ordinary Arabs who depended on the informal economy for their livelihoods. He pointed to the ILD&#x27;s earlier 2004 findings in Egypt, which revealed the nation&#x27;s largest employer with 92% of the property in the informal economy – assets worth almost $247 billion. Also, as proof of the extent of desperation among MENA’s entrepreneurs, he elaborated ILD&#x27;s exclusive research on Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor whose public self-immolation in protest of the expropriation of his goods and scale literally sparked the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, which spread unrest through the Arab world.

After losing core funding from USAID, ILD laid off the majority of their employees from their San Isidro office. In 2014–2015, de Soto and a small team working out of his house began to attempt to guide the political process in Peru, as presidential elections were due to take place in 2016, by finding solutions to the ongoing national mining crisis. De Soto has been a strong advocate for the formalisation of the informal miners that are scattered throughout Peru. Since 2014, several large national investment projects, including Las Bambas, and Tia Maria have been disrupted by violent protests by informal miners against government regulation and formal extractive industries. In July 2015, de Soto alleged that former Shining Path militants who have taken up the ecological cause were paralyzing some $70 billion in mining investment in Peru. Furthermore, recorded video debates between the former extremists and de Soto were published on ILD&#x27;s YouTube channel and revealed that the Shining Path militants agree that property rights could be an important part of the solution to social conflicts in Peru. De Soto&#x27;s stated goal is to determine the roots of informal hostility against multinationals and identify what is needed to build a national social contract on extractive industries that could harmonize their property interests with those of multinationals as opposed to creating conflict.

=== De Soto applies thesis to terrorism ===

In October 2014, de Soto published an article in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; &quot;The Capitalist Cure for Terrorism&quot;, that stated an aggressive agenda for economic empowerment was needed in the Middle East in order to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL. He argued that the U.S. should promote an agenda similar to what was successfully used in Peru to defeat the Shining Path in the 1990s. He also mentions in the article that local policymakers in the Middle East are missing the fact that if ordinary people cannot play the game legally, they will be far less able to resist a terrorist offensive. The article received praise among high-level global Right-Wing politicians such as US presidential candidates Rand Paul and Jeb Bush.

Once again In January 2016, de Soto released his second article, How to Win the War on Terror, which focused on defeating terrorism through promoting strong property rights. The article was distributed by &quot;Project Syndicate&quot; and published in dozens of countries and languages, including in Switzerland by the World Economic Forum in advance of their 2016 forum.

=== De Soto challenges Thomas Piketty ===

In 2014, de Soto started to refute French economist Thomas Piketty’s thesis by arguing that his recent attacks against capital in his worldwide best seller book &quot;Capital in the 21st Century&quot; were unjustified. His op-ed article challenging Piketty, ‘The Poor Against Piketty’ (French: Les pauvres contre Piketty) was first published in France&#x27;s news magazine &quot;Le Point&quot; in April 2015.

De Soto argued that Piketty&#x27;s statistics ignore the ninety percent of the world population that lives in developing countries and former Soviet states, whose inhabitants produce and hold their capital in the informal sector. Furthermore, he states that his institute&#x27;s global research proves that most people actually want more rather than less capital. Finally, he argues that the wars against capital, which Piketty claims are coming, have already begun under Europe&#x27;s nose in the form of the Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa.

=== De Soto addresses Pope Francis ===
In February 2016, de Soto took a break from countering Piketty&#x27;s work and wrote an article addressing Pope Francis’s trip to Mexico titled, A Mexican Impasse for the Pope. The article encourages the Pope and the Vatican to address the lack of property rights among the poor in countries like Mexico as a solution to global refugee crises.

A week later, de Soto published a second article in Fortune Magazine addressing the Pope&#x27;s and US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s public spat over building a wall on the Mexican-USA border. The article titled, &quot;What Pope Francis Should Really Say to Donald Trump&quot;, conveys five property rights related thoughts that the Pope should use to respond to Trump. The article led to many different opinion articles featured in conservative outlets such as &quot;Breitbart&quot; and &quot;Investors Business Daily&quot;.

===Blockchain work===
In May 2015, de Soto attended the 1st Annual Block Chain Summit hosted by British billionaire Richard Branson at his private Caribbean residence, Necker Island. De Soto was one of three moderators, along with Michael J. Casey, former &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; senior columnist and Matthew Bishop, editor at &quot;The Economist&quot;. Advocates of blockchain technology argue that it is well-suited to acting as a public ledger to help achieve de Soto&#x27;s objective of formalising the informally held property rights of groups like the indigenous peoples of Peru.

De Soto presented a property application of Bitcoin to Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates and financial authorities of Abu Dhabi at a second Blockchain summit held in Abu Dhabi in 2015.

==Reception==

=== Ideology ===
De Soto&#x27;s promotion of liberalism in developing countries has faced criticism as supporting the exploitation of poorer nations. Social scientist Joseph Hanlon described De Soto as &quot;an economist of the far right&quot; and that &quot;the risk that people will be thrown off their land is fundamental to De Soto&#x27;s system of bringing capitalism to the poor&quot;, summarizing that landlessness for some impoverished individuals &quot;is intrinsic to his strategy&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described de Soto as &quot;a radical free-market economist&quot;. Geohegan states that the United States government under President Ronald Reagan and his successor George H. W. Bush adopted de Soto&#x27;s work as the main strategy of the United States&#x27; foreign policy towards developing countries since &quot;de Soto&#x27;s interpretation of underdevelopment seemed to validate the emerging &#x27;neoliberal&#x27; US policies&quot;. According to de Soto, Peru was not poor because of international inequality enforced by the globalized economy but due to Peru&#x27;s own economic regulation. Reagan – whose administration provided funding to found de Soto&#x27;s ILD – George H. W. Bush and Bush&#x27;s successor Bill Clinton would continue promoting de Soto&#x27;s work. Timothy Mitchell says that de Soto&#x27;s background as a European economist was often ignored by American neoliberals promoting him, writing that his popularity and experience &quot;came to depend on his identity as a neoliberal from the third world, willing to describe the poverty of the global south as a self-inflicted injury unconnected to its relationship to the north&quot;. Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Andrew Natsios would later advocate de Soto&#x27;s work, stating &quot;Instead of seeing the developing world as victims of capitalism, Hernando argues &#x27;We&#x27;re inflicting our own wounds&#x27; ... Since he is Peruvian, he can make this argument credibly&quot;.

The promotion of neoliberalism by de Soto was not only utilized by officials in the United States; other neoliberal economists endorsed de Soto due to his origins from the developing world as well, with Mitchell stating that his background &quot;transformed de Soto into a very useful asset for the neoliberal movement&quot;. President of the Atlas Network, Alex Chaufen, said that de Soto was often discussed among the neoliberal community, stating &quot;During the years I spent with Antony [Fisher] at Atlas, I couldn&#x27;t recall any conversation, any speech about think tanks, any fundraising letter where he did &quot;not&quot; mention Hernando&quot;.

As de Soto began to work with the government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in the Philippines in 2004, investigative journalism website Bulatlat described de Soto&#x27;s work as &quot;rich people&#x27;s reformism&quot;, writing &quot;The secret to de Soto&#x27;s and ILD&#x27;s popularity among political, economic and developmental elites ultimately lies in their unashamed conservatism, defense of the status quo and promise of capitalist wealth for the world&#x27;s poor and exploited. ... Elites get to keep the property they value so much and can continue exploiting and oppressing while the poor – and historically exploited and oppressed – are diverted from systemic struggles by the chimera of becoming wealthy entrepreneurs themselves&quot;. In his &quot;Planet of Slums&quot;, Mike Davis argues that de Soto, who Davis calls &quot;the global guru of neo-liberal populism&quot;, is essentially promoting what the statist left in South America and India has always promoted individual land titling. Davis argues that titling is the incorporation into the formal economy of cities, which benefits more wealthy squatters but is disastrous for poorer squatters, and especially tenants who simply cannot afford incorporation into the fully commodified formal economy.

=== Property rights ===
De Soto&#x27;s works on property rights has voiced diverse views on the effect of the titling of land. The findings at the conclusion of his land title program under Alberto Fujimori found that providing land titles did not provide poor Peruvians with greater access to credit. De Soto has been criticized for methodological and analytical reasons, while some activists have accused him of just wanting to be a representative figure of the prioritizing property rights movement. Some state that his theory does not offer anything new compared to traditional land reform. His emphasis on title formalization as the only reason behind economic growth in the United States has been subject to criticism. Property formalization in the United States may have happened as a result of different reasons including establishment of law and order, increased state control, greater institutional integration, increased economic efficiency, increased tax revenue, and greater equality.

==== Reception from scholars ====
Empirical studies by Argentine economists Sebastian Galiani and Ernesto Schargrodsky found a modest relationship between titling and credit market access (contradicting de Soto&#x27;s research), but have also pointed out that families with titles &quot;substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and improved the education of their children relative to the control group&quot;. In a 2012 book by Yale University political science methodologist Thad Dunning, he argues that Galiani and Schargrodsky&#x27;s studies provide &quot;highly credible&quot; claims because the studies rely on true randomization, whereas De Soto&#x27;s study did not (and is thus vulnerable to confounding variables).

&quot;De Soto’s proposal is not wealth transfer, but wealth legalization. The poor of the world already possess trillions in assets now. De Soto is not distributing capital to anyone. By making them liquid, everyone’s capital pool grows dramatically&quot;. While analysing Schaefer&#x27;s arguments, Roy writes, &quot;de Soto’s ideas are seductive precisely because they only guarantee the latter, but in doing so promise the former&quot;. Robert J. Samuelson has argued against what he sees as de Soto&#x27;s &quot;single bullet&quot; approach and has argued for a greater emphasis on culture and how local conditions affect people&#x27;s perceptions of their opportunities.

In the &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot;, Christopher Woodruff of the University of California, San Diego criticized de Soto for overestimating the amount of wealth that land titling now informally owned property could unlock and argues that &quot;de Soto&#x27;s own experience in Peru suggests that land titling by itself is not likely to have much effect. Titling must be followed by a series of politically challenging steps. Improving the efficiency of judicial systems, rewriting bankruptcy codes, restructuring financial market regulations, and similar reforms will involve much more difficult choices by policymakers.&quot;

==== Reception from governmental officials ====
The argument for private and often individualist property regime comes under the question of societal legitimacy, may not be justified even if de Soto eyes bringing a unified system in a state or unification with the global economy.

His work has also received praise from two United Nations secretaries-general: Kofi Annan – &quot;Hernando de Soto is absolutely right, that we need to rethink how we capture economic growth and development&quot; – and Javier Pérez de Cuéllar – &quot;A crucial contribution. A new proposal for change that is valid for the whole world.&quot; UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, has questioned the insistence on titling as a means to protect security of tenure based on the risk that titling will undermine customary forms of tenure and insufficiently protect the rights of land users that depend on the commons, as well as the fear that titling schemes may lead to further reconcentration of land ownership.

A study commissioned by DFID, an agency of the U.K. government, further summarized many of the complications arising from implementing de Soto&#x27;s policy recommendations when insufficient attention is paid to the local social context.

==== Reception from activists ====
Grassroots controlled and directed shack dwellers movements like Abahlali baseMjondolo in South Africa and the Homeless Workers&#x27; Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto – MTST) in Brazil have strenuously argued against individual titling and for communal and democratic systems of collective land tenure because this offers protection to the poorest and prevents &#x27;downward raiding&#x27; in which richer people displace squatters once their neighborhoods are formalized.

=== Publications ===
Neoliberal politicians and organizations promoted de Soto&#x27;s publications, with their endorsements and awards making his books bestsellers. Since the publication of &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot; in 2000 and subsequent translations, his ideas have become increasingly influential in the field of development economics. Scholars have disputed that there is a significant relationship between land titles and credit market access.

In the World Development journal, a 1990 article by R. G. Rossini and J. J. Thomas of the London School of Economics questioned the statistical basis of de Soto&#x27;s claims about the size of the informal economy in his first book &quot;The Other Path&quot;. The ILD responded in the same journal that Rossini and Thomas’ observations &quot;neither [addressed] the central theme of the book, nor [did it address] the main body of quantitative evidence displayed to substantiate the importance of economic and legal barriers that give rise to informal activities. Instead, [they focused] exclusively on four empirical estimates that the book [mentioned] only in passing&quot;.

On January 31, 2012, de Soto and his publisher were fined by the Peruvian intellectual property rights organization INDECOPI for excluding the names of co-authors Enrique Ghersi and Mario Ghibellini in newer editions of his 1986 book &quot;The Other Path&quot;.

=== Relationship with elites ===
An article by Madeleine Bunting for &quot;The Guardian&quot; (UK) claimed that de Soto&#x27;s suggestions would in some circumstances cause more harm than benefit and referred to The Mystery of Capital as &quot;an elaborate smokescreen&quot; used to obscure the issue of the power of the globalized elite. She cited de Soto&#x27;s employment history as evidence of his bias in favor of the powerful. Reporter John Gravois also criticized de Soto for his ties to power circles, exemplified by his attendance at the Davos World Economic Forum. In response, de Soto told Gravois that this proximity to power would help de Soto educate the elites about poverty. Ivan Osorio of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has argued against Gravois&#x27;s allegations, claiming that Gravois has misinterpreted many of de Soto&#x27;s recommendations.

==Awards and accolades==
&quot;Time&quot; magazine chose De Soto as one of the five leading Latin American innovators of the century in its special May 1999 issue &quot;Leaders of the New Millennium&quot;, and included him among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004.

===Books===
De Soto has published two books about economic development: &quot;The Other Path: The Invisible Revolution in the Third World&quot; in 1986 in Spanish (with a new edition in 2002 titled &quot;The Other Path, The Economic Answer to Terrorism&quot;) and in 2000, &quot;The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else&quot; (). Both books have been international bestsellers, translated into some 30 languages.

The original Spanish-language title of &quot;The Other Path&quot; is &quot;El Otro Sendero&quot;, an allusion to de Soto&#x27;s alternative proposals for development in Peru, countering the attempts of the &quot;Shining Path&quot; (&quot;Sendero Luminoso&quot;) to win the support of Peru&#x27;s poor. Based on five years&#x27; worth of ILD research into the causes of massive informality and legal exclusion in Peru, the book was also a direct intellectual challenge to the Shining Path, offering to the poor of Peru not the violent overthrow of the system but &quot;the other path&quot; out of poverty, through legal reform. In response, the Senderistas added de Soto to their assassination list. In July 1992, the terrorists sent a second car bomb into ILD headquarters in Lima, killing 3 and wounding 19.

In addition, he has written, with Francis Cheneval, &quot;Swiss Human Rights Book Volume 1: Realizing Property Rights&quot;, published in 2006 – a collection of papers presented at an international symposium in Switzerland in 2006 on the urgency of property rights in impoverished countries for small business owners, women, and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor and political refugees. The book includes a paper on the ILD&#x27;s work in Tanzania delivered by Hernando de Soto.

<text>A gentleman thief, gentleman burglar, lady thief, or phantom thief is a stock character in fiction. A gentleman or lady thief is characterised by impeccable manners, charm, courtesy, and the avoidance of physical force or intimidation to steal, and often has inherited wealth. They steal not only to gain material wealth but also for the thrill of the act itself, which is often combined in fiction with correcting a moral wrong, selecting wealthy targets, or stealing only particularly rare or challenging objects.

==In fiction==

In fiction, the gentleman thief is typically superb at stealing while maintaining a gentleman&#x27;s manners and a code of honour. For example, A. J. Raffles steals only from other gentlemen (and occasionally gives the object away to a good cause); Arsène Lupin steals from the rich who do not appreciate their art or treasures and redistributes it; Saint Tail steals back what was stolen or taken dishonestly or rights the wrongs done to the innocent by implicating the real criminals; Sly Cooper and his gang steal from other thieves and criminals. Another example would be Kaito Kuroba who only steals to amuse the audience, to find the Pandora Gem and find the people who killed his father.

==Perceptions of real historical figures==

* Charles Earl Boles (b. 1829; d. after 1888), known as Black Bart, was an English-born outlaw noted for the poetic messages he left behind after two of his robberies. Considered a gentlemanly bandit with a reputation for style and sophistication, he was one of the most notorious stagecoach robbers to operate in and around Northern California and southern Oregon during the 1870s and 1880s.
* Willie Sutton, a gentleman bank robber of the 1920s who never harmed a person during his robberies and carried only unloaded weapons during the heists.
* D. B. Cooper, the only unidentified hijacker in American aviation history, who, in 1971, extorted $200,000 from an airline before parachuting out of a plane during the cover of night. A flight attendant described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or &quot;take-me-to-Cuba&quot; political dissidents) popularly associated with air piracy at the time. Another flight attendant agreed: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t nervous,&quot; she told investigators. &quot;He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time.&quot; He ordered a bourbon and 7 Up, paid his drink tab (and attempted to give a flight attendant the change), and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.
* Bạch Hải Đường was known as the &quot;phantom thief&quot; () in southern Vietnam from 1970 to 1982. He was wanted by both the pre-1975 National Police and the later Public Security Forces. Bạch Hải Đường was believed to have never killed anyone and that he had only actually used his gun once in a gold robbery, which was also the reason the police started to use lethal force on him. During one of his arrest, he confessed that he used all stolen money for himself. However, since Bạch Hải Đường wasn’t known to be a wasteful spender, there were rumours that he donated his money to charity.

* Xianxia, a wuxia offshoot that is a fantasy genre with some popular works that value radical politics often of a traditionalist Chinese religious bent, and often have brutal thief characters who steal and lie but still have a sense of honor

<text>An autoinjector (or auto-injector) is a medical device for injection of a premeasured dose of a particular drug. Most autoinjectors are one-use, disposable, spring-loaded syringes (prefilled syringes). By design, autoinjectors are easy to use and are intended for self-administration by patients, administration by untrained personnel, or easy use by healthcare professionals; they can also overcome the hesitation associated with self-administration using a needle. The site of injection depends on the drug, but it typically is administered into the thigh or the buttocks.

Autoinjectors are sharps waste.

== History ==
Automatic syringes are known since the 1910s, and many spring-loaded devices with needle protectors were patented in the first half of the 20th century, but it was not until 1970s when they became economically feasible to mass-produce (simple syrettes were used instead before). In 2023 an open source autoinjector was developed that could be digitally replicated with a low cost desktop 3D printer. It was tested against the then current standard (ISO 11608–1:2022) for needle-based injection systems and found to cost less than mass manufactured systems.

== Design ==
Designs exist for both intramuscular and subcutaneous injection. Disposable autoinjectors commonly use a pre-loaded spring as a power source. This spring and the associated mechanical components form a one-shot linear actuator. When triggered the actuator drives a three-step sequence:

# accelerate the syringe forward, puncturing the injection site
# actuate the piston of the syringe, injecting the drug
# deploy a shield to cover the needle

Some injectors are triggered by simply pushing the nose ring against the injection site. In these designs, the protective cap is the primary safety. Other designs use a safety mechanism similar to nail guns: The injection is triggered by pushing the nose ring against the injection site and simultaneously, while applying pressure, pushing a trigger button at the rear end of the device.

Since spent autoinjectors contain a hypodermic needle, they pose a potential biohazard to waste management workers. Hence the protective cap is designed not only to protect the drug and keep the needle sterile but also to provide adequate sharps waste confinement after disposal.

Injectors intended for application through layers of clothing may feature an adjustable injection depth. Other typical features include: A drug inspection window, a color-coded spent indicator, and an audible click after the injection has finished.

== Uses ==
* Epinephrine autoinjectors are often prescribed to people who are at risk for anaphylaxis. Brand names include Anapen, EpiPen, Emerade, and Auvi-Q.
* Rebiject, Rebiject II and Rebidose autoinjectors for Rebif, the drug for interferon beta-1a used to treat multiple sclerosis. An autoinjector for the Avonex version of this same medication is also on the market.
* SureClick autoinjector is a combination product for drugs Enbrel or Aranesp to treat rheumatoid arthritis or anemia, respectively.
* Subcutaneous sumatriptan autoinjectors are used to terminate cluster headache attacks.
* Naloxone autoinjectors are being developed and prescribed to recreational opioid users to counteract the deadly effects of opioid overdose.

Military uses include:

* Autoinjectors are often used in the military to protect personnel from chemical warfare agents. In the U.S. military, atropine and 2-PAM-Cl (pralidoxime chloride) are used for first aid (&quot;buddy aid&quot; or &quot;self aid&quot;) against nerve agents. An issue item, the Mark I NAAK (Nerve Agent Antidote Kit), provides these drugs in the form of two separate autoinjectors. A newer model, the ATNAA (Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-Injector), has both drugs in one syringe, allowing for the simplification of administration procedures. In the Gulf War, accidental and unnecessary use of atropine autoinjectors supplied to Israeli civilians proved to be a major medical problem.
* In concert with the Mark I NAAK, diazepam (&quot;Valium&quot;) autoinjectors, known as CANA, are carried by US service members.

== Variants ==
Another design has a shape and size of a smartphone which can be put into a pocket. This design also has a retractable needle and automated voice instructions to assist the users on how to correctly use the autoinjector. The &quot;Auvi-Q&quot; epinephrine autoinjector uses this design.

A newer variant of the autoinjector is the gas jet autoinjector, which contains a cylinder of pressurized gas and propels a fine jet of liquid through the skin without using a needle. This has the advantage that patients who fear needles are more accepting of using these devices. The autoinjector can be reloaded, and various doses or different drugs can be used, although the only widespread application to date has been for the administration of insulin in the treatment of diabetes.

<text>The common degu (Octodon degus; ), or, historically, the degu, is a small hystricomorpha rodent endemic to the Chilean matorral ecoregion of central Chile. The name &quot;degu&quot; on its own indicates either the entire genus &quot;Octodon&quot; or, more commonly, just the common degu. Common degus belong to the parvorder Caviomorpha of the infraorder Hystricognathi, along with the chinchilla and guinea pig. The word &quot;degu&quot; comes from the indigenous language of Chile, Mapudungun, and the word &quot;dewü&quot;, meaning &#x27;mouse&#x27; or &#x27;rat&#x27;.

The animal may be kept as a domestic pet, though there are prohibitions on their ownership in some territories. As a pet, the animal is larger than a golden hamster but smaller than a fancy rat.

== Description ==
The common degu is a small animal with a body length of and a weight of . It has yellow-brown fur above and creamy-yellow below, with yellow around the eyes and a paler band around the neck. It has a long, thin tail with a tufted, black tip, dark sparsely furred ears, and pale grey toes. Its fifth toe is small with a nail, rather than a claw, on the fore feet. Its hind feet are bristled. Its cheek teeth are shaped like figures-of-eight, hence the degu&#x27;s genus name &quot;Octodon&quot;.

== Social behavior ==
Common degus are highly social. They live in burrows, and, by digging communally, they are able to construct larger and more elaborate burrows than they could on their own. Degus digging together coordinate their activities, forming digging chains. Females living in the same group have been shown to spontaneously nest communally; they nurse one another&#x27;s young. They spend a large amount of time on the surface, where they forage for food. When foraging, their ability to detect predators is increased in larger groups, and each animal needs to spend less time in .

Common degus exhibit a wide array of communication techniques. They have an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising up to 15 different sounds, and the young need to be able to hear their mother&#x27;s calls if the emotional systems in their brains are to develop properly. They use their urine to scent mark, and experiments have shown that they react to one another&#x27;s marks, although in males the hormone testosterone may suppress their sense of smell somewhat.
Common degus are seasonal breeders; the breeding season for wild degus begins in the Chilean autumn when day and night are roughly equal, with pups born in early to mid-spring. Female degus are pregnant for approximately ninety days, having a comparatively long gestation period compared to other non-caviomorph rodents. Female pregnant weight varies over the course of gestation and according to litter size; litters contain an average of six pups, but size can range from one or two up to twelve young. Common degu pups are born relatively precocial, fully furred and with eyes open, and their auditory and visual systems are functional at birth. Unlike most other rodents, male common degus also take part in protecting and raising their pups until they are old enough to leave the family.

Unlike some other octodontids, common degus are diurnal (active during the day), and they have good vision. Their retinas include rod cells and two types of cone cells, corresponding to peak sensitivity in the green and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. Behavioral experiments have shown that degus are able to discriminate ultraviolet light from the wavelengths visible to humans; it is likely that this ultraviolet sensitivity has a social function, since both their (stomach) fur and their urine are highly UV reflective.

== Diet ==
Common degus are strictly herbivorous, in the wild feeding on grasses and browsing the leaves of shrubs, though they will also take seeds. Throughout much of the year forage is dried and so common degus are specially adapted to a very high fibre intake, and this varies between food types and environmental conditions. Like some other herbivores such as rabbits, they perform coprophagy (faecal reingestion) so as to extract more nutrition from their diet. This also serves to maintain healthy gut function during times when food is scarce. Although they are active by day, in high summer they do not leave their burrows in the middle of the day and instead emerge to forage in the mornings and evenings.

Common degus have an intolerance of dietary sugar. They have been found to have a divergent insulin structure (one of the hormones that regulate blood glucose level) and so are highly susceptible to developing diabetes mellitus when fed regularly on a diet containing free sugars. This is thought to be due to evolutionary pressure arising from the lack of availability of free sugars in the degu&#x27;s natural environment. Because of this, the ingredients of non-degu-specific hard feed formulations given to captive common degus should be checked for sugar-laden ingredients, such as molasses, honey, and glucose syrup.

== Research subjects ==

Common degus are research subjects due to their relationship with sugar and diabetes, but are also studied for a variety of other reasons.
Neuroscientists at the Riken Institute in Tokyo, Japan, used common degus for research into tool use in animals with good eye-and-paw coordination, in which they spontaneously learned to use a tiny rake to retrieve out-of-reach seeds. Common degus have also been found to spontaneously stack objects in order of decreasing size. In both cases, it is the first time these behaviours have been recorded in animals other than apes and birds.

Another area of common degu research is circadian rhythm function, i.e., the ability of the brain to tell what time of day it is. Degus have the ability to show both diurnal and nocturnal rhythms if the environment permits. Common degus can take cues that do not relate to day length, such as temperature, melatonin levels and scents from other degus to adjust their rhythms.

Common degus are also used in development and aging studies. Separation anxiety caused by separating degu pups from their mother from an early age for periods of half an hour or more can cause developmental and behavioural changes in later life, similar to ADHD in humans. In elderly common degus, neural markers have been discovered which are similar to those in humans with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which is the first time this has been seen in a wild-type rodent.

==As pets==


After initial interest into common degus as research subjects, they have become popular as pets. Their advantages over traditional small pets are their diurnal habits, bubbly personalities, the haired tail (as compared to rats and mice) and their lifespan: they are reported to live up to 13 years under ideal circumstances (though a poor gene pool or genetic background often reduces a pet degu&#x27;s lifespan significantly). The average lifespan of a common degu in captivity is typically around six to eight years of age.

One disadvantage of the common degu as a pet is their predisposition to chewing, due to their continually growing incisor and molar teeth. For this reason, common degus cannot be housed in plastic-bottomed cages typically found in pet stores. Lining the floors of a degu enclosure with grass mats or a soft fabric prevents infections known as bumblefoot.

Untamed common degus, as with some other small animals kept as pets, can be prone to biting, but their intelligence makes them easy to tame. Regular non-predatory handling and food offerings help with this transition. The common degu&#x27;s tail skin and tuft is easily &quot;shed&quot; (pulled off). This helps common degus in the wild elude capture by predators, but it is painful to the creature and the tail end will not grow back, and as such pulling on it or picking up a degu by the tail is not recommended. When tail shedding occurs, common degus will chew off the damaged portion. This can reduce the chances of infection.

Common degus often &quot;groom&quot; their human owners with a gentle nibbling action, and will bond with people that spend time with them. Common degus need regular sand baths, like Chinchillas need dust baths, to keep their coats healthy and free from grease. They should have access to these baths regularly, preferably two or three times a week for half an hour at a time. However, daily sand bathing can make their coats soiled.

===Prohibitions===
Some jurisdictions consider common degus as a potential invasive species and forbid owning them as a pet.

In the United States, they are illegal to own in California, Utah, Georgia, Connecticut, and Alaska.

<doc id="285914" wikidata="Q2707736" url="?curid=285914" title="West Anglia Great Northern">
<text>West Anglia Great Northern, commonly shortened to &quot;WAGN&quot;, was a train operating company in England. It operated the West Anglia Great Northern franchise between January 1997 and March 2004, as well as the Great Northern franchise between April 2004 and March 2006. It was initially owned by Prism Rail, and was subsequently acquired by the British transport conglomerate National Express.

The West Anglia Great Northern franchise was created as part of the privatisation of British Rail, the recently founded company Prism Rail successfully bid for it, being awarded a seven year concession for its operation during December 1996. It took over operations from British Rail on 5 January 1997. The company set about overhauling its inherited rolling stock, such as the Class 313 and Class 317 electric multiple units. By 1999, WAGN was amongst the best performing franchises according to statistics compiled by the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising. However, proposed open access services between Peterborough and Doncaster by WAGN were rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) due to a lack of capacity.

During July 2000, Prism Rail, along with WAGN, was acquired by the British transport conglomerate National Express via a £166 million deal. In January 2002, as part of a wider reorganisation of the various franchises conducted by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), it was announced that the franchise would be divided, and that the West Anglia portion would be merged into the Greater Anglia franchise. On 10 May 2002, a northbound WAGN service derailed at Potters Bar, resulting the deaths of seven people and the injury of a further 76; services were heavily disrupted and special measures were implemented in response. In December 2005, the Department for Transport (DfT) awarded the recently created Thameslink franchise to rival company FirstGroup, thus the services operated by WAGN were transferred to the new operator First Capital Connect on 1 April 2006.

==History==

During 1995, amid the privatisation of British Rail, several individuals from the bus industry decided to found their own company, Prism Rail, to bid for some of the newly created rail franchises. In its bid for the West Anglia Great Northern franchise, Prism promised that it would make a premium payment of £24.8 million to the franchising office in 2004. During December 1996, it was announced that Prism had been awarded a seven year concession to operate the franchise, which was the company&#x27;s fourth awarding of a passenger train franchise at that time.

On 5 January 1997, West Anglia Great Northern commenced operations, taking over service from British Rail, including their rolling stock. During the late 1990s, West Anglia Great Northern submitted an application to operate extended services on an open access basis between Peterborough and Doncaster; however, the proposal was rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) due to a reported lack of capacity on the route.

By 1999, according to statistics compiled by the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, West Anglia Great Northern was amongst the best performing franchises, being one of only seven franchises to obtain a B grade, for which its average punctuality had to be above 90 per cent while its average reliability figures had to be exceed 99 per cent.

During July 2000, it was announced that Prism Rail, and thus West Anglia Great Northern as well, had been acquired by the British transport conglomerate National Express in exchange for £166 million. That same month, the company had agreed to invest £20.5m into the network, and had reported that the &quot;Great Northern&quot; portion of the franchise&#x27; operations were running at a profit.

In January 2002, as part of a wider reorganisation of the various franchises conducted by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), it was announced that the franchise would be divided, and that the West Anglia portion would be merged into the Greater Anglia franchise. During December 2003, the SRA awarded the Greater Anglia franchise to National Express, resulting in the transfer of the West Anglia services to One on 1 April 2004. The company was also granted a two-year extension on the West Anglia Great Northern franchise; thereafter, the Great Northern services were retained with the company commonly referring to itself as &quot;WAGN&quot; rather than West Anglia Great Northern.

On 10 May 2002, a major rail accident involving a northbound WAGN service occurred at Potters Bar, resulting the deaths of seven people and the injury of a further 76. The train, a four-coach Class 365 Electric multiple unit, had derailed while passing over a set of points just south of Potters Bar railway station at 97 mph (156 km/h); these points had unintentionally moved while still underneath the third coach. In the aftermath of the accident, WAGN services were heavily disrupted and delayed, leading to a special timetable being implemented for a time. During April 2004, the railway infrastructure services company Jarvis plc admitting liability for the accident.

==Services==
West Anglia Great Northern operated all-stops and limited stops West Anglia services out of London Liverpool Street to Chingford, Enfield Town, Hertford East, Stansted Airport, and Cambridge, and all-stops and limited stops Great Northern services out of London King&#x27;s Cross to Cambridge, King&#x27;s Lynn and Peterborough, including the Hertford North loop line.

==Rolling stock==
West Anglia Great Northern inherited a fleet of Class 313s, Class 315s, Class 317s, Class 322s and Class 365s from British Rail.

Between 1997 and 1999, two of the five Class 322 electric multiple units were loaned to First North Western, after which all five units were transferred to ScotRail during 2001.

The first trains to undergo overhaul work were twenty-four Class 317/2 multiple units; these were adapted to be more suitable for long-distance use, changes included the installation of lower-density seats throughout, an improved first class area, the addition of carpet, and repainting. Dedicated bicycle and wheelchair spaces and improved lighting were also provided, while the exterior received a new white, grey, blue and red livery.

West Anglia Great Northern also opted to improve its suburban trains, such as the Class 313 multiple units, which gained new seats with higher backs, provisions for wheelchair users, and minor improvements to fittings such as stanchions in the passenger areas. These emerged from refurbishment at Railcare, Wolverton in a plain white undercoat, before a metallic purple livery was introduced in 2001.

Between 1999 and 2000, nine Class 317/1s were refurbished for use on the dedicated Stansted Express service, they were reclassified Class 317/7. These multiple units featured improved interiors and a new metallic blue Stansted Express livery.

During 2004, sixteen Class 365s were transferred to WAGN from South Eastern Trains. Before their entry into service, these multiple units had their original DC shoe gear removed and pantographs fitted instead. 

==Depots==
West Anglia Great Northern&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Hornsey and Ilford depots.

==Demise==
As part of a franchise reorganisation by the Strategic Rail Authority, the Great Northern services were merged into the Thameslink franchise. In December 2005, the Department for Transport awarded the Thameslink franchise to FirstGroup with the services operated by West Anglia Great Northern transferring to First Capital Connect on 1 April 2006.

<doc id="285918" wikidata="Q1394096" url="?curid=285918" title="Golden Horns of Gallehus">
<text>The Golden Horns of Gallehus were two horns made of sheet gold, discovered in Gallehus, north of Møgeltønder in Southern Jutland, Denmark.
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the Germanic Iron Age.

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart. They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a Proto-Norse Elder Futhark inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as drinking horns, or as blowing horns, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless, replicas of the original horns were produced, two of them exhibited at the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, with copies at e.g. the Moesgaard Museum, near Aarhus, Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, &quot;The Golden Horns&quot; (&quot;Guldhornene&quot;), by Adam Oehlenschläger.

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an Elder Futhark inscription in Proto-Norse which is of great value for Germanic linguistics.

Both horns were once the same length, but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8 cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4 cm., and the horn weighed 3.2 kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following Elder Futhark inscription (DR 12 †U), identifying the maker as Hlewagast:

This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of alliterative verse.

The meaning of the given name &quot;Hlewagastiz&quot; is debated: it may mean either &quot;lee guest&quot; or &quot;fame guest&quot;. &quot;Holtijaz&quot; may either be a patronymic, &quot;son (or descendant) of Holt&quot;, or express a characteristic such as &quot;of the wood&quot;.

===Possible cipher runes===

The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a cipher encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment. Hartner (1969) read &quot;luba horns ens helpa hjoho&quot;, an &quot;apotropaic sentence&quot; translated by Hartner as &quot;may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan&quot;.

===Iconography===
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and hybrid motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by chasing.

There have been numerous attempts at their interpretation, all speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with Germanic mythology, although Mediterranean (Byzantine) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic Migration Period art are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider animal style of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the &quot;valkyrie&quot; shown on the Tjängvide image stone. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of sword-dances, e.g. on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to horned helmet iconography, or to the &quot;Cernunnos&quot; figure on the Gundestrup cauldron. The peculiar image of a tricephalous (three-headed) figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a tricephalous Christ symbolizing the Trinity in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of Norse gods among the figures, including Tyr, Odin, Thor and Freyr.

Frankfurt historian of science Willy Hartner in 1969 published an interpretation involving gematria and archaeoastronomy, taking many of the figures as representing constellations, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

==Discovery==

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on 20 July 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near Møgeltønder, Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King Christian IV of Denmark who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish prince Christian, who refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian Olaus Wormius wrote a treatise named &quot;De aureo cornu&quot; on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the &quot;Journal des Savants&quot;.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on 21 April 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King Christian VI of Denmark and received 200 rigsdaler in return. From this moment both horns were stored at &quot;Det kongelige Kunstkammer&quot; (The Royal Chamber of Art) at Christiansborg, currently the Danish Rigsarkivet (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On 4 May 1802 the horns were stolen by a goldsmith and watchmaker named Niels Heidenreich from Foulum, who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The grandmaster of the goldsmiths&#x27; guild, Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged &quot;pagodas&quot; (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with brass. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on 27 April 1803 and confessed on 30 April. On 10 June Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

A set of plaster casts of the horns had been made for a cardinal in Rome, but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the Corsican coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from Moesgaard Museum, which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near Hasselager. These copies are made of gilded brass.

On 17 September 2007 a set of modern gilded silver copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning, but were recovered shortly after on 19 September 2007.

<doc id="285920" wikidata="Q2004317" url="?curid=285920" title="Kogo Noda">
<text>was a Japanese screenwriter most famous for collaborating with Yasujirō Ozu on many of the director&#x27;s films.

Born in Hakodate, Noda was the son of the head of the local tax bureau and younger brother to Kyūho, a Nihonga painter. He moved to Nagoya after completing elementary school and later went to Waseda University. After graduating, he worked for the city of Tokyo while also serving as a reporter for &quot;Katsudō kurabu&quot;, one of the major film magazines, using the pen name Harunosuke Midorikawa. On the recommendation of a scriptwriter friend from junior high, Takashi Oda, he joined the script department at Shōchiku after the Great Kantō earthquake. He soon became one of the studio&#x27;s central screenwriters, penning for instance &quot;Aizen katsura&quot; (1938), one of its biggest pre-war hits.

He is most known for his collaborations with Ozu, which began with Noda supplying the script for the director&#x27;s first feature &quot;Sword of Penitence&quot; (1927), and led to such postwar works as &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953), regarded by many critics as one of the greatest films of all time. He co-wrote thirteen of Ozu&#x27;s fifteen post-war films.

When the Writers Association of Japan was formed in 1950, Noda served as its first chair.

<text>is a 1998 Japanese experimental coming-of-age film directed and co-written by Hideaki Anno, based on the novel &quot;Topaz II&quot; by Ryū Murakami&quot;.&quot; It was Anno&#x27;s first live action feature-length film. The film was shot almost entirely on hand-held digital cameras and contains unorthodox camera work, including many different mounted camera positions, such as on a model train riding on tracks. The film also flips from widescreen to fullscreen, distorts (with effects such as a fisheye lens), confuses, and makes use of overlays stacked in layers to convey the character&#x27;s emotions.

An official English-language DVD was released in 2004 by Kino on Video.

==Plot==
Hiromi Yoshii is a high school girl living in Tokyo. She has three friends: Nao, who is interested in computers, Chieko, who is older and more mature, and Chisa, who plans to drop out of school to become a professional dancer. Hiromi feels that she lacks direction in comparison to her friends. All four routinely go out with older men in exchange for payment.

On July 19, 1997, Hiromi wakes up and goes to Shibuya. There, she meets Nao, who, earlier that day, had met a gay man named Kobayashi who gave her a cell phone. They then meet Chieko, and all three leave voice messages on the phone, stating that they are interested in meeting with older men that day. 

Planning to go to the beach together soon, they meet with Chisa and go out to buy swimwear. While shopping, Hiromi finds a topaz ring on sale. She cannot afford it, but plans to gather the money and return to buy it before the shop closes later that day. All four friends then go to karaoke with an older man, who pays the cost of the ring in exchange. Despite this, Hiromi refuses to take the money for herself, insisting that they split the money evenly. Shortly after, the four part ways.

Hiromi receives a phone call from a man named Yoshio, who says that his kitten is sick and he is leaving Kobayashi. She then checks the messages she has received from interested men. She contacts one of the men, Uehara, and takes a taxi to meet him. Uehara takes her to a video rental store, with Hiromi posing as his girlfriend. There, they go to the adult video section, where Uehara grabs Hiromi&#x27;s hand and uses it to masturbate. Disgusted, Hiromi runs away; Uehara pays her anyway.

Hiromi receives a call from Kobayashi, where she relays the information she had heard from the previous call. She chooses to meet another man who had left a message, who calls himself Captain EO, and carries a Fuzzball stuffed animal. The two go to a love hotel, where they talk and Hiromi fixes the stuffed animal. Hiromi takes a shower, but Captain EO intrudes, berating her for choosing to go on a date with him. He admits that he had planned to assault Hiromi, rape her, and steal her money, but does not. He pays her very little, and leaves.

Hiromi meets Kobayashi to return the cell phone. He thanks her for saving his cat&#x27;s life, but says that he and Yoshio had broken up. Hiromi repeats one of Captain EO&#x27;s remarks, to which Kobayashi replies that whoever had said that must see great value in her. Hiromi then returns home, and ruminates on her life and her failure to buy the ring before falling asleep.

==DVD variations==
An SR-Ban version was released in Japan on 24 July 2003. Apparently, it is the director&#x27;s cut, has two minutes of extra footage and has been transferred directly from the original tape, whilst the American and Japanese DVDs appear to come from a different source. The American version appears to be the original interlaced version, whilst the Japanese, non-director&#x27;s cut, appears to have been de-interlaced and given the impression of a pseudo-progressive style. Both non-director&#x27;s cuts have more subdued colors, whilst the director&#x27;s cut is more vivid and the motion is fluid.
This fluidity in motion is due to the 60 fps high frame rate, compared to the normal 24 fps frame rates on the non SR-Ban DVDs.

<text>Promise Keepers is an Evangelical Christian parachurch organization for men. It opposes same-sex marriage, and champions chastity and marital fidelity and the man as being head of the household.

Promise Keepers originated in the United States, but independent branches have also been established in Canada and New Zealand. It is a non-profit organization, not affiliated with any Christian church or denomination. Its most widely publicized events tend to be mass rallies held at football stadiums and similar venues.

==History==
Promise Keepers was founded in 1990 by Bill McCartney, then the head football coach at the University of Colorado Boulder. The organization was incorporated as a nonprofit in the state of Colorado on December 3, 1990.

&quot;What Makes a Man?&quot;, Promise Keepers&#x27; first hardbound book written for the organization, was published by The Navigators&#x27; Navpress publishing arm in 1992 for its first Folsom Field gathering in June of that year. James Dobson had McCartney on his Focus on the Family nationwide radio program that same month. McCartney resigned his coaching position in 1994 in order to focus his attention on the organization.

Promise Keepers&#x27; most notable event was its &quot;Stand in the Gap: A Sacred Assembly of Men&quot; open-air gathering at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1997. C-SPAN carried the event live in its entirety. Attendance figures vary but have been estimated to be between 600,000 and 800,000. This was probably its peak, with the organization halving its office staff four months later due to financial problems and the admission fee of $60 for regional rallies dropped in a number of regions. Rally attendance and finances continued to suffer and a planned millennial march to take part at the capital of every state was cancelled.

Promise Keepers has at the same time extended its organization outside the United States, setting up &quot;Promise Keepers International&quot; which holds &quot;Summit Meetings&quot; in at least seven languages and has set up chapters in other countries.

McCartney resigned as president on October 1, 2003, after a personal leave of absence to take care of his ailing wife, who had a severe respiratory illness.

In April 2018, Promise Keepers announced that the appointment of a new chairman of the board, Ken Harrison. Harrison is also CEO of WaterStone Foundation, a Christian donor-advised fund. He is a former police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department.

===Promise Keepers relaunch===
Under Harrison&#x27;s leadership, Promise Keepers then began a &quot;relaunch&quot; campaign with a new approach focused on having one stadium event per year and following up with Bible studies and other resources.

In May 2020, Promise Keepers announced that its relaunch event at AT&amp;T Stadium would become an online virtual event in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since moving their relaunch event at the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas to a virtual platform, Promise Keepers has hosted a variety of live-streamed events and had a live, in-person AT&amp;T Stadium event scheduled for July 16–17, 2021.

== Reception ==

=== Doctrines ===

Promise Keepers has been lauded for its Christian focus. However, the group has also been criticized for doctrinal compromises and inconsistent doctrines.

Raymond Hartwig, a former president of the South Dakota District of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, commented: &quot;They use the Bible in a very simplistic form, as a springboard to jump into the law.&quot;

=== Same-sex relationships ===
Promise Keepers champion the exclusive legitimacy of heterosexuality and denigrate homosexuality as sinful. Promise Keeper founder, the late University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney, called homosexuals &quot;a group of people who don&#x27;t reproduce, yet want to be compared with people who do reproduce,&quot; and maintained that he believed, &quot;Homosexuality is an abomination of Almighty God.&quot;

Critics call the Promise Keepers approach to homosexuality &quot;simplistic, sexist, homophobic and patriarchal,&quot; and &quot;based on exclusion,&quot; and that within the views of the organization, &quot;there&#x27;s no place for gays and lesbians. There is no place for women except as subservient to men.&quot;

Belmont University, a private Christian school in Tennessee, cancelled a Promise Keepers event in 2023 after the organization published a Pride month blog post that the university said was &quot;harmful to members of our community.&quot;

=== Role of Women ===
The National Organization for Women (NOW), an American feminist organization, has expressed the view that the Promise Keepers pose a threat to women&#x27;s rights. NOW contends that the group encourages inequality within marriages and teaches a doctrine of male superiority.

In August, 2020, Promise Keepers chairman Ken Harrison spoke on the topic of Promise Keepers and how it relates to women. &quot;We&#x27;re really calling men to be humble, proactive leaders in their homes. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s my role to tell women how they should be. That is for their pastor and other people.&quot;

According to Amy Schindler, &quot;the discourse of masculinity found within conservative religious movements, such as the Promise Keepers and the Victorian era movement &#x27;muscular Christianity,&#x27; is inherently political. Any masculinity project aimed at restoring or reclaiming a &#x27;traditional&#x27; male role for privileged white, heterosexual males has a political impact within the tapestry of class, race, and gender power&quot; (1998). Academic Browyn Kara Conrad argued in a 2006 article that the organization reproduces problematic sexual scripts such as the Madonna/whore view of female sexuality and a view of the male sex drive as uncontrollable. A 2002 article from the &quot;Nordic Journal of Feminist and Gender Research&quot; argued that, despite their initial appearance to be pro-feminist, the Promise Keepers build upon patriarchal assumptions, including having the man as the actor in the family, church, and world, and that they expect women to be passively dependent.

=== Manhood ===
The organization places particular emphasis on godly manhood, with an emphasis on fatherhood. John Bartkowski saw Promise Keepers&#x27; leadership in 2000 as evoking two types of manhood: first, is an essentialist appeal to gender difference advocated by Edwin Louis Cole that emphasizes aggression, strength, and rationality; second, is Gary Oliver&#x27;s &quot;expressive manhood&quot;, which says that all of the traits now traditionally attributed to women were practiced by Jesus, and that men should re-connect with their sensitive side. According to a 1999 Yeshiva University study, when it comes to fatherhood, the organization tends to be more conservative, supporting heterosexist, male predominance in the family.

=== Race ===
Following the murder of George Floyd, Promise Keepers launched Promise 6 Sunday, an event aimed toward &quot;building unity&quot; among churches. The event included resources from various evangelical leaders and American public figures including Samuel Rodriguez, Tony Dungy, Alveda King, Donald Burgs Jr., Chad Hennings, and Ken Harrison.

Patrick Glynn argues that the Promise Keepers succeed in racial reconciliation where politics has seemed to fail. Scholar Siphiwe Dube notes that the organization has open discussions of race that promote racial reconciliation. L. Dean Allen finds that while the organizations&#x27; leaders primarily claim that Satan is responsible for fostering racism in individuals and that the best way to counter racism is for people to personally repent and go to confession, PK participants see racism as a more multifaceted issue, citing historical animosity, economic differences, and racial fear. Further, while both leaders and participants see forming relationships with members of other races as important to battling racism, participants do not see PK events as valuable in developing these relationships. Andrea Smith also notes that race relations between Promise Keepers and Native communities is more open.

<text>Ole Worm (13 May 1588 – 31 August 1654), who often went by the Latinized form of his name Olaus Wormius, was a Danish physician, natural historian and antiquary. He was a professor at the University of Copenhagen where he taught Greek, Latin, physics and medicine.

== Biography==
Worm was the son of Willum Worm, who served as the mayor of Aarhus, and was made a rich man by an inheritance from his father. Ole Worm&#x27;s grandfather Johan Worm, a magistrate in Aarhus, was a Lutheran who had fled from Arnhem in Gelderland while it was under Catholic rule.

Worm married Dorothea Fincke, the daughter of a friend and colleague, Thomas Fincke. Fincke was a Danish mathematician and physicist, who invented the terms &#x27;tangent&#x27; and &#x27;secant&#x27; and taught at the University of Copenhagen for more than 60 years. Through Fincke, Worm became connected to the powerful Bartholin family of physicians, and later theologians and scientists, that dominated the University of Copenhagen throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.

Ole Worm was something of a perpetual student: after attending the grammar school of Aarhus, he continued his education at the University of Marburg, studying theology in 1605. He received his doctor of medicine degree from the University of Basel in 1611, and received a master of arts degree from the University of Copenhagen in 1617. The rest of his academic career was spent in Copenhagen, where he taught Latin, Greek, physics, and medicine. He was personal physician to King Christian IV of Denmark. Somewhat remarkable for a physician of the time, he remained in the city of Copenhagen to minister to the sick during an epidemic of the bubonic plague, which led to his own death from the plague in 1654.

== Scientific and cultural significance ==
In medicine, Worm&#x27;s chief contributions were in embryology. The Wormian bones (small bones that fill gaps in the cranial sutures) are named after him.

Worm is known to have been a collector of early literature in the Scandinavian languages. He also wrote a number of treatises on runestones and collected texts that were written in runic. Worm received letters of introduction to the bishops of Denmark and Norway from the King of Denmark due to the king&#x27;s interest and approval.

In 1626 Worm published his &quot;Danish Chronology&quot; (&quot;Fasti Danici&quot;) containing the results of his researches into runic lore; and in 1636 his &quot;Runes: the oldest Danish literature&quot; (&quot;Runir seu Danica literatura antiquissima&quot;), a compilation of transcribed runic texts. In 1643 his &quot;Danish Monuments&quot; (&quot;Danicorum Monumentorum&quot;) was published. The first written study of runestones, it is also one of the only surviving sources for depictions of numerous runestones and inscriptions from Denmark, some of which are now lost. An illustration of his pet bird, a great auk, survives as the only known illustration of a live member of the species, which is now extinct.

As a scientist, Worm straddled the line between modern and pre-modern. As an example, in a very modern, empirical mode, Worm determined in 1638 that the unicorn did not exist and that purported unicorn horns simply were from the narwhal. At the same time, however, he then wondered if the anti-poison properties associated with a unicorn&#x27;s horn still held true, and undertook experiments in poisoning pets and then serving them ground up narwhal horn (his poisoning must have been relatively mild because he reported that they did recover).

Other empirical investigations he conducted included providing convincing evidence that lemmings were rodents and not, as some thought, spontaneously generated by the air (Worm 1655, p. 327), and also by providing the first detailed drawing of a bird-of-paradise proving that they did, despite much popular speculation to the opposite, indeed have feet like regular birds. Worm&#x27;s primary use of his natural history collection was for the purpose of pedagogy.

==Museum Wormianum==
As a natural philosopher, Worm assembled a great collection of curiosities, which ranged from native artifacts collected from the New World, to taxidermed animals, to fossils, on which he speculated greatly. Museum Wormianum was the cabinet of rarities of the natural history cabinet established by Ole Worm in Copenhagen. It consists of minerals, plants, animals, and man-made objects.

Worm compiled engravings of his collection, along with his speculations about their meaning, into a catalog of his &quot;Museum Wormianum&quot;, published after his death in 1654. &quot;Museum Wormianum&quot; contained a detailed description of the natural history cabinet. The text is divided into four books; the first three dealing with minerals, plant and animal. The fourth detailed archaeological and ethnographic items.

== In popular culture ==
The early twentieth century horror author H. P. Lovecraft mentions Olaus Wormius as having translated the fictional &quot;Al Azif &quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;) from Greek to Latin; however, he dates this translation 1228, four centuries before the historical Wormius&#x27;s lifetime. Horror writer Anders Fager has elaborated this myth in several of his tales.
Ole Worm appears in one of the Icelandic Sjón&#x27;s novels &quot;From the Mouth of the Whale&quot;.

<doc id="285939" wikidata="Q423800" url="?curid=285939" title="Andean flamingo">
<text>The Andean flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) is a species of flamingo native to the Andes mountains of South America. Until 2014, it was classified in genus &quot;Phoenicopterus&quot;. It is closely related to James&#x27;s flamingo, and the two make up the genus &quot;Phoenicoparrus&quot;. The Chilean flamingo, Andean flamingo, and James&#x27; flamingo are all sympatric, and all live in colonies (including shared nesting areas).

==Description==
It is distinguished from other flamingos by its deeper lower mandible and the very long filtering filaments on the maxilla. It is the largest flamingo in the Andes and is one of the two heaviest living flamingos alongside the taller greater flamingo. Reportedly body mass of the Andean flamingo has ranged from , height from and wingspan from .

The flamingo has a pale pink body with brighter upperparts, deep vinaceous-pink lower neck, breast, and wing coverts. It is the only flamingo species with yellow legs and three-toed feet. Its bill is pale yellow near the skull, but black for the majority of its length, and curves downward. Its lower mandible is less apparent than those of the genus &quot;Phoenicopterus.&quot;

=== Plumages ===
Juveniles present a uniformly pale gray plumage. It is often duskier on the head and neck. Coverts and scapulars can have darker brown centers. Meanwhile, adults are overall pale pink, with the feathers on the lower neck and chest being much brighter pink; coverts may be similarly bright pink. Head and upper neck may be a brighter pink than the rest of the body, which can appear almost white with only a pale pink wash, but head and upper neck never as bright as the lower neck and breast. Primaries and secondaries black, which when wings are folded, appear as bold black triangle that is not obscured by other feathers.

=== Fossil history ===
Fossils attributed to Andean Flamingo have been found at the Salar de Atacama border and roughly date to the Early Formative period, approximately 3,000 to 2,200 BP. These fossils date to a period consistent with the onset of modern climate conditions that the species now inhabits.

== Behavior ==

===Feeding===
These flamingos are filter feeders and their diet ranges over the entire spectrum of available foods, from fish to invertebrates, from vascular plants to microscopic algae.

The flamingos feed from the bottom layer of the lake for small particles, mainly diatoms. They have a deep-keeled bill; the upper mandible is narrower than the lower, creating a gape on the dorsal surface of the bill. The bill morphology facilitates feeding of diatoms through inertial impaction. This mechanism entails that food particles denser than water, such as diatoms, would impact the filtering surface in the bill, causing water to flow out of the mouth and leaving diatoms in the flamingo&#x27;s bill. The flamingos forage in shallow salty waters for resources. They exhibit the most flexible foraging pattern compared to that of the Chilean and James&#x27;s flamingos.

When grouping the Andean flamingos with Chilean flamingos or James&#x27;s flamingos, Andean flamingos adopt the foraging patterns of the species with which it is grouped. Thus, when grouped with Chilean flamingos, they use a moderate and deep foraging depth strategy more than or the same as expected. If they are grouped with James&#x27;s flamingos, they adopt the edge and the shallow foraging strategy. However, the overall foraging behavior of Andean flamingos remains unclear.

=== Vocalization ===
Very poorly known; the available recordings fall into three distinct call types, but specific information on function lacking. &quot;Peep&quot;: a surprisingly high-pitched (c 2 kHz), short (c 0.1–0.2 s), clear note that sounds rather Passerine-like. Most often given in a quick series that slightly descends, but sometimes also singly. &quot;Quack&quot;: a brief, rough nasal quack or honk-like note that can be given individually or in series. Lower-pitched and shorter in duration than the analogous call in Chilean Flamingo, but slightly higher-pitched than in James&#x27;s Flamingo. Often heard in flight. &quot;Chuckle&quot;: a quiet, conversational call made up of short, low-pitched quack-like notes. Lower-pitched and less nasal than the Quack call, and typically given in a faster series.

==Distribution, habitat, and movements==
This Andean flamingo is native to the wetlands of the high Andes mountain range from southern Peru to northwestern Argentina and northern Chile. Andean flamingos are migratory, with the ability to travel up to 700 miles in one day. In the summer, they live in salt lakes, and migrate to the lower wetlands for the winter. The cause of this migration from summer to winter is possibly due to the extreme aridity of salt flats during the winter. The path of migration is unknown, but it is thought to occur between the Chilean breeding grounds and the wetlands of central and western Argentina.

Breeding is concentrated in northern Chile, extreme southwestern Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. During the nonbreeding season, some birds remain around the same wetlands where they bred, but others move to lower elevation wetlands and lakes, including east to the central plains of Argentina, and also north through the Andes to southern Peru.

Vagrant as far north as Conococha in central Peru, to the coast of Peru and northern Chile, to Amazonian Brazil, to southern Argentina, and to coastal southern Brazil.

==Status and conservation==
The Andean flamingo is considered a vulnerable species due to the mining business and human disturbances causing changes in its habitat.

===Mining===
The Andean flamingo&#x27;s habitat is constantly changing due to human activity. The primary threat to the flamingo population is mining excavations, which occur at the end of the summer rainy season.
The habitat of the Andean flamingo is rich in boron compounds, specifically borax. Borax is fairly toxic at high dosages to animals such as the Andean flamingo, but not to humans. Studies testing the effects of borax exposure in animals show that excess boron causes skeletal malformations, cardiovascular defects, and degeneration of testes. Borax is a derivative of boric acid; a study comparing the toxicology of borates determined that salts of boric acid produce comparable effects. A study on the mining environment determined as little as 5 g of borax can produce adverse effects in animal populations, but human workers remain unaffected at these levels. Therefore, the miners remain unaffected while the animals suffer from developmental and reproductive toxicity.

A study on Salinas Lake in Peru showed that mining companies have established themselves adjacent to the flamingos&#x27; nesting sites, and some mining is performed near flamingo breeding grounds and feeding sites. Flamingos abandoned their nesting sites if mining was initiated after the establishment of nesting colonies and in close proximity. An increase of hydrocarbon exploration resulted in a decreased success rate for breeding. Less than 1% of the flamingos observed were juveniles. The decreased reproductive success may be due to borax exposure or to an altered environment caused by bulldozers disturbing the lake bed. Mining creates a muddy environment, which entraps flamingos, thus increasing mortality. Surveys conducted on residents near the mining activities report sightings of dead flamingos exhumed by the bulldozers.

The extraction process also affects the water availability. Andean flamingos filter surface water for food, but borax mining pollutes this water. Along with the pollution, the extractions expedite the removal of lake moisture. By limiting the amount of water in the lake, mining companies can increase visibility, thus contributing to more optimal mining. A study comparing the correlation between water availability and flamingo population determined that the number of flamingos was strongly correlated to the proportion of water in the lake. With an insufficient food supply and a disturbed habitat, the decrease in offspring seems inevitable.

In Argentina, the rarest species of flamingo is primarily found in northern provinces (Salta, Catamarca, and Jujuy) during warmer months, as well as in low-lying areas of the central region, mainly Córdoba and Santa Fe. The National Mining Secretariat reports 38 lithium projects across the country, with 17 situated in the vast salt flats of Salta province.

Biologists and conservationists have raised concerns about the negative impacts of lithium brine extraction on areas where these birds reproduce and feed. This species, part of the flamingo family alongside the Andean and James&#x27;s flamingos, has been classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

===Human disturbance===
Not only are the flamingos&#x27; offspring numbers diminished by mining activities, but they are also affected by the egg collection by locals. This illegal hunting has increased over time due to an increase in international demand for flamingo eggs. Poaching is conducted by organized groups within Chile; the group members trap the flamingos and export them to Europe, the United States, and other overseas destinations. The exportation process is conducted mainly in the Altiplano, which is an area that has deep cultural roots in egg poaching. During the reproductive season, local families also take eggs from flamingo nests. The removal of eggs can disturb the nesting process and cause the flamingo to abandon its nest, even if some eggs remain. Egg removal might be acceptable if the local populations were malnourished, but studies on the diets of the local people show no protein deficiency. In the area of study, the common people raise llamas and alpacas, which offer a higher content of protein than flamingo eggs.

Alongside mining activities, unregulated tourism has taken its toll on the flamingos&#x27; habitat. Over time, numerous peat bogs have developed throughout the land. These bogs gradually build up and begin to overflow into the lake. When the bogs enter the lake, they decrease the surface area of the water and prevent the flamingos from entering the lake to feed.
As a result of the mining and the tourism, new infrastructure, such as highways, are being built into the Andes. Highways now run alongside the flamingos&#x27; habitat. With the addition of these roads, accessibility to the flamingos&#x27; habitat increases, leading to more commercial mining and tourism, which in turn results in detrimental effects to the Andean flamingo population. The development of new infrastructure has caused severe fragmentation of the lake, diminishing the biodiversity, and increasing the possibility of extinction for all species.

The demand for surface and underground water, energy production, and transportation, as well as unregulated tourism, have all increased in the last two decades. These increases were documented to be most significant in Chile, the main location for Andean flamingo breeding colonies. As a consequence, these areas are concentrated with toxic compounds due to mineral and hydrocarbon exploration. Since the 1980s, the number of successful breeding colonies and the total production of chicks of Andean flamingos declined. As a result, the Andean flamingo is a threatened species.

===Conservation plans===
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the Andean flamingo is an &quot;insufficiently known species&quot;. Thus, despite being negatively affected for at least the previous two decades, it was finally declared endangered in September 2010. In this announcement, it was stated that this flamingo would be protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Most of the areas in which the flamingos reside, both in the summer and the winter, have been covered by the implementation of national parks. However, these parks are absent in habitats incurring changes. Thus, the main breeding grounds are still susceptible to outside disturbances that decrease the population of the flamingos. Because the Andean flamingo is a recent addition to the endangered species list, few plans have been implemented to protect their species. However, the National Institution of Natural Resources (http://www.nri.org/) is currently developing a plan. This group is working with conservationists to find a way to solve the problems of borate extraction and egg collecting and poaching. The plan consists of an environmental education strategy to inform businessmen, workers, villagers, and any other people who pose as a threat to the flamingos. Local authorities in the Salinas Lake district have created an outpost to prevent illicit actions and to find possible solutions to present problems. Creation of national parks has decreased the egg collecting; however, environmental education will be necessary to eliminate this activity.

The Flamingo Specialist Group, established in 1971, is actively trying to inform the public on the vulnerability of flamingos. They produce an annual newsletter to tell readers the current status of several species. In 2000, this group conducted a census that revealed a total population less than 34,000 Andean flamingos, giving them the label of most rare species. Recently, this group has joined sides with the International Union for Conservation of Nature to create an action plan for the flamingos. A meeting was held in Miami, Florida, in 2000 to develop a group to control an action place to protect the six species and subspecies of flamingos.

Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of High Andean Flamingos and their Habitats was concluded and came into effect on 4 December 2008. The MoU covers Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. As of August 2012, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru have signed the MoU. The MoU aims to improve the conservation status of the species and their habitats through coordinated and concerted actions across the range.

<text>Social statistics is the use of statistical measurement systems to study human behavior in a social environment. This can be accomplished through polling a group of people, evaluating a subset of data obtained about a group of people, or by observation and statistical analysis of a set of data that relates to people and their behaviors.

==Statistics in the social sciences==
===History===

Adolph Quetelet was a proponent of social physics. In his book &quot;Physique sociale&quot; he presents distributions of human heights, age of marriage, time of birth and death, time series of human marriages, births and deaths, a survival density for humans and curve describing fecundity as a function of age. He also developed the Quetelet Index.

Francis Ysidro Edgeworth published &quot;On Methods of Ascertaining Variations in the Rate of Births, Deaths, and Marriages&quot; in 1885 which uses squares of differences for studying fluctuations and George Udny Yule published &quot;On the Correlation of total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-Relief&quot; in 1895.

A numerical calibration for the fertility curve was given by Karl Pearson in 1897 in his &quot;The Chances of Death, and Other Studies in Evolution&quot; In this book Pearson also uses standard deviation, correlation and skewness for studying humans.

Vilfredo Pareto published his analysis of the distribution of income in Great Britain and Ireland in 1897, this is now known as the Pareto principle.

Louis Guttman proposed that the values of ordinal variables can be represented by a Guttman scale, which is useful if the number of variables is large and allows the use of techniques such as ordinary least squares.

Macroeconomic statistical research has provided stylized facts, which include:
* Bowley&#x27;s law (1937) regarding the proportion between wages and national output 
* The Phillips curve (1958) regarding the relation between wages and unemployment

Statistics and statistical analyses have become a key feature of social science: statistics is employed in economics, psychology, political science, sociology and anthropology.

=== Statistical methods in social sciences===


Methods and concepts used in quantitative social sciences include:
* Research design, survey methodology and survey sampling
* Delphi method

Statistical techniques include:

====Covariance based methods====

* Regression analysis
* Canonical correlation
* Causal analysis
* Multilevel models
* Factor analysis
* Linear discriminant analysis
* Path analysis
* Structural Equation Modeling

====Probability based methods====

* Probit and logit
* Item response theory
* Bayesian statistics
* Stochastic process
* Latent class model

====Distance based methods====

* Cluster analysis
* Multidimensional scaling

====Methods for categorical data====

* Classification analysis
* Cohort analysis

=== Usage and applications ===

Social scientists use social statistics for many purposes, including:
* the evaluation of the quality of services available to a group or organization,
* analyzing behaviors of groups of people in their environment and special situations,
* determining the wants of people through statistical sampling
* evaluation of wage expenditures and savings
* preventing industrial diseases
* prevention of industrial accidents
* labour disputes, such as supporting the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission of 1902-1903
* supporting governments in times of peace and war

===Reliability===

The use of statistics has become so widespread in the social sciences that many universities such as Harvard, have developed institutes focusing on &quot;quantitative social science.&quot; Harvard&#x27;s Institute for Quantitative Social Science focuses mainly on fields like political science that incorporate the advanced causal statistical models that Bayesian methods provide. However, some experts in causality feel that these claims of causal statistics are overstated. There is a debate regarding the uses and value of statistical methods in social science, especially in political science, with some statisticians questioning practices such as data dredging that can lead to unreliable policy conclusions of political partisans who overestimate the interpretive power that non-robust statistical methods such as simple and multiple linear regression allow. Indeed, an important axiom that social scientists cite, but often forget, is that &quot;correlation does not imply causation.&quot;

<text>Email art refers to artwork created for the medium of email. It includes computer graphics, animations, screensavers, digital scans of artwork in other media, and even ASCII art. When exhibited, Email art can be either displayed on a computer screen or similar type of display device, or the work can be printed out and displayed.

Email art is an evolution of the networking Mail Art movement and began during the early 1990s. Chuck Welch, also known as Cracker Jack Kid, connected with early online artists and created a net-worker telenetlink. The historical evolution of the term &quot;Email art&quot; is documented in Chuck Welch&#x27;s &quot;Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology&quot; published and edited by University of Calgary Press.

By the end of the 1990s, many mailartists, aware of increasing postal rates and cheaper internet access, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, inexpensive forms of digital communication. The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of Mail Art calls (invitations), Mail Art blogs and websites have become commonly used to display contributions and online documentation, and an increasing number of projects include an invitation to submit Email art digitally, either as the preferred channel or as an alternative to sending contributions by post.
In 2006, Ramzi Turki received an e-mail containing a scanned work of Belgian artist Luc Fierens, so he sent this picture to about 7000 e-mail addresses artists seeking their interactions in order to acquire about 200 contributions and answers.

<doc id="285948" wikidata="Q36468" url="?curid=285948" title="Unicellular organism">
<text>A unicellular organism, also known as a single-celled organism, is an organism that consists of a single cell, unlike a multicellular organism that consists of multiple cells. Organisms fall into two general categories: prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms. Most prokaryotes are unicellular and are classified into bacteria and archaea. Many eukaryotes are multicellular, but some are unicellular such as protozoa, unicellular algae, and unicellular fungi. Unicellular organisms are thought to be the oldest form of life, with early protocells possibly emerging 3.5–4.1 billion years ago.

Although some prokaryotes live in colonies, they are not specialised cells with differing functions. These organisms live together, and each cell must carry out all life processes to survive. In contrast, even the simplest multicellular organisms have cells that depend on each other to survive.

Most multicellular organisms have a unicellular life-cycle stage. Gametes, for example, are reproductive unicells for multicellular organisms. Additionally, multicellularity appears to have evolved independently many times in the history of life.

Some organisms are partially unicellular, like &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;. Additionally, unicellular organisms can be multinucleate, like &quot;Caulerpa&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, and Myxogastria.

== Evolutionary hypothesis ==

Primitive protocells were the precursors to today&#x27;s unicellular organisms. Although the origin of life is largely still a mystery, in the currently prevailing theory, known as the RNA world hypothesis, early RNA molecules would have been the basis for catalyzing organic chemical reactions and self-replication.

Compartmentalization was necessary for chemical reactions to be more likely as well as to differentiate reactions with the external environment. For example, an early RNA replicator ribozyme may have replicated other replicator ribozymes of different RNA sequences if not kept separate. Such hypothetic cells with an RNA genome instead of the usual DNA genome are called &#x27;ribocells&#x27; or &#x27;ribocytes&#x27;.

When amphiphiles like lipids are placed in water, the hydrophobic tails aggregate to form micelles and vesicles, with the hydrophilic ends facing outwards. Primitive cells likely used self-assembling fatty-acid vesicles to separate chemical reactions and the environment. Because of their simplicity and ability to self-assemble in water, it is likely that these simple membranes predated other forms of early biological molecules.

== Prokaryotes ==
Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria or a nucleus. Instead, most prokaryotes have an irregular region that contains DNA, known as the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a single, circular chromosome, which is in contrast to eukaryotes, which typically have linear chromosomes. Nutritionally, prokaryotes have the ability to utilize a wide range of organic and inorganic material for use in metabolism, including sulfur, cellulose, ammonia, or nitrite. Prokaryotes are relatively ubiquitous in the environment and some (known as extremophiles) thrive in extreme environments.

=== Bacteria ===
Bacteria are one of the world&#x27;s oldest forms of life, and are found virtually everywhere in nature. Many common bacteria have plasmids, which are short, circular, self-replicating DNA molecules that are separate from the bacterial chromosome. Plasmids can carry genes responsible for novel abilities, of current critical importance being antibiotic resistance. Bacteria predominantly reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission. However, about 80 different species can undergo a sexual process referred to as natural genetic transformation. Transformation is a bacterial process for transferring DNA from one cell to another, and is apparently an adaptation for repairing DNA damage in the recipient cell. In addition, plasmids can be exchanged through the use of a pilus in a process known as conjugation.

The photosynthetic cyanobacteria are arguably the most successful bacteria, and changed the early atmosphere of the earth by oxygenating it. Stromatolites, structures made up of layers of calcium carbonate and trapped sediment left over from cyanobacteria and associated community bacteria, left behind extensive fossil records. The existence of stromatolites gives an excellent record as to the development of cyanobacteria, which are represented across the Archaean (4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), Proterozoic (2.5 billion to 540 million years ago), and Phanerozoic (540 million years ago to present day) eons. Much of the fossilized stromatolites of the world can be found in Western Australia. There, some of the oldest stromatolites have been found, some dating back to about 3,430 million years ago.

Clonal aging occurs naturally in bacteria, and is apparently due to the accumulation of damage that can happen even in the absence of external stressors.

=== Archaea ===
Hydrothermal vents release heat and hydrogen sulfide, allowing extremophiles to survive using chemolithotrophic growth.
Archaea are generally similar in appearance to bacteria, hence their original classification as bacteria, but have significant molecular differences most notably in their membrane structure and ribosomal RNA. By sequencing the ribosomal RNA, it was found that the Archaea most likely split from bacteria and were the precursors to modern eukaryotes, and are actually more phylogenetically related to eukaryotes. As their name suggests, Archaea comes from a Greek word &quot;archaios,&quot; meaning original, ancient, or primitive.

Some archaea inhabit the most biologically inhospitable environments on earth, and this is believed to in some ways mimic the early, harsh conditions that life was likely exposed to. Examples of these Archaean extremophiles are as follows:
* Thermophiles, optimum growth temperature of 50 °C-110 °C, including the genera &quot;Pyrobaculum&quot;, &quot;Pyrodictium&quot;, &quot;Pyrococcus&quot;, &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot; and &quot;Melanopyrus.&quot;
* Psychrophiles, optimum growth temperature of less than 15 °C, including the genera &quot;Methanogenium&quot; and &quot;Halorubrum.&quot;
* Alkaliphiles, optimum growth pH of greater than 8, including the genus &quot;Natronomonas&quot;.
* Acidophiles, optimum growth pH of less than 3, including the genera &quot;Sulfolobus and Picrophilus&quot;.
* Piezophiles, (also known as barophiles), prefer high pressure up to 130 MPa, such as deep ocean environments, including the genera &quot;Methanococcus&quot; and &quot;Pyrococcus&quot;.
* Halophiles, grow optimally in high salt concentrations between 0.2 M and 5.2 M NaCl, including the genera &quot;Haloarcula&quot;, &quot;Haloferax&quot;, &quot;Halococcus&quot;.
Methanogens are a significant subset of archaea and include many extremophiles, but are also ubiquitous in wetland environments as well as the ruminant and hindgut of animals. This process utilizes hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide into methane, releasing energy into the usable form of adenosine triphosphate. They are the only known organisms capable of producing methane. Under stressful environmental conditions that cause DNA damage, some species of archaea aggregate and transfer DNA between cells. The function of this transfer appears to be to replace damaged DNA sequence information in the recipient cell by undamaged sequence information from the donor cell.

== Eukaryotes ==

Eukaryotic cells contain membrane bound organelles. Some examples include mitochondria, a nucleus, or the Golgi apparatus. Prokaryotic cells probably transitioned into eukaryotic cells between 2.0 and 1.4 billion years ago. This was an important step in evolution. In contrast to prokaryotes, eukaryotes reproduce by using mitosis and meiosis. Sex appears to be a ubiquitous and ancient, and inherent attribute of eukaryotic life. Meiosis, a true sexual process, allows for efficient recombinational repair of DNA damage and a greater range of genetic diversity by combining the DNA of the parents followed by recombination. Metabolic functions in eukaryotes are more specialized as well by sectioning specific processes into organelles.

The endosymbiotic theory holds that mitochondria and chloroplasts have bacterial origins. Both organelles contain their own sets of DNA and have bacteria-like ribosomes. It is likely that modern mitochondria were once a species similar to &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, with the parasitic ability to enter a cell. However, if the bacteria were capable of respiration, it would have been beneficial for the larger cell to allow the parasite to live in return for energy and detoxification of oxygen. Chloroplasts probably became symbionts through a similar set of events, and are most likely descendants of cyanobacteria. While not all eukaryotes have mitochondria or chloroplasts, mitochondria are found in most eukaryotes, and chloroplasts are found in all plants and algae. Photosynthesis and respiration are essentially the reverse of one another, and the advent of respiration coupled with photosynthesis enabled much greater access to energy than fermentation alone.

=== Protozoa ===
Protozoa are largely defined by their method of locomotion, including flagella, cilia, and pseudopodia. While there has been considerable debate on the classification of protozoa caused by their sheer diversity, in one system there are currently seven phyla recognized under the kingdom Protozoa: Euglenozoa, Amoebozoa, Choanozoa &quot;sensu&quot; Cavalier-Smith, Loukozoa, Percolozoa, Microsporidia and Sulcozoa. Protozoa, like plants and animals, can be considered heterotrophs or autotrophs. Autotrophs like &quot;Euglena&quot; are capable of producing their energy using photosynthesis, while heterotrophic protozoa consume food by either funneling it through a mouth-like gullet or engulfing it with pseudopods, a form of phagocytosis. While protozoa reproduce mainly asexually, some protozoa are capable of sexual reproduction. Protozoa with sexual capability include the pathogenic species &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;, &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; and &quot;Leishmania&quot; species.

Ciliophora, or ciliates, are a group of protists that utilize cilia for locomotion. Examples include &quot;Paramecium&quot;, &quot;Stentors&quot;, and &quot;Vorticella&quot;. Ciliates are widely abundant in almost all environments where water can be found, and the cilia beat rhythmically in order to propel the organism. Many ciliates have trichocysts, which are spear-like organelles that can be discharged to catch prey, anchor themselves, or for defense. Ciliates are also capable of sexual reproduction, and utilize two nuclei unique to ciliates: a macronucleus for normal metabolic control and a separate micronucleus that undergoes meiosis. Examples of such ciliates are &quot;Paramecium&quot; and &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; that likely employ meiotic recombination for repairing DNA damage acquired under stressful conditions.

The Amebozoa utilize pseudopodia and cytoplasmic flow to move in their environment. &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; is the cause of amebic dysentery. &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; appears to be capable of meiosis.

=== Unicellular algae ===
Unicellular algae are plant-like autotrophs and contain chlorophyll. They include groups that have both multicellular and unicellular species:
* Euglenophyta, flagellated, mostly unicellular algae that occur often in fresh water. In contrast to most other algae, they lack cell walls and can be mixotrophic (both autotrophic and heterotrophic). An example is &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot;.
* Chlorophyta (green algae), mostly unicellular algae found in fresh water. The chlorophyta are of particular importance because they are believed to be most closely related to the evolution of land plants.
* Diatoms, unicellular algae that have siliceous cell walls. They are the most abundant form of algae in the ocean, although they can be found in fresh water as well. They account for about 40% of the world&#x27;s primary marine production, and produce about 25% of the world&#x27;s oxygen. Diatoms are very diverse, and comprise about 100,000 species.
* Dinoflagellates, unicellular flagellated algae, with some that are armored with cellulose. Dinoflagellates can be mixotrophic, and are the algae responsible for red tide. Some dinoflagellates, like &quot;Pyrocystis fusiformis&quot;, are capable of bioluminescence.

=== Unicellular fungi ===
Unicellular fungi include the yeasts. Fungi are found in most habitats, although most are found on land. Yeasts reproduce through mitosis, and many use a process called budding, where most of the cytoplasm is held by the mother cell. &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; ferments carbohydrates into carbon dioxide and alcohol, and is used in the making of beer and bread. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is also an important model organism, since it is a eukaryotic organism that is easy to grow. It has been used to research cancer and neurodegenerative diseases as well as to understand the cell cycle. Furthermore, research using &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has played a central role in understanding the mechanism of meiotic recombination and the adaptive function of meiosis. Candida spp. are responsible for candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth and/or throat (known as thrush) and vagina (commonly called yeast infection).

== Macroscopic unicellular organisms ==
Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic size and are thus classified as microorganisms. However, some unicellular protists and bacteria are macroscopic and visible to the naked eye. Examples include:
* &quot;Brefeldia maxima&quot;, a slime mold, examples have been reported up to a centimetre thick with a surface area of over a square metre and weighed up to around 20 kg
* Xenophyophores, protozoans of the phylum Foraminifera, are the largest examples known, with &quot;Syringammina fragilissima&quot; achieving a diameter of up to 
* &quot;Nummulite&quot;, foraminiferans
* &quot;Valonia ventricosa&quot;, an alga of the class Chlorophyceae, can reach a diameter of 
* &quot;Acetabularia&quot;, algae
* &quot;Caulerpa&quot;, algae, may grow to 3 metres long
* &quot;Gromia sphaerica&quot;, amoeba, 
* &quot;Thiomargarita magnifica&quot; is the largest bacterium, reaching a length of up to 20 mm
* &quot;Epulopiscium fishelsoni&quot;, a bacterium
* &quot;Stentor&quot;, ciliates nicknamed trumpet animalcules
* &quot;Bursaria&quot;, largest colpodean ciliates.

<doc id="285954" wikidata="Q777183" url="?curid=285954" title="Rocky Mountain National Park">
<text>Rocky Mountain National Park is a national park of the United States located approximately northwest of Denver in north-central Colorado, within the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The park is situated between the towns of Estes Park to the east and Grand Lake to the west. The eastern and western slopes of the Continental Divide run directly through the center of the park with the headwaters of the Colorado River located in the park&#x27;s northwestern region. The main features of the park include mountains, alpine lakes and a wide variety of wildlife within various climates and environments, from wooded forests to mountain tundra.

The Rocky Mountain National Park Act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on January 26, 1915, establishing the park boundaries and protecting the area for future generations. The Civilian Conservation Corps built the main automobile route, Trail Ridge Road, in the 1930s. In 1976, UNESCO designated the park as one of the first World Biosphere Reserves. In 2023, 4.1 million recreational visitors entered the park. The park is one of the most visited in the National Park System, ranking as the third most visited national park in 2015. In 2019, the park saw record attendance yet again with 4,678,804 visitors, a 44% increase since 2012.

The park has five visitor centers, with park headquarters located at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Centera National Historic Landmark designed by the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture at Taliesin West. National Forest lands surround the park on all sides, including Roosevelt National Forest to the north and east, Routt National Forest to the north and west, and Arapaho National Forest to the west and south, with the Indian Peaks Wilderness area located directly south of the park.

==History==
The history of Rocky Mountain National Park began when Paleo-Indians traveled along what is now Trail Ridge Road to hunt and forage for food. Ute and Arapaho people subsequently hunted and camped in the area. In 1820, the Long Expedition, led by Stephen H. Long for whom Longs Peak was named, approached the Rockies via the Platte River. Settlers began arriving in the mid-1800s, displacing the Native Americans who mostly left the area voluntarily by 1860, while others were removed to reservations by 1878.

Lulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver. The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims. The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road—a section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park—was completed in 1904. The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges, including the Bear Lake Trail School, and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.

Prominent individuals in the effort to create a national park included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania. The national park was established on January 26, 1915.

==Geography==
Rocky Mountain National Park encompasses of federal land, with an additional of U.S. Forest Service wilderness adjoining the park boundaries. The Continental Divide runs generally northsouth through the center of the park, with rivers and streams on the western side of the divide flowing toward the Pacific Ocean while those on the eastern side flow toward the Atlantic.

A geographical anomaly is found along the slopes of the Never Summer Mountains where the Continental Divide forms a horseshoeshaped bend for about , heading from southtonorth but then curving sharply southward and westward out of the park. The sharp bend results in streams on the eastern slopes of the range joining the headwaters of the Colorado River that flow south and west, eventually reaching the Pacific. Meanwhile, streams on the western slopes join rivers that flow north and then east and south, eventually reaching the Atlantic.
The headwaters of the Colorado River are located in the park&#x27;s northwestern region. The park contains approximately of rivers and streams, of trails, and 150 lakes.

Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the highest national parks in the nation, with elevations from , the highest point of which is Longs Peak. Trail Ridge Road is the highest paved through-road in the country, with a peak elevation of . Sixty mountain peaks over high provide scenic vistas. On the north side of the park, the Mummy Range contains a number of thirteener peaks, including Hagues Peak, Mummy Mountain, Fairchild Mountain, Ypsilon Mountain, and Mount Chiquita. Several small glaciers and permanent snowfields are found in the high mountain cirques.

There are five regions, or geographical zones, within the park.

===Region 1: Moose and big meadows===
Region 1 is known for moose and big meadows and is located on the west, or Grand Lake, side of the Continental Divide. Thirty miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail loop through the park and pass through alpine tundra and scenery.
The Big Meadows area with its grasses and wildflowers can be reached via the Onahu, Tonahutu, or Green Mountain trail. Other scenic areas include Long Meadows and the Kawuneeche Valley (Coyote Valley) of the upper Colorado River which is a good place for birdwatching, as well as snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in winter. The valley trail loops through Kawuneeche Valley which contained as many as 39 mines, though less than 20 of those have archived records and archeological remains. LuLu City is the site of an abandoned silver mining town of the early 1880s located along the Colorado River Trail. According to a 1985 report prepared for the NRHP, there were only three cabin ruins remaining along with remnants of six other buildings.

Baker Pass crosses the Continental Divide through the Never Summer Mountains and into the Michigan River drainage to the west of Mount Nimbusa drainage that feeds streams and rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Other mountain passes are La Poudre Pass and Thunder Pass, which was once used by stage coaches and is a route to Michigan Lakes. Little Yellowstone has geological features similar to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The Green Mountain trail once was a wagon road used to haul hay from Big Meadows. Flattop Mountain, which can be accessed from the eastern and western sides of the park, is near Green Mountain. Shadow Mountain Lookouta wildfire observation toweris on the National Register of Historic Places. Paradise Park Natural Area is an essentially hidden and protected wild area with no maintained trails penetrating it.

Skeleton Gulch, Cascade Falls, North Inlet Falls, Granite Falls, and Adams Falls are found in the west side of the park. The west side lakes include Bowen Lake, Lake Verna, Lake of the Clouds, Haynach Lakes, Timber Lake, Lone Pine Lake, Lake Nanita, and Lake Nokoni.

===Region 2: Alpine region===
Region 2 is the alpine region of the park with accessible tundra trails at high elevationsan area known for its spectacular vistas. Within this region is Mount Ida, with tundra slopes and a wide-open view of the Continental Divide. Forest Canyon Pass is near the top of the Old Ute Trail that once linked villages across the Continental Divide.

Chapin Pass trail traverses a dense forest to beautiful views of the Chapin Creek valley, proceeding onward above timberline to the western flank of Mount Chapin. Tundra Communities Trail, accessible from Trail Ridge Road, is a hike offering tundra views and alpine wildflowers. Other trails are Tombstone Ridge and Ute Trail, which starts at the tundra and is mostly downhill from Ute Crossing to Upper Beaver Meadows, with one backcountry camping site. Cache La Poudre River trail begins north of Poudre Lake on the west side of the valley near Milner Pass and heads downward toward the Mummy Pass trail junction. Lake Irene is a recreation and picnic area.

===Region 3: Wilderness===
Region 3, known for wilderness escape, is in the northern part of the park and is accessed from the Estes Park area.
The Mummy Range is a short mountain range in the north of the park. The Mummies tend to be gentler and more forested than the other peaks in the park, though some slopes are rugged and heavily glaciated, particularly around Ypsilon Mountain and Mummy Mountain. Bridal Veil Falls is a scenic point and trail accessible from the Cow Creek trailhead, at the Continental Divide Research Center. West Creek Falls and Chasm Falls, near Old Fall River Road, are also in this region. The Alluvial Fan trail leads to a bridge over the river that had been the site of the Lawn Lake Flood.

Lumpy Ridge Trail leads to Paul Bunyan&#x27;s Boot at about from the trailhead, then Gem Lake, and a further to Balanced Rock. Black Canyon Trail intersects Cow Creek Trail, forming part of the Gem Lake loop which goes through the old McGregor Ranch valley, passing Lumpy Ridge rock formations, with a loop hike that goes into the McGraw Ranch valley.

Cow Creek Trail follows Cow Creek, with its many beaver ponds, extending past the Bridal Falls turnoff as the Dark Mountain trail, then joining the Black Canyon trail to intersect the Lawn Lake trail shortly below the lake. North Boundary Trail connects to the Lost Lake trail system. North Fork Trail begins outside of the park in the Comanche Peak Wilderness before reaching the park boundary and ending at Lost Lake. Stormy Peaks Trail connects Colorado State University&#x27;s Pingree Park campus in the Comanche Peak Wilderness and the North Fork Trail inside the park.

Beaver Mountain Loop, also used by horseback riders, passes through forests and meadows, crosses Beaver Brook and several aspen-filled drainages, and has a great view of Longs Peak. Deer Mountain Trail gives a 360 degree view of eastern part of the park. The summit plateau of Deer Mountain offers expansive views of the Continental Divide. During the winter, the lower trail generally has little snow, though packed and drifted snow are to be expected on the switchbacks. Snow cover on the summit may be three to five feet deep, requiring the use of snowshoes or skis.

The trail to Lake Estes in Estes Park meanders through a bird sanctuary, beside a golf course, along the Big Thompson River and Fish Creek, through the lakeside picnic area and along the lakeshore. The trail is used by birdwatchers, bikers and hikers.

Lawn Lake Trail climbs to Lawn Lake and Crystal Lake, one of the parks deepest lakes, in the alpine ecosystem and along the course of the Roaring River. The river shows the massive damage caused by a dam failure in 1982 that claimed the lives of three campers. The trail is a strenuous snowshoe hike in the winter. Ypsilon Lake Trail leads to its namesake as well as Chipmunk Lake, with views of Longs Peak, while traversing pine forests with grouseberry and bearberry bushes. The trail also offers views of the canyon gouged out by rampaging water that broke loose from Lawn Lake Dam in 1982. Visible is the south face of Ypsilon Mountain, with its Y-shaped gash rising sharply from the shoreline.

Gem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide. Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.

===Region 4: Heart of the park===

Region 4 is the heart of the park with easy road and trail access, great views, and lake hikes including the most popular trails. Flattop Mountain is a tundra hike and the easiest hike to the Continental Divide in the park. Crossing over Flattop Mountain, the hike to Hallett Peak passes through three climate zones, traversing the ridge that supports Tyndall Glacier and finally ascending to the summit of Hallett Peak.

Bear Lake is a high-elevation lake in a spruce and fir forest at the base of Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain. Bierstadt Lake sits atop a lateral moraine named Bierstadt Moraine, and drains into Mill Creek. There are several trails that lead to Bierstadt Lake through groves of aspens and lodgepole pines. North of Bierstadt Moraine is Hollowell Park, a large and marshy meadow along Mill Creek. The Hollowell Park trail runs along Steep Mountain&#x27;s south side. Ranches, lumber and sawmill enterprises operated in Hollowell Park into the early 1900s.

Glacial Basin was the site of a resort run by Abner and Alberta Sprague, after whom Sprague Lake is named. The lake is a shallow body of water that was created when the Spragues dammed Boulder Brook to create a fish pond. Sprague Lake is a popular place for birdwatching, hiking and viewing the mountain peaks, along with camping at the Glacier Basin campground.
Dream Lake is one of the most-photographed lakes and is also noted for its winter snowshoeing. Emerald Lake is located directly below the saddle between Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain, only a short hike beyond Dream Lake. The shore of Lake Haiyaha (a Native American word for &quot;big rocks&quot;) is surrounded by boulders along with ancient, twisted and picturesque pine trees growing out of rock crevices. Nymph Lake is named for the yellow lily, &quot;Nymphaea polysepala&quot;, on its surface. Lake Helene is at the head of Odessa Gorge, east of Notchtop Mountain. Two Rivers Lake is found along the hike to Odessa Lake from Bear Lake, and has one backcountry campsite. The Cub Lake trail passes Big Thompson River, flowery meadows, and stands of pine and aspen trees. Ice and deep snow are present during the winter, requiring the use of skis or snowshoes.

The Fern Lake trail passes Arch Rock formations, The Pool, and the cascading water of Fern Falls. Two backcountry campsites are located near the lake, and two more are closer to the trailhead. Odessa Lake has two approaches: one is along the Flattop trail from Bear Lake while the other is from the Fern Lake trailhead, along which are Fern Creek, The Pool, Fern Falls, and Fern Lake itself. One backcountry campsite is available. Other lakes are Jewel Lake, Mills Lake, Black Lake, Blue Lake, Lake of Glass, Sky Pond, and Spruce Lake.

The Pool is a large turbulent water pocket formed below where Spruce and Fern Creeks join the Big Thompson River. The winter route is along a gravel road, which leads to a trail at the Fern Lake trailhead. Along the route are beaver-cut aspen, frozen waterfalls on the cliffs, and the Arch Rocks. The trail to Alberta Falls runs by Glacier Creek and Glacier Gorge.

Wind River Trail leaves the East Portal and follows the Wind River to join with the Storm Pass trail. There are three backcountry campsites. Other sites in the area are The Loch, Loch Vale, Mill Creek Basin, Andrews Glacier, Sky Point, Timberline Falls, Upper Beaver Meadows, and Storm Pass.

===Region 5: Waterfalls and backcountry===
Region 5, known for waterfalls and backcountry, is south of Estes Park and contains Longs Peakthe park&#x27;s iconic fourteenerand the Wild Basin area. Other peaks and passes include Lily Mountain, Estes Cone, Twin Sisters, Boulder-Grand Pass, and Granite Pass. Eugenia Mine operated about the late-19th to early-20th century, with some old equipment and a log cabin remaining. Sites and trails include Boulder Field, Wild Basin Trail, and Homer Rouse Memorial Trail.

Enos Mills, the main figure behind the creation of Rocky Mountain National Park, enjoyed walking to Lily Lake from his nearby cabin. Wildflowers are common in the spring and early summer. In the winter, the trail around the lake is often suitable for walking in boots, or as a short snowshoe or ski. Other lakes in the Wild Basin include Chasm Lake, Snowbank Lake, Lion Lakes 1 and 2, Thunder Lake, Ouzel Lake, Finch Lake, Bluebird Lake, Pear Lake, and Sandbeach Lake. Many of the lakes have backcountry campsites. Waterfalls include Ouzel Falls, Trio Falls, Copeland Falls, and Calypso Cascades.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Rocky Mountain National Park has a Subarctic climate with cool summers and year around precipitation (&quot;Dfc&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Bear Lake Ranger Station (9492 ft / 2893 m) is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -15.2 °F (-26.2 °C), and 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -16.1 °F (-26.7 °C) at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center (7825 ft / 2385 m).

The complex interactions of elevation, slope, exposure and regional-scale air masses determine the climate within the park, which is noted for its extreme weather patterns. A &quot;collision of air masses&quot; from several directions produces some of the key weather events in the region. When cold arctic air from the north meets warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at the Front Range, &quot;intense, very wet snowfalls with total snow depth measured in the feet&quot; accumulate in the park.

===Elevation===
Higher elevation areas within the park receive twice as much precipitation as lower elevation areas, generally in the form of deep winter snowfall. Arctic conditions are prevalent during the winter, with sudden blizzards, high winds, and deep snowpack. High country overnight trips require gear suitable for -35 °F or below.
The subalpine region does not begin to experience spring-like conditions until June. Wildflowers bloom from late June to early August.

Below , temperatures are often moderate, although nighttime temperatures are cool, as is typical of mountain weather. Spring comes to the montane area by early May, when wildflowers begin to bloom. Spring weather is subject to unpredictable changes in temperature and precipitation, with potential for snow along trails through May. In July and August, temperatures are generally in the 70s or 80s °F during the day, and as low as the 40s °F at night. Lower elevations receive rain as most of their summer precipitation.

Sudden dramatic changes in the weather may occur during the summer, typically due to afternoon thunderstorms that can cause as much as a 20 °F drop in temperature and windy conditions.

===Continental Divide===
The park&#x27;s climate is also affected by the Continental Divide, which runs northwest to southeast through the center of the park atop the high peaks. The Continental Divide creates two distinct climate patterns - one typical of the east side near Estes Park and the other associated with the Grand Lake area on the park&#x27;s west side. The west side of the park experiences more snow, less wind, and clear cold days during the winter months.

===Climate change study===
Rocky Mountain National Park was selected to participate in a climate change study, along with two other National Park Service areas in the Rocky Mountain region and three in the Appalachian Mountain region. The study began in 2011, orchestrated by members of the academic scientific community in cooperation with the National Park Service and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The stated objective: &quot;develop and apply decision support tools that use NASA and other data and models to assess vulnerability of ecosystems and species to climate and land use change and evaluate management options.&quot;

, the preceding one hundred years of records indicated an increase in the average annual temperature of approximately . The average low temperature has increased more than the average high temperature during the same time period. As a result of the temperature increase, snow is melting from the mountains earlier in the year, leading to drier summers and probably to an earlier, longer fire season. Since the 1990s, mountain pine beetles have reproduced more rapidly and have not died off at their previous mortality rate during the winter months. Consequently, the increased beetle population has led to an increased rate of tree mortality in the park.

The climate change study projects further temperature increases, with greater warming in the summer and higher extreme temperatures by 2050. Due to the increased temperature, there is a projected moderate increase in the rate of water evaporation. Reduced snowfallperhaps 15% to 30% less than current amountsand the elimination of surface hail, along with the higher likelihood of intense precipitation events are predicted by 2050. Droughts may be more likely due to increased temperatures, increased evaporation rates, and potential changes in precipitation.

==Geology==

Precambrian metamorphic rock formed the core of the North American continent during the Precambrian eon 4.5–1 billion years ago. During the Paleozoic era, western North America was submerged beneath a shallow sea, with a seabed composed of limestone and dolomite deposits many kilometers thick. Pikes Peak granite formed during the late Precambrian eon, continuing well into the Paleozoic era, when mass quantities of molten rock flowed, amalgamated, and formed the continents about 1 billion–300 million years ago. Concurrently, in the period from 500 to 300 million years ago, the region began to sink while lime and mud sediments were deposited in the vacated space. Eroded granite produced sand particles that formed stratalayers of sedimentin the sinking basin.

About 300 million years ago, the land was uplifted creating the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Fountain Formation was deposited during the Pennsylvanian period of the Paleozoic era, 290–296 million years ago. Over the next 150 million years, the mountains uplifted, continued to erode, and covered themselves in their own sediment. Wind, gravity, rainwater, snow, and glacial ice eroded the granite mountains over geologic time scales. The Ancestral Rockies were eventually buried under subsequent strata.
The Pierre Shale formation was deposited during the Paleogene and Cretaceous periods about 70 million years ago. The region was covered by a deep seathe Cretaceous Western Interior Seawaywhich deposited massive amounts of shale on the seabed. Both the thick stratum of shale and embedded marine life fossilsincluding ammonites and skeletons of fish and such marine reptiles as mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and extinct species of sea turtles, along with rare dinosaur and bird remainswere created during this time period. The area now known as Colorado was eventually transformed from being at the bottom of an ocean to dry land again, giving yield to another fossiliferous rock layer known as the Denver Formation.

At about 68 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise again due to the Laramide orogeny in the west. During the Cenozoic era, block uplift formed the present Rocky Mountains. The geologic composition of Rocky Mountain National Park was also affected by deformation and erosion during that era. The uplift disrupted the older drainage patterns and created the present drainage patterns.

===Glaciation===

Glacial geology in Rocky Mountain National Park can be seen from the mountain peaks to the valley floors. Ice is a powerful sculptor of this natural environment and large masses of moving ice are the most powerful tools. Telltale marks of giant glaciers can be seen all throughout the park. Streams and glaciations during the Quaternary period cut through the older sediment, creating mesa tops and alluvial plains, and revealing the present Rocky Mountains. The glaciation removed as much as of sedimentary rocks from earlier inland sea deposits. This erosion exposed the basement rock of the Ancestral Rockies. Evidence of the uplifting and erosion can be found on the way to Rocky Mountain National Park in the hogbacks of the Front Range foothills. Many sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras exist in the basins surrounding the park.

While the glaciation periods are largely in the past, the park still has several small glaciers. The glaciers include Andrews, Sprague, Tyndall, Taylor, Rowe, Mills, and Moomaw Glaciers.

==Ecology==


According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Rocky Mountain National Park encompasses three classifications; an Alpine tundra &amp; Barren (&quot;52&quot;) vegetation type with an Alpine tundra (&quot;11&quot;) vegetation form, a Western Spruce/Fir (&quot;15&quot;) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (&quot;3&quot;) vegetation form, and a Pine/Douglas fir (&quot;18&quot;) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (&quot;3&quot;) vegetation form.

Colorado has one of the most diverse plant and animal environments of the United States, partially due to the dramatic temperature differences arising from varying elevation levels and topography. In dry climates, the average temperature drops 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 foot increase in elevation (9.8 degrees Celsius per 1,000 meters). Most of Colorado is semi-arid with the mountains receiving the greatest amount of precipitation in the state.

The Continental Divide runs north to south through the park, creating a climatic division. Ancient glaciers carved the topography into a range of ecological zones. The east side of the Divide tends to be drier with heavily glaciated peaks and cirques. The west side of the park is wetter with more lush, deep forests.

There are four ecosystems, or zones, in Rocky Mountain National Park: montane, subalpine, alpine tundra, and riparian. The riparian zone occurs throughout all of the three other zones. Each individual ecosystem is composed of organisms interacting with one other and with their surrounding environment. Living organisms (biotic), along with the dead organic matter they produce, and the abiotic (non-living) environment that impacts those living organisms (water, weather, rocks, and landscape) are all members of an ecosystem.

The park was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1976 to protect its natural resources. The park&#x27;s biodiversity includes afforestation and reforestation, ecology, inland bodies of water, and mammals, while its ecosystems are managed for nature conservation, environmental education and public recreation purposes. The areas of research and monitoring include ungulate ecology and management, high-altitude revegetation, global change, acid precipitation effects, and aquatic ecology and management.

Despite the importance of preserving the park&#x27;s natural environment, the area suffers air pollution impacts from Front Range activities, even as the impacts of Denver&#x27;s infamous brown cloud have been reduced.

===Montane zone===

The montane ecosystem is at the lowest elevations in the park, between , where the slopes and large meadow valleys support the widest range of plant and animal life, including montane forests, grasslands, and shrublands. The area has meandering rivers and during the summer, wildflowers grow in the open meadows. Ponderosa pine trees, grass, shrubs and herbs live on dry, south-facing slopes. North-facing slopes retain moisture better than those that face south. The soil better supports dense populations of trees, like Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine. There are also occasional Engelmann spruce and blue spruce trees. Quaking aspens thrive in high-moisture montane soils. Other water-loving small trees like willows, grey alder, and water birch may be found along streams or lakeshores. Water-logged soil in flat montane valleys may be unable to support growth of evergreen forests. The following areas are part of the montane ecosystem: Moraine Park, Horseshoe Park, Kawuneeche Valley, and Upper Beaver Meadows.

Some of the mammals that inhabit the montane ecosystem include snowshoe hares, coyotes, cougars, beavers, mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep, black bears, and Rocky Mountain elk. During the fall, visitors often flock to the park to witness the elk rut.

===Subalpine zone===

From to , the montane forests give way to subalpine forests. Forests of fir and Engelmann spruce cover the mountainsides in subalpine areas. Trees grow straight and tall in the lower subalpine forests, but become shorter and more deformed the nearer they are to the tree line. At the tree line, seedlings may germinate on the lee side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection, with any further growth being more horizontal than vertical. The low growth of dense trees is called krummholz, which may become well-established and live for several hundred to a thousand years old.
In the subalpine zone, lodgepole pines and huckleberry have established themselves in previous burn areas. Crystal clear lakes and fields of wildflowers are hidden among the trees. Mammals of the subalpine zone include bobcats, cougars, coyotes, elk, mule deer, chipmunks, shrews, porcupines and yellow-bellied marmots. Black bears are attracted by the berries and seeds of subalpine forests. Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, Steller&#x27;s jay, mountain chickadee and yellow-rumped warbler are some of the many birds found in the subalpine zone. Sprague Lake and Odessa Lake are two of the park&#x27;s subalpine lakes.

===Alpine tundra===
Above tree line, at approximately , trees disappear and the vast alpine tundra takes over. Over one third of the park resides above the tree line, an area which limits plant growth due to the cold climate and strong winds. The few plants that can survive under such extreme conditions are mostly perennials. Many alpine plants are dwarfed at high elevations, though their occasional blossoms may be full-sized.
Cushion plants have long taproots that extend deep into the rocky soil. Their diminutive size, like clumps of moss, limits the effect of harsh winds. Many flowering plants of the tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or red-colored pigments capable of converting the sun&#x27;s light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer. Grasses and sedges are common where tundra soil is well-developed.

Non-flowering lichens cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed algal cells can photosynthesize at any temperature above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 °C), and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. Adaptations for survival amidst drying winds and cold temperatures may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects it remains very fragile. Footsteps can destroy tundra plants and it may take hundreds of years to recover. Mammals that live on the alpine tundra, or visit during the summer season, include bighorn sheep, elk, badgers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, and snowshoe hares. Birds include prairie falcons, white-tailed ptarmigans, and common ravens. Flowering plants include mertensia, sky pilot, alpine sunflowers, alpine dwarf columbine, and alpine forget-me-not. Grasses include kobresia, spike trisetum, spreading wheatgrass, and tufted hairgrass.

===Riparian zone===
The riparian ecosystem runs through the montane, subalpine, and alpine tundra zones and creates a foundation for life, especially for species that thrive next to streams, rivers, and lakes. The headwaters of the Colorado River, which provides water to many of the southwestern states, are located on the west side of the park. The Fall River, Cache la Poudre River and Big Thompson Rivers are located on the east side of the park. Just like the other ecosystems in the park, the riparian zone is affected by the climatic variables of temperature, precipitation, and elevation. Generally, riparian zones in valleys will have cooler temperatures than communities located on slopes and ridge tops. Depending on elevation, a riparian zone may have more or less precipitation than other riparian zones in the park, with the difference creating a shift in the types of plants and animals found in a specific zone.

===Wildlife===

Rocky Mountain National Park is home to many species of animals, including nearly seventy mammals and almost three hundred species of birds. This diversity is due to the park&#x27;s varying topography, which creates a variety of habitats. However, some species have been extirpated from the park, including gray wolf, wolverine, grizzly bear, and American bison. Moose are commonly seen in the park, but they were not historically recorded as being part of this particular area of the Rocky Mountains.

====Elk====
The park is home to some 2,000 to 3,000 elk in summer, and between 800 and 1,000 elk spend the winter within its boundaries. Because of lack of predators such as wolves, the National Park Service culls around 50 elk each winter. Overgrazing by elk has become a major problem in the park&#x27;s riparian areas, so much so that the NPS fences them out of many critical wetland habitats to let willows and aspens grow. The program seems to be working, as the deciduous wetland plants thrive within the fencing. Many people think the elk herd is too large, but are reluctant to reintroduce predators because of its proximity to large human populations and ranches.

====Other ungulates====

Many other ungulates reside in the park, including bighorn sheep, moose, and mule deer. Bison were eliminated from the park in the 1800s, as were pronghorn and moose, the latter of which was restored to the area in 1978. Moose are now frequently seen in the park, especially on the park&#x27;s west side. The park&#x27;s bighorn sheep population has recovered and is estimated at 350 animals.

====Predators====
The park is home to many predatory animals, including Canada lynx, foxes, bobcat, cougar, black bear, and coyotes. Wolves and grizzly bears were extirpated in the early 1900s. Most of these predators kill smaller animals, but mountain lions and coyotes kill deer and occasionally elk. Bears also eat larger prey. Moose have no predators in the park. Black bears are relatively uncommon in the park, numbering only 24–35 animals. They also have fewer cubs and the bears seem skinnier than they do in most areas. Canadian lynx are quite rare within the park, and they have probably spread north from the San Juan Mountains, where they were reintroduced in 1999. Cougars feed mainly on mule deer in the park, and live 10–13 years. Cougar territories can be as large as . Coyotes hunt both alone and in pairs, but occasionally hunt in packs. They mainly feed on rodents but occasionally bring down larger animals, including deer, and especially fawns and elk calves. Scat studies in Moraine Park showed that their primary foods were deer and rodents. They form strong family bonds and are very vocal.

==Recreational activities==
The park contains a network of trails that range from easy, paved paths suitable for all visitors including those with disabilities, to strenuous mountain trails for experienced, conditioned hikers as well as off-trail routes for backcountry hikes. Trails lead to more than 100 designated wilderness camping sites. From either the Bear Lake or Grand Lake trailheads, backpackers can hike a loop along the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail within the park. Most trails are for summer use only, since at other times of the year many trails are not safe due to weather conditions. Horseback riding is permitted on most trails, as are llamas and other pack animals.

Rock climbing and mountaineering opportunities include Lumpy Ridge, Hallett Peak, Chiefs Head Peak, and Longs Peak, the highest peak in the park, with the easiest route being the Keyhole Route. This one-way climb has an elevation gain of . The vast east face, including the area known as The Diamond, is home to many classic big wall rock climbing routes. Many of the highest peaks have technical ice and rock routes on them, ranging from short scrambles to long multi-pitch climbs. Bouldering is popular in the park as well, as it is often considered a &quot;mecca for boulderers around the world&quot;, particularly the Emerald Lake and Chaos Canyon areas.

Fishing is permitted at many of the park&#x27;s lakes and streams. Four trout species inhabit park waters: rainbow, brook, cutthroat, and German brown trout. The greenback cutthroat, once widespread in Eastern Colorado, is currently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

During the winter most of Trail Ridge Road is closed due to heavy snow, limiting motorized access to the edges of the park. Winter activities include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing which are possible from either the Estes Park or Grand Lake entrances. On the east side near Estes Park, skiing and snowshoeing trails are available off Bear Lake Road, such as the Bear Lake, Bierstadt Lake, and Sprague Lake trails and at Hidden Valley. Slopes for sledding are also available at Hidden Valley. The west side of the park near Grand Lake also has viable snowshoeing trails. Backcountry skiing and snowboarding can be enjoyed after climbing up one of the higher slopes, especially late in the snow season after avalanche danger has subsided and technical climbing remains also a possibility, although typically differing in style from the summer months.

==Hazards==

Encountering bears is a concern in much of the Rocky Mountains, including the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.

There have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. According to data from the National Park Service, there have been 77 fatalities at the park between 2007 and 2024, the majority of which were from accidental falls while hiking or climbing.

=== Wildfires ===
Wildfires have been recorded in Rocky Mountain National Park prior to its establishment in 1915. Some of the most notable wildfires include the Bear Lake Fire, which was started by a campfire that was not properly put out, and burned for two months in 1900. The Ouzel Fire in 1978 was caused naturally by lightning and was allowed to burn under supervision until it grew out of control and in total burned 1,050 acres of land. The Fern Lake Fire in 2012 was also caused by a campfire, the fire was intensified due to strong winds and drought in the area. Absence of fire in around Fern Lake for many centuries caused excessive dead trees and a thick layer of organic matter on the ground which fuelled the fire, ultimately leading to the it lasting for over two months, burning nearly 3,500 acres of land.

An increase in average temperature in the Rocky Mountain region has been correlated to a decrease in snowfall that melts earlier in the year, attributing to drier summers and longer fire seasons. Rocky Mountain National Park is expected to see one of the largest increases in number of wildfires for the United States, with an increase in both duration and intensity for wildfires in general across the nation.

Wildfires that have a higher burn severity can cause serious damage to an ecosystem. High-severity wildfires can cause soil degradation by affecting the soils’ ability to absorb and process water. They also cause an increase in erosion due to burning away vegetation that holds the soil to the ground, thus increasing the chances of flooding and mudslides that cause further damage in and around the affected areas. Ash from the fires also contributes significantly to air and water pollution.

Low-severity wildfires however are crucial to maintaining a balanced ecosystem and can help prevent the damaging high-severity wildfires by clearing away excess organic material that adds fuel to and amplifies the spread of more severe wildfires. While severe fires can negatively impact the soil, less severe wildfires can be beneficial as burning the nutrient-rich dead organic material helps to fertilize the soil. The smaller fires also clear room for new growth and can fight against invasive species encroachment in the park.

Many parks including Rocky Mountain National Park use small fires as means to prevent more severe fires from getting out of hand. Along with small, prescribed burns, other fuel management practices include removing low hanging branches and forest thinning in general. Scientists have been working hard to find a balance in wildfires, allowing them to work as a restorative ecological process while avoiding the damage and pollution that come with high-severity wildfires.

==Access==

The park may be accessed through Estes Park or via the western entrance at Grand Lake. Trail Ridge Road, also known as U.S. Route 34, connects the eastern and western sides of the park. The park has five visitor centers. The Alpine Visitor Center is located in the tundra environment along Trail Ridge Road, while Beaver Meadows and Fall River are both near Estes Park, with Kawuneeche in the Grand Lake area, and the Moraine Park Discovery Center near the Beaver Meadows entrance and visitor center.

===Trail Ridge Road and other roads===

Trail Ridge Road is long and connects the entrances in Grand Lake and Estes Park. Running generally eastwest through many hairpin turns, the road crosses Milner Pass through the Continental Divide at an elevation of . The highest point of the road is , with eleven miles of the road being above tree line which is approximately . The road is the highest continuously paved highway in the country, and includes many large turnouts at key points to stop and observe the scenery.

Most visitors to the park drive over the famous Trail Ridge Road, but other roads include Fall River Road and Bear Lake Road. The park is open every day of the year, weather permitting. Due to the extended winter season in higher elevations, Trail Ridge Road between Many Parks Curve and the Colorado River Trailhead is closed much of the year. The road is usually open again by Memorial Day and closes in mid-October, generally after Columbus Day. Fall River Road does not open until about July 4 and closes by, or in, October for vehicular traffic. Snow may also fall in sufficient quantities in higher elevations to require temporary closure of the roads into July, which is reported on the road status site.

===Estes Park===

Most visitors enter the park through the eastern entrances near Estes Park, which is about northwest of Denver. The most direct route to Trail Ridge Road is the Beaver Meadows entrance, located just west of Estes Park on U.S. Route 36, which leads to the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center and the park&#x27;s headquarters. North of the Beaver Meadows entrance station is the Fall River entrance, which also leads to Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road. There are three routes into Estes Park: I-25 to U.S. 34 west which runs alongside the Big Thompson River; U.S. 36 west (northwest) from Boulder connecting to U.S. 34 west; and the Peak to Peak Highway, also known as State Highway 7, from points south.

The nearest airport is Denver International Airport and the closest train station is the Denver Union Station. Estes Park may be reached by rental car or shuttle. During peak tourist season, there is free shuttle service within the park; additionally, the town of Estes Park provides shuttle service to Estes Park Visitor Center, surrounding campgrounds, and the Rocky Mountain National Park&#x27;s shuttles.

===Grand Lake===
Visitors may also enter at the western side of the park from U.S. 34 near Grand Lake. U.S. 34 is reached by taking U.S. 40 north from I-70. The closest railroad station is the Amtrak station in Granby, which is from the western entrance of the park. Taxi service is available into the park.

<text>Stephen McConnell Case (born August 21, 1958) is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist best known as the former chief executive officer and chairman of America Online (AOL). Case joined AOL&#x27;s predecessor company, Quantum Computer Services, as a marketing vice-president in 1985, became CEO of the company (renamed AOL) in 1991, and, at the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000, orchestrated with Gerald M. Levin the merger that created AOL Time Warner, described as &quot;the biggest train wreck in the history of corporate America.&quot;

Since resigning as chairman of the company in 2003, he has launched a venture-capital firm, Revolution LLC, based in Washington, D.C., and authored &quot;The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur&#x27;s Vision of the Future&quot;, which in 2016 became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book. In 2022 he published his second book, &quot;The Rise of the Rest: How Entrepreneurs in Surprising Places Are Building the New American Dream&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Steve Case was born and grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of Carol and Daniel Case. He graduated from the private Punahou School (Class of 1976) and attended Central Union Church.

Case graduated from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1980 with a degree in political science. For the next two years he worked as an assistant brand manager at Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1982 he joined Pizza Hut Inc. in Wichita, Kansas, serving as manager of new pizza marketing.

In January 1983, his older brother, Dan, an investment banker, introduced him to Bill von Meister, CEO of Control Video Corporation. The company was marketing a service called GameLine for the Atari 2600 video game console that allowed users to download games via a phone line and modem. After that meeting, von Meister hired Case as a marketing consultant. Later that year, the company nearly went bankrupt and one of its investors, Frank Caufield, brought in his friend Jim Kimsey as a manufacturing consultant. Case later joined the company as a full-time marketing employee.

In 1985 Quantum Computer Services, an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video. Kimsey became CEO of the newly renamed Quantum Computer Services and hired Case as vice president of marketing. In 1987 he promoted him again to executive vice president. Kimsey groomed Case to become chairman and CEO when Kimsey retired, and the transition formally took place in 1991 (CEO) and 1995 (chairman).

As part of the changes that gave birth to Quantum, Case changed the company&#x27;s strategy, creating an online service called Quantum Link (Q-Link for short) for the Commodore 64 in 1985 with programmer (and AOL co-founder) Marc Seriff. In 1988, Quantum began offering the AppleLink online service for Apple and PC Link for IBM compatible computers. In 1991 he changed the company name to America Online and merged the Apple and PC services under the AOL name; the new service reached 1 million subscribers by 1994, and Q-Link was terminated October 21 of that year.

AOL pioneered the concept of social media, as its focus from day one was on communication features such as chatrooms, instant messaging and forums. Case believed that the &quot;killer app&quot; was community — people interacting with each other — and that was the driver of much of AOL&#x27;s early success. By contrast, competitive services of the time such as Prodigy funded by IBM and Sears, focused on shopping, and CompuServe focused on being an information utility.
AOL&#x27;s strategy was to make online services available and accessible to the mass market by making them affordable, easy to use, useful and fun. At a time when competing services like CompuServe were charging for each minute of access (which varied based on modem speeds and added extra charges for premium services), AOL priced its service at $19.95 per month for unlimited use of basic tier services beginning in 1996. Within three years, AOL&#x27;s userbase grew to 10 million, ultimately reaching 26.7 million users at its peak in 2002.

Among many initiatives in the early years of AOL, Case personally championed many innovative online interactive titles and games, including graphical chat environments Habitat (1986) and Club Caribe (1989), the first online interactive fiction series QuantumLink Serial by Tracy Reed (1988), Quantum Space, the first fully automated Play by email game (1989), and the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons title &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, the first Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text (1991).

After a decade of quick growth, AOL merged with media giant Time Warner in 2001, creating one of the world&#x27;s largest media, entertainment and communications companies. The $164 billion acquisition was completed in January 2001 but quickly ran into trouble as part of the dot-com recession, compounded by accounting scandals. Case announced his resignation as chairman in January 2003, although he remained on the company&#x27;s board of directors for almost three more years.

The failure of the AOL-Time Warner merger is the subject of a book by Nina Munk entitled &quot;Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner&quot; (2005). A photo of Case and Time Warner&#x27;s Jerry Levin embracing at the announcement of the merger appears on the cover.

In 2005, Case wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s now my view that it would be best to &#x27;undo&#x27; the merger by splitting Time Warner into several independent companies and allowing AOL to set off on its own path.&quot;

Case resigned from the Time-Warner board of directors in October 2005, to spend more time working on Revolution LLC, a D.C.-based investment firm he founded in April 2005. Revolution and its related funds have invested in more than 200 companies. Revolution has committed to investing a majority of its capital outside Silicon Valley

He is also chairman of the Case Foundation, which he and his wife Jean Case created in 1997. In 2011, Steve and Jean Case were honored as Citizens of the Year by the National Conference on Citizenship and interviewed by Stephanie Strom of &quot;The New York Times&quot; about their record of service and philanthropic endeavors.

In 1999, Case received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His award was presented by Awards Council member Jim Kimsey. Case was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2011, he was appointed as a Citizen Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, and became Chair of the Regents in 2020. Case was a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. In May 2014, Case received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Georgetown University.

== Investments ==
Following his departure from AOL, Case founded Revolution LLC in 2005. Early investments include Revolution Money, HelloWallet, AddThis, Zipcar, Living Social, and luxury travel club Exclusive Resorts. These last three were considered early bets on the new Web economy, and were early examples of what is now referred to as the &#x27;sharing economy.&#x27; Zipcar went public in April 2011, earning a market valuation of more than $1 billion before being acquired by Avis Budget Group in January 2013.

Case also believed he could change the healthcare system in the US and founded Revolution Health Group in April 2005. After a number of acquisitions but disappointing results, the company merged with Waterfront Media in October 2008.

Other exits include the purchase of Revolution Money by American Express in 2009 for $300 million, and on May 29, 2014 MorningStar announced plans to acquire HelloWallet for an undisclosed amount. Additionally, Case recognized another successful exit when Towers Watson acquired early exchange pioneer Extend Health for $435 million in May, 2012.

In 2011, Case, along with Ted Leonsis, launched the $450 million Revolution Growth fund. The fund&#x27;s investments to date include Bigcommerce, Custom Ink, Echo360, FedBid, Handy, Lolly Wolly Doodle, Optoro, Orchard, Resonate, Revolution Foods, Sweetgreen, Sparefoot, Bedrock Manufacturing, LDiscovery, Interactions, Cava, DraftKings, Sportradar, Tala, Tempus, TalkSpace and Uptake. In 2013, he launched the Revolution Ventures fund with Tige Savage and David Golden. Revolution Ventures has invested in BenchPrep, Booker, Busbud, Framebridge, Homesnap, Insikt, OrderUp, RunKeeper, MemberSuite, PolicyGenius, Paro, Bloomscape and Bright Cellars. In 2017, Case launched the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, investing in companies outside of San Francisco, New York and Boston. The fund has invested in companies across 78 cities and 35 states. Case has also invested directly in other companies, such as Kenyan solar provider M-kopa.

Case controls tens of thousands of acres of land in Hawaii, including a controlling interest in Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Company, and Grove Farm, obtained in a highly controversial transaction which led to years of litigation by the farm&#x27;s previous owners.

==Third Wave==
Case wrote &quot;The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur&#x27;s Vision of the Future&quot; in 2016. In the book, he argues innovations in technology will transform the Internet of Things to the Internet of &quot;Everything&quot;, change the way society thinks about work and challenging the biggest industries in the world.

He calls the new era the &quot;Third Wave&quot; of the internet. The &quot;first wave&quot; saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the internet. The &quot;second wave&quot; saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Instagram leveraged the smartphone revolution. Case says we&#x27;re entering the &quot;Third Wave,&quot; a period when entrepreneurs will leverage technologies to finally disrupt &quot;real world&quot; sectors like health, education, transportation, and energy - and in the process change the way people live their daily lives. Entrepreneurs, large corporations and governments will need to have a new mindset and skills in order to be successful in this new era.

In the &quot;Third Wave,&quot; Case also predicts the rise of startup ecosystems outside of California, New York and Boston. What he calls The Rise of the Rest. A confluence of the industry expertise in these regions, technological innovations and public policy changes makes it easier to start and scale a business anywhere.

==Political views and advocacy==
Steve Case has long advocated for policies that support the rise of startups. In 2012, he advocated for the bipartisan Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, which legalized crowdfunding for early stage companies and included reforms to make it easier for younger companies to make initial public offerings. Congress passed the bill with bipartisan support and it was signed into law on April 5, 2012.

Steve Case is also a staunch supporter of opportunity zones, and is credited for having helped pass them as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed by President Trump. Case stated that he believes the policy will help create real estate incentives to create the infrastructure co-working space needed to attract entrepreneurs. He referred to the policy as a &quot;game changer,&quot; stating that opportunity zones will be a &quot;terrific place for entrepreneurs to cluster.&quot; In a 2019 interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, Case stated that Trump&#x27;s passage of opportunity zones was a &quot;step in the right direction in trying to get more money from the coasts to other parts of the country.&quot; 

Case is an avid advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that easing restraints on immigration is necessary for America&#x27;s future entrepreneurial economy. He particularly emphasizes the impact that reform would have on recent engineering graduates and the tech sector.

Case contends that making it easier for foreign students educated in America to stay post graduation is vital to winning the war for talent, given the sheer high demand for engineers and entrepreneurs and current visa rules preventing tech companies from hiring the best foreign talent. He argues not only for reforming the H-1B visa program, but also implementing a Startup Visa program that welcomes immigrant entrepreneurs with proven ideas to launch their startups in the United States. Case traditionally has avoided politics, quietly building nonpartisan relationships with both Democrats and Republicans.

Fueled by concern that Donald Trump&#x27;s restrictive immigration policies would result in loss of jobs as many Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children he made an exception to remaining nonpartisan by endorsing Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidency. However, in 2017, Case met with President Trump stating that he appreciates &quot;that the administration wants to connect with the men and women that are leading Silicon Valley’s/New York’s tech giants.&quot; In 2024, Case stated that he &quot;was pleased to hear President Trump express his support for issuing green cards to noncitizen graduates of U.S. colleges and universities earlier this year.&quot; In 2019, Case praised a portion of Donald Trump&#x27;s State of the Union address, stating the importance of &quot;focusing on greatness and not gridlock.&quot;

In a 2022 interview with Kara Swisher, Case indicated his preference for a nonpartisan approach to advocacy, and emphasized the importance of bringing Republicans and Democrats together over conversations that transcend the traditional partisan political divide, such as efforts to improve the start-up ecosystem. 

In 2017, Case also hired J.D. Vance to work at Revolution LLC to help advance his effort to promote startup growth in parts of the United States outside of major tech hubs like Silicon Valley, Boston, and New York City. After Vance was elected Vice President, Case wrote on November 8th, 2024 that everybody having access to the benefits of entrepreneurship and innovation is something &quot;[he] knows[s] vice-president-elect JD Vance cares about.&quot;

== Family ==
His father, Daniel H. Case, is the founding partner of the Hawaiian law firm of Case Lombardi &amp; Pettit. His mother Carol was an elementary school teacher. His parents had three other children. His brother Dan died from brain cancer at the age of 44 in June 2002.

Case is a cousin of Ed Case, who served as a Hawaii congressman from 2002 to 2007 and since 2019.

In 1985, Case married Joanne Barker whom he had met while attending Williams College. The couple had three children and divorced in 1996. Two years later, in 1998, he married former AOL executive Jean Villanueva in a ceremony officiated by Billy Graham.

Case donated $10 million to Punahou School to build a junior high school named after his parents. He is a Christian.

<text>Situated ethics, often confused with situational ethics, is a view of applied ethics in which abstract standards from a culture or theory are considered to be far less important than the ongoing processes in which one is personally and physically involved, e.g. climate, ecosystem, etc. It is one of several theories of ethics within the philosophy of action.

There are also situated theories of economics, e.g. most green economics, and of knowledge, usually based on some situated ethics. All emphasize the actual physical, geographical, ecological and infrastructural state the actor is in, which determines that actor&#x27;s actions or range of actions - all deny that there is any one point of view from which to apply standards of or by authority. This makes such theories unpopular with authority, and popular with those who advocate political decentralisation.

==Embodiment==

Humans pass through Kohlberg/Gilligan&#x27;s stages of moral development. Up to stage 3 (Conventional morality:Good Interpersonal Relationships), these stages are compatible with embodiment. Most philosophy of law emphasizes that the fact that bodies take risk to enforce laws, make laws embodied at least to the degree they are enforced.

However, the stages become problematic when Lawrence Kohlberg posits a universal ethics - that is, a disembodied ethic. All ethical decisions are necessarily situated in a world. Carol Gilligan&#x27;s view is closer to an embodied view and emphasizes ethical relationships - necessarily between bodies - over universal ethical principles that require a &quot;God&#x27;s Eye view&quot;. Some ethicists emphasize the role of the ethicist to sort out right versus right in a given context. This is stage 4 but assumes that the ethicist is hesitant to damage relationships or violate principles, e.g. that survival or human rights take precedence over property rights.

<doc id="285974" wikidata="Q406643" url="?curid=285974" title="AirAsia">
<text>Capital A Berhad (), operating as AirAsia (stylised as airasia) is a Malaysian multinational low-cost airline headquartered near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Established in 1993 and commencing operations in 1996, the airline is the largest in Malaysia by fleet size and destinations. It operates scheduled domestic and international flights to over 166 destinations across 25 countries. Its primary hub is Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), where it operates from Terminal 2, the low-cost carrier terminal.

AirAsia has a network of affiliate airlines catering to regional markets, including Thai AirAsia, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippines AirAsia and AirAsia Cambodia, which have bases in cities including Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila and Phnom Penh. AirAsia X, the airline’s long-haul subsidiary, primarily serves long-distance routes. In addition to passenger services, AirAsia manages Teleport, its dedicated freight division. Together, these carriers form an extensive network connecting Southeast Asia with other parts of Asia, Australia and the Middle East.
==History==
=== 1993-2001: Foundation and Early Years===
AirAsia was established on December 20, 1993, by DRB-HICOM, a Malaysian government-owned conglomerate, as a full-service carrier. The airline commenced operations on November 18, 1996, with its inaugural flight from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi, utilising a Boeing 737-300. In its early years, AirAsia faced challenges such as high operating costs and competition from established carriers like Malaysia Airlines.
By the late 1990s, AirAsia had accumulated substantial debts, amounting to approximately MYR 40 million (around US$10.5 million). Efforts to stabilise the airline included route expansion, leasing aircraft for Hajj charters and internal discussions about potential management changes.

However, these initiatives were insufficient to address the airline&#x27;s structural issues. The situation deteriorated further following the global aviation downturn after the September 11 attacks. By September 2001, AirAsia’s debt had risen to around US$11 million, leaving the company on the brink of collapse.

===2001-2002: Transformation into a Low-Cost Carrier===
On September 5, 2001, Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun acquired AirAsia through their company Tune Air Sdn Bhd for a nominal sum of one ringgit (approximately US$0.26), taking on its considerable liabilities. Fernandes, a former executive at Time Warner (now known as Warner Bros. Discovery), saw an opportunity to transform AirAsia into a low-cost carrier, inspired by the success of airlines such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair. This acquisition marked a turning point in AirAsia’s history, setting the stage for its reinvention as a budget airline.

After the acquisition, Fernandes and his team rebranded the airline as a low-cost carrier on January 15, 2002. This strategic shift involved adopting a no-frills service model, enabling AirAsia to offer fares that were significantly lower than those of its competitors, particularly Malaysia Airlines. Promotional fares began as low as MYR 10 (approximately US$2.63), which attracted a large number of passengers. 

In its first year under the low-cost model, AirAsia achieved profitability, marking a significant recovery from its previous financial challenges. The airline focused on point-to-point routes and utilised secondary airports, which helped lower operational costs and improve overall efficiency.

===2003-2006: Entry into New Markets ===

Between 2003 and 2006, AirAsia embarked on a rapid expansion of its routes and infrastructure. In December 2003, the airline established a second hub at Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru, expanding its operational reach. AirAsia also began its international operations with flights to Phuket in December 2003, followed by services to Bangkok in February 2004. By April 2005, the airline further broadened its network by adding Manila and Xiamen to its destinations.

AirAsia was also quick to embrace technological advancements, becoming a pioneer in the region. In 2002, the airline introduced ticketless travel via online bookings, becoming the first airline in Asia to do so. This innovation revolutionized ticket purchasing. Additionally, the airline launched SMS booking services, allowing customers to book flights directly from their mobile phones.

The growth of affiliate airlines played a key role in AirAsia’s expansion strategy. In 2003, Thai AirAsia was founded, and in 2005, Indonesia AirAsia was launched. These affiliates allowed the airline to enter new markets, strengthening its regional presence across Southeast Asia. 

By the end of 2006, AirAsia’s fleet had seen substantial growth, consisting of 35 Boeing 737-300s and eight Airbus A320s. Additionally, the airline placed orders for 100 more Airbus A320 aircraft, which helped increase its capacity and frequency of flights, supporting its expanding network.

===2006-2012: Market Expansion and Hub Development===

In late 2006, AirAsia&#x27;s CEO Tony Fernandes introduced a five-year plan designed to strengthen the airline&#x27;s presence across Asia. The strategy focused on enhancing connectivity between existing destinations and expanding into new markets such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Southern China and India. As part of this effort, Kota Kinabalu became a hub on 7 July 2006, followed by Kuching on 20 July 2006. These initiatives led to a significant increase in passenger traffic, with AirAsia carrying about 13.9 million passengers in 2007, compared to 5.7 million in 2006.

AirAsia expanded its offerings further in 2009 by launching Redbox, the world’s first low-cost courier service. The same year, the airline began flights from Penang to Hong Kong, adding Penang as another hub in its network.

In 2011, AirAsia entered into a controversial share swap agreement with Malaysia Airlines, aiming to reduce competition between the two carriers. However, due to regulatory concerns, this partnership was dissolved in early 2012, marking a setback for AirAsia&#x27;s ambitions to strengthen its domestic market. Despite this, the airline remained committed to its strategy of expanding its regional and international networks.

===2013-2019: Strategic Developments and Challenges===

Between 2013 and 2019, AirAsia continued its expansion strategy, both by launching new routes and growing its affiliate network. Notably, the airline established Philippines AirAsia and AirAsia Japan in 2012, followed by AirAsia India in 2014. Despite its focus on growth, AirAsia’s efforts to establish airlines in countries such as China, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam were hindered by various challenges and practical constraints.

In 2014, AirAsia made another significant advancement by becoming the first Malaysian airline to offer onboard Wi-Fi services through its subsidiary, Tune Box. This innovation responded to the increasing demand for connectivity among travelers, reinforcing AirAsia&#x27;s reputation as a leader in in-flight services.

By 2018, AirAsia introduced Teleport, a logistics venture under its digital division, to enhance its cargo and e-commerce capabilities. Teleport has since become a significant logistics provider, utilising AirAsia’s network to serve businesses and e-commerce platforms across Asia Pacific and beyond, including key hubs such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Incheon, Narita, Bangalore and Sydney.

During this period, AirAsia continued to earn accolades for its service quality, further solidifying its position as a leading low-cost airline. The airline was awarded the title of World&#x27;s Best Low-Cost Airline by Skytrax for an impressive eleven consecutive years, from 2009 to 2019.

=== 2020–2023: Navigating the Pandemic and Recovery ===

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the global aviation industry, and AirAsia was no exception. In March 2020, the airline suspended most of its flights due to travel restrictions, resulting in significant revenue losses. This unprecedented situation forced AirAsia to rapidly adapt in order to survive. The airline grounded its fleet and implemented various cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and salary reductions for employees. AirAsia also focused on maintaining liquidity by securing loans and receiving government support.

During this challenging period, AirAsia accelerated its digital transformation. In late 2020, the airline launched the Airasia Super App, diversifying its business model beyond air travel to include services such as food delivery, e-commerce and logistics. This move was aimed at adapting to changing consumer behaviors and maintaining a steady revenue stream in the face of reduced air travel.

As vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions began to ease in 2021, AirAsia gradually resumed its operations. The airline restarted domestic flights within Malaysia in April 2021, focusing initially on rebuilding its domestic network before reintroducing international routes. By late 2022, AirAsia began reinstating international routes, prioritizing key markets within ASEAN and beyond. The airline targeted popular destinations in Thailand, Indonesia and India to restore its pre-pandemic network.

AirAsia&#x27;s recovery continued throughout 2022, as demand for travel rebounded. By the end of the year, the airline had carried approximately 9.95 million passengers. In 2023, AirAsia significantly increased its capacity, with a nine-fold increase in available seats compared to the previous year. This expansion was driven by the resumption of routes and the addition of new aircraft to its fleet. Additionally, the airline expanded its international network by reintroducing routes between Thailand and China, capitalizing on the growing demand from travelers eager to visit these popular destinations.

=== 2024–Present: Strategic Reorganisation and Global Ambitions ===

On 8 January 2024, AirAsia X signed a non-binding agreement with Capital A to fully acquire AirAsia Bhd and AirAsia Aviation Group Limited (AAAGL), which oversees AirAsia’s affiliates outside Malaysia. The plan involves merging AirAsia Malaysia, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippines AirAsia and AirAsia Cambodia under the AirAsia X brand. Initially, the creation of a new entity, AirAsia Group Berhad, was proposed, but by August 2024, the decision was made to directly acquire AirAsia and AAAGL instead. This acquisition, expected to be finalized by the end of 2024, is projected to provide access to over 200 aircraft and 361 future aircraft orders from Capital A&#x27;s aviation portfolio, integrating narrow-body and wide-body aircraft into a unified fleet. This enhanced fleet aims to improve operational efficiency, expand service offerings and bolster AirAsia’s competitive position across key market segments.

In March 2024, AirAsia launched its first flights to Perth in Australia using Airbus A321neo aircraft. This marked a milestone as the airline expanded its reach beyond Asia, a role previously handled by its long-haul affiliate, AirAsia X. By late 2024, AirAsia outlined ambitious plans to position Kuala Lumpur International Airport as a key global aviation hub. As part of this expansion strategy, the airline aims to increase its fleet size from 79 to 92 aircraft by the end of 2024, while boosting daily flights from 230 to 258. Additionally, AirAsia plans to add eight new destinations to its network, bringing the total number of destinations to 106, up from 98.
To support its operational growth, AirAsia is considering acquiring up to 100 smaller regional aircraft to enhance its fleet diversity and efficiency. Discussions are underway with Airbus, Comac and Embraer, with potential options including the Airbus A220, Comac C919 and Embraer E2 families. These aircraft would complement AirAsia&#x27;s existing Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft, enabling the airline to better serve secondary routes and adapt to market demands.

As part of its restructuring, Capital A, AirAsia&#x27;s parent company, took significant steps to resolve its financial challenges. Capital A had been classified under Practice Note 17 (PN17) due to financial difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. PN17 is a status issued by Malaysia’s stock exchange, Bursa Malaysia, to companies facing financial distress, requiring them to submit a recovery plan to remain publicly listed. In December 2024, Capital A submitted its proposed regularisation plan to exit PN17, which includes a reduction of accumulated losses and the disposal of its aviation businesses to AirAsia X. The company aims to complete the process and exit PN17 by the first quarter of 2025, once all necessary approvals are in place. This move is designed to restore the company’s financial health, improve investor confidence and support long-term growth.

Looking beyond the immediate future, AirAsia’s long-term vision focuses on expanding its reach to strategic markets across the Pacific and East Asia, with further ambitions to enter Africa, Europe and North America by 2030. This global expansion strategy underscores AirAsia&#x27;s aim to enhance its position as a leading low-cost carrier, connecting more regions and catering to a broader, international customer base.

==Destinations==
AirAsia has rapidly expanded its domestic and international network since its rebranding as a low-cost carrier in 2001. The airline&#x27;s primary hub is located at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), where it operates a substantial portion of its flights. AirAsia operates a broad domestic network within Malaysia, connecting numerous cities and regional hubs across the country. Key destinations include major cities like Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching. 

Internationally, AirAsia operates numerous routes across Southeast Asia and beyond, offering destinations in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and mainland China. The airline has also expanded into other regions, including India and Australia. This broad network has enabled AirAsia to become a significant player in the regional and international aviation markets, catering to both business and leisure travelers.

In addition to its primary operations at KLIA’s low-cost terminal, AirAsia (Malaysia) has developed secondary hubs to enhance regional connectivity. These hubs include Penang International Airport which acts as a gateway in northern Peninsular Malaysia, Kota Kinabalu International Airport and Kuching International Airport facilitating travel in Malaysian Borneo and Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru, which serves the southern region of Peninsular Malaysia and provides convenient access to and from Singapore. Together, these hubs play a vital role in supporting AirAsia’s extensive network, ensuring that the airline can efficiently serve its domestic and international markets.

===Private aircraft===
===Fleet renewal and development===

Previously operating the Boeing 737-300, AirAsia has now completely converted to the Airbus A320 family.

In June 2011, AirAsia ordered 200 Airbus A320neos at the Paris Air Show. The planes were originally due to become available in 2015, and the deal was one of the largest ever for commercial aircraft in a single order. The deal was worth US$18 billion at list prices, although AirAsia will have obtained a substantial discount from those prices. The deal makes AirAsia Airbus&#x27; single biggest customer. On 13 December 2012, AirAsia placed an order for an additional 100 Airbus A320 jets, splitting it between 64 A320neo and 36 A320ceo.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.airbus.com/presscentre&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Farnborough International Air Show in 2016, AirAsia ordered 100 A321neos at an estimated cost of US$12.6 Billion dollars at list prices. AirAsia planned to fly these larger aircraft to airports that had infrastructure constraints. AirAsia received its first A320neo in September 2016.

At the 2019 Farnborough Air Show, AirAsia further increased its orders for A320 aircraft, in the process also becoming Airbus&#x27; largest customer for the A321neo variant. With this order, the total number of orders that AirAsia had placed for the Airbus A320 family climbed to 592, reaffirming the carrier&#x27;s position also as the largest airline customer for the Airbus single aisle product line. However, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, the orders for the new A320 family of aircraft were reworked by mutual agreement between AirAsia and Airbus in October 2021, with deliveries now scheduled to extend to 2035, among other undisclosed changes in purchase terms.

===Former fleet===
AirAsia formerly operated the following aircraft:

==Services==
===On board===

AirAsia offers &quot;Santan&quot; menu, with options to buy on board offering food, drinks, merchandise and duty free for purchase. Pre-purchase of &quot;Santan&quot; meals is available at a lower price than on board, and with additional options AirAsia is accredited by the KL Syariah Index of Bursa Malaysia, and in accordance with Shariah principles, it does not serve alcohol or pork. However, this applies only to the regional AirAsia group flights, and not to the AirAsia X flights, which do sell wine and beer on board.

===Frequent-flyer program===
AirAsia has launched a programme called &quot;AirAsia rewards&quot;, formerly known as “BIG”. Under this programme, it will issue loyalty points to AirAsia customers and third-party merchants. Points can then be used to redeem AirAsia flights.

==Corporate affairs==

The head office is the Red Quarters (RedQ) at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Selangor. This facility also serves as the company&#x27;s registered office.

The airline has moved its head office to a new , RM140mil facility constructed at klia2 on 7 November 2016. Until the new head office opened, the airline&#x27;s head office was located in the KLIA LCCT. The new klia2 head office has been scheduled to open at the end of 2015. The former registered office was on level 13 of the Menara Prima Tower B in Petaling Jaya.

RedQ is scheduled to hold about 2,000 AirAsia and AirAsia X employees. Aireen Omar, the AirAsia Country CEO of Malaysia, stated that the headquarters needed to be redesigned because in the klia2 plans the location of the control tower had been changed. Construction on the facility was scheduled to begin in July 2014. Malaysia Airports Holdings is leasing the land that will be occupied by the headquarters. January Ann Baysa, an AirAsia X flight attendant from the Philippines, gave the building the name &quot;RedQuarters&quot; or &quot;RedQ&quot;. Its groundbreaking ceremony was held in November 2014.

==Criticism and controversy==
=== Barisan Nasional-themed flight ===
Before the 2018 Malaysian general election, AirAsia received criticism for seemingly backing Najib Razak and his Barisan Nasional coalition, a move seen as politically incorrect by some political commentators. Najib was seen returning from Sabah to Kuala Lumpur after a campaign trip on an AirAsia flight together with AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes. The aeroplane that Najib flew was draped in the blue of BN with the air stewardesses dressed in that same blue, instead of the typical AirAsia red. The words &quot;Hebatkan Negaraku&quot; (English: &quot;Make my country greater&quot;) can also be seen across the fuselage of the aeroplane. After Najib was defeated in the general election, Tony Fernandes issued an apology, claiming that he had buckled under the intense pressure from Najib&#x27;s government.

===Other controversies and issues===
In 2007, passengers from &quot;The Barrier-Free Environment and Accessible Transport Group&quot; protested against the airline over its refusal to fly passengers who were completely immobile. They claimed that people with disabilities were discriminated against when booking tickets online; the CEO of the airline said it did not turn away passengers in wheelchairs.

<doc id="285979" wikidata="Q13405132" url="?curid=285979" title="Hindu reform movements">
<text>Contemporary groups, collectively termed Hindu reform movements, reform Hinduism, neo-Hinduism, or Hindu revivalism, strive to introduce regeneration and reform to Hinduism, both in a religious or spiritual and in a societal sense. The movements started appearing during the Bengali Renaissance.

==History==

From the 18th century onward, India was colonised by the British. This process of colonisation had a huge impact on Indian society: social and religious leaders tried to assimilate into Western culture and modernise Hindu culture.

==Social reform movements==
In social work, Swami Vivekananda, Dayananda Saraswati, Mahatma Gandhi, Vinoba Bhave, Baba Amte and Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar have been most important. Sunderlal Bahuguna created the &quot;chipko&quot; movement for the preservation of forestlands according to the Hindu ecological ideas. The less accessible Vedas were rejected and parallel Vachanas were compiled.

==Religious movements==
===Brahmo Samaj===
The Brahmo Samaj is a social and religious movement founded in Kolkata in 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy. The Brahmo Samaj movement thereafter resulted in the Brahmo religion in 1850 founded by Debendranath Tagore, better known as the father of Rabindranath Tagore.

==== Brahmo Samaj of South India ====
The faith and Principles of Brahmo Samaj had spread to South Indian states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala with many followers.

In Kerala the faith and principles of Brahmosamaj and Raja Ram Mohun Roy had been propagated by Ayyathan Gopalan, and reform activities had been led by establishing Brahmosamaj in 1898 in the Calicut (now Kozhikode) region. Gopalan was a doctor by profession, but dedicated his life to Brahmosamaj, and was an active executive member of the Calcutta Sadharan Brahmosamaj until his death.

===Arya Samaj===
The Arya Samaj is a monotheistic Hindu reform movement founded in India by Maharshi Dayananda in 1875 at Bombay. He was an ascetic who believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas. 

It aimed to be a universal structure based on the authority of the Vedas. Dayananda stated that he wanted &#x27;to make the world noble&#x27;, i.e., to return Hinduism to its universality of the Vedas. To this end, the Arya Samaj started Shuddhi movement in early 20th century to bring back Hinduism to people converted to Islam and Christianity, set up schools and missionary organisations, and extended its activities outside India. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India in his book, The Discovery of India credits Arya Samaj in introducing proselytization in Hinduism.

===Ramakrishna Movement===

Swami Vivekananda was a central personality in the development of another stream of Hinduism in late 19th century and the early 20th century that reconciled the devotional (&quot;bhakti-märga&quot;) path of his guru Sri Ramakrishna (of the Puri dashanami sampradäya) with the &quot;gnana märga&quot; (path of knowledge). His ideals and sayings have inspired numerous Indians as well as non-Indians, Hindus as well as non-Hindus. Among the prominent figures whose ideals were very much influenced by them were Rabindranath Tagore, Gandhi, Subhas Bose, Satyendranath Bose, Megh Nad Saha, Sister Nivedita, and Sri Aurobindo.

<doc id="285980" wikidata="Q887484" url="?curid=285980" title="Orval Faubus">
<text>Orval Eugene Faubus ( ; January 7, 1910 – December 14, 1994) was an American politician who served as the 36th Governor of Arkansas from 1955 to 1967, as a member of the Democratic Party. In 1957, he refused to comply with a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1954 case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent black students from attending Little Rock Central High School. This event became known as the Little Rock Crisis. He was elected to six two-year terms as governor.

==Early life and career==
Orval Eugene Faubus was born in the northwest corner of Arkansas near the village of Combs to John Samuel and Addie (née Joslen) Faubus. Although Sam Faubus was a socialist, and enrolled Orval at the socialist Commonwealth College, the latter went on to pursue a very different political path from that of his father.

Faubus&#x27;s first political race was in 1936 when he contested a seat in the Arkansas House of Representatives, which he lost. He was urged to challenge the result but declined, which earned him the gratitude of the Democratic Party. As a result, he was elected circuit clerk and recorder of Madison County, a post he held for two terms.

His book, &quot;In This Faraway Land&quot;, documents the military period of his life. He was active in veterans&#x27; causes for the remainder of his life. When Faubus returned from the war, he cultivated ties with leaders of Arkansas&#x27; Democratic Party, particularly with progressive reform Governor Sid McMath, leader of the post-war &quot;GI Revolt&quot; against corruption, under whom he served as director of the state&#x27;s highway commission. Meanwhile, conservative Francis Cherry defeated McMath&#x27;s bid for a third term in the 1952 Democratic primary. Cherry became unpopular with voters, and Faubus challenged him in the 1954 primary.

==1954 gubernatorial election==
In the 1954 campaign, Faubus was compelled to defend his attendance at the defunct Commonwealth College in Mena, as well as his early political upbringing. Commonwealth College had been formed by leftist academic and social activists, some of whom later were revealed to have had close ties with the Communist Party USA. Most of those who attended and taught there were idealistic young people who sought an education or, in the case of the faculty, a job which came with room and board.

===Democratic primary===
During the runoff, Cherry and his surrogates accused Faubus of having attended a &quot;communist&quot; school and implied that his sympathies remained leftist. Faubus at first denied attending, and then admitted enrolling &quot;for only a few weeks&quot;. Later, it was shown that he had remained at the school for more than a year, earned good grades, and was elected student body president. Faubus led a group of students who testified on behalf of the college&#x27;s accreditation before the state legislature. Nevertheless, efforts to paint the candidate as a communist sympathizer backfired in a climate of growing resentment against such allegations. Faubus narrowly defeated Cherry to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Relations were cool between the two men for years, but when Cherry died in 1965, Faubus put politics aside and was magnanimous in praising his predecessor.

===General election===
In the 1954 general election campaign against Little Rock Mayor Pratt Remmel, Faubus secured the endorsement of the previous 1950 and 1952 Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jefferson W. Speck, a planter from Mississippi County in eastern Arkansas. Faubus defeated Remmel by a 63% to 37% percent margin. Faubus rejected his father&#x27;s radicalism for the more mainline New Deal, a pragmatic move. He was elected governor as a liberal Democrat. A moderate on racial issues, he adopted racial policies that were palatable to influential white voters in the Delta region as part of a strategy to effect key social reforms and economic growth in Arkansas.

==Governor of Arkansas, 1955–1967==
The 1954 election made Faubus sensitive to attacks from the political right. It has been suggested that this sensitivity contributed to his later stance against integration when he was challenged by segregationist elements within his own party. Faubus’ challenger in the 1956 gubernatorial primary, Jim Johnson, called Faubus &quot;a traitor to the Southern way of life,&quot; spurring Faubus to add a line to his standard speech: &quot;No school district will be forced to mix the races as long as I am governor of Arkansas.&quot;

===Little Rock crisis===

Faubus&#x27;s name became internationally known during the Little Rock Crisis of 1957, when he used the Arkansas National Guard to stop African Americans from attending Little Rock Central High School as part of federally ordered racial desegregation.

Many observers argued that Faubus&#x27;s fight in Little Rock against the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that separate schools were inherently unequal was motivated by considerations of political gain. The ensuing battle helped to shield him from the political fallout from a tax increase. Journalist Harry Ashmore (who won a Pulitzer Prize for his columns on the subject) portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus. Ashmore said that Faubus used the Guard to keep blacks out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to arouse white voters.

Faubus&#x27;s decision led to a showdown with President Dwight D. Eisenhower and former Governor Sid McMath. On September 5, 1957, Eisenhower sent a telegram to Faubus in which he wrote &quot;The only assurance I can give you is that the Federal Constitution will be upheld by me by every legal means at my command.&quot; This was a response to Faubus&#x27;s concerns about being taken into custody and his telephones being wired. Eisenhower did say in his telegram that the Department of Justice was collecting facts as to why there was a failure to comply with the courts. This led to the September 14 conference where Faubus and Eisenhower discussed the Court order in Newport, Rhode Island. The quoted &quot;friendly and constructive discussion&quot; led to Faubus claiming his desire to comply with his duty to the Constitution, personal opinions aside. Faubus did express his hope that the Department of Justice would be patient. He did stay true to his word and on September 21, President Eisenhower released a statement which announced that Faubus had withdrawn his troops, the Little Rock School Board was carrying out desegregation plans, and local law was ready to keep order.
On September 23, however, Little Rock Mayor Woodrow W. Mann sent a telegram to Eisenhower stating a mob had formed at Central High School. State police made efforts to control the mob, but for the safety of the newly enrolled children, they were sent home. The mayor stressed how this was a planned act and that the principal agitator, Jimmy Karam, was an associate of Governor Faubus. The mayor further stated his belief that there was no way the governor could not have been aware of this planned attack. In October 1957, Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to return to their armories which effectively removed them from Faubus&#x27;s control. Eisenhower then sent elements of the 101st Airborne Division to Arkansas to protect the black students and enforce the federal court order. The Arkansas National Guard later took over protection duties from the 101st Airborne Division. In retaliation, Faubus shut down Little Rock high schools for the 1958–1959 school year. This is often referred to as &quot;The Lost Year&quot; in Little Rock.

In a 1985 interview with a Huntsville, Arkansas, student, Faubus stated that the crisis was due to an &quot;usurpation of power&quot; by the federal government. The State knew forced integration by the federal government was going to meet with unfavorable results from the Little Rock public. In his opinion, Faubus was acting in the State&#x27;s best interest at the time.

Though Faubus later lost general popularity as a result of his support for segregation, at the time he was included among the &quot;Ten Men in the World Most Admired by Americans&quot;, according to Gallup&#x27;s most admired man and woman poll for 1958. This dichotomy was later summed up as follows: Faubus was both the &quot;best loved&quot; and &quot;most hated&quot; of Arkansas politicians of the second half of the twentieth century.

The Little Rock Crisis inspired the song &quot;Fables of Faubus&quot; by jazz artist Charles Mingus.

===Faubus-style politics===

Faubus was elected governor to six two-year terms and hence served for twelve years. He maintained a defiant, populist image, while he shifted toward a less confrontational stance with the federal government, particularly during the administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, with each of whom he remained cordial, and both of whom carried Arkansas.
In the 1956 general election, Faubus, having already beaten Jim Johnson, overwhelmed GOP candidate Roy Mitchell, later the GOP state chairman from Hot Springs, 321,797 (80.7%) to 77,215 (19.4%). In 1958, he defeated Republican George W. Johnson of Greenwood in Sebastian County by drawing 82.5% of the votes.

In 1962, Faubus broke with the White Citizens&#x27; Councils and other groups, who preferred, but did not officially endorse, U.S. Representative Dale Alford in that year&#x27;s gubernatorial primary. Faubus cast himself as a moderate, he completely ignored the race issue during the 1962 election campaign, and barely secured a majority over Alford, McMath, and three other candidates. He then handily defeated the Republican Willis Ricketts, a then 37-year-old pharmacist from Fayetteville in the general election.

While Faubus was still shunned by black leaders, he nevertheless won a large percent of the black vote. In 1964, when he defeated the Republican Winthrop Rockefeller by a 57–43 percent margin, Faubus won 81 percent of the black vote. He even collected a share of the base Republican vote from the conservative party members who had sided with former Republican state chairman William L. Spicer of Fort Smith, an intraparty rival of Rockefeller.

==1960 presidential election==
During the 1960 presidential election, at a secret meeting held in a rural lodge near Dayton, Ohio, the National States Rights Party (NSRP) nominated Faubus for President and retired U.S. Navy rear admiral John G. Crommelin of Alabama for Vice President. Faubus, however, did not campaign on this ticket actively, and won only 0.07% of the vote (best in his native Arkansas: 6.76%), losing to the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson ticket.

==Later life==

Faubus chose not to run for re-election to a seventh term in what would likely have been a difficult race in 1966. Former gubernatorial candidate James D. Johnson, by then an elected Arkansas Supreme Court Justice, narrowly won the Democratic nomination over another justice, the moderate Frank Holt. Johnson was then defeated in the general election by Winthrop Rockefeller, who became the state&#x27;s first GOP governor since Reconstruction. Years later, Johnson himself became a Republican and supported Governor Frank D. White, later a benefactor of Faubus.

In the 1968 United States presidential election, Faubus was among five people considered for the vice-presidential slot of third-party presidential candidate George Wallace. However, in light of the public perception of both as segregationists, Wallace selected retired General Curtis LeMay. During the 1969 season, Faubus was hired by new owner Jess Odom to be general manager of his Li&#x27;l Abner theme park in the Ozark Mountains, Dogpatch USA. According to newspaper articles, Faubus was said to have commented that managing the park was similar to running state government because some of the same tricks applied to both.

Faubus sought the governorship again in 1970, 1974, and 1986 but was defeated in the Democratic primaries by Dale Bumpers, David Pryor, and Bill Clinton, respectively, each of whom defeated Republican opponents. In the 1970 race, two other Democratic candidates in the running, Joe Purcell and Hayes McClerkin, failed to make the runoff, and Bumpers barely edged Purcell for the chance to face Faubus directly. In his last race, 1986, he polled 174,402 votes (33.5 percent) to Clinton&#x27;s 315,397 (60.6 percent).

In 1984, Faubus was one of the few white politicians to support civil rights activist Jesse Jackson for President of the United States. He supported Jackson again in the 1988 Democratic primaries. Faubus, a life-long Southern Baptist, died of prostate cancer on December 14, 1994, and is interred at the Combs Cemetery in Combs, Arkansas.

<text>Gerlinde Obermeir (1942–1984) was an Austrian feminist writer known for her critiques on mental health care.

She wrote &quot;I Will Not&quot; and &quot;San Francisco, of Course&quot; (or &quot;Positively San Francisco&quot; as she herself translated the title).

Obermeir has been credited by some critics with mystical insights in her writing. This perhaps makes too much of a visit to India. In 1976 she spent three weeks in India with Swami Paramananda Saraswati. This visit is detailed in Malachi O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s memoir, &quot;I Was A Teenage Catholic&quot;. It seems more appropriate to read her explorations of madness as relating to a celebration of anarchic thinking than as grounded in Eastern religion.

She died by suicide in her early forties in Vienna in 1984.

<text>Terentius Maximus, also known as the Pseudo-Nero, was a Roman who rebelled during the reign of Titus, but was suppressed. He resembled Nero in appearance and in action, as he was known to perform singing with the accompaniment of the lyre.

He gained his followers first in Asia, and then gained many more during his march to the Euphrates. He later fled to Parthia and tried to gain support there by claiming (supposedly in the person of Nero) that the people there owed him some requital for the return of Armenia. Artabanus III, a Parthian leader, out of anger towards Titus, both received him and made preparations to reinstate him to Rome. He was executed when his true identity was revealed.

==In literature==
In 1936, Lion Feuchtwanger wrote The Pretender (&quot;Der falsche Nero&quot;), a fictional novel in which he compared Terentius Maximus with Adolf Hitler.

<doc id="286000" wikidata="Q870797" url="?curid=286000" title="Modular form">
<text>In mathematics, a modular form is a holomorphic function on the complex upper half-plane, formula_1, that roughly satisfies a functional equation with respect to the group action of the modular group and a growth condition. The theory of modular forms has origins in complex analysis, with important connections with number theory. Modular forms also appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.

Modular form theory is a special case of the more general theory of automorphic forms, which are functions defined on Lie groups that transform nicely with respect to the action of certain discrete subgroups, generalizing the example of the modular group formula_2. Every modular form is attached to a Galois representation.

The term &quot;modular form&quot;, as a systematic description, is usually attributed to Erich Hecke. The importance of modular forms across multiple field of mathematics has been humorously represented in a possibly apocryphal quote attributed to Martin Eichler describing modular forms as being the fifth fundamental operation in mathematics, after addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

== Definition ==
In general, given a subgroup formula_3 of finite index (called an arithmetic group), a modular form of level formula_4 and weight formula_5 is a holomorphic function formula_6 from the upper half-plane satisfying the following two conditions:

* &quot;Automorphy condition&quot;: for any formula_7, we haveformula_8 , and

* &quot;Growth condition&quot;: for any formula_9, the function formula_10 is bounded for formula_11.

In addition, a modular form is called a cusp form if it satisfies the following growth condition:

* &quot;Cuspidal condition&quot;: For any formula_9, we have formula_13 as formula_11.

Note that formula_15 is a matrix
:formula_16 

identified with the function formula_17. The identification of functions with matrices makes function composition equivalent to matrix multiplication. 

=== As sections of a line bundle ===
Modular forms can also be interpreted as sections of a specific line bundle on modular varieties. For formula_3 a modular form of level formula_4 and weight formula_5 can be defined as an element of
:formula_21
where formula_22 is a canonical line bundle on the modular curve
:formula_23
The dimensions of these spaces of modular forms can be computed using the Riemann–Roch theorem. The classical modular forms for formula_24 are sections of a line bundle on the moduli stack of elliptic curves.

== Modular function ==

A modular function is a function that is invariant with respect to the modular group, but without the condition that it be holomorphic in the upper half-plane (among other requirements). Instead, modular functions are meromorphic: they are holomorphic on the complement of a set of isolated points, which are poles of the function.

== Modular forms for SL(2, Z) ==

=== Standard definition ===
A modular form of weight formula_5 for the modular group
:formula_26
is a function formula_27 on the upper half-plane formula_28 satisfying the following three conditions: 
# formula_27 is holomorphic on formula_1. 
# For any formula_31 and any matrix in formula_32, we have
#:formula_33.
# formula_27 is bounded as formula_35.

Remarks: 
* The weight formula_5 is typically a positive integer.
* For odd formula_5, only the zero function can satisfy the second condition.
* The third condition is also phrased by saying that formula_27 is &quot;holomorphic at the cusp&quot;, a terminology that is explained below. Explicitly, the condition means that there exist some formula_39 such that formula_40, meaning formula_27 is bounded above some horizontal line.
* The second condition for 
::formula_42 
:reads
::formula_43
:respectively. Since formula_44 and formula_45 generate the group formula_32, the second condition above is equivalent to these two equations. 
* Since formula_47, modular forms are periodic functions with period , and thus have a Fourier series.

===Definition in terms of lattices or elliptic curves===
A modular form can equivalently be defined as a function &quot;F&quot; from the set of lattices in to the set of complex numbers which satisfies certain conditions:

# If we consider the lattice generated by a constant and a variable , then is an analytic function of .
# If is a non-zero complex number and is the lattice obtained by multiplying each element of by , then where is a constant (typically a positive integer) called the weight of the form.
# The absolute value of remains bounded above as long as the absolute value of the smallest non-zero element in is bounded away from 0.

The key idea in proving the equivalence of the two definitions is that such a function is determined, because of the second condition, by its values on lattices of the form , where .

=== Examples ===

I. Eisenstein series

The simplest examples from this point of view are the Eisenstein series. For each even integer , we define to be the sum of over all non-zero vectors of :

:formula_48

Then is a modular form of weight . For we have

:formula_49

and

:formula_50

The condition is needed for convergence; for odd there is cancellation between and , so that such series are identically zero.

II. Theta functions of even unimodular lattices

An even unimodular lattice in is a lattice generated by vectors forming the columns of a matrix of determinant 1 and satisfying the condition that the square of the length of each vector in is an even integer. The so-called theta function

:formula_51

converges when Im(z) &gt; 0, and as a consequence of the Poisson summation formula can be shown to be a modular form of weight . It is not so easy to construct even unimodular lattices, but here is one way: Let be an integer divisible by 8 and consider all vectors in such that has integer coordinates, either all even or all odd, and such that the sum of the coordinates of is an even integer. We call this lattice . When , this is the lattice generated by the roots in the root system called E8. Because there is only one modular form of weight 8 up to scalar multiplication,

:formula_52

even though the lattices and are not similar. John Milnor observed that the 16-dimensional tori obtained by dividing by these two lattices are consequently examples of compact Riemannian manifolds which are isospectral but not isometric (see Hearing the shape of a drum.)

III. The modular discriminant
The Dedekind eta function is defined as

:formula_53

where &quot;q&quot; is the square of the nome. Then the modular discriminant is a modular form of weight 12. The presence of 24 is related to the fact that the Leech lattice has 24 dimensions. A celebrated conjecture of Ramanujan asserted that when is expanded as a power series in q, the coefficient of for any prime has absolute value . This was confirmed by the work of Eichler, Shimura, Kuga, Ihara, and Pierre Deligne as a result of Deligne&#x27;s proof of the Weil conjectures, which were shown to imply Ramanujan&#x27;s conjecture.

The second and third examples give some hint of the connection between modular forms and classical questions in number theory, such as representation of integers by quadratic forms and the partition function. The crucial conceptual link between modular forms and number theory is furnished by the theory of Hecke operators, which also gives the link between the theory of modular forms and representation theory.

==Modular functions==
When the weight &quot;k&quot; is zero, it can be shown using Liouville&#x27;s theorem that the only modular forms are constant functions. However, relaxing the requirement that &quot;f&quot; be holomorphic leads to the notion of &quot;modular functions&quot;. A function &quot;f&quot; : H → C is called modular if it satisfies the following properties:

* &quot;f&quot; is meromorphic in the open upper half-plane &quot;H&quot;
* For every integer matrix formula_54 in the modular group, formula_55.
* The second condition implies that &quot;f&quot; is periodic, and therefore has a Fourier series. The third condition is that this series is of the form
::formula_56 
It is often written in terms of formula_57 (the square of the nome), as:
::formula_58
This is also referred to as the &quot;q&quot;-expansion of &quot;f&quot; (q-expansion principle). The coefficients formula_59 are known as the Fourier coefficients of &quot;f&quot;, and the number &quot;m&quot; is called the order of the pole of &quot;f&quot; at i∞. This condition is called &quot;meromorphic at the cusp&quot;, meaning that only finitely many negative-&quot;n&quot; coefficients are non-zero, so the &quot;q&quot;-expansion is bounded below, guaranteeing that it is meromorphic at &quot;q&quot; = 0. 

Sometimes a weaker definition of modular functions is used – under the alternative definition, it is sufficient that &quot;f&quot; be meromorphic in the open upper half-plane and that &quot;f&quot; be invariant with respect to a sub-group of the modular group of finite index. This is not adhered to in this article.

Another way to phrase the definition of modular functions is to use elliptic curves: every lattice Λ determines an elliptic curve C/Λ over C; two lattices determine isomorphic elliptic curves if and only if one is obtained from the other by multiplying by some non-zero complex number . Thus, a modular function can also be regarded as a meromorphic function on the set of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves. For example, the j-invariant &quot;j&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of an elliptic curve, regarded as a function on the set of all elliptic curves, is a modular function. More conceptually, modular functions can be thought of as functions on the moduli space of isomorphism classes of complex elliptic curves.

A modular form &quot;f&quot; that vanishes at (equivalently, , also paraphrased as ) is called a &quot;cusp form&quot; (&quot;Spitzenform&quot; in German). The smallest &quot;n&quot; such that is the order of the zero of &quot;f&quot; at .

A &quot;modular unit&quot; is a modular function whose poles and zeroes are confined to the cusps.

==Modular forms for more general groups==
The functional equation, i.e., the behavior of &quot;f&quot; with respect to formula_60 can be relaxed by requiring it only for matrices in smaller groups.

===The Riemann surface &quot;G&quot;\H∗===
Let be a subgroup of that is of finite index. Such a group acts on H in the same way as . The quotient topological space &quot;G&quot;\H can be shown to be a Hausdorff space. Typically it is not compact, but can be compactified by adding a finite number of points called &quot;cusps&quot;. These are points at the boundary of H, i.e. in Q∪{∞}, such that there is a parabolic element of (a matrix with trace ±2) fixing the point. This yields a compact topological space &quot;G&quot;\H∗. What is more, it can be endowed with the structure of a Riemann surface, which allows one to speak of holo- and meromorphic functions.

Important examples are, for any positive integer &quot;N&quot;, either one of the congruence subgroups
:formula_61

For &quot;G&quot; = Γ0(&quot;N&quot;) or , the spaces &quot;G&quot;\H and &quot;G&quot;\H∗ are denoted &quot;Y&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;) and &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;) and &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;N&quot;), &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;), respectively.

The geometry of &quot;G&quot;\H∗ can be understood by studying fundamental domains for &quot;G&quot;, i.e. subsets &quot;D&quot; ⊂ H such that &quot;D&quot; intersects each orbit of the -action on H exactly once and such that the closure of &quot;D&quot; meets all orbits. For example, the genus of &quot;G&quot;\H∗ can be computed.

===Definition===
A modular form for of weight &quot;k&quot; is a function on H satisfying the above functional equation for all matrices in , that is holomorphic on H and at all cusps of . Again, modular forms that vanish at all cusps are called cusp forms for . The C-vector spaces of modular and cusp forms of weight &quot;k&quot; are denoted and , respectively. Similarly, a meromorphic function on &quot;G&quot;\H∗ is called a modular function for . In case &quot;G&quot; = Γ0(&quot;N&quot;), they are also referred to as modular/cusp forms and functions of &quot;level&quot; &quot;N&quot;. For , this gives back the afore-mentioned definitions.

===Consequences===
The theory of Riemann surfaces can be applied to &quot;G&quot;\H∗ to obtain further information about modular forms and functions. For example, the spaces and are finite-dimensional, and their dimensions can be computed thanks to the Riemann–Roch theorem in terms of the geometry of the -action on H. For example,

:formula_62

where formula_63 denotes the floor function and formula_5 is even.

The modular functions constitute the field of functions of the Riemann surface, and hence form a field of transcendence degree one (over C). If a modular function &quot;f&quot; is not identically 0, then it can be shown that the number of zeroes of &quot;f&quot; is equal to the number of poles of &quot;f&quot; in the closure of the fundamental region &quot;R&quot;Γ.It can be shown that the field of modular function of level &quot;N&quot; (&quot;N&quot; ≥ 1) is generated by the functions &quot;j&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;j&quot;(&quot;Nz&quot;).

===Line bundles===
The situation can be profitably compared to that which arises in the search for functions on the projective space P(&quot;V&quot;): in that setting, one would ideally like functions &quot;F&quot; on the vector space &quot;V&quot; which are polynomial in the coordinates of &quot;v&quot; ≠ 0 in &quot;V&quot; and satisfy the equation &quot;F&quot;(&quot;cv&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) for all non-zero &quot;c&quot;. Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants. If we allow denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we can let &quot;F&quot; be the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we can stick with polynomials and loosen the dependence on &quot;c&quot;, letting &quot;F&quot;(&quot;cv&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;F&quot;(&quot;v&quot;). The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree . On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for each &quot;k&quot;, and on the other, if we let &quot;k&quot; vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective space P(&quot;V&quot;).

One might ask, since the homogeneous polynomials are not really functions on P(&quot;V&quot;), what are they, geometrically speaking? The algebro-geometric answer is that they are &quot;sections&quot; of a sheaf (one could also say a line bundle in this case). The situation with modular forms is precisely analogous.

Modular forms can also be profitably approached from this geometric direction, as sections of line bundles on the moduli space of elliptic curves.

==Rings of modular forms==

For a subgroup of the , the ring of modular forms is the graded ring generated by the modular forms of . In other words, if is the vector space of modular forms of weight , then the ring of modular forms of is the graded ring formula_65.

Rings of modular forms of congruence subgroups of are finitely generated due to a result of Pierre Deligne and Michael Rapoport. Such rings of modular forms are generated in weight at most 6 and the relations are generated in weight at most 12 when the congruence subgroup has nonzero odd weight modular forms, and the corresponding bounds are 5 and 10 when there are no nonzero odd weight modular forms.

More generally, there are formulas for bounds on the weights of generators of the ring of modular forms and its relations for arbitrary Fuchsian groups.

==Types==

===New forms===

New forms are a subspace of modular forms of a fixed level formula_66 which cannot be constructed from modular forms of lower levels formula_67 dividing formula_66. The other forms are called old forms. These old forms can be constructed using the following observations: if formula_69 then formula_70 giving a reverse inclusion of modular forms formula_71.

===Cusp forms===

A cusp form is a modular form with a zero constant coefficient in its Fourier series. It is called a cusp form because the form vanishes at all cusps.

== Generalizations ==
There are a number of other usages of the term &quot;modular function&quot;, apart from this classical one; for example, in the theory of Haar measures, it is a function determined by the conjugation action.

Maass forms are real-analytic eigenfunctions of the Laplacian but need not be holomorphic. The holomorphic parts of certain weak Maass wave forms turn out to be essentially Ramanujan&#x27;s mock theta functions. Groups which are not subgroups of can be considered.

Hilbert modular forms are functions in &quot;n&quot; variables, each a complex number in the upper half-plane, satisfying a modular relation for 2×2 matrices with entries in a totally real number field.

Siegel modular forms are associated to larger symplectic groups in the same way in which classical modular forms are associated to ; in other words, they are related to abelian varieties in the same sense that classical modular forms (which are sometimes called &quot;elliptic modular forms&quot; to emphasize the point) are related to elliptic curves.

Jacobi forms are a mixture of modular forms and elliptic functions. Examples of such functions are very classical - the Jacobi theta functions and the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms of genus two - but it is a relatively recent observation that the Jacobi forms have an arithmetic theory very analogous to the usual theory of modular forms.

Automorphic forms extend the notion of modular forms to general Lie groups.

Modular integrals of weight are meromorphic functions on the upper half plane of moderate growth at infinity which &quot;fail to be modular of weight &quot; by a rational function.

Automorphic factors are functions of the form formula_72 which are used to generalise the modularity relation defining modular forms, so that
:formula_73

The function formula_74 is called the nebentypus of the modular form. Functions such as the Dedekind eta function, a modular form of weight 1/2, may be encompassed by the theory by allowing automorphic factors.

==History==

The theory of modular forms was developed in four periods:

* In connection with the theory of elliptic functions, in the early nineteenth century
* By Felix Klein and others towards the end of the nineteenth century as the automorphic form concept became understood (for one variable)
* By Erich Hecke from about 1925
* In the 1960s, as the needs of number theory and the formulation of the modularity theorem in particular made it clear that modular forms are deeply implicated.

Taniyama and Shimura identified a 1-to-1 matching between certain modular forms and elliptic curves. Robert Langlands built on this idea in the construction of his expansive Langlands program, which has become one of the most far-reaching and consequential research programs in math.

In 1994 Andrew Wiles used modular forms to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. In 2001 all elliptic curves were proven to be modular over the rational numbers. In 2013 elliptic curves were proven to be modular over real quadratic fields. In 2023 elliptic curves were proven to be modular over about half of imaginary quadratic fields, including fields formed by combining the rational numbers with the square root of integers down to −5.

<doc id="286001" wikidata="Q898489" url="?curid=286001" title="Lipolysis">
<text>Lipolysis is the metabolic pathway through which lipid triglycerides are hydrolyzed into a glycerol and free fatty acids. It is used to mobilize stored energy during fasting or exercise, and usually occurs in fat adipocytes. The most important regulatory hormone in lipolysis is insulin; lipolysis can only occur when insulin action falls to low levels, as occurs during fasting. Other hormones that affect lipolysis include leptin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and cortisol.

== Mechanisms ==
In the body, stores of fat are referred to as adipose tissue. In these areas, intracellular triglycerides are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. When lipase enzymes are phosphorylated, they can access lipid droplets and through multiple steps of hydrolysis, breakdown triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. Each step of hydrolysis leads to the removal of one fatty acid. The first step and the rate-limiting step of lipolysis is carried out by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol. Subsequently, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol to glycerol.

Perilipin 1A is a key protein regulator of lipolysis in adipose tissue. This lipid droplet-associated protein, when deactivated, will prevent the interaction of lipases with triglycerides in the lipid droplet and grasp the ATGL co-activator, comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58) (a.k.a. ABHD5). When perilipin 1A is phosphorylated by PKA, it releases CGI-58 and it expedites the docking of phosphorylated lipases to the lipid droplet. CGI-58 can be further phosphorylated by PKA to assist in its dispersal to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, CGI-58 can co-activate ATGL. ATGL activity is also impacted by the negative regulator of lipolysis, G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2). When expressed, G0S2 acts as a competitive inhibitor in the binding of CGI-58. Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27) (a.k.a. CIDEC) is also a negative regulator of lipolysis. FSP-27 expression is negatively correlated with ATGL mRNA levels.

== Regulation ==

Lipolysis can be regulated through cAMP&#x27;s binding and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate lipases, perilipin 1A, and CGI-58 to increase the rate of lipolysis. Catecholamines bind to 7TM receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) on the adipocyte cell membrane, which activate adenylate cyclase. This results in increased production of cAMP, which activates PKA and leads to an increased rate of lipolysis. Despite glucagon&#x27;s lipolytic activity (which stimulates PKA as well) in vitro, the role of glucagon in lipolysis in vivo is disputed.

Insulin counter-regulates this increase in lipolysis when it binds to insulin receptors on the adipocyte cell membrane. Insulin receptors activate insulin-like receptor substrates. These substrates activate phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI-3K) which then phosphorylate protein kinase B (PKB) (a.k.a. Akt). PKB subsequently phosphorylates phosphodiesterase 3B (PD3B), which then converts the cAMP produced by adenylate cyclase into 5&#x27;AMP. The resulting insulin induced reduction in cAMP levels decreases the lipolysis rate.

Insulin also acts in the brain at the mediobasal hypothalamus. There, it suppresses lipolysis and decreases sympathetic nervous outflow to the fatty part of the brain matter. The regulation of this process involves interactions between insulin receptors and gangliosides present in the neuronal cell membrane.

==In blood==
Triglycerides are transported through the blood to appropriate tissues (adipose, muscle, etc.) by lipoproteins such as Very-Low-Density-Lipoproteins (VLDL). Triglycerides present on the VLDL undergo lipolysis by the cellular lipases of target tissues, which yields glycerol and free fatty acids. Free fatty acids released into the blood are then available for cellular uptake. Free fatty acids not immediately taken up by cells may bind to albumin for transport to surrounding tissues that require energy. Serum albumin is the major carrier of free fatty acids in the blood.

The glycerol also enters the bloodstream and is absorbed by the liver or kidney where it is converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by the enzyme glycerol kinase. Hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate is converted mostly into dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) and then glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) to rejoin the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway.

== Lipogenesis ==
While lipolysis is triglyceride hydrolysis (the process by which triglycerides are broken down), esterification is the process by which triglycerides are formed. Esterification and lipolysis are, in essence, reversals of one another.

== Medical procedures ==
Physical lipolysis involves destruction of fat cells containing the fat droplets and can be used as part of cosmetic body contouring procedures. Currently there are four main non-invasive body contouring techniques in aesthetic medicine for reducing localized subcutaneous adipose tissue in addition to the standard minimally invasive liposuction: low-level laser therapy (LLLT), cryolipolysis, radio frequency (RF) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). However, they are less effective with shorter lasting benefits and can remove significantly smaller amounts of fat compared to traditional surgical liposuction or lipectomy. However, future drug developments can be potentially combined with smaller procedures to augment the result.

<text>Kevin Major (born September 12, 1949) is a Canadian author who lives in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador with his wife. He writes for both young people and adults, including fiction, literary non-fiction, poetry, and plays.

Major was born and raised in Stephenville, Newfoundland. He later moved to St. John&#x27;s where he attended Memorial University of Newfoundland. Before becoming a writer, he taught school in several parts of the province, including the Eastport Peninsula in Bonavista Bay. His early novels are known for exploring issues such as adolescence and family. The novels were usually set on the island of Newfoundland. In 1992, he was awarded the Vicky Metcalf Award for his body of work. His more recent books are mostly adult fiction, including the Sebastian Synard murder mystery series.

<text>Bobbi Lee Maracle (born Marguerite Aline Carter; July 2, 1950November 11, 2021) was an Indigenous Canadian writer and academic of the Stó꞉lō nation. Born in North Vancouver, British Columbia, she left formal education after grade 8 to travel across North America, attending Simon Fraser University on her return to Canada. Her first book, an autobiography called &quot;Bobbi Lee: Indian Rebel&quot;, was published in 1975. She wrote fiction, non-fiction, and criticism and held various academic positions. Maracle&#x27;s work focused on the lives of Indigenous people, particularly women, in contemporary North America. As an influential writer and speaker, Maracle fought for those oppressed by sexism, racism, and capitalist exploitation. 

==Early life and education==
The granddaughter of Tsleil-Waututh Chief Dan George, Marguerite Aline Carter was born on July 2, 1950, in North Vancouver, British Columbia. &quot;Lee&quot; was a nickname for &quot;Aline&quot;. She grew up in North Vancouver, raised mainly by her mother, Jean (Croutze) Carter. 

Maracle dropped out of school after grade 8 and went from California, where she did various jobs that included producing films and doing stand-up comedy, to Toronto. After returning to Canada, she attended Simon Fraser University. In the 1970s, she became involved with the Red Power movement in Vancouver.

==Writing==
Maracle&#x27;s writing explores the experience of Indigenous women, critiquing patriarchy and white supremacy. Her first book was an autobiography: &quot;Bobbi Lee: Indian Rebel&quot;, published in 1975. The book began as an assignment in a course about writing life histories. Critic Harmut Lutz describes &quot;Indian Rebel&quot; as &quot;a celebration of Native survival&quot;, comparing it to the works of Maria Campbell and Howard Adams. &quot;Indian Rebel&quot; was &quot;one of the first Indigenous works published in Canada&quot;.

&quot;I Am Woman&quot; (1988) applies feminist theory to the situation of Indigenous women, describing women&#x27;s sexual victimization at the hands of Indigenous and white men alike while reflecting on her own struggle for liberation. &quot;Sojourner&#x27;s Truth&quot; (1990), a collection of short stories, describes the everyday lives of Indigenous people dealing with a &quot;Eurocentric culture&quot;. Her poetry book, &quot;Hope Matters&quot;, was written in conjunction with her daughters Columpa Bobb and Tania Carter, and was published in 2019.

&quot;Sundogs&quot;, 1992, Maracle&#x27;s first novel, touches on remembering Native heritage and recollecting cultural roots. 

&quot;Ravensong&quot;, (1993), speaks of blending oral tradition and holistic oneness with living while tackling the barriers of racism, sexism, and class.

== Academic positions ==
Maracle was one of the founders of the En&#x27;owkin International School of Writing in Penticton, British Columbia. She was the cultural director of the Centre for Indigenous Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, from 1998 to 2000.

Maracle taught at the University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and Southern Oregon University, and was a professor of Canadian culture at Western Washington University. She lived in Toronto, teaching at the University of Toronto First Nations House. She was the writer-in-residence at the University of Guelph.

== Personal life ==
Maracle belonged to the Stó꞉lō nation and had Salish and Cree ancestry. She has been described as Métis. She was married to Raymond Bobb and later to Aiyyana Maracle. She and Raymond had two daughters, including Columpa Bobb, and one son, actor Sid Bobb.

She died on November 11, 2021, at Surrey Memorial Hospital in Surrey, British Columbia.

== Awards and honours ==
Maracle was named an officer of the Order of Canada in 2018. In 2017, Maracle was presented with the Bonham Centre Award from the Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for her contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification. She delivered the 2021 Margaret Laurence Lecture on &quot;A Writing Life&quot;. In 2020, she was named finalist for the Neustadt International Prize for &quot;Celia&#x27;s Song&quot;.

<doc id="286007" wikidata="Q844756" url="?curid=286007" title="USS Franklin (CV-13)">
<text>USS &quot;Franklin&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-13, AVT-8), nicknamed &quot;Big Ben,&quot; was one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy, and the fifth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in January 1944, she served in several campaigns in the Pacific War, earning four battle stars. In March 1945, while launching strikes against the Japanese mainland, she was badly damaged when a single Japanese dive bomber struck her with two bombs. The attack resulted in the loss of 807 of her crew and &quot;Franklin&quot; became the most heavily-damaged United States aircraft carrier to survive the war. The complement of &quot;Franklin&quot; suffered 924 killed in action during the war, the worst for any surviving U.S. warship and second only to that of .

After the attack, she returned to the U.S. mainland for repairs, missing the rest of the war; she was decommissioned in 1947. In reserve, she was reclassified as an attack carrier (CVA), then an antisubmarine carrier (CVS), and finally an aircraft transport (AVT), but she was never modernized and never saw active service again. &quot;Franklin&quot; and (damaged by two kamikazes) were the only &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers not to see active service as aircraft carriers after World War II. &quot;Franklin&quot; was sold for scrap in 1966.

==Construction and commissioning==

The keel of &quot;Franklin&quot; was laid down on 7 December 1942 in Shipway 11, the first anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and she was launched by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company, in Virginia, on 14 October 1943, sponsored by Lieutenant Commander Mildred H. McAfee, an American naval officer who was the Director of the WAVES. The warship was named in honor of the founding father Benjamin Franklin and for the previous warships that had been named for him; it was not named for the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee, that was fought during the American Civil War, as is sometimes erroneously reported, although a footnote in &quot;The Franklin Comes Home&quot; does attribute the naming to the Battle of Franklin. (Franklin, Tennessee was also named after Benjamin Franklin.) &quot;Franklin&quot; was commissioned on 31 January 1944. Among the plankowners was a ship&#x27;s band made up of several enlisted men who were professional musicians at the time, including Saxie Dowell and Deane Kincaide, assigned to &quot;Franklin&quot; by a lottery.

==Service history==
===World War II===
Carrier Air Group 13 had been established in November 1943 and embarked aboard &quot;Franklin&quot; for war service. &quot;Franklin&quot; steamed south to Trinidad for a shakedown and soon thereafter, she departed in Task Group 27.7 (TG 27.7) for San Diego, to engage in intensive training exercises preliminary to combat duty. In June, she steamed via Pearl Harbor for Eniwetok Island where she joined TG 58.2. &quot;Franklin&quot; served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Ralph E. Davison for most of her time in the western Pacific.

====The Mariana and Palau Islands campaign====
On the last day of June 1944, she sortied for carrier strikes on the Bonin Islands in support of the subsequent Mariana Islands assault. Her planes destroyed aircraft on the ground and in the air, gun installations, airfield and enemy shipping. On 4 July, strikes were launched against Iwo Jima, Chichi Jima, and Haha Jima, hitting ground targets, sinking a large cargo vessel in the harbor and setting three smaller ships on fire.

On 6 July, &quot;Franklin&quot; began strikes on Guam and Rota Island to soften them up for the invasion forces that were going to land on Guam, and those strikes continued until 21 July, when she lent direct support to enable safe landing of the first assault waves. Two days of replenishment at Saipan permitted her to steam in Task Force 58 for photographic reconnaissance and air strikes against the islands of the Palau Islands group. On 25 and 26 July, her planes struck enemy planes, ships, and ground installations. &quot;Franklin&quot; departed on 28 July and headed for Saipan, and the following day she was shifted to TG 58.1. Although high seas prevented taking on a needed load of bombs and rockets, &quot;Franklin&quot; steamed for another raid against the Bonins. On 4 August, her fighters attacked Chichi Jima and her dive bombers and torpedo planes attacked a ship convoy north of Ototo Jima. Targets included radio stations, a seaplane base, airstrips, and ships.

A period of upkeep and recreation from 9–28 August ensued at Eniwetok before she departed with , and for neutralization and diversionary attacks against the Bonins. From 31 August to 2 September, strikes from &quot;Franklin&quot; inflicted ground damage, sank two cargo ships, destroyed enemy planes in flight, and undertook photographic surveys. On 4 September 1944, &quot;Franklin&quot; took on supplies at Saipan, and then she steamed in TG 38.1 for an attack against Yap Island (3–6 September) which included direct air coverage of the Peleliu invasion on the 15th. The Task Group took on supplies at Manus Island from 21 to 25 September. &quot;Franklin&quot;, now the flagship of TG 38.4, returned to the Palau area where she launched daily patrols and night fighters.

====Leyte====
Early on 14 September 1944, a fighter sweep was made against Aparri, Luzon, following which she steamed to the east of Luzon to neutralize installations prior to invasion landings on Leyte. On 15 September, &quot;Franklin&quot; was attacked by three enemy planes, one of which scored with a bomb that hit the after outboard corner of the deck edge elevator, killing three men and wounding 22.

As part of Task Force 38.4, &quot;Franklin&quot; next sailed northwest to participate in the Formosa Air Battle from 12 to 16 October, where the U.S. Navy needed to destroy multiple Japanese air bases that controlled airspace from the Philippines to Okinawa to the southern Home Islands. No invasion of Luzon could take place until this Japanese air power was neutralized. On 13 October a Japanese Betty bomber aircraft was shot down, and attempted to kamikaze into &quot;Franklin&quot;. It did some damage to the flight deck, but slid off the starboard side of the ship. Following this action, &quot;Franklin&quot; moved into support for the invasion of the Philippines. The carrier&#x27;s aircraft hit Manila Bay on 19 October when her planes sank and damaged ships and boats, destroyed a floating drydock, and claimed 11 Japanese aircraft.
During the initial landings on Leyte (20 October) &quot;Franklin&quot;″s aircraft attacked surrounding airstrips and launched search patrols in anticipation of the approach of a reported enemy attack force. On the morning of 24 October, in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, her planes formed part of the waves that attacked the Japanese First Raiding Force (under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita), helping to sink south of Luzon, damage and , and sink . As further enemy threats seemed to materialize in another quarter, &quot;Franklin&quot; – with TGs 38.4, 38.3, and 38.2 – sped to intercept the advancing Japanese carrier force and attack at dawn. The distant carrier force was actually a sacrificial feint, as by that time the Japanese were almost out of serviceable airplanes and, even more importantly, very short on trained pilots, but the admiral in charge, William Halsey, took the bait and steamed after them without effectively communicating his intentions, leading to the infamous &quot;the world wonders&quot; communications debacle. &quot;Franklin&quot;″s strike groups combined with those from the other carriers on 25 October in the Battle off Cape Engaño to damage (she would be sunk by American cruiser gunfire subsequently) and sink .

Retiring in her task group to refuel, she returned to the Leyte action on 27 October, her planes concentrating on a heavy cruiser and two destroyers south of Mindoro. She was under way about off Samar on 30 October, when enemy bombers appeared bent on a suicide mission. Navy fighters shot down most of the Japanese planes, but six broke through the combat air patrol into &quot;Franklin″s&quot; task group of four carriers defensively surrounded by a circle of about twenty escorting cruisers and destroyers. Shipboard anti-aircraft guns shot down three of the four &quot;kamikazes&quot; independently diving toward each of the four carriers; but the one targeting &quot;Franklin&quot; hit the flight deck and crashed through to the gallery deck, killing 56 men and wounding 60. As the remaining two &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacked, one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns and the second missed &quot;Franklin&quot; with two bombs before flying into the stern of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;.

&quot;Franklin&quot; was able to extinguish fires and patch the flight deck so planes could be recovered 76 minutes after the &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit. Both carriers retired to Ulithi Atoll for temporary repairs, and then &quot;Franklin&quot; proceeded to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, arriving on 28 November 1944 for repairs of her battle damage. In the meantime, on 7 November, Captain Leslie E. Gehres took over as the carrier&#x27;s commanding officer. Captain Gehres was a strict disciplinarian whose autocracy was disliked by many of &quot;Franklin&quot;″s crew.

&quot;Franklin&quot; departed from Bremerton on 2 February 1945 for training exercises and pilot qualification operations. After a stop for provisions, she departed from Pearl Harbor on 3 March 1945 to join TG 58.2 for strikes on the Japanese homeland in support of the Okinawa landings. On board were RADM Davison in command of the task group, RADM Gerald F. Bogan en route to take command of Carrier Division 4 and CAPT Arnold J. Isbell en route to take command of . On 15 March, she rendezvoused with TF 58 units, and three days later launched sweeps and strikes against Kagoshima and Izumi on southern Kyūshū.

====19 March 1945====
Before dawn on 19 March 1945, &quot;Franklin&quot;, which had maneuvered to within of the Japanese mainland, closer than any other U.S. carrier during the war, launched a fighter sweep against Honshū and later a strike against shipping in Kure Harbor. The &quot;Franklin&quot; crew had been called to battle stations twelve times within six hours that night and Gehres downgraded the alert status to Condition III, allowing his men freedom to eat or sleep, although gunnery crews remained at their stations.
A single Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber approached &quot;Franklin&quot; without being detected by radar. As &quot;Franklin&quot; was about halfway through launching a second wave of strike aircraft, the Japanese dive bomber pierced the cloud cover and dropped two semi-armor-piercing bombs before the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft gunners could fire. The damage analysis came to the conclusion that the bombs were . According to the war film &quot;The Saga of the Franklin&quot;, the leader of Air Group 5 shot the bomber down.

One bomb struck the flight deck centerline, penetrating to the hangar deck, causing destruction and igniting fires through the second and third decks, and knocking out the combat information center and air plot. The second hit aft, tearing through two decks. At the time she was struck, &quot;Franklin&quot; had 31 armed and fueled aircraft warming up on her flight deck, and these planes caught fire almost immediately. The 13 to 16 tons of high explosives aboard these planes soon began detonating progressively, and although &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; air-to-surface rockets were loaded aboard Vought F4U Corsairs, their three-point, nose up attitude allowed most of the rockets to fly overboard when their motors ignited. The hangar deck contained planes, of which 16 were fueled and 5 were armed. The forward gasoline system had been secured, but the aft system was operating. The explosion on the hangar deck ignited the fuel tanks on the aircraft, and a gasoline vapor explosion devastated the deck. The twelve &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; rockets aboard these planes ricocheted around the hangar deck until their warheads detonated. Of the personnel who were in the hangar only two survived. One &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; warhead lodged on the third deck below the forward elevator, and was not removed until &quot;Franklin&quot; reached Ulithi.
Dense smoke soon filled the engineering spaces, which were ordered evacuated with the throttles set. &quot;Franklin&quot; was soon dead in the water, without radio communications, and broiling in the heat from enveloping fires. On the bridge, Captain Gehres ordered &quot;Franklin&quot;″s magazines flooded but this could not be carried out as the ship&#x27;s water mains were destroyed by the explosions or fire. Cruisers and with destroyers , , and left the task group formation to assist &quot;Franklin&quot;. Accompanied by RADM Bogan, RADM Davison transferred his flag to the destroyer &quot;Miller&quot; by breeches buoy and suggested abandoning ship, but Gehres refused to scuttle the &quot;Franklin&quot; as there were still many men alive below deck.

The other destroyers fell in astern of the carrier to rescue members of the crew who had been blown overboard, or jumped off to avoid the fire. Some of the destroyers put their bows against the side of the burning carrier to take off men trapped by the fire. Some of the crew from the assisting ships were killed or wounded, but the hundreds of officers and enlisted men who voluntarily remained saved many lives, and then saved the ship. Among the dead was one of the ship&#x27;s surgeons, LCDR George W. Fox, M.D., who was killed while tending to wounded sailors; he was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. When totaling casualty figures for both &quot;Franklin&quot; cruises numbers increase to 926 killed in action, the worst for any surviving U.S. warship and second only to that of battleship . Certainly, the casualty figures would have far exceeded this number, but for the work of many survivors. Among these were the Medal of Honor recipients Lieutenant Commander Joseph T. O&#x27;Callahan, the warship&#x27;s Catholic chaplain, who administered the last rites, organized and directed firefighting and rescue parties, and led men below to wet down magazines that threatened to explode; and also Lieutenant Junior Grade Donald A. Gary, who discovered 300 men trapped in a blackened mess compartment and, finding an exit, returned repeatedly to lead groups to safety. Gary later organized and led fire-fighting parties to battle fires on the hangar deck and entered the No. 3 fireroom to raise steam in one boiler. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; rescued crewmen from the sea and approached &quot;Franklin&quot; to take off the numerous wounded and nonessential personnel. Among those evacuated were the surviving members of the embarked Air Group 5, who were deemed nonexpendable. 32 Corsair fighters, 15 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, 7 Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers, and 5 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, 59 planes total, were destroyed by the Japanese attack.

The casualty count for &quot;Franklin&quot; varies from source to source as some do not include air group personnel or Marines, passengers who were in transit, a journalist, or those who died from their wounds much later. In &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot;, Samuel Eliot Morison gives figures of 724 killed and 265 wounded for 19 March 1945. Joseph A. Springer, citing &quot;official statistics,&quot; gives higher numbers of 807 killed and at least 487 wounded. &quot;Franklin&quot; suffered the most severe damage and highest casualties experienced by any U.S. fleet carrier that survived World War II. In addition to the Medals of Honor for Donald Gary and Joseph O&#x27;Callahan and the posthumous Navy Cross for George Fox, 21 additional Navy Crosses and 26 Silver Stars were awarded as a result of actions that day. Among these were a gold star in lieu of a third Navy Cross for CDR (later RADM) Joseph F. &quot;Joe&quot; Taylor, the ship&#x27;s executive officer and a former torpedo bomber pilot, and Navy Crosses for CAPT (later RADM) Harold C. Fitz, the &quot;Santa Fe&quot; commander, CDR Stephen Jurika, the &quot;Franklin&quot; navigator and also a former torpedo bomber pilot, LCDR (later RADM) Dwight L. Johnson, the &quot;Miller&quot; commander, LCDR Macgregor &quot;Mac&quot; Kilpatrick, an experienced fighter pilot and the commanding officer of Fighting Squadron Five, and LT Fred R. &quot;Red&quot; Harris, a &quot;Franklin&quot; flight deck officer and a member of the Texas Legislature both before and after the war. Among those who received Silver Stars were LT Grimes W. Gatlin, the ship&#x27;s other chaplain and a Methodist minister, and Donald H. Russell, a civilian Corsair technical support engineer.

&quot;Franklin&quot;, like many other wartime ships, had been modified with additional armament, requiring larger crews and substantial ammunition stocks. Aircraft were both more numerous and heavier than originally planned for, and thus the flight deck had been strengthened. The aircraft carrier, therefore, displaced more than originally planned, her freeboard was reduced, and her stability characteristics had been altered. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; came alongside &quot;Franklin&quot; to spray water from fire hoses over the fire as she received stretcher cases and ambulatory wounded from the carrier. The enormous quantities of water poured aboard her to fight the fires further reduced freeboard, which was exacerbated by a 15-degree list to starboard, and her stability was seriously impaired such that her survival was in jeopardy. Pumping ballast to correct the starboard list caused a 15-degree list to port. &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; towed &quot;Franklin&quot; at for the remaining daylight hours. After six hours, with the fire finally under control such that the ship could be saved, men returned to the engineering spaces and got underway at with only two of the four screws driving. &quot;Franklin″s&quot; planes which had been in the air when the carrier was hit landed aboard the other carriers in the task group, although it was necessary to push some planes overboard to make room for them. Admiral Davison deployed five destroyers to search for any of &quot;Franklin&quot;″s men who had been blown overboard or jumped into the sea.

====Return to the U.S.====
&quot;Franklin&quot; proceeded to Ulithi Atoll at under her own power for emergency repairs. Next she headed to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for temporary repairs. As per Pearl Harbor procedures, a civilian harbor pilot came aboard to help navigate the carrier to the dock; Captain Gehres, however, refused, and said he would &quot;take her in&quot; himself. He maneuvered &quot;Franklin&quot; into the dock area too fast, crashing her into the dock; embarrassed, Gehres blamed the mooring details for the incident. After temporary repairs were completed, the ship continued its journey through the Panama Canal to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York, where she arrived on 28 April 1945. She had to steam to the East Coast of the United States for repairs in New York because all of the repair shipyards on the West Coast were heavily overloaded with American warships that had been damaged by Japanese &quot;kamikazes&quot;.

Upon &quot;Franklin&quot;″s arrival in New York, a long-brewing controversy over the ship&#x27;s crew&#x27;s conduct during her struggles finally came to a head. Captain Gehres had accused many of those who had left the ship on 19 March 1945 of desertion, despite the fact that those who had jumped into the water to escape had done so to prevent a likely death by fire, or had been led to believe that &quot;abandon ship&quot; had been ordered. While en route from Ulithi Atoll to Hawaii, Gehres had proclaimed 704 members of the crew to be members of the &quot;Big Ben 704 Club&quot; for having stayed with the heavily damaged warship, but investigators in New York discovered that only about 400 were actually onboard &quot;Franklin&quot; continuously. The others had been brought back on board either before or during the stop at Ulithi. All of the charges against the men of her crew were quietly dropped. 

Captain Gehres was relieved as captain of the &quot;Franklin&quot; in July 1945 and reassigned to command Naval Air Station San Diego, eventually reaching the rank of rear admiral before retirement.

Despite severe damage, &quot;Franklin&quot; was eventually restored to good condition. The story of this aircraft carrier&#x27;s near-destruction and salvage was chronicled in the wartime documentary, &quot;The Saga of the Franklin&quot; (1945), and the 2011 documentary, &quot;USS Franklin: Honor Restored&quot;.

===Post-war===
&quot;Franklin&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service. After the war, &quot;Franklin&quot; was opened to the public for Navy Day celebrations. On 17 February 1947, she was decommissioned at Bayonne, New Jersey.

While &quot;Franklin&quot; lay mothballed at Bayonne, she was redesignated as an attack aircraft carrier CVA-13 on 1 October 1952, an antisubmarine warfare support carrier CVS-13 on 8 August 1953 and, ultimately, as an aircraft transport AVT-8 on 15 May 1959. However, she never went to sea again, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1964. She and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, which also had sustained severe damage from aerial attack, were the only carriers in their class that never saw any active-duty postwar service, but their wartime damage had been successfully repaired. In fact, it was their like-new condition which kept them out of commission, as the Navy for many years envisioned an &quot;ultimate reconfiguration&quot; for them, which never took place.

The Navy initially sold &quot;Franklin&quot; to the Peck Iron and Metal Company of Portsmouth, Virginia, but reclaimed her because of an urgent Bureau of Ships requirement for her four turbo generators. She was again sold for scrap to the Portsmouth Salvage Company of Chesapeake, Virginia, on 27 July 1966. She departed naval custody under tow (by the Red Star Towing Company) on the evening of 1 August 1966.

<doc id="286012" wikidata="Q209041" url="?curid=286012" title="Platonic love">
<text>Platonic love is a type of love in which sexual desire or romantic features are nonexistent or have been suppressed, sublimated, or purgated, but it means more than simple friendship.

The term is derived from the name of Greek philosopher Plato, though the philosopher never used the term himself. Platonic love, as devised by Plato, concerns rising through levels of closeness to wisdom and true beauty, from carnal attraction to individual bodies to attraction to souls, and eventually, union with the truth.

Platonic love is contrasted with romantic love.

== Classical philosophical interpretation ==

Platonic love is examined in Plato&#x27;s dialogue, the &quot;Symposium&quot;, which has as its topic the subject of love, or more generally the subject of Eros. It explains the possibilities of how the feeling of love began and how it has evolved, both sexually and non-sexually, and defines genuine platonic love as inspiring a person&#x27;s mind and soul and directing their attention towards spiritual matters. Of particular importance is the speech of Socrates, who attributes to the prophet Diotima an idea of platonic love as a means of ascent to contemplation of the divine, an ascent known as the &quot;Ladder of Love&quot;. For Diotima and Plato generally, the most correct use of love of human beings is to direct one&#x27;s mind to love of divinity. Socrates defines love based on separate classifications of pregnancy (to bear offspring); pregnancy of the body, pregnancy of the soul, and direct connection to existence. Pregnancy of the body results in human children. Pregnancy of the soul, the next step in the process, produces &quot;virtue&quot;—which is the soul (truth) translating itself into material form. 

===Eros===
Pausanias, in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; (181b–182a), defines two types of the love known as &quot;Eros&quot;: vulgar Eros, or earthly love, and divine Eros, or divine love. Pausanias defines vulgar Eros as material attraction towards a person&#x27;s beauty for the purposes of physical pleasure and reproduction, and divine Eros as starting from physical attraction but transcending gradually to love for supreme beauty, placed on a similar level to the divine. This concept of divine Eros was later transformed into the term &quot;platonic love&quot;.

Vulgar Eros and divine Eros were both considered to be connected, and part of the same continuous process of pursuing perfection of one&#x27;s being, with the purpose of mending one&#x27;s human nature and eventually reaching a point of unity where there is no longer an aspiration or need to change.

====Eros as a god====
In the &quot;Symposium&quot;, Eros is discussed as a Greek god—more specifically, the king of the gods, with each guest of the party giving a eulogy in praise of Eros.

==== Virtue ====
Virtue, according to Greek philosophy, is the concept of how closely reality and material form equates good, positive, or benevolent. This can be seen as a form of linguistic relativity.

Some modern authors&#x27; perception of the terms &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;good&quot; as they are translated into English from the &quot;Symposium&quot; are a good indicator of this misunderstanding. In the following quote, the author simplifies the idea of virtue as simply what is &quot;good&quot;.

=== Ladder of Love ===
The Ladder of Love is a metaphor that relates each step toward Being as consecutive rungs of a ladder. Each step closer to the truth further distances love from beauty of the body toward love that is more focused on wisdom and the essence of beauty.

The ladder starts with carnal attraction of body for body, progressing to a love for body and soul. Eventually, in time, with consequent steps up the ladder, the idea of beauty is eventually no longer connected with a body, but entirely united with Being itself.

==== Tragedy and comedy ====
Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; defines two extremes in the process of platonic love; the entirely carnal and the entirely ethereal. These two extremes of love are seen by the Greeks in terms of tragedy and comedy. According to Diotima in her discussion with Socrates, for anyone to achieve the final rung in the Ladder of Love, they would essentially transcend the body and rise to immortality—gaining direct access to Being. Such a form of love is impossible for a mortal to achieve.

What Plato describes as &quot;pregnancy of the body&quot; is entirely carnal and seeks pleasure and beauty in bodily form only. This is the type of love, that, according to Socrates, is practiced by animals.

===== Tragedy =====
Diotima considers the carnal limitation of human beings to the pregnancy of the body to be a form of tragedy, as it separates someone from the pursuit of truth. One would be forever limited to beauty of the body, never being able to access the true essence of beauty.

===== Comedy =====
Diotima considers the idea of a mortal having direct access to Being to be a comic situation simply because of the impossibility of it. The offspring of true virtue would essentially lead to a mortal achieving immortality.

==Historical views of platonic love==
In the Middle Ages, new interest in the works of Plato, his philosophy and his view of love became more popular, spurred on by Georgios Gemistos Plethon during the Councils of Ferrara and Firenze in 1438–1439. Later in 1469, Marsilio Ficino put forward a theory of neo-platonic love, in which he defined love as a personal ability of an individual, which guides their soul towards cosmic processes, lofty spiritual goals and heavenly ideas. The first use of the modern sense of platonic love is considered to be by Ficino in one of his letters.

Though Plato&#x27;s discussions of love originally centered on relationships which were sexual between members of the same sex, scholar Todd Reeser studies how the meaning of platonic love in Plato&#x27;s original sense underwent a transformation during the Renaissance, leading to the contemporary sense of nonsexual heterosexual love.

The English term &quot;platonic&quot; dates back to William Davenant&#x27;s &quot;The Platonick Lovers&quot;, performed in 1635, a critique of the philosophy of platonic love which was popular at Charles I&#x27;s court. The play was derived from the concept in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; of a person&#x27;s love for the idea of good, which he considered to lie at the root of all virtue and truth. For a brief period, platonic love was a fashionable subject at the English royal court, especially in the circle around Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. Platonic love was the theme of some of the courtly masques performed in the Caroline era, though the fashion for this soon waned under pressures of social and political change.

=== Seven types of love ===
Throughout these eras, platonic love was slowly categorized into seven different classical definitions. These were:
* Eros: sexual or passionate love, or a modern perspective of romantic love.
* Philia: the love of friendship or goodwill, often met with mutual benefits that can also be formed by companionship, dependability, and trust.
* Storge: the love found between parents and children, often a unilateral love.
* Agape: the universal love, consisting of love for strangers, nature, or God.
* Ludus: playful and uncommitted love, intended for fun with no resulting consequences
* Pragma: love founded on duty and reason, and one&#x27;s longer-term interests.
* Philautia: self-love, both healthy or unhealthy; unhealthy if one places oneself above the gods (to the point of hubris), and healthy if it is used to build self-esteem and confidence.

Despite the variety and number of definitions, the different distinctions between types of love were not considered concrete and mutually exclusive, and were often considered to blend into one another at certain points.

== Modern interpretations ==

=== Definition ===
&quot;Platonic love in its modern popular sense is an affectionate relationship into which the sexual element does not enter, especially in cases where one might easily assume otherwise.&quot; &quot;Platonic lovers function to underscore a supportive role where the friend sees [their] duty as the provision of advice, encouragement, and comfort to the other person ... and do not entail exclusivity.&quot;

=== Complications ===
One of the complications of platonic love lies within the persistence of the use of the title itself &quot;platonic love&quot; versus the use of &quot;friend&quot;. It is the use of the word love that directs us towards a deeper relationship than the scope of a normal [friendship .

=== Queerplatonic love ===
Some in the aromantic and asexual communities, within the broader LGBT community, have coined the term &quot;queerplatonic&quot; to refer to formal intimate relationships between significant others that do not involve romance. Queerplatonic feelings are often described, like romance, as involving a deeper and more profound emotional connection than friendship.

Julie Sondra Decker writes that queerplatonic love often &quot;looks indistinguishable from romance when outside the equation&quot;, but should not be &quot;assigned a romantic status if participants say it is not romantic&quot;. She also notes that it can also be misread by observers as close friendship in circumstances where overtly romantic gestures are socially expected. For Decker, the essence of queerplatonic attraction is its ambiguous position in relation to normative categories: she writes that QPR &quot;is a platonic relationship, but it is &#x27;queered&#x27; in some way—not friends, not romantic partners, but something else&quot;.

<text>A regional Internet registry (RIR) is an organization that manages the allocation and registration of Internet number resources within a region of the world. Internet number resources include IP addresses and autonomous system (AS) numbers. 
The regional Internet registry system evolved, eventually dividing the responsibility for management to a registry for each of five regions of the world. The regional Internet registries are informally liaised through the unincorporated Number Resource Organization (NRO), which is a coordinating body to act on matters of global importance.

As of 2005, there are currently five regional registries:
* The African Network Information Centre (AFRINIC) is based in Ebene, Mauritius and serves all of Africa. 
* The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is based in Chantilly, Virginia and serves Antarctica, Canada, the United States, and some Caribbean countries and territories.
* The Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) is based in Brisbane, Australia and serves East, South and Southeast Asia and Oceania.
* The Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre (LACNIC) is based in Montevideo, Uruguay and serves Latin America as well as some Caribbean countries.
* Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) is based in Amsterdam, Netherlands and serves Central and West Asia, Europe, and Russia.


==Internet Assigned Numbers Authority==
Regional Internet registries are components of the Internet Number Registry System, which is described in IETF RFC 7020, where IETF stands for the Internet Engineering Task Force. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) delegates Internet resources to the RIRs who, in turn, follow their regional policies to delegate resources to their customers, which include Internet service providers and end-user organizations. Collectively, the RIRs participate in the Number Resource Organization (NRO), formed as a body to represent their collective interests, undertake joint activities, and coordinate their activities globally. The NRO has entered into an agreement with ICANN for the establishment of the Address Supporting Organisation (ASO), which undertakes coordination of global IP addressing policies within the ICANN framework.

==Number Resource Organization==
The Number Resource Organization (NRO) is an unincorporated organization uniting the five RIRs. It came into existence on October 24, 2003, when the four existing RIRs entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in order to undertake joint activities, including joint technical projects and policy coordination. The youngest RIR, AFRINIC, joined in April 2005.

The NRO&#x27;s main objectives are to:

* Protect the unallocated IP number resource pool.
* Promote and protect the bottom-up policy development process of the Internet.
* Serve as a focal point for the Internet community to provide input on the RIR system.

==Local Internet registry==
A local Internet registry (LIR) is an organization that has been allocated a block of IP addresses by a RIR, and that assigns most parts of this block to its own customers. Most LIRs are Internet service providers, enterprises, or academic institutions. Membership in a regional Internet registry is required to become a LIR.

<doc id="286015" wikidata="Q1165505" url="?curid=286015" title="Daphne Marlatt">
<text>Daphne Marlatt, born Buckle, CM (born July 11, 1942 in Melbourne, Australia), is a Canadian poet and novelist who lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.

At a young age, her family moved to Malaysia and at age nine, they moved to British Columbia, where she later attended the University of British Columbia. There she developed her poetry style and her strong feminist views. In 1968, she received an MA in comparative literature from Indiana University.

Her poetry, while considered extremely dense and difficult, is also much acclaimed. In 2006, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Daphne Marlatt is an author, teacher, writer, editor, mother and feminist. Her works include two novels, several poetry pieces, and many edited literary journals and magazines. Daphne Marlatt was born to English parents, Arthur and Edrys Lupprian Buckle, in Melbourne, Australia on July 11, 1942.

At the age of three, Marlatt&#x27;s family moved to Penang, Malaysia and then at the age of nine her family immigrated to Vancouver. Marlatt received her B.A. from the University of British Columbia in 1964 and while there, in 1963, became an editor for &quot;TISH&quot;, a Canadian literary journal.

After traveling around the continent with her husband, Gordon Alan Marlatt, a clinical psychologist, she then settled down for a while in Bloomington, Indiana where she received her M.A. from the Indiana University in Comparative literature in 1968. It is here where she started to write &quot;Frames of a Story&quot; (1968). Robert Lecker, in the 1978 article &quot;Perceiving It as It Stands&quot; from &quot;Canadian Literature&quot;, says &quot;Marlatt has every right to join Kay and Gerda in flight, for their predicament, and the development of their story, serve as a metaphor for the problems of growth encountered by a poet struggling to break away from the frames imposed by established word patterns and the falsities implied by a world view which categorizes experience, storytelling it in standardized form, as if the motion of living was always the same, always sane.&quot;

In 1969, Marlatt published &quot;leaf leaf/s&quot;, which is a collection of shorter poems. In 1971, Marlatt published &quot;Rings&quot;, a collection of poems about pregnancy, birth, and early parenting. She started teaching writing and literature at Capilano College and also edited for &quot;The Capilano Review&quot;. In 1972 she published &quot;Vancouver Poems&quot;. Marlatt published a well known piece of hers, &quot;Steveston&quot;, in 1974. This piece is about a small fishing village that Marlatt explains the relation to its history as a camp for Japanese Canadians during World War II.

===Later life===
In 1975, Marlatt published &quot;Our Lives&quot;, a poetry piece about &quot;organic implosions of relationships&quot;, according to BookRags. Marlatt and her partner, the poet and artist Roy Kiyooka, separated in the late 1970s. In 1977, &quot;The Story, She Said&quot; was published and so was her book, &quot;Zocalo&quot;. &quot;Zocalo&quot; is a collection of long poems about the travels had through the Yucatán. Marlatt&#x27;s, &quot;What Matters: Writing 1968-1970&quot;, includes some of her early writings, including &quot;Rings,&quot; and was published in 1980.

Also, in 1980 she had, &quot;Net Work: Selected Writing&quot;, published, which contains new &quot;confidence and authority&quot;, according to Fred Wah, a professor at the University of Calgary. He goes on to say that &quot;the flow of town and history, of the Japanese people and the cannery, especially of the river and language, are more securely rooted in place and concentrated in the writing consciousness than in any other of her books.&quot; And according to www.athabascau.ca, &quot;Net Work: Selected Writing&quot; is &quot;a selection of poetry spanning from &quot;Frames of a Story&quot; (1968) to &quot;What Matters&quot; (1980) is an excellent cross-section of her early poetry.&quot; It is through these pieces and earlier pieces that Marlatt&#x27;s feminist theory begins to emerge.

In 1977, Marlatt co-founded &quot;periodies: a magazine of prose&quot; (1977–81) and in 1981 published &quot;here &amp; there&quot;. It was around this time that Marlatt became more involved in feminist concerns, and attended and organized several feminist conferences. She also, in 1985, co-founded &quot;Tessera&quot;, which is a feminist journal. Around this time, Marlatt is quoted to saying, &quot;a time of transition for me as i tried to integrate my feminist reading with a largely male-mentored postmodernist poetic, at the same time coming out as a lesbian in my life as well as in my writing.&quot;

In 1983, Marlatt&#x27;s &quot;How Hug a Stone&quot; was published, which follows that journey traveled by herself and her son, in 1981, to England. In 1984, &quot;Touch to My Tongue&quot; was published. Both pieces &quot;express her intense apprehension of the continually changing world.&quot;, according to Douglas Barbour, an author of &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;.

Marlatt created two books, &quot;Mauve&quot;, published in 1985 and &quot;character/jeu de letters&quot;, published in 1986, with Quebec feminist and writer Nicole Brossard. &quot;Double negative&quot;, a piece that was put together between Marlatt and Betsy Warland, her significant other, was published in 1988.

In 1988, the introduction of one of Marlatt&#x27;s most distinguished pieces, &quot;Ana Historic&quot;, was published. This novel, according to www.athabascau.ca, &quot; describes the experiences of women both historic and contemporary.&quot; Marlatt describes her novel, &quot;Ana Historic&quot;, in a 2003 interview with Sue Kossew, a professor at the University of New South Wales, as follows:
&quot;I like rubbing the edges of document and memory/fiction against one another. I like the friction that is produced between the stark reporting of document, the pseudo-factual language of journalism, and the more emotional, even poetic, language of memory. That&#x27;s why I used such a hodgepodge of sources in &quot;Ana Historic&quot;: a little nineteenth-century and very local journalism that sounds like a gossip column, a 1906 school textbook, various historical accounts, some contemporary feminist theory, and a school teacher&#x27;s diary from 1873 that was completely fictitious.&quot;

According to Caroline Rosenthal, author of &quot;Narrative Deconstructions of Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdrich&quot;, &quot;Marlatt, in &quot;Ana Historic&quot;, challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a &quot;monstrous&quot; text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity.&quot;

In 1991, Marlatt&#x27;s piece, &quot;Salvage&quot;, was published, which explores parts of Marlatt&#x27;s life and puts it together with a feminist&#x27;s point of view. In 1993 &quot;Ghost Works&quot; was published, which contains prose poems, letters, diary entries, short-line poems, and travel books to make a narrative.

In 1994, &quot;Two Women in a Birth&quot;, was published. This piece was written by both Marlatt and her significant other, Betsy Warland. This piece is &quot;This collection of [poetry] represents ten years of collaborative work by two of Canada&#x27;s leading feminist writers&quot; according to books.google.com.

In 1996, Marlatt&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Taken&quot; was published. This novel that is a tribute to women whose lives have been taken by war. In 2001, &quot;This Tremor Love Is&quot; was published. &quot;This Tremor Love&quot; is a collection of love poems over a period of twenty-five years, from Marlatt&#x27;s first writing to her most recent. Marlatt&#x27;s recent published piece, a collection of poetry called &quot;Seven Glass Bowls&quot;, was published in 2003.

In addition to all of Marlatt&#x27;s published works she can be heard on the CD &quot;Like Light Off Water&quot;, Otter Bay, 2008, reading passages from her classic poetry cycle, Steveston. With music by Canadian composers Robert Minden and Carla Hallett, the CD offers a delicate resonance of microtonal nuance and lyrical intimacy surrounding Marlatt¹s poetic voicing, rhythm and imagery. In 2006 Marlett and her work were the subject of an episode of the television series &quot;Heart of a Poet&quot; produced by Canadian filmmaker Maureen Judge.

Marlatt has also taught at several colleges and universities. These include: University of Alberta, University of British Columbia, Capilano College, University of Calgary, University of Manitoba, McMaster University, Mount Royal College, University of Saskatchewan, Simon Fraser University, University of Victoria and University of Western Ontario. She also received four awards in her career. She received the MacMillan and Brissenden for creative writing; the Canada Council award; the Vancouver Mayor&#x27;s Arts Award for Literary Arts; and the Order of Canada for her contributions to Canadian literature. Marlatt also founded the West Coast Women and Words Society.

Marlatt is currently a student of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, and currently lives in Vancouver, B.C.

<doc id="286016" wikidata="Q661953" url="?curid=286016" title="Decantation">
<text>Decantation is a process for the separation of mixtures of immiscible liquids or of a liquid and a solid mixture such as a suspension. The layer closer to the top of the container—the less dense of the two liquids, or the liquid from which the precipitate or sediment has settled out—is poured off, leaving denser liquid or the solid behind. The process typically is unable to remove all of the top layer, meaning the separation is incomplete or at least one of the two separated components is still contaminated by the other one.

==Processes==
===Immiscible liquid separation===
Decantation can be used to separate immiscible liquids that have different densities. For example, when a mixture of water and oil is present in a beaker, after some time a distinct layer between the two liquids is formed, with the oil layer floating on top of the water layer. This separation can be done by pouring oil out of the container, leaving water behind. Generally, this technique gives an incomplete separation as it is difficult to pour off all of the top layer without pouring out some parts of the bottom layer.

A separatory funnel is an alternative apparatus for separating liquid layers. It has a valve at the bottom to allow draining off the bottom layer. It can give better separation between the two liquids.

===Liquid-solid separation===

Decantation can also separate solid and liquid mixtures by allowing gravity to pull the solid fragments to settle at the bottom of the container. In laboratory situations, decantation of mixtures containing solids and liquids occur in test tubes. To enhance productivity, test tubes should be placed at a 45° angle to allow sediments to settle at the bottom of the apparatus.

A centrifuge machine may also be used in decantation as the natural process of settling down is time-consuming and tedious. A centrifuge forces the precipitate to the bottom of the container; if the force is high enough, solids can aggregate to form pellets, making it easier to separate the mixtures. Then the liquid can be more easily poured away, as the precipitate will tend to remain in its compressed form. 

A decanter centrifuge may be used for continuous solid-liquid separation.

==Examples==
Decantation is frequently used to purify a liquid by separating it from a suspension of insoluble particles (e.g. in red wine, where the wine is decanted from the potassium bitartrate crystals to avoid unsavory taste). This makes the wine more tonic and astringent.

Cream accelerates to the top of milk, allowing the separation of milk and cream. This is used in the cheese industry. Fat is determined in butter by decantation.

To obtain a sample of clear water from muddy water, muddy water is poured into another container, which separates the water from the mud.

In the sugar industry, the processing of sugar beets into granular sugar involves many liquid–solid separations; e.g. separation of syrups from crystals.

Decantation is also present in nanotechnology. In the synthesis of high quality silver nanowire (AgNW) solutions and fabrication process of high performance electrodes, decantation is also being applied which greatly simplifies the purification process.

After using a desiccant to absorb water from an organic liquid, the organic liquid can often be decanted away from the desiccant.

The process of deriving vinegar also requires decantation to remove fats and biomolecular antioxidants from the raw substance. 
Plasma can be separated from blood through decantation by using a centrifuge.

Mercury is disposed of in water bodies during mining, turning the water unfit and toxic. The mercury can be removed through decantation.

<text>Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre (LACNIC) (, ) is the regional Internet registry for the Latin American and Caribbean regions.

LACNIC provides number resource allocation and registration services that support the global operation of the Internet. It is a not-for-profit, membership-based organisation whose members include Internet Service Providers, and similar organisations.

== History ==
Since 1993, academic organizations in Latin America like ENRED – Foro de Redes de América Latina y el Caribe, discussed the need of a register for Latin America, independent from the influence of the United States. In 1998 during an ENRED meeting in Panama including NIC-MX, this theme was discussed and they learned that another group formed by commercial organizations like CABASE (Cámara Argentina de Base de Datos y Servicio en Línea) and ECOM-LAC (Latin America and Caribbean Federation for Internet and Electronic Commerce), were also discussing the idea of a Latin American registry.

On January 30, 1998, Ira Magaziner, then the senior adviser to President Clinton for policy development, released a discussion paper, known as the &quot;green paper&quot; after the DNS root authority incident. A revised version known as the &quot;white paper&quot; was released on June 5. This paper proposed a new organization to handle internet resources (that later became ICANN). The International Forum for the White Paper organized four meetings, the final one in Buenos Aires was attended by South American communication organizations.

Those organizations joined by ECOM-LAC, argued that Latin American IPs addresses could be handled by a local entity and the agreement for creation of LACNIC was signed in Santiago, Chile, on August 22, 1999, during the second ICANN meeting.

An Interim Board was defined with six members:
* AHCIET (Ibero American Association of Research Centers and Telecommunication Companies), Raimundo Beca
* CABASE (Argentine Chamber of Databases and Online Services), Jorge Plano, later substituted by Oscar Messano
* CGI.br, José Luis Ribeiro
* ENRED (Network Forum for Latin America and the Caribbean), Julian Dunayerich; later substituted by Raul Echeverria
* NIC.mx (NIC Mexico), German Valdez
* ECOM-LAC, Fabio Marinho

The agreement to form LACNIC was submitted on August 26, 1999, to Esther Dyson, then Chair of ICANN Interim Board, and the business plan was presented to ARIN. Statutes were created and it was decided that LACNIC headquarters would be in Montevideo, with technicians and equipment in São Paulo, at the NIC.br premises.LACNIC was established in 2001, with administrative offices in Montevideo, Uruguay, and technical facilities provided by CGI.br of São Paulo. The criteria for a new regional Internet registry was formally recognized by ICANN during its Shanghai meeting in 2002.

== Organization ==
LACNIC&#x27;s main functions are:
* Allocating IPv4 and IPv6 address space, and Autonomous System Numbers
* Maintaining the public Whois Database for the Latin American and Caribbean region
* Reverse DNS delegations
* Representing the interests of the Latin American and Caribbean Internet community on the global stage

=== Governance ===
Today, LACNIC has a total of over 8,500 members in the following categories:

# Active Founding Members: AHCIET, CABASE, CGI-Br, eCOMLAC, ENRED, NIC-Mx
# Active A Members
#: Those who receive IP address space directly from LACNIC or indirectly through national registries NIC Brazil and NIC Mexico, as well as those who have received address space from ARIN corresponding to the address space allocated to LACNIC and who apply for admission.
# Adhering Members:
#* Organizations based in the LAC region or that carry out their activities mainly in LAC, which are involved in Internet development and/or composed of Internet service providers, make a relevant contribution to Internet-related policies in the region, agree with the goals of LACNIC and apply for admission.
#* Organizations that manage IP addresses that are not part of the address space allocated to LAC and are geographically located in the LAC region.
#* Any person, company or institution designated as such by decision of the LACNIC Member Assembly in recognition of their activities in furtherance of LACNIC&#x27;s goals.
#* Any natural or legal person who makes a significant financial contribution to support LACNIC.
#* Organizations that receive only an ASN do not become LACNIC members.

=== The Number Resource Organization ===
With the other RIRs, LACNIC is a member of the Number Resource Organization (NRO), which exists to protect the unallocated number resource pool, to promote and protect the bottom-up policy development process, and to be the focal point for input into the RIR system.

=== Initiatives ===
* 2004 FRIDA: Aided by various international agencies to provide grants related to various issues such as gender equality in technology.

<doc id="286021" wikidata="Q1967135" url="?curid=286021" title="Centrifugation">
<text>Centrifugation is a mechanical process which involves the use of the centrifugal force to separate particles from a solution according to their size, shape, density, medium viscosity and rotor speed. The denser components of the mixture migrate away from the axis of the centrifuge, while the less dense components of the mixture migrate towards the axis. Chemists and biologists may increase the effective gravitational force of the test tube so that the precipitate (pellet) will travel quickly and fully to the bottom of the tube. The remaining liquid that lies above the precipitate is called a supernatant or supernate.

There is a correlation between the size and density of a particle and the rate that the particle separates from a heterogeneous mixture, when the only force applied is that of gravity. The larger the size and the larger the density of the particles, the faster they separate from the mixture. By applying a larger effective gravitational force to the mixture, like a centrifuge does, the separation of the particles is accelerated. This is ideal in industrial and lab settings because particles that would naturally separate over a long period of time can be separated in much less time.

The rate of centrifugation is specified by the angular velocity usually expressed as revolutions per minute (RPM), or acceleration expressed as &quot;g&quot;. The conversion factor between RPM and &quot;g&quot; depends on the radius of the centrifuge . The particles&#x27; settling velocity in centrifugation is a function of their size and shape, centrifugal acceleration, the volume fraction of solids present, the density difference between the particle and the liquid, and the viscosity. The most common application is the separation of solid from highly concentrated suspensions, which is used in the treatment of sewage sludges for dewatering where less consistent sediment is produced.

The centrifugation method has a wide variety of industrial and laboratorial applications; not only is this process used to separate two miscible substances, but also to analyze the hydrodynamic properties of macromolecules. It is one of the most important and commonly used research methods in biochemistry, cell and molecular biology. In the chemical and food industries, special centrifuges can process a continuous stream of particle turning into separated liquid like plasma. Centrifugation is also the most common method used for uranium enrichment, relying on the slight mass difference between atoms of U-238 and U-235 in uranium hexafluoride gas.

==Mathematical formula==
In a liquid suspension, many particles or cells will gradually fall to the bottom of the container due to gravity; however, the amount of time taken for such separations is not feasible. Other particles, which are very small, can not be isolated at all in solution until they are exposed to a high centrifugal force. As the suspension is rotated at a certain speed or revolutions per minute (RPM), the centrifugal force allows the particles to travel radially away from the rotation axis. The general formula for calculating the revolutions per minute (RPM) of a centrifuge is:

formula_1,

where &quot;g&quot; represents the relative centrifugal force (RCF) and &quot;r&quot; the radius from the center of the rotor to a point in the sample.

However, depending on the centrifuge model used, the respective angle of the rotor and the radius may vary, thus the formula gets modified. For example, the Sorvall #SS-34 rotor has a maximum radius of 10.8 cm, so the formula becomes formula_2, which can further simplify to formula_3.

When compared to gravity, the particle force is called the &#x27;Relative Centrifugal Force&#x27; (RCF). It is the perpendicular force exerted on the contents of the rotor as a result of the rotation, always relative to the gravity of the Earth, which measures the strength of rotors of different types and sizes. For instance, the RCF of 1000 x g means that the centrifugal force is 1000 times stronger than the Earth&#x27;s gravitational force. RCF is dependent on the speed of rotation in rpm and the distance of the particles from the center of rotation. The most common formula used for calculating RCF is:

formula_4,

where formula_5 is a constant; &quot;r&quot; is the radius, expressed in centimetres, between the axis of rotation and a point in the sample; and &quot;rpm&quot; is the speed in revolutions per minute.

Historically, many separations have been carried out at the speed of 3000 rpm; a rough guide to the ‘g’ force exerted at this speed is to multiply the centrifugation radius by a factor of 10, so a radius of 160 mm gives approximately 1600 x g. This is a rather arbitrary approach, since the RCF applied is linearly dependent on the radius, so a 10% larger radius means that a 10% higher RCF is applied at the same speed. Roughly, the above formula can be simplified to formula_6, with an error of only 0.62%.

==Centrifugation in biological research==
===Microcentrifuges===
Microcentrifuges are specially designed table-top models with light, small-volume rotors capable of very fast acceleration up to approximately 17,000 rpm. They are lightweight devices which are primarily used for short-time centrifugation of samples up to around 0.2–2.0 mL. However, due to their small scale, they are readily transportable and, if necessary, can be operated in a cold room. They can be refrigerated or not. The microcentrifuge is normally used in research laboratories where small samples of biological molecules, cells, or nuclei are required to be subjected to high RCF for relatively short time intervals. Microcentrifuges designed for high-speed operation can reach up to 35,000 rpm, giving RCF up to 30000×g, and are called high-speed microcentrifuges.

===Low-speed centrifuges===
Low-speed centrifuges are used to harvest chemical precipitates, intact cells (animal, plant and some microorganisms), nuclei, chloroplasts, large mitochondria and the larger plasma-membrane fragments. Density gradients for purifying cells are also run in these centrifuges. Swinging-bucket rotors tend to be used very widely because of the huge flexibility of sample size through the use of adaptors. These machines have maximum rotor speeds of less than 10 000 rpm and vary from small, bench-top to large, floor-standing centrifuges.

===High-speed centrifuges===
High-speed centrifuges are typically used to harvest microorganisms, viruses, mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes and intact tubular Golgi membranes. The majority of the simple pelleting tasks are carried out in fixed angle rotors. Some density-gradient work for purifying cells and organelles can be carried out in swinging-bucket rotors, or in the case of Percoll gradients in fixed-angle rotors. High-speed or superspeed centrifuges can handle larger sample volumes, from a few tens of millilitres to several litres. Additionally, larger centrifuges can also reach higher angular velocities (around 30,000 rpm). The rotors may come with different adapters to hold various sizes of test tubes, bottles, or microtiter plates.

===Ultracentrifugations===
Ultracentrifugation makes use of high centrifugal force for studying properties of biological particles at exceptionally high speeds. Current ultracentrifuges can spin to as much as 150,000 rpm (equivalent to 1,000,000 x g). They are used to harvest all membrane vesicles derived from the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membrane, endosomes, ribosomes, ribosomal subunits, plasmids, DNA, RNA and proteins in fixed-angle rotors. Compared to microcentrifuges or high-speed centrifuges, ultracentrifuges can isolate much smaller particles and, additionally, whilst microcentrifuges and supercentrifuges separate particles in batches (limited volumes of samples must be handled manually in test tubes or bottles), ultracentrifuges can separate molecules in batch or continuous flow systems.

Ultracentrifugation is employed for separation of macromolecules/ligand binding kinetic studies, separation of various lipoprotein fractions from plasma and deprotonisation of physiological fluids for amino acid analysis.

They are the most commonly used centrifuge for the density-gradient purification of all particles except cells, and, whilst swinging buckets have been traditionally used for this purpose, fixed-angle rotors and vertical rotors are also used, particularly for self-generated gradients and can improve the efficiency of separation greatly. There are two kinds of ultracentrifuges: the analytical and the preparative.

====Analytical ultracentrifugation====
Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) can be used for determination of the properties of macromolecules such as shape, mass, composition, and conformation. It is a commonly used biomolecular analysis technique used to evaluate sample purity, to characterize the assembly and disassembly mechanisms of biomolecular complexes, to determine subunit stoichiometries, to identify and characterize macromolecular conformational changes, and to calculate equilibrium constants and thermodynamic parameters for self-associating and hetero-associating systems. Analytical ultracentrifuges incorporate a scanning visible/ultraviolet light-based optical detection system for real-time monitoring of the sample’s progress during a spin.

Samples are centrifuged with a high-density solution such as sucrose, caesium chloride, or iodixanol. The high-density solution may be at a uniform concentration throughout the test tube (&quot;cushion&quot;) or a varying concentration (&quot;gradient&quot;). Molecular properties can be modeled through sedimentation velocity analysis or sedimentation equilibrium analysis. During the run, the particle or molecules will migrate through the test tube at different speeds depending on their physical properties and the properties of the solution, and eventually form a pellet at the bottom of the tube, or bands at various heights.

====Preparative ultracentrifugation====
Preparative ultracentrifuges are often used for separating particles according to their densities, isolating and/or harvesting denser particles for collection in the pellet, and clarifying suspensions containing particles. Sometimes researchers also use preparative ultracentrifuges if they need the flexibility to change the type of rotor in the instrument. Preparative ultracentrifuges can be equipped with a wide range of different rotor types, which can spin samples of different numbers, at different angles, and at different speeds.

===Fractionation process===
In biological research, cell fractionation typically includes the isolation of cellular components while retaining the individual roles of each component. Generally, the cell sample is stored in a suspension which is:
*Buffered—neutral pH, preventing damage to the structure of proteins including enzymes (which could affect ionic bonds)
*Isotonic (of equal water potential)—this prevents water gain or loss by the organelles
*Cool—reducing the overall activity of enzyme released later in the procedure

Centrifugation is the first step in most fractionations. Through low-speed centrifugation, cell debris may be removed, leaving a supernatant preserving the contents of the cell. Repeated centrifugation at progressively higher speeds will fractionate homogenates of cells into their components. In general, the smaller the subcellular component, the greater is the centrifugal force required to sediment it. The soluble fraction of any lysate can then be further separated into its constituents using a variety of methods.

===Differential centrifugation===
Differential centrifugation is the simplest method of fractionation by centrifugation, commonly used to separate organelles and membranes found in cells. Organelles generally differ from each other in density and in size, making the use of differential centrifugation, and centrifugation in general, possible. The organelles can then be identified by testing for indicators that are unique to the specific organelles. The most widely used application of this technique is to produce crude subcellular fractions from a tissue homogenate such as that from rat liver. Particles of different densities or sizes in a suspension are sedimented at different rates, with the larger and denser particles sedimenting faster. These sedimentation rates can be increased by using centrifugal force.

A suspension of cells is subjected to a series of increasing centrifugal force cycles to produce a series of pellets comprising cells with a declining sedimentation rate. Homogenate includes nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, plasma membrane sheets and a broad range of vesicles derived from a number of intracellular membrane compartments and also from the plasma membrane, typically in a buffered medium.

===Density gradient centrifugation===
Density gradient centrifugation is known to be one of the most efficient methods for separating suspended particles, and is used both as a separation technique and as a method for measuring the density of particles or molecules in a mixture.

It is used to separate particles on the basis of size, shape, and density by using a medium of graded densities. During a relatively short or slow centrifugation, the particles are separated by size, with larger particles sedimenting farther than smaller ones. Over a long or fast centrifugation, particles travel to locations in the gradient where the density of the medium is the same as that of the particle density; (ρp – ρm) → 0. Therefore, a small, dense particle initially sediments less readily than a large, low density particle. The large particles reach their equilibrium density position early, while the small particles slowly migrate across the large particle zone and ultimately take up an equilibrium position deeper into the gradient.

A tube, after being centrifuged by this method, has particles in order of density based on height. The object or particle of interest will reside in the position within the tube corresponding to its density. Nevertheless, some non-ideal sedimentations are still possible when using this method. The first potential issue is the unwanted aggregation of particles, but this can occur in any centrifugation. The second possibility occurs when droplets of solution that contain particles sediment. This is more likely to occur when working with a solution that has a layer of suspension floating on a dense liquid, which in fact have little to no density gradient.

==Other applications==
A centrifuge can be used to isolate small quantities of solids retained in suspension from liquids, such as in the separation of chalk powder from water. In biological research, it can be used in the purification of mammalian cells, fractionation of subcellular organelles, fractionation of membrane vesicles, fractionation of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes, etc. Centrifugation is used in many different ways in the food industry. For example, in the dairy industry, it is typically used in the clarification and skimming of milk, extraction of cream, production and recovery of casein, cheese production, removing bacterial contaminants, etc. This processing technique is also used in the production of beverages, juices, coffee, tea, beer, wine, soy milk, oil and fat processing/recovery, cocoa butter, sugar production, etc. It is also used in the clarification and stabilization of wine.

In forensic and research laboratories, it can be used in the separation of urine and blood components. It also aids in separation of proteins using purification techniques such as salting out, e.g. ammonium sulfate precipitation. Centrifugation is also an important technique in waste treatment, being one of the most common processes used for sludge dewatering. This process also plays a role in cyclonic separation, where particles are separated from an air-flow without the use of filters. In a cyclone collector, air moves in a helical path. Particles with high inertia are separated by the centrifugal force whilst smaller particles continue with the air-flow.

Centrifuges have also been used to a small degree to isolate lighter-than-water compounds, such as oil. In such situations, the aqueous discharge is obtained at the opposite outlet from which solids with a specific gravity greater than one are the target substances for separation.

==History==
By 1923 Theodor Svedberg and his student H. Rinde had successfully analyzed large-grained sols in terms of their gravitational sedimentation. Sols consist of a substance evenly distributed in another substance, also known as a colloid. However, smaller grained sols, such as those containing gold, could not be analyzed. To investigate this problem Svedberg developed an analytical centrifuge, equipped with a photographic absorption system, which would exert a much greater centrifugal effect. In addition, he developed the theory necessary to measure molecular weight. During this time, Svedberg&#x27;s attention shifted from gold to proteins.

By 1900, it had been generally accepted that proteins were composed of amino acids; however, whether proteins were colloids or macromolecules was still under debate. One protein being investigated at the time was hemoglobin. It was determined to have 712 carbon, 1,130 hydrogen, 243 oxygen, two sulfur atoms, and at least one iron atom. This gave hemoglobin a resulting weight of approximately 16,000 dalton (Da) but it was uncertain whether this value was a multiple of one or four (dependent upon the number of iron atoms present).

Through a series of experiments utilizing the sedimentation equilibrium technique, two important observations were made: hemoglobin has a molecular weight of 68,000 Da, suggesting that there are four iron atoms present rather than one, and that, no matter where the hemoglobin was isolated from, it had exactly the same molecular weight. How something of such a large molecular mass could be consistently found, regardless of where it was sampled from in the body, was unprecedented and favored the idea that proteins are macromolecules rather than colloids. In order to investigate this phenomenon, a centrifuge with even higher speeds was needed, and thus the ultracentrifuge was created to apply the theory of sedimentation-diffusion. The same molecular mass was determined, and the presence of a spreading boundary suggested that it was a single compact particle. Further application of centrifugation showed that under different conditions the large homogeneous particles could be broken down into discrete subunits. The development of centrifugation was a great advance in experimental protein science.

Linderstorm-Lang, in 1937, discovered that density gradient tubes could be used for density measurements. He discovered this when working with potato yellow-dwarf virus. This method was also used in Meselson and Stahl&#x27;s famous experiment in which they proved that DNA replication is semi-conservative by using different isotopes of nitrogen. They used density gradient centrifugation to determine which isotope or isotopes of nitrogen were present in the DNA after cycles of replication.

<text>AFRINIC(African Network Information Centre) is the regional Internet registry (RIR) for Africa. Its headquarters are in Ebene, Mauritius.

Before AFRINIC was formed, IP addresses (IPv6 and IPv4) for Africa were distributed by the Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC), the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), and the RIPE NCC. ICANN provisionally recognized AFRINIC on 11 October 2004. The registry became operational on 22 February 2005. ICANN gave it final recognition in April 2005.

== Organizational structure ==

=== Board of directors ===
AFRINIC consists of a nine-member Board of Directors. Six of the directors are elected to represent the different sub-regions, while two directors are elected to serve on the Board-based solely on competency as opposed to regional representation. The last seat on the Board is filled by the Chief Executive Officer.

Elections are held at each AFRNIC Annual General Meeting (AGMM), which is conducted around May/June every year. Voting takes place both on-site at these meetings and prior to the meeting via online voting.

=== Council of Elders ===
The AFRINIC Council of Elders consists of six former AFRINIC chairpersons.

They fulfill an advisory role and harness all their experience leading the organization as former Chairs.

The Members of the AFRINIC Council of Elders are:
# Dr. Nii N. Quaynor (AFRINIC Board of Trustees Chair: 2001–2004)
# Mr. Pierre S. Dandjinou (AFRINIC Chair: 2004–2008) Board Member: 2004-2010
# Dr. Viv Padayatchy (AFRINIC Chair: 2008–2011) - Board Member: - 2005-2011 
# Mrs. Maimouna Ndeye Diop Diagne (AFRINIC Chair: 2011–2012) - Board Member: 2010-2013
# Dr. Christian Bope

=== AFRINIC Staff ===

AFRINIC Staff carry out the daily operations of the organization.

The Staff is structured in nine departments: CEO&#x27;s Office, HR and Administration, Research and Innovation, Finance and Accounting, External Relations, Communication and Public Relations, Member Services, IT and Engineering, and Capacity Building. These divisions encompass all AFRINIC activities, including that of acting as a central source of information for members.

AFRINIC&#x27;s open policy development process also invites stakeholders interested in Internet number resources from around the world, primarily from the African region, to participate. These include representatives from governments, regulators, educators, media, the technical community, civil society, and other not-for-profit organizations.

== Public Policy Meeting ==
Each year, AFRINIC conducts two public policy meetings. These give the community the chance to come together for policy development, information sharing, and networking. The first Public Policy Meeting of each year is known as the Africa Internet Summit (AIS), and the second is held as a standalone meeting. The meetings are held in various locations throughout Africa.

== Controversies and scandals ==

AFRINIC has been at the center of several organizational controversies in the past five years.

=== Corruption ===

A former senior management member from AFRINIC, Ernest Byaruhanga, committed what is tagged to be Africa&#x27;s greatest internet heist. In total, 4.1 million IP addresses were stolen. 2.3 million came from AFRINIC&#x27;s “free pool” and a further 1.7 million were “legacy” IP addresses. They were worth around $87M, according to MyBroadband. IPv4 addresses, which were already reserved and in use by major organizations were effectively hijacked and sold. These reappropriated IP addresses were used to forward spam, breach data records, and compromise functioning websites. Dozens of South African-based companies and businesses were impacted. Education sectors and the Department of Defence were also hit, losing addresses worth approximately $5.3M.

=== Sexual harassment and bullying complaint ===

In March 2018, allegations were filed by the RIR&#x27;s former head of external relations, Vymala Poligadu. She alleged that the Board chair, VC and the head of financial department had been actively plotting to get her fired from her position. She also alleged that one of the staff had been sexually harassed by Afrinic&#x27;s former chair Sunday Folayan.

The internal report detailing Poligadu&#x27;s accusations was then leaked onto the organization&#x27;s discussion mailing list by an anonymous poster, writing in response to a complaint by another member about high staff turnover.

The independent Investigation Committee&#x27;s (IC) report concluded that the allegations were false and the chair breached the NDA of Board members;
Sunday Folayan quit after the Investigation Committee proved that he breached the signed NDA of AFRINIC Board members.

=== Lawsuits ===

====Lawsuit due to senior management&#x27;s corruption====

=====Afri Holdings Ltd &amp; Others vs AFRINIC=====
In June 2020, AFRINIC was taken to court by one of the men whose name and company have been linked to the heist of the African Internet resources committed by a founding member of AFRINIC, Ernest Byaruhanga. In a notice sent to individuals and organizations that hold IP addresses in the African region, the then AFRINIC CEO Eddy Kayihura stated that an application for an interim injunction against AFRINIC was brought before the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of Mauritius.
The application was lodged by Afri Holdings Ltd, Netstyle A. Ltd, and Elad Cohen. Internet investigator Ron Guilmette has linked Netstyle and Cohen&#x27;s e-mail address to suspicious activity in South Africa, caused by large chunks of South African Internet Protocol address space, worth millions of dollars on the open reseller market, being stolen by AFRINIC&#x27;s ex-top senior executive Ernest Byaruhanga.
Affected IP addresses included a block that belongs to Sasol, and blocks that appear to belong to Tredcor, Afrox, Woolworths, and SITA. Documents obtained in August 2019 also showed that Cohen is a director and shareholder of Afri Holdings Ltd.

=====Logic Web Inc vs AFRINIC=====
On 1 October 2021, Logic Web Inc initiated an application for an interim injunction against AFRINIC.
LogicWeb Inc has received a 196.52.0.0/14 block under the registered name of &quot;ITC&quot;, which is a made-up name for a fake corporate entity that never existed, and one that was invented by the ex-AFRINIC senior management Ernest Byaruhanga as a WHOIS cover story for his IP addresses famous heist. The 196.52.0.0/14 block was another one of AFRINIC&#x27;s senior management&#x27;s thefts from the free pool and one that was subsequently sold or gifted to the proprietor of LogicWeb, Inc. of New York, USA, i.e. a certain Mr. Chad Abizeid. Sometime after Mr. Chad Abizeid received the 196.52.0.0/14 block that was stolen by Ernest Byaruhanga, which is worth well over $5 million, Mr. Abizeid tried to sell off the entire thing at once. 
Before recently reclaiming the stolen Internet Resources, the ex-CEO AFRINIC CEO, Eddy Kayihura, has known about the misappropriated 196.52.0.0/14 block for quite some time without taking any actions of reclaiming it, in potential with corruption from Mr. Abizeid, similar to the AfriHoldings lawsuit case.

AFRINIC&#x27;s scandal of committing the biggest Internet Resources heist, valued at more than 50 million dollars, is still affecting businesses operations that are struggling to recover from AFRINIC&#x27;s attempts of concealing the gravity of the thefts by reclaiming the stolen IP resources, with little to no consideration of the consequences on the African Internet Connectivity. These businesses are now taking the matter to the Mauritius Courts by filing lawsuits against AFRINIC&#x27;s management.

====Lawsuit due to a legal dispute with its membership====

=====Cloud Innovation Ltd vs AFRINIC=====
AFRINIC has been in a feud with Cloud Innovation (CI) since July 2021, as it intended to revoke over 6 million IP addresses from the company backing the claim by stating a breach in policy. However, Afrinic&#x27;s attempt to seize IP addresses currently under Cloud Innovation&#x27;s domain backfired, as by bringing the issue directly to court, without an effort to de-escalate the matter, the RIR did not follow its own in-house policies.

As a result of the unfounded claims advanced by Afrinic, the Supreme Court of Mauritius ordered that Afrinic bank accounts be frozen, thereby crippling its operations. On 15 July, due to court order, Afrinic restored CI&#x27;s IP address blocks. However, the RIR&#x27;s bank assets remained frozen until 15 October, when they were granted the removal of the freezing order against AFRINIC in the Mauritius Court. The litigation is still ongoing.

With the amount of IP addresses involved and Cloud Innovation&#x27;s large international customer base, this litigation is said to be potentially impacting a large majority of the Internet&#x27;s connectivity and operations. Internet professionals all over the world have raised concerns about the possible consequences that would result from Cloud Innovation&#x27;s membership being possibly terminated.

In 2022, Cloud Innovation won in court against AFRINIC, with a Supreme Court Judge ruling in favor of the plaintiff, CI, and against AFRINIC. The Supreme Court Judge concluded that the lawsuits were caused by the registry&#x27;s dogged “determination… to terminate (the plaintiff’s) membership.” At the same time, the judge found no evidence of the lawsuits being indeed vexatious, asking how “in these circumstances… can it be held against the applicant […] that it resorted to the court to preserve its rights?”

=====Africa on Cloud (PTY) Ltd v Afrinic =====
An Injunction has been issued against AFRINIC&#x27;s board&#x27;s illegal attempt to extend Director&#x27;s term, In particular, board seat number 6 is currently being held by Abdalla Omari. This seat was given to Mr. Omari through the passing of an illegal resolution to extend a board member&#x27;s office without an election.

=====Crystal Web (Pty) Ltd v AFRINIC =====
An order has been granted to Crystal Web, one of resources member of AFRINIC, to suspend the CEO of AFRINIC, Eddy Mabano Kayihura, after he tried to censor the community discussion list of AFRINIC because a resource member had uncovered information linking the CEO with a known terrorist supporter. Furthermore, Eddy has been the subject of many controversial and corruptions allegations over the short 2 years since he was in the office. During his tenure as CEO, nearly 50 lawsuits have been filed against AFRINIC, with AFRINIC having been sued by over 8 different parties, including internal parties.

====Lawsuit by suspended CEO Kayihura Mabano Eddy against AFRINIC====
In July 2022, Eddy Kayihura tried to bypass member-based elections by the ATU to appoint directors though the court, thereby violating the bottom-up process in which the RIR is built on and hampering the intended effect of the internet self-governance model.

=== Interfere with rule of law and its home nation&#x27;s sovereignty===
The other four RIRs sent a letter in the name of Number Resources Organization (NRO) to the Mauritius government requesting government recognition of AFRINIC&#x27;s international status.

This letter was not received well by the global community, and Sander Steffan, one of the NRO&#x27;s number council members, described such a move as &quot;neo-colonialism&quot;.

A formal board member of AFRINIC, CTO of Liquid Labs, also sent a letter to the Mauritius government requesting that they not act on the NRO letter by stating &quot;please disregard it in its entirety and that the legal process be allowed to play out as per the Mauritian legal system&quot;.

International media at large has also been against this letter with one media personality calling it &quot;causing collateral damage&quot;. Another referenced such action as a top-down approach (contradicting to bottom-up approach RIR was founded on) and questioned why RIR resisted the ITU proposal to take them over in the immunity is what they want.

The NRO letter called Cloud Innovation a vexatious litigant, but a week later a judgment from the supreme court was delivered that specifically noted Cloud Innovation is not a vexatious litigant. The judgement criticized AFRINIC for trying to pervert the course of justice.

== IPv4 exhaustion ==
In April 2017, AFRINIC became the last regional Internet registry to run down to its last /8 block of IPv4 addresses (102/8), thus triggering the final phase of its IPv4 exhaustion policy. As a result, AFRINIC then implemented a soft landing policy for allocating the last /8 to its users, in which, since Phase 2 of the exhaustion period (started in January 2020), each AFRINIC customer is eligible for just one final maximum allocation of a /22 block of IPv4 addresses until the block is exhausted.

== AFRINIC training ==
AFRINIC conducts a number of training courses in a wide variety of locations around the region. These courses are designed to educate participants to proficiently configure, manage and administer their Internet services and infrastructure and to embrace current best practices.

== WHOIS database ==
The AFRINIC WHOIS Database contains registration details of IP addresses and AS numbers originally allocated by AFRINIC. It shows the organizations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks. The organizations that hold those resources are responsible for updating their information in the database. The database can be searched by using the web interface on the AFRINIC site or by directing your whois client to whois.afrinic.net (for example, whois -h whois.afrinic.net 196.1.0.0/24).

== The AFRINIC membership ==
Major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Internet exchange point (IXPs), governments and academic institutions.

== Policy development process ==
AFRINIC&#x27;s policies are developed by the membership and broader Internet community. The major media for policy development are the face-to-face Public Policy Meetings, which are held twice each year, and mailing list discussions.
== Economies ==
AFRINIC&#x27;s service region is divided into six sub-regions in Africa for statistic gathering purposes and for Board of Directors elections to ensure regional representation.

These sub-regions are: Northern, Western, Central, Eastern, Southern and the Indian Ocean.

AFRINIC&#x27;s service region also includes several islands located in the Atlantic Ocean which are listed in the Western or Central African regions.

<text>Turacin is a naturally occurring red pigment that is 6% copper complexed to uroporphyrin III. Arthur Herbert Church discovered turacin in 1869.

It is found only in the bird family Musophagidae, the turacos. Other birds derive their red coloration from carotenoids (bright and orange-reds) or phaeomelanins (rusty and brownish-reds).

It is often assumed that this coloration will wash out when the birds are bathing or after heavy rains, but this is true only if the water used for bathing happens to be very alkaline.

The copper(II) uroporphyrin III pigment in turaco feathers was studied using electron spin resonance by Jack Peisach first with Blumberg and later with Mims.

<doc id="286031" wikidata="Q1349498" url="?curid=286031" title="Philip Henslowe">
<text>Philip Henslowe ( – 6 January 1616) was an Elizabethan theatrical entrepreneur and impresario. Henslowe&#x27;s modern reputation rests on the survival of his diary, a primary source for information about the theatrical world of Renaissance London.

== Life ==
Henslowe was born in Lindfield, Sussex, into a family with roots in Devon. His father, Edmund Henslowe, was appointed Master of the Game for Ashdown Forest, Sussex, from 1539 until his death in 1562. Before Edmund Henslowe&#x27;s death, his daughter Margaret had married Ralf Hogge, an ironmaster.

By the 1570s, Henslowe had moved to London, becoming a member of the Dyers&#x27; Company. Henslowe is recorded working as assistant to Henry Woodward, reputed to be the bailiff for Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, owner of Cowdray House and Battle Abbey in Sussex. Henslowe married Woodward&#x27;s widow, Agnes, and from 1577 lived in Southwark, opposite the Clink prison. His elder brother Edmund, a merchant, also owned property in Southwark. It was at one time assumed that his wife&#x27;s inheritance gave Henslowe his start in business, but there is no evidence.

His success in business appears to have brought him some social prominence. By the early-17th century, he was a vestryman, churchwarden and overseer of the poor in St Saviour&#x27;s ward in Southwark. During the reign of Elizabeth I, he was a Groom of the Chamber. Under James I, he served as a Gentleman Sewer of the Chamber. Henslowe also served as a collector of the Lay Subsidy.

Henslowe died in 1616 in London, still actively involved in the theatre.

== Business interests ==
Henslowe developed extensive business interests, including dyeing, starch-making, pawn-broking, money lending and trading in goat skins. He owned property in East Grinstead and Buxted, Sussex, where his brother-in-law, Ralf Hogge, lived. Between 1576 and 1586, Henslowe was involved in the trade in timber from Ashdown Forest. However, his main activity was as a landlord in Southwark. One of his authors, Henry Chettle, described him as being unscrupulously harsh with his poor tenants, even though Henslowe made many loans to Chettle and they seem to have been on friendly terms.

=== Theatrical interests ===
In 1584, Henslowe purchased a property known as The Little Rose, in Southwark, which contained rose gardens and, almost certainly, a brothel. In 1587, Henslowe and John Cholmley built The Rose, the third of the large, permanent playhouses in London, and the first in Bankside. From 1591, Henslowe partnered with the Admiral&#x27;s Men after that company split with The Theatre&#x27;s James Burbage over the division of receipts. Edward Alleyn, the Admiral&#x27;s&#x27; lead actor, married Henslowe&#x27;s stepdaughter Joan in 1592, and they worked in partnership.

In 1598 Burbage&#x27;s company (by then, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men) erected the new Globe Theatre in Bankside; Henslowe moved the Admiral&#x27;s Men to the north-western corner of the city, into a venue he had financed, the Fortune Theatre. John Taylor, the &quot;Water Poet&quot;, petitioned the King on behalf of the Watermen&#x27;s Company, because of the expected loss of business transporting theatre patrons across the Thames.

He also had interests in the Newington Butts Theatre and The Swan Theatre in Southwark.

=== Animal shows ===
Henslowe and Alleyn also operated the Paris Garden, a venue for baitings; early in James&#x27;s reign, they purchased the office of Keeper of the Royal Game, namely bulls, bears and mastiffs. In 1614, he and Jacob Meade built the Hope Theatre in Bankside; designed with a moveable stage for both plays and animal baiting, it was the last of the large open-roof theatres built before 1642. The animal shows ended up ascendant at this venue. The introduction to Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;, performed at the Hope in 1614, complains that the theatre is &quot;as dirty as Smithfield, and as stinking every whit.&quot; The theatre did not have a regular theatrical tenant after 1617; Henslowe&#x27;s share in it was willed to Alleyn.

== Henslowe&#x27;s diary ==
Henslowe&#x27;s &quot;diary&quot; is a valuable source of information on the theatrical history of the period. It is a collection of memoranda and notes that record payments to writers, box office takings, and lists of money lent. Also of interest are records of the purchase of expensive costumes and of stage properties, such as the dragon in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, which provide insight into the staging of plays in Elizabethan theatre.

The diary is written on the reverse of pages of a book of accounts of his brother-in-law Ralf Hogge&#x27;s ironworks, kept by his brother John Henslowe for the period 1576–1581. Hogge was the Queen&#x27;s Gunstonemaker, and produced both iron cannon and shot for the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. John Henslowe seems to have acted as his agent, and Philip prudently reused his old account book. These entries are a valuable source for the early iron-making industry.

The diary begins covering Henslowe&#x27;s theatrical activities for 1592. Entries continue, with varying degrees of thoroughness (authors&#x27; names were not included before 1597), until 1609; in the years before his death, Henslowe appears to have run his theatrical interests from a greater distance. At some time after his death, his papers, including the diary, were transferred to Dulwich College, which Alleyn had founded.

Henslowe recorded payments to twenty-seven Elizabethan playwrights. He variously commissioned, bought and produced plays by, or made loans to Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton, Henry Chettle, George Chapman, Thomas Dekker, John Webster, Anthony Munday, Henry Porter, John Day, John Marston and Michael Drayton. The diary shows the varying partnerships between writers, in an age when many plays were collaborations. It also shows Henslowe to have been a careful man of business, obtaining security in the form of rights to his authors&#x27; works, and holding their manuscripts, while tying them to him with loans and advances. If a play was successful, Henslowe would commission a sequel.

Performances of works with titles similar to Shakespearean plays, such as a &quot;Hamlet&quot;, a &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, a &quot;Henry V&quot;, a &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; and a &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; are mentioned in the diary with no author listed. Most of these plays were recorded when the Admiral&#x27;s Men and the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men briefly joined forces when the playhouses were closed owing to the plague (June 1594).

In 1599, Henslowe paid Dekker and Henry Chettle for a play called &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, which is probably the play currently known from British Library Add MS 10449 (the actors&#x27; names that appear in the plot connect it to the Admiral&#x27;s Men and date it between March 1598 and July 1600). 
There is no mention of William Shakespeare (or Christopher Marlowe, Robert Greene, Thomas Kyd or any University Wits writer, or figures like Richard Burbage for that matter) in Henslowe&#x27;s diary (which prompted the forgeries of John Payne Collier); their absence is due to the fact that Shakespeare and Burbage were only connected to Henslowe&#x27;s companies in the early 1590&#x27;s before Henslowe records any authors. Shakespeare&#x27;s company, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, performed at The Theatre (starting in 1594) and later The Globe Theatre (starting in 1599).

=== Costumes and props ===
In 1598 Henslowe made an inventory of his company&#x27;s stage props; &#x27;along with numerous weapons and crowns, there was a boar&#x27;s head, a wooden leg, a golden fleece and the cauldron in which Marlowe&#x27;s Jew of Malta is boiled to death.&#x27;

== History ==
The papers first came to critical attention in 1780, when Edmond Malone requested them from the Dulwich College library; the papers had been misplaced and were not found until 1790. Malone made a transcript of the parts he viewed as relevant to his variorum edition of Shakespeare. The original was returned to Dulwich after Malone&#x27;s death. (Malone&#x27;s transcript was returned to the library around 1900.) The next scholar to examine the manuscripts was John Payne Collier.

== In popular culture ==
Henslowe was portrayed by actor Geoffrey Rush in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.

<text>Velotype is the trademark for a type of keyboard for typing text known as a syllabic chord keyboard, an invention of the Dutchmen Nico Berkelmans and Marius den Outer.

== History ==
Marius den Outer invented the Tachotype in 1933. Herman Schweigman and Rudolf Nitzsche created an electronic version of the Tachotype in 1982 and named it the Velotype. A stand-alone Velotype text processor was created in 2001 named the Veyboard.

In 2011 the Velotype keyboard was improved and modernized by Wim Gerbecks and Sander Pasveer. Velotype is a Dutch company.

== Design and rationale ==
Contrary to traditional QWERTY type keyboards, on which a typist usually presses one key at a time to create one character at a time, a Velotype requires the user to press several keys simultaneously, producing syllables rather than letters.

A practiced velotypist can produce more text than on a traditional keyboard, as much as 200 words per minute, double the rate of a fast traditional typist. Because of this, Velotypes are often used for live applications, such as subtitling for television and for the hearing impaired.

The keyboard is an orthographic chord keyboard, very different from phonetic chord keyboards used for verbatim transcription, like the stenotype. Such chorded phonetic keyboards, such as those manufactured by Stenograph, produce an intermediate shorthand format in which a combination of phonetics- and spelling-based strokes are translated by software to produce the output. Orthographic keyboards, on the other hand, allow the operator to rely on more traditional spelling in shaping the output, hence the term &quot;orthographic&quot; as opposed to &quot;phonetic&quot;.

The Velotype-pro contains software that allows the user to create their own abbreviations and short forms in addition to those pre-built into the machine.

Stenographic keyboards are generally more difficult to learn than the Velotype, but trained stenotype operators can go faster, even upwards of 300 words per minute. However, if unusual words appear, a typist using a stenotype slows down, while the Velotypist can continue with the same speed, which can go up to 200 words per minute.

<text>Fürstenfeldbruck is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the city of Munich and the districts of Munich, Starnberg, Landsberg, Aichach-Friedberg and Dachau.

==History==

In medieval times the region was a clerical state ruled by the abbey of Fürstenfeld. When the clerical states of Holy Empire were dissolved in 1803, the territory was annexed by Bavaria. The district of Fürstenfeldbruck was established in 1939.

==Geography==

The district is occupied by the western Munich metropolitan area. It has the highest population density of all Bavarian districts. More than 90 percent of the population lives in the eastern half of the district, which includes the suburbs of Munich.

<text>The Rose was an Elizabethan playhouse, built by theatre entrepreneur Philip Henslowe in 1587. It was the fifth public playhouse to be built in London, after the Red Lion in Whitechapel (1567), The Theatre (1576) and the Curtain (1577), both in Shoreditch, and the theatre at Newington Butts () – and the first of several playhouses to be situated in Bankside, Southwark, in a liberty outside the jurisdiction of the City of London&#x27;s civic authorities. Two of the earliest plays by William Shakespeare – Titus Andronicus and Henry VI, Part 1 – are recorded as having been performed there, as well as plays by dramatists such as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene, George Peele, Thomas Dekker, Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson and Thomas Heywood. The Rose&#x27;s archaeological remains were rediscovered in 1989 during the redevelopment of the site to build an office block, and were partially excavated. After a public campaign to preserve the remains, they are now listed by Historic England as a Scheduled Monument at Risk. Subsequently the site has become an exhibition space and theatre venue, known as The Rose Playhouse, administered by The Rose Theatre Trust, a registered charity, which plans to first complete the excavation and preservation of the remains, and then to build a new visitor, education and arts centre there.

== History ==
The Rose was built in 1587 by Philip Henslowe and by a tanner from Bletchingley named John Cholmley. The theatre was built on a messuage called the &quot;Little Rose,&quot; which Henslowe had leased from the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark in 1585. The Rose was the first of several theatres to be situated in Bankside, Southwark near the south shore of the River Thames. The area was known for its leisure attractions such as bear/bull-baitings, gaming dens and brothels. It was located in the Liberty of the Clink, a liberty outside the jurisdiction of the City of London&#x27;s civic authorities. The Rose contained substantial rose gardens and two buildings; Cholmley used one as a storehouse, while Henslowe appears to have leased the other as a brothel. North of London, professional playhouses like the Curtain Theatre and The Theatre had already been open for over a decade. However, Henslowe recognized the ease at which audiences could ferry across the River of Thames and established a playhouse in this particular location.

The extent of Cholmley&#x27;s involvement in the theatre project is unclear. The only mention of Cholmley among Henslowe&#x27;s diaries of the playhouse are in the deed of partnership between the two men, and in brief scribbles on the outside cover of the first folio: &quot;Cholmley Cholmley&quot; and &quot;Cholmley when?&quot;. Cholmley died in 1589 nullifying their deed of partnership, 2 years into the agreed 8 year and 3 month term. Cholmley was a member of the Worshipful Company of Grocers and so is referred to as a Grocer in some sources, though his primary business was in tanning.

The theatre was built by the carpenter John Griggs. The new building was of timber, with a lath and plaster exterior and thatch roof. In shape it was a fourteen-sided polygon, of about in external diameter. The inner space was also a fourteen-sided polygon, about wide. Modern calculations show that the dimensions and fourteen-sided layout were dictated by the use of the standard 16th-century measure of one rod as a base and the carpenter&#x27;s &quot;rule of thumb&quot; method of dividing a circle into seven equal parts, subdivided.

Henslowe&#x27;s documentation of the Rose Theatre has survived, and was placed in the library of Dulwich College by its founder, Edward Alleyn, in 1619. Alleyn was the principal actor of the Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men. City records indicate that The Rose was in use by late 1587; however, it is not mentioned in Henslowe&#x27;s accounts between its construction and 1592, and it is possible that he leased it to an acting company with which he was not otherwise concerned. In May 1591, The Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men split off from the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, a company of London&#x27;s most famous actor, Richard Burbage, at The Theatre. Their repertoire included plays by Robert Greene and especially Christopher Marlowe, who became the theatre&#x27;s main playwright. Edward Alleyn married Henslowe&#x27;s step-daughter in 1592, and the two became partners. However, the 1592–4 period was difficult for the acting companies of London; a severe outbreak of bubonic plague meant that the London theatres were closed almost continuously from June 1592 to May 1594. The plague took nearly 11,000 Londoners. The companies were forced to tour to survive, and some, like Pembroke&#x27;s Men, fell on hard times. From 1592 to 1593, the Lord Strange&#x27;s Men performed on the Rose Stage. From 1593 to 1594, the Earl of Sussex&#x27;s Men performed in its place, suggesting that the Lord Strange&#x27;s Men were among the deceased. By the summer of 1594 the plague had abated, and the companies re-organized themselves. The Queen&#x27;s Men performed in 1594 and the Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men, still led by Alleyn, resumed its place at the Rose by Springtime. At their height, in the year from June 1595, they performed 300 times, nearly thirty-six plays, twenty of which were new. The Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men resided at The Rose for seven years.

Henslowe enlarged the theatre for The Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men, moving the stage further back (six feet six inches, or two metres) to make room for perhaps 500 extra spectators. The original Rose was smaller than other theatres, only about two-thirds the size of the original Theatre built eleven years earlier, and its stage was also unusually small; the enlargement addressed both matters. Henslowe paid all the costs himself, given Cholmley was deceased. The renovation gave the theatre, formerly a regular polygon (with 14 sides), a distorted egg shape, a &quot;bulging tulip&quot; or &quot;distorted ovoid&quot; floor plan.

However, the Rose&#x27;s success encouraged other theatre companies to set up roots in the Bankside. The Swan Playhouse opened nearby in the winter of 1596. People were drawn to the comedies and tragedies performed at the Swan in contrast to the history plays for which the Rose Theatre was renowned. In 1598, Alleyn retired, and Henslowe shifted his position over from landlord and banker to the full financial manager. When the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men built the Globe Theatre on the Bankside in 1599, however, the Rose was put into a difficult position. In January the following year, Henslowe and Alleyn built The Fortune Theatre north of the River of Thames. Prompted by complaints from city officials, the Privy Council decreed in June 1600 that only two theatres would be allowed for stage plays: The Globe Theatre in Bankside, and the Fortune Theatre in Middlesex – specifically, Shoreditch. Henslowe and Alleyn had already built the Fortune, apparently to fill the vacuum created when the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men left Shoreditch. The Rose was used briefly by The Lord Pembroke&#x27;s Men in 1600 and the Worcester&#x27;s Men in 1602 and 1603. The lease ended in 1605, and Henslowe was ready to renew his lease under the original terms. However, the parish insisted on renegotiating the contract and tripled the price of his rent. Henslowe gave up the playhouse in 1605. The Rose may have been torn down as early as 1606. Henslowe moved on to build the Hope Theatre in 1613. He died three years later.

The Rose appears to have differed from other theatres of the era in its ability to stage large scenes on two levels. It is thought that all Elizabethan theatres had a limited capability to stage scenes &quot;aloft,&quot; on an upper level at the back of the stage – as with Juliet at her window in &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; II.ii. A minority of Elizabethan plays, however, call for larger assemblies of actors on the higher second level – as with the Roman Senators looking down upon Titus in the opening scene of &quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot; An unusual concentration of plays with the latter sort of staging requirement can be associated with the Rose, indicating that the Rose had an enhanced capacity for this particularity of stagecraft.

== Excavation ==

An archaeological dig began in Park Street during planned large scale redevelopment. Investigatory trenches revealed several finds, which came to the attention of Sam Wanamaker, who was seeking the means to recreate Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre, and conveying updates to his contacts in theatrical productions early in 1988. An action committee was formed to &#x27;Save The Rose Theatre&#x27;, being assisted by both &#x27;Entertainment Stars and a rotation of public volunteers, to ensure the site&#x27;s protection, which was continually threatened by construction crews ignorant of the potential &#x27;English Heritage&#x27; beneath.

In March 1989, the remains of The Rose were again threatened with destruction resulting in a physical stand-off between the two parties at the entrance of the building development. A campaign to save the site was launched by several well-known theatrical figures, led by Peggy Ashcroft and including Laurence Olivier and Judi Dench. Prior to the site being given full legal protections, a fundraising street party attended by several prominent entertainers was held on 23 April 1989.

It was eventually decided to suspend the proposed building over the top of the theatre&#x27;s remains, leaving them conserved beneath, resulting in what has been called &quot;one of the weirdest sights in London&quot;. A blue plaque at 56 Park Street marks the spot.

The handling of the Rose Theatre by government, archaeologists and the developer provided impetus for the legitimisation of archaeology in the development process and led the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher to introduce PPG 16 in an attempt to manage archaeology in the face of development threats.

When the Department of Greater London Archaeology (now MOLA) carried out the excavation work, the staff found many objects which are now stored in the museum itself. Portions of the theatre&#x27;s foundations, under the &quot;ingressi&quot; (wooden stairs leading to the galleries), were littered with fruit seeds and hazelnut shells; it has been claimed that hazelnuts were the popcorn of English Renaissance drama. When combined with cinder and earth, they provided a tough floor surface &quot;so tough, indeed, that 400 years later archaeologists had to take a pickaxe to it to penetrate it&quot;. Initially the floor of the yard (including the area beneath the raised wooden stage) had a screeded mortar surface but when the building was extended a compacted layer of silt, ash and clinker, mixed with hazelnut shells, was used. The nutshells were brought to the site from a nearby soap works, where the nuts were crushed for their oil, rather than evidence of litter left by the audience.

== Today ==
In 1999, the site was re-opened to the public, underneath the new development. Work continues to excavate this historic site further and to secure its future. The foundations of the Rose are covered in a few inches of water to keep the ground from developing major cracks. In 2003 the Rose was opened as a performance space with a production of Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot;.

== Modern replicas ==
A replica of The Rose Theatre was featured in the film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and after 10 years in storage was donated by Dame Judi Dench to the British Shakespeare Company, who were planning to rebuild it in the north of England, although the plans have not progressed any further since they were announced in 2009. In 2008 the Rose Theatre Kingston opened in Kingston upon Thames. It is a modern theatre, but based on the plan of the original Rose, revealed by archaeology in 1989.

<text>In Hinduism, Kamalā () or Kamalātmikā, () also known as Kamalālayā () is considered to be the Tantric characterisation of the goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi. In Shaktism, she is represented as the Devi in the fullness of her graceful aspect. She is believed to be the tenth and the last Mahavidya. She is also considered to be the last form of the goddess Adi Parashakti.

==Iconography==
In Shakti tradition, the lotus goddess is exalted thus:

The fact that Kamala is associated with elephants has two connotations: Firstly, elephants are harbingers of clouds and rain in Hinduism, thus indicating fertility; Secondly, as a powerful creature, it represents royal authority and divinity. Her relationship with the lotus suggests that she exists in a state of refinement that transcends the material world, and yet is rooted in it.

== Relationship with Vishnu ==
While Lakshmi is portrayed as a loving wife to Narayana and is often depicted as massaging his feet in her submissive role, Kamala is rendered more independent in her role, more candidly performing her duties as the goddess who ushers in bliss and prosperity. While she is still deemed as the beloved of Vishnu, she is less performative of her marital and domestic obligations to him. She is also depicted to be a more fearsome goddess who is to be reckoned in her own right, some of her epithets in Tantric traditions including Bhima (terrible), Kalaratri (black night), and Tamasi (darkness), indicating that she is not reliant on him for his preservation and can fight evil with her own powers. In her Mahavidya context, she is also rarely associated with incarnations of Lakshmi such as Sita and Rukmini, though she is identified as two of the Saptamatrikas who are also forms associated with Vishnu, Varahi, and Vaishnavi.

<doc id="286046" wikidata="Q17634885" url="?curid=286046" title="Matangi">
<text>Matangi (, ) is a Hindu goddess. She is one of the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and an aspect of the Hindu Divine Mother. She is considered to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati, the goddess of music and learning. Matangi governs speech, music, knowledge and the arts. Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers, especially gaining control over enemies, attracting people to oneself, acquiring mastery over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge.

Matangi is often associated with pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society, which is embodied in her most popular form, known as Uchchhishta-Chandalini or Uchchhishta-Matangini. She is described as an outcaste (Chandalini) and offered left-over or partially eaten food (&quot;Uchchhishta&quot;) with unwashed hands or food after eating, both of which are considered to be impure in classical Hinduism.

Matangi is represented as emerald green in colour. While Uchchhishta-Matangini carries a noose, sword, goad, and club, her other well-known form, Raja-Matangi, plays the veena and is often pictured with a parrot.

==Iconography and textual descriptions==

The &quot;Dhyana mantra&quot; (a mantra that details the form of the deity on which a devotee should meditate) of the &quot;Brhat Tantrasara&quot; describes Uchchhishta-Matangini, one of the most popular forms of the goddess. Matangi is seated on a corpse and wears red garments, red jewellery and a garland of gunja seeds. The goddess is described as a young, sixteen-year-old maiden with fully developed breasts. She carries a skull bowl and a sword in her two hands, and is offered leftovers.

The &quot;Dhyana mantra&quot;s in the &quot;Purashcharyarnava&quot; and the &quot;Tantrasara&quot; describe Matangi as blue in colour. The crescent moon adorns her forehead. She has three eyes and a smiling face. She wears jewellery and is seated on a jewelled throne. She carries a noose, a sword, a goad, and a club in her four arms. Her waist is slim and her breasts well-developed.

The &quot;Dhyana Mantra&quot; of Raja-Matangi from the &quot;Purashcharyarnava&quot; describes Matangi as green in colour with the crescent moon on her forehead. She has long hair, a smiling expression and intoxicated eyes, and wears a garland of kadamba flowers and various ornaments. She perspires a little around the face, which renders her even more beautiful. Below her navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin vertical line of fine hair. Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots, she represents the 64 arts. The &quot;Saradatilaka&quot;, adds to this description that Raja-Matangi plays the veena, wears conch-shell earrings and flower garlands, and has flower paintings adorning her forehead. She is also depicted wearing a garland of white lotus (here lotus signifies multi-colored world creation), similar to the iconography of goddess Saraswati, with whom she is associated with.

According to Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Shyamaladandakam&quot;, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena and speaks sweetly. The &quot;Dhyana Mantra&quot; describes her to be four-armed, with a dark emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a crescent moon on her forehead. She carries a noose, a goad, a sugarcane bow and flower arrows, which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often described to hold. She is also described to love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song.

The green complexion is associated with deep knowledge and is also the colour of Budha, the presiding deity of the planet Mercury who governs intelligence. Matangi is often depicted with a parrot in her hands, representing speech. The veena symbolizes her association with music.

==Legends==

Matangi is often named as the ninth Mahavidya. A list contained within the prose of the &quot;Mundamala&quot; equates Vishnu&#x27;s ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas. The Buddha is equated to Matangi. A similar list in the &quot;Guhyatiguhya-Tantra&quot; omits Matangi altogether, however the scholar Sircar interprets the goddess Durga – equated to the avatar Kalki in the list – as an allusion to Matangi.

In a story from the Shakta &quot;Maha-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, which narrates the creation of all the Mahavidyas, Sati, the daughter of Daksha and wife of the god Shiva, feels insulted that she and Shiva are not invited to Daksha&#x27;s yagna (&quot;fire sacrifice&quot;) and insists on going there, despite Shiva&#x27;s protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva, the enraged Sati transforms into the Mahavidyas, including Matangi. The Mahavidyas then surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions; Matangi stands in the northwest. Another similar legend replaces Sati with Kali (the chief Mahavidya) as the wife of Shiva and the origin of Matangi and the other Mahavidyas. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes Matangi and her fellow Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of the goddess Shakambhari.

The &quot;Shaktisamgama-tantra&quot; narrates the birth of Uchchhishta-Matangini. Once, the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his wife Parvati (a reincarnation of Sati) and gave them a banquet of fine foods. While eating, the deities dropped some food on the ground, from which arose a beautiful maiden, a manifestation of Goddess Saraswati, who asked their left-overs. The four deities granted her their left-overs as prasad, food made sacred by having been first consumed by the deity. This can be interpreted as the Uchchhishta of the deity, although due to its negative connotation the word &quot;Uchchhishta&quot; is never explicitly used in connection to prasad. Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes, declaring her the giver of boons. From that day, the maiden was known as Uchchhishta-Matangini.

The &quot;Pranotasani Tantra&quot; (18th Century) and &quot;Naradpancharatra&quot; narrates that once Parvati longed to go back to her maternal house for some days and asked Shiva&#x27;s permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya&#x27;s place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himavan&#x27;s abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva&#x27;s abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Uchchhishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali &quot;Mangalkavya&quot;s. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.

The &quot;Svatantra-tantra&quot; mentions that Matanga practised austerities for thousands of years to gain the power to subdue all beings. Finally, goddess Tripura Sundari appeared and from eyes emitted rays that produced goddess Kali, who had greenish complexion and was known as Raja-Matangini. With her help, Matanga fulfilled his desire. &quot;Matanga Tantra&quot; and many other texts including the &quot;Shyamaladandakam&quot; describe Matangi as the daughter of the sage Matanga.

Another tale is associated with the temple dedicated to Kauri-bai—an aspect of Matangi—who appeared in the low caste area of Varanasi. Kauri-bai is Shiva&#x27;s sister who was obsessed with the Brahmin ways and purity and abhorred Shiva&#x27;s heterodox practices like dwelling in cremation grounds, partaking of intoxicants and being in the company of ghosts and goblins. While Shiva simply ignored Kauri-bai&#x27;s words at first, after his marriage his wife Parvati could not bear Kauri-bai&#x27;s abusive words toward her husband and cursed Kauri-bai to be reborn in and spend her entire life within an &quot;untouchable&quot; area of Varanasi which Kauri-bai considered polluted. Consequently, Kauri-bai was indeed reborn in the low-caste area of Varanasi and felt very unhappy. She pleaded her brother Shiva—the Lord of Varanasi—who granted her the boon that no pilgrimage to Varanasi would be deemed complete without her worship.

==Associations==

Matangi is often associated with pollution, especially left-over or partially eaten food (Uchchhishta or &quot;Ucçhishṭa&quot;, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She is often offered such polluted left-over food and is in one legend described to be born from it. Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish. As the patron of left-over food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.

Matangi is often described as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in ancient Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like the collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of ancient Hindu society. She represents equality as she is worshipped by both upper and lower caste people.

Matangi is also associated with forests and tribal peoples, who lie outside conventional Hindu society. Her thousand-name hymn from the &quot;Nanayavarta-tantra&quot; mentions lines that describe her as dwelling in, walking in, knowing and relishing the forest.

Matangi represents the power of the spoken word (&quot;Vaikhari&quot;) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music, and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (&quot;Madhyama&quot;), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents &quot;Para-Vaikhari&quot;—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called &quot;Mantrini&quot;, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also represents the word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Saraswati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers to the nature of the spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.

Matangi is regarded as a Tantric form of Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and the arts of mainstream Hinduism, with whom she shares many traits. Both embody music and are depicted playing the veena. They are also both said to be the &quot;Nada&quot; (sound or energy) that flows through the Nadi channels in the body through which life force flows. Both are related to rain clouds, thunder and rivers. Though both govern learning and speech, Saraswati represents the orthodox knowledge of the Brahmins while Matangi—the wild and ecstatic outcast—embodies the &quot;extraordinary&quot; beyond the boundaries of mainstream society, especially inner knowledge. Matangi is also associated with Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of knowledge and obstacle removal. Both are related to the elephant and learning. Matangi is also regarded as his mother. Matangi is also described as a minister of the Mahavidya goddess Tripura Sundari or Rajarajeshvari, the Queen of Queens.

==Worship==

Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is the other Mahavidya, whose worship is primarily prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the &quot;Maha-Bhagavata Purana&quot; asks her grace to control one&#x27;s foes, while the &quot;Tantrasara&quot; says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. &quot;Tantric sadhaka&quot;s are regarded to have transcended the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (&quot;Uchchhishta&quot;) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The &quot;Purashcharyarnava&quot; describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee&#x27;s queries by whispering in her ear.

Matangi is often worshipped with the mantra syllable &quot;Aim&quot;, which is associated with Saraswati and is the seed-syllable of knowledge, learning, and teaching. A longer mantra is also used:
&quot;Om Hrim Aim Shrim Namo Bhagvati Ucchishtachandali Shri Matangeswari Sarvajanavasankari Swaha&quot;
&quot;Reverence to adorable Matangi, the outcast and residue, who gives control over all creatures&quot;


Her mantra may be repeated ten thousand times, repeated one thousand times while offering flowers and ghee in a fire sacrifice, or repeated one hundred times while offering water (&quot;Arghya&quot;) or while offering food to Brahmin priests. Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the mantra. Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, riverbanks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the mantra is said to fulfill specific goals. An offering of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives the power to control; turmeric gives the power to paralyze; neem twigs bring wealth; and an offering of sandalwood, camphor, and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people. A rice-flour bread prepared while repeating her mantra is said to give the power to attract women. It is likewise said that it is possible to make a person one&#x27;s slave by feeding him or her the ashes of a crow whose stomach was stuffed with a conch and burnt in a cremation ground while repeating the goddess&#x27; mantra.

Leftover or partially eaten food (&quot;Uchchhishta&quot;) is recommended to be offered to Matangi with the devotee in the polluted &quot;Uchchhishta&quot; state, that is, having eaten but not washed, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands. An offering of leftovers to Hindu deities or being in the polluted &quot;Uchchhishta&quot; state is a taboo in mainstream Hinduism. Another taboo that is broken in Matangi worship is the offering to the goddess of a cloth stained with menstrual blood to gain the ability to attract a mate. Menstrual blood is considered polluted in almost all Hindu scriptures and menstruating women are kept away from Hindu worship and temples. The outcaste Matangi community of Nepal collect polluted substances and items related to death and bad luck such as sacrificial animal heads and clothes of the deceased, and offers them at special stones kept at crossroads called &quot;chwasa&quot;s, where the Matangi &quot;consumes&quot; them as an offering, thereby getting rid of the pollution. The &quot;Tantrasara&quot; also advises offerings to Matangi of meat, fish, cooked rice, milk and incense at crossroads or cremations grounds in the dead of the night to overpower enemies and gain poetic talent. Oblations of &quot;Uchchhishta&quot;, cat meat and goat meat to the goddess are said to help achieve Supreme knowledge. A text proclaims Matangi&#x27;s worship becomes fruitful only if the devotee reveres women as goddesses and refrains from criticizing them.

No fasts or rituals to purify oneself before worship—typical of Hindu worship—are prescribed for Matangi worship. Anyone can use any mantra for worship, even though he is not initiated or considered unfit for worshipping any other deity. A thousand-name hymn from the &quot;Nanayavarta-tantra&quot; and a hundred-name hymn from the &quot;Rudrayamala&quot; are dedicated to the goddess. The recitation of the Sanskrit alphabet, the chanting of mantras, the loud reading of the scriptures, and performance of music and dance are also described as constituting acts of her worship.
==Temples==

Matangi along with the other Mahavidyas finds place in the Kamakhya Temple complex, one of the many important Shaktipeeth for Tantra worship. While other Mahavidyas are worshipped in individual temples, Matangi and Kamala find place in the main Kamakhya shrine along with Kamakhya, in the form of a &#x27;yoni&#x27;.

Goddess Meenakshi of Madurai is also considered as none other than Raja Matangi. Here, She is seen as two-handed and standing, holding a parrot.

The Modh community of Gujarat worship Matangi as Modheshwari, patron deity of the Modh community. Here, Matangi is seen in a Durga-like form sitting over a lion.

Other than the above, Rajrappa Chhinnamasta shrine also has a temple dedicated to Matangi and the other Mahavidyas. There are several temples in South India where Matangi is venerated as Shyamala or Mantrini, the Prime minister of Goddess Lalita in Srikula tradition.

<doc id="286047" wikidata="Q4841418" url="?curid=286047" title="Bagalamukhi">
<text>Baglamukhi or Bagalā () is the female form of a personification of the mahavidyas (great wisdom/science), a group of ten Tantrik deities in Hinduism. Devi Bagalamukhi smashes the devotee&#x27;s misconceptions and delusions (or the devotee&#x27;s enemies) with her cudgel. The word &quot;Bagala&quot; is derived from the word &quot;Valga&quot; (meaning – bridle or to rein in) which, became &quot;Vagla&quot; and then &quot;Bagla&quot;. She has 108 different names (some others also call her by 1,108 names). Bagalamukhi is commonly known as Pitambari in North India, the goddess associated with yellow color or golden color. She sits on a golden throne that has pillars decorated with various jewels, and has three eyes, symbolising the fact that she can impart ultimate knowledge to the devotee. 

Bagalamukhi is one of the ten forms of the Devi, symbolising potent female, primeval force.

The main temples dedicated to Bagalamukhi or Bagala Devi temples are located at Shri Bagalamukhee Shakthi Peetham, Shivampet, Narsapur, Telangana State ,Bagalamukhi Temple, Datia Madhya Pradesh, Bugiladhar, Ghuttu Uttarakhand, Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam, Baglamukhi temple of Lalitpur, Nepal and of Banghandi, Kangra, Himachal Pradesh.

==Iconography==
Another interpretation translates her name as &quot;Kalyani&quot;. In Kubjika Tantra there is a reference to yet another interpretation of the meaning of the name ‘Bagala’. In the initial chapter of the text, there is a verse – ‘Bakare Baruni Devi Gakare Siddhida Smrita. Lakare Prithivi Chaiba Chaitanya Prakrirtita’ (‘Ba’, the first letter of the name – ‘Bagala’, means ‘Baruni’ or ‘She Who is filled with the intoxicating mood to vanquish the demon’. ‘Ga’, the second letter, means ‘She Who grants all kinds of divine powers or siddhis and successes to human beings’. ‘La’, the third letter, means ‘She Who is the foundation of all kinds of sustaining powers in the world like the earth and is Consciousness Herself’.

Two descriptions of the goddess are found in various texts: the &quot;Dwi-Bhuja&quot; (two-handed), and the &quot;Chaturbhuja&quot; (four-handed).
The Dwi-Bhuja depiction is the more common and is described as the &quot;Soumya&quot; or milder form. She holds a club in her right hand with which she beats a demon, while pulling his tongue out with her left hand. This image is sometimes interpreted as an exhibition of , the power to stun or paralyse an enemy into silence. This is one of the boons for which Bagalamukhi&#x27;s devotees worship her. Other Mahavidya goddesses are also said to represent similar powers useful for defeating enemies, to be invoked by their worshippers through various rituals.

Bagalamukhi is also called &quot;Pitambaradevi&quot;, &quot;Shatrubuddhivinashini&quot; and &quot;Brahmastra Roopini&quot; and she turns each thing into its opposite.

The &quot;Tantrasara&quot; describes her iconography: Bagalamukhi sits in a golden throne in the midst of an ocean in an altar. Her complexion is yellow (golden). Clad in yellow clothes, she is adorned by a garland of yellow flowers and decked with yellow (golden) ornaments. She pulls the tongue of a demon by her left hand, while raising the right hand to strike him with a club. Another description says that she has four arms and a third eye. A yellow crescent moon adorns her forehead.

Though generally depicted with a human head, the goddess is sometimes described to have a head of a crane and sometimes depicted riding a crane. Sometimes, she is described associated with other birds: having a duck-head or a nose of a parrot.

== Etymology and other epithets ==
Kinsley translates Bagalamukhi as &quot;she who has the face of a crane&quot;. Bagalamukhi is rarely depicted with a crane-head or with cranes. Kinsley believes that the crane&#x27;s behaviour of standing still to catch prey is reflective of the occult powers bestowed by the goddess.

Another interpretation suggests that &quot;Baglamukhi&quot; is a corruption of the word &quot;Valgamukhi&quot;; &quot;valga&quot; means &quot;bridle&quot; or &quot;bit&quot;. Like the bridle or bit – placed in the mouth – is used to direct a horse, Bagalamukhi gives the supernatural power of control over one&#x27;s foes. In this context, Bagalamukhi is she &quot;whose face has the power to control or conquer&quot;.

Another etymology suggests that &quot;valga&quot; means &quot;to paralyze&quot; and symbolizes the power of , &quot;paralysis&quot; that the goddess is said to grant; this theory seems questionable to Kinsley.

Bagalamukhi is known by the popular epithet Pitambara-devi or Pitambari, &quot;she who wears yellow clothes&quot;. The iconography and worship rituals repeatedly refer to the yellow colour.

==Legend==
In the Satya Yuga (the first epoch in Hindu cosmology), a great storm started destroying Creation. The god Vishnu was disturbed and performed austerities to appease the goddess Parvati on shore of Haridra Sarovar, the lake of turmeric. Pleased with Vishnu, the goddess appeared and brought forth her manifestation Bagalamukhi from the lake. Bagalamukhi calmed the storm, restoring order in the universe.

Another tale records that a demon named Madan acquired &quot;Vak-siddhi&quot;, by which whatever he said came true. He misused it to trouble humans and murder people. The gods beseeched Bagalamukhi. The goddess grabbed the demon&#x27;s tongue and immobilized his power. Madan requested the goddess that he be worshipped with her; the goddess granted him this boon, before slaying him.

== Symbolism and associations ==
Bagalamukhi is strongly associated with the yellow colour. She dresses in yellow clothes and ornaments. Various texts describe her affinity to the colour; yellow is an integral part of her worship rituals. Bagalamukhi is propitiated with yellow offerings by devotees dressed in yellow, seated on a yellow cloth. Yellow turmeric bead rosary are used in her &quot;japa&quot; (repetition) of her names or mantra (invocation). The colour yellow is linked to the Sun, gold, the earth, grain and fire, signifying auspiciousness, bountifulness and purity. The yellow turmeric is associated with marriage. This is why goddess Bagalamukhi is also known as Pitambhara devi.

Bagalamukhi is praised as the giver of supernatural powers (siddhis) or magical powers (s meaning good fortune, prosperity, wealth)

In ‘Bagalamukhistotratram’, a part of ‘Rudrayamala’ (a famous Tantra work), there are hymns in praise of the powers of Bagalamukhi – 

==Worship==

Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, one of the primary centers of Tantricism, consists of shrines for each of the Mahavidyas, one of which is dedicated to the Goddess Bagalamukhi, located a few hundred metres away.
Major temples to the goddess are situated in the Pathankot Mandi highway NH20 at Kotla and Bankhandi Himachal Pradesh in the north, and at village Badowan near Mahilapur district Hoshiarpur Punjab India and at Nalkheda at Agar Malwa district in Madhya Pradesh and Pitambara Peeth in Datia and DusMahavidhya Temple at Nikhildham Bhojpur -Bhopal Madhya Pradesh.

A lesser known temple of the goddess is situated in Somalapura (Kalyani) of Sindhanur taluk, Raichur district of North Karnataka. It is believed to be a powerful Bagulamukhi Sidhdha Shakta pitha. As per local legends, the temple was built by a great yogi after goddess&#x27; sakshaatkara fell in love with him. She promised to preside in the temple. As per another legend, the temple was built by great yogi Shri Chidanandavadhoota around 300 years ago. He composed &#x27;Shree Devi Charitre&#x27;, a popular text in Karnataka. Her prayers are said to pacify Brihaspati.

In Virupaskhi, a small village next to Mulabagilu of Kolar district Karnataka, another shrine dedicated to the goddess, as part of temple complex of Virupakshi temple. As per folklore, the Virupaskha linga was installed by great sage Atri Maharshi, father of Shriguru Dattatreya. The linga changes its color in 3 ways from sunrise to sunset. It is believed that King Vikramaditya built the Bagulamukhi temple at Virupakshi.

Whereas, the Maa Bagalamukhi Temple, Bankhandi, HP is a prominent place of worship of the goddess, thronged by huge crowds during Fridays and other festive seasons.

According to Hindu Puranas, Rama, guided by Hanuman, worshipped Mata Baglamukhi to secure victory over the demon king Ravana. The goddess granted Rama the Brahmastra, a celestial weapon of immense destructive power. This divine gift was instrumental in Rama’s success, symbolising the victory of good over evil and demonstrating the divine support that Maa Baglamukhi Temple in Bankhandi provides to her devotees.

Furthermore, it is said that the Maa Baglamukhi Temple, Bankhandi, HP was constructed during the Dwaparyug by the Pandavas during their period of &#x27;Agyatvas&#x27; (exile). According to legend, the Pandavas built the temple in a single night. Bhima and Arjuna worshipped Goddess Baglamukhi to seek her blessings and power.

It is believed that worshipping Maa Baglamukhi Temple in Bankhandi, Kangra district enhances one&#x27;s power and diminishes enemies capabilities, rendering them helpless. This aspect of the goddess’s power underscores her role as a protector and a formidable force against adversities.

A temple devoted to Bagalamukhi is also located in the Newar city of Patan near Kathmandu, Nepal, the country where worship of tantric goddesses had royal patronage. The territory of this temple in Patan has several other shrines dedicated to Ganesha, Shiva, Saraswati, Guheswar, Bhairava, etc.

<text>Chhinnamasta (, :&quot;She whose head is severed&quot;), often spelled Chinnamasta, and also called Chhinnamastika, Chhinnamasta Kali, Prachanda Chandika and Jogani Maa (in western states of India), is a Hindu goddess (Devi). She is one of the Mahavidyas, ten goddesses from the esoteric tradition of Tantra, and a ferocious aspect of Mahadevi, the Hindu Mother goddess. The self-decapitated nude goddess, usually standing or seated on a divine copulating couple, holding her own severed head in one hand and a scimitar in another. Three jets of blood spurt out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.

Chhinnamasta is a goddess of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She is considered both a symbol of sexual self-control and an embodiment of sexual energy, depending upon interpretation. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the kundalini – spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her self-sacrifice – sometimes coupled with a maternal element – sexual dominance, and self-destructive fury.

Chhinnamasta is worshipped in the Kalikula sect of Shaktism, the Goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism. Though Chhinnamasta enjoys patronage as one of the Mahavidyas, temples devoted to her (found mostly in Nepal and eastern India) and her public worship are rare. However, she is a significant Tantric deity, well known and worshipped among esoteric Tantric practitioners. Chhinnamasta is closely related to Chinnamunda – the severed-headed form of the Tibetan Buddhist goddess Vajrayogini.

== Origins ==

The Hindu Chhinnamasta appears as a significant deity in Tantric and Tibetan Buddhism, where she is called Chinnamunda (&quot;she with the severed head&quot;) or Trikaya-vajrayogini (&quot;triple-bodied Vajrayogini&quot;). Chinnamunda is the severed-head form of goddess Vajrayogini (or Vajravarahi, a ferocious form of Vajrayogini), who is depicted similar to Chhinnamasta.

Buddhist texts recount the birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of Krishnacharya&#x27;s disciples, two &quot;Mahasiddha&quot; (&quot;great perfected ones&quot;) sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also appeared in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the &quot;Mahasiddha&quot; princess Lakshminkara, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.

In the early decades of the 20th century, Benoytosh Bhattacharya – an expert on Tantra and the then director of the Oriental Institute of Baroda – studied various texts such as the Buddhist &quot;Sadhanamala&quot; (1156CE), the Hindu &quot;Chhinnamastakalpa&quot; (uncertain date), and the &quot;Tantrasara&quot; by Krishnananda Agamavagisha (late 16th century). He determined that the Hindu Chhinnamasta and the Buddhist Chinnamunda were the same goddess, in spite of the fact that the former wears a serpent as a sacred thread and has an added copulating couple in the icon. In the &quot;Sadhanamala&quot;, the goddess is called Sarvabuddha (&quot;all-awakened&quot;), and is attended by Vajravaironi and Vajravarnini; in the Hindu &quot;Tantrasara&quot;, she is called &quot;Sarvasiddhi&quot; (&quot;all-accomplished&quot;), and is accompanied by attendants Dakini, Vaironi, and Varnini. In the &quot;Chhinnamastakalpa&quot;, she is called Sarvabuddhi (&quot;all-enlightened&quot;); her attendants retain their Buddhist names. Bhattacharyya concluded that the Hindu Chhinnamasta originated from the Buddhist Chinnamunda, who was worshipped by at least the 7th century. 
While Bhattacharyya&#x27;s view is mostly undisputed, some scholars such as S. Shankaranarayanan – the author of &quot;The Ten Great Cosmic Powers&quot; – attribute Chhinnamasta to Vedic (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of &quot;The Indian Theogony&quot;, says that the Vedic goddess Nirrti&#x27;s functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses Kali, Chamunda, Karali, and Chhinnamasta. Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the &quot;upapurana&quot; &quot;Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana&quot; (c.950CE) and the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; (9th–12th century). ElisabethA. Benard, the author of &quot;Chinnamastā: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess&quot;, says that whatever her origins may be, it is clear that Chhinnamasta/Chinnamunda was known in the 9th century and worshipped by &quot;Mahasiddha&quot;s. Though essentially agreeing with Bhattacharyya&#x27;s view, Karel R. vanKooij, former Professor of South Asian art history at Leiden University, goes further and associates the iconography of Chhinnamasta with the Tantric goddesses Varahi and Chamunda.

David Kinsley, an expert on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are depicted nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless to focus on the display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.

Other nude Hindu goddesses who might have inspired Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess Kotavi and the South-Indian hunting goddess Korravai. Kotavi, sometimes described as a Matrika (&quot;mother goddess&quot;), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, often as a foe of the god Vishnu. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not. Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.

The beheading and rejoining motif also appears in the tale of the goddess Renuka; however the self-decapitation is missing in the legend. In the context of her legend, Renuka is given the epithet &quot;Chhinnamasta&quot; (&quot;She whose head is severed&quot;). The mahavidya Chhinnamasta is also associated with Renuka&#x27;s son Parashurama, who decapitated his mother in the legend.

The name &quot;Chhinnamasta&quot; is also used as a generic name for goddess icons which do not have heads, such as those at Chinnamasta Bhagawati, Na-kati Bhavani shrine in Aurangabad district, Bihar and the goddess shrine in Uchchaith, Madhubani district, Bihar; these goddesses are not identified with the mahavidya Chhinnamasta.

The theme of self-decapitation and the severed head is recurring in Indian mythology. Legends from the &quot;Simhasana Dvatrimsika&quot; and the &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; speak of how the hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess. Rajasthani folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (&quot;jhumjharji&quot; or &quot;bhomiya&quot;) who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on – without his head – slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies. The decapitated body and head motif is not unique to Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the Cephalophore saints of Christianity and in Celtic culture.

==Legends and textual references==

Chhinnamasta is often named as the fifth or sixth Mahavidya (Mahavidyas are a group of ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu esoteric tradition of Tantra), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of Devi, the Hindu Mother goddess. Kinsley says that three Mahavidyas – Kali, Tara, and Chhinnamasta – are prominent among Mahavidya depictions and lists, but that Chhinnamasta barely has an independent existence outside the group. The &quot;Guhyatiguhya-Tantra&quot; (c. 9th century) equates the god Vishnu&#x27;s ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas; the man-lion avatar Narasimha is described to have arisen from Chhinnamasta. A similar list in &quot;Mundamala Tantra&quot; (pre-16th century) equates Chhinnamasta with the avatar Parashurama.

Chhinnamasta appears in two distinct set of legends: the origin myths of Mahavidyas as a group and those explaining the genesis of Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess.

=== Mahavidyas as a group ===

A story from the &quot;Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Brihaddharma Purana&quot; (13th century) narrates the creation of all Mahavidyas, including Chhinnamasta. The story is as follows: Sati, the daughter of Daksha, is the first wife of the god Shiva. When she and Shiva are not invited to the fire sacrifice organized by her father, she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva&#x27;s protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the &quot;Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana&quot;, Chhinnamasta stands to the right of Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the &quot;Brihaddharma Purana&quot; describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.

In similar legends, the Mahavidyas arise from the wrath of other goddesses, specifically, Parvati (the second wife of Shiva and the reincarnation of Sati) and Kali (the principal Mahavidya). In one legend, Shiva and Parvati are living in the house of Parvati&#x27;s father. Shiva wants to leave, but Parvati creates the ten fierce Mahavidyas who appear from ten directions and prevent him from leaving. In another legend, Shiva is living with Kali, identified as Shiva&#x27;s consort in this context, but becomes tired of her and wants to leave. Kali creates the Mahavidyas who also obstruct his path from ten directions. Kali enlightens him and he ceases trying to leave.

The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; also mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of the goddess Shakambhari. An oral tradition similarly replaces Shakambhari with the goddess Durga.

=== Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess ===

The &quot;Pranatoshini Tantra&quot; (18th century) narrates two tales of Chhinnamasta&#x27;s birth. One legend, attributed to the &quot;Narada-pancharatra&quot;, tells how once, while bathing in Mandakini river, Parvati becomes sexually aroused, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.

The other version, from the &quot;Pranatoshini Tantra&quot; and attributed to &quot;Svatantra Tantra&quot;, is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort Chandika (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus, but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale is similar to the earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta&#x27;s birth is called &quot;Viraratri&quot;, and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha Bhairava. This version is retold in the &quot;Shaktisamgama Tantra&quot; (c. 16th century), in which Chhinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.

An oral legend tells how the goddess Prachanda Chandika appeared to aid the gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the &quot;amrita&quot; (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons&#x27; share of the elixir and then beheaded herself to prevent them from acquiring it.

The central themes of the mythology of Chhinnamasta are her self-sacrifice – with a maternal aspect (in the &quot;Pranatoshini&quot; &quot;Tantra&quot; versions) or for the welfare of the world (in the Samudra manthan oral version described above) – her sexual dominance (second &quot;Pranatoshini&quot; &quot;Tantra&quot; version), and her self-destructive fury (in the first oral legend).

==Iconography==

The iconography of Chhinnamasta is described in the &quot;Trishakti Tantra&quot; (pre-16th century), the &quot;Tantrasara&quot; (&quot;Prachandachandika&quot; section), the &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; (&quot;Chinnamastatantra&quot; section), and the &quot;Mantra-mahodadhih&quot; (1589CE).

Chhinnamasta is described as being as red as the hibiscus flower or as bright as a million suns. She is usually depicted as red or orange in complexion and sometimes as black. She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She is described as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart. Sometimes, she is partially or fully clothed.

The goddess carries her own severed head – sometimes on a platter or in a skull-bowl – in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified as that of the god Brahma.

Chhinnamasta may have a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and sometimes decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a &quot;mundamala&quot; (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake around her neck and serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.
Both of the attendants – Dakini to her left and Varnini to her right – are depicted nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the &quot;mundamala&quot;, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta&#x27;s severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.

With her right leg held straight and her left leg bent a little (the &quot;pratyalidha&quot; stance), Chhinnamasta stands in a fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama) – a symbol of sexual love/lust – and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (&quot;viparita-rati&quot; sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The &quot;Chhinnamasta Tantra&quot; describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva – the goddess&#x27;s consort – is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals drinking the blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.

Another form of the goddess in the &quot;Tantrasara&quot; describes her seated in her own navel, formless and invisible. This form is said to be realised only via a trance. Another aniconic representation of the goddess is her yantra (a mystical geometrical diagram used in Tantric rituals), which figures the inverted triangle and lotus found in her iconography.

The scholar van Kooij notes that the iconography of Chhinnamasta has the elements of heroism (&quot;vira rasa&quot;) and terror (&quot;bhayanaka rasa&quot;) as well as eroticism (&quot;sringara rasa&quot;) in terms of the copulating couple, with the main motifs being the offering of her own severed head, the spilling and drinking of blood, and the trampling of the couple.

Chhinnamasta&#x27;s popular iconography is similar to the yellow-coloured severed-headed Buddhist Chinnamunda, except for the copulating couple – which is exclusive to the former&#x27;s iconography – and Chhinnamasta&#x27;s red skin tone.

==Symbolism and associations==

=== Goddess of paradoxes ===
Chhinnamasta is a goddess of contradictions: she &quot;is both the food and the eater of food, thereby symbolizing the whole world by this act of being devoured and the devourer. The dichotomy of receiver and giver or object and subject collapses into one.&quot; Most of her epithets listed in her &quot;nama-stotra&quot; (name-hymn, which enlists the names of a deity) convey marvel and fury; few names are erotic or peaceful, which are contrary to Chhinnamasta&#x27;s fierce nature and appearance. Her &quot;sahasranama&quot; (thousand name-hymn) echoes paradoxes; she is Prachanda Chandika (&quot;the powerfully fierce one&quot;) as well as Sarvananda-pradayini (&quot;the prime giver of all ananda or bliss&quot;). Her names convey the idea that though she is fierce at first appearance, she can be gentle upon worship.

While other fierce Hindu goddesses like Kali depict severing the heads of demons and are associated with ritual self-decapitation, Chhinnamasta&#x27;s motif reverses the ritual head-offering, offering her own head to the devotees (attendants) in order to feed them. Thus, she symbolises the aspect of Devi as a giver, like Annapurna, the goddess of food, and Shakambhari, the goddess of vegetables, or a maternal aspect. The element of self-sacrifice is the symbol of &quot;divine reciprocation&quot; by the deity to her devotees. As a self-sacrificing mother, she symbolises the ideal woman; however, her sexuality and power are at odds with the archetype. She subdues and takes the life-force of the copulating divine couple, signifying the aspect of the life-taker, like Kali.

Chhinnamasta&#x27;s serpentine ornaments indicate asceticism while her youthful nude ornamented body has erotic overtones. Like all Hindu goddesses, she is decked in gold finery, symbol of wealth and fertility.

=== Destruction, transformation and recreation ===

The scholars Pratapaditya Pal, an expert on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of &quot;Hinduder Debdebi&quot; on the subject of Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood – drunk by her attendants – nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.

Chhinnamasta is &quot;a figure of radical transformation, a great yogini&quot;. She conveys the universal message that all life is sustained by other forms of life, and destruction and sacrifice are necessary for the continuity of creation. The goddess symbolises &quot;pralaya&quot; (cosmic dissolution), where she swallows all creation and makes way for new creation, thus conveying the idea of transformation. The Supreme Goddess is said to assume the form of Chhinnamasta for destruction of the universe. Chhinnamasta is considered a fearsome aspect of the Divine Mother. She is said to represent Transformation and complements Kali, who stands for Time. Her hundred-name hymn and thousand-name hymn describe her fierce nature and wrath. The names describe her as served by ghosts and as gulping blood. She is pleased by human blood, human flesh, and meat, and worshipped by body hair, flesh, and fierce mantras.

The seer Ganapati Muni associated the Mahavidyas with &quot;prakasha&quot; (&quot;Light&quot;) and &quot;nada&quot; (&quot;Sound&quot;) in stages of creation. Chhinnamasta is the violent interaction between the Light and the Sound enabling Creation. Chhinnamasta severing her own head is interpreted symbolic of the disconnecting of the Source and the manifest Creation, similar to cutting the umbilical cord between the mother and the new-born. Further, Chhinnamasta is associated with thunder and lightning, interacting light and sound forces. Her epithet, Vajra Vairochani (&quot;radiant like the vajra&quot;), is linked to the &quot;vajra&quot; (thunderbolt) and its divine master - Indra, the king of heaven and the god of rain, thunder and lightning.

The head offering and subsequent restoration of the head signify immortality. The dichotomy of temporality and immortality is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta&#x27;s head – interpreted as &quot;amrita&quot; and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and fear of Death. Chhinnamasta&#x27;s black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red or orange denotes life. By drinking the blood, she appears as the Saviour, who drinks the negativity of the world and transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than &quot;amrita&quot;.

Chhinnamasta signifies that life, death, and sex are interdependent. Her image conveys the eternal truth that &quot;life feeds on death, is nourished by death, necessitates death, and that the ultimate destiny of sex is to perpetuate more life, which in turn will decay and die in order to feed more life&quot;. While the lotus and the lovemaking couple symbolise life and the urge to create life, giving a life-force to the beheaded goddess, the blood flowing from the goddess conveys death and loss of the life-force, which flows into the mouths of her devotee yoginis, nourishing them.

=== Self-realization and awakening of kundalini ===
The head is celebrated as a mark of identity as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of &quot;maya&quot; (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to &quot;moksha&quot; (emancipation), &quot;jnana&quot; (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain a consciousness that transcends the bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks at herself, prompting the devotee to look within themself.

The Chhinnamasta icon is also understood as a representation of the awakening of the kundalini – spiritual energy. The copulating couple represent the awakening in the Muladhara chakra, which corresponds to the last bone in the spinal column. The kundalini flows through the central passage in the body – the Sushumna nadi and hits the topmost chakra, the Sahasrara at the top of head – with such force that it blows her head off. The blood spilling from the throat represents the upward-flowing kundalini, breaking all knots (&quot;granthis&quot;) – those things which make a person sad, ignorant and weak – of the chakras. The severed head is &quot;transcendent consciousness&quot;. The three blood streams represent the flow of nectar when the kundalini unites with Shiva, who resides in the Sahasrara. The serpent in her iconography is also a symbol of the kundalini.

Another interpretation associates Daknini, Varnini, and Chhinnamasta with the three main nadis – Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna, respectively – flowing free. The goddess is generally said to be visualised in one&#x27;s navel, the location of the Manipura chakra where the three nadis unite, and symbolises consciousness as well as the duality of creation and dissolution. Another tradition associates her with the Ajna chakra, the location of the &quot;third eye&quot; of wisdom between the eyebrows, the other meeting point of the three nadis.

The ability to remain alive despite the beheading is associated with supernatural powers and the awakening of the kundalini. The Earl of Ronaldshay (1925) compared Chhinnnamasta to India, beheaded by the British, &quot;but nevertheless preserving her vitality unimpaired by drinking her own blood&quot;.

=== Control over or embodiment of sexual desire ===

There are two contrasting interpretations of Chhinnamasta with regard to sexual desire. The image of Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kamadeva (literally, &quot;sexual desire&quot;) and Rati (&quot;sexual intercourse&quot;) is interpreted by some scholars as a symbol of a person&#x27;s &quot;control&quot; over sexual desire, while others interpret the goddess as being the &quot;embodiment&quot; of sexual energy.

Her names, such as &quot;Yogini&quot; and &quot;Madanatura&quot; (&quot;one who has control of Kama&quot;), convey her yogic control over sexual energy. Her triumphant stance trampling the love-deity couple denotes victory over desire and &quot;samsara&quot; (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth). Her subjugation of the amorous couple suggests that her worship will grant control over sexual urge and other impulses of the &quot;indriya&quot;s (&quot;senses&quot;), whose governing god Indra - she is associated with.

Images in which Chhinnamasta is depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion suggest that the couple is giving sexual energy to the goddess. Images where Shiva is depicted in coitus with Chhinnamasta are associated with this interpretation. Chhinnamasta&#x27;s names like &quot;Kameshwari&quot; (&quot;goddess of desire&quot;) and &quot;Ratiragavivriddhini&quot; (&quot;one who is engrossed in the realm of Rati – [copulation or sexual desire]&quot;) and the appearance of &quot;klim&quot; – the common seed syllable of Kamadeva and Krishna – in her mantra support this interpretation. Her lolling tongue also denotes sexual hunger.

The inverted triangle, found in Chhinnamasta&#x27;s iconography as well as in her yantra, signifies the &quot;yoni&quot; (womb) and the feminine. The goddess is often prescribed to be visualised in the centre of the inverted triangle in the navel. It also signifies the three &quot;guna&quot;s (qualities) and three &quot;shakti&quot;s (powers) –&quot;iccha&quot; (&quot;will-power&quot;), &quot;kriya&quot; (&quot;action&quot;), and &quot;jnana&quot; (&quot;wisdom&quot;). The goddess is called &quot;Yoni-mudra&quot; or &quot;Yoni-gamya&quot;, accessible through the yoni.

=== Other symbolism and associations ===
Chhinnamasta&#x27;s nudity and headlessness symbolise her integrity and &quot;heedlessness&quot;. Her names like &quot;Ranjaitri&quot; (&quot;victorious in war&quot;) celebrate her as the slayer of various demons and her prowess in battle. Her nakedness and free-flowing hair denote rejection of societal stereotypes and her rebellious freedom, as well as her sensual aspect.

The triad of the goddess and the two yoginis is also philosophically cognate to the triad of patterns, &quot;which creative energy is felt to adopt&quot;. Besides the nadis, Chhinnamasta, Varnini and Dakini also represent the &quot;guna&quot; trinity: &quot;sattva&quot; (purity), &quot;rajas&quot; (energy), and &quot;tamas&quot; (ignorance). While discussing Mahavidya as a group, Chhinnamasta is associated with &quot;rajas&quot; (in the &quot;Kamadhenu Tantra&quot; and the &quot;Maha-nirvana Tantra&quot;) or &quot;sattva&quot; (based on her lighter complexion).

While the goddess is a mature sixteen-year-old who has conquered her ego and awakened her kundalini, the attendants are described as spiritually immature twelve-year-olds who are sustained on the goddess&#x27;s blood and have not become liberated from the delusion of duality. In portrayals where the goddess&#x27;s hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have free-flowing hair like young girls, the goddess is treated as a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of controlled and uncontrolled nature, respectively.

Chhinnamasta&#x27;s association with the navel and her red complexion can be connected to the fire element and the sun, while the lotus in her iconography signifies purity.

==Worship==

Chhinnamasta&#x27;s individual cult is not widespread, but she is well known and important among &quot;Tantrika&quot;s (a type of Tantric practitioner) and is worshipped and depicted as part of the Mahavidya group in goddess temples. Temples and public worship of Chhinnamasta are rare, and her private worship by lay worshippers is probably uncommon.

Within the esoteric Tantric tradition, Chhinnamasta is a significant deity. She enjoys &quot;active worship&quot; in eastern India and Nepal; her temples are found in Nepal as well as in the Indian states of Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh. Benard remarks that she could not visit any Chhinnamasta temples in Bengal, however was &quot;assured&quot; that Chhinnamasta is a popular goddess in Bengal.

The goddess is venerated in the Kalikula (&quot;family of Kali&quot;) sect of Shaktism, the Goddess-centric sect of Hinduism. Her individual worship is mainly restricted to heroic &quot;Tantrika&quot;s, and those who worship her say only yogis and world renouncers have the ability to meditate on her, using her icon. The lack of worship of Chhinnamasta by lay worshippers is attributed by Kinsley to her ferocious nature and her reputation for being dangerous to approach and worship.

=== Goals of worship ===
Tantric practitioners worship Chhinnamasta for acquiring siddhis or supernatural powers. Chhinnamasta&#x27;s mantra (a sacred chant that is repeated by a devotee) &quot;Srim hrim klim aim Vajravairocaniye hum hum phat svaha&quot; is to be invoked to attract and subjugate women. Her mantra associates her with syllables denoting beauty, light, fire, spiritual self-realization, and destruction of delusion. The &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; and the &quot;Rudrayamala&quot; recommend the use of her mantra to obtain wealth and auspiciousness.

Another goal of Chhinnamasta&#x27;s worship is to cast spells and cause harm to someone. She is prescribed to be worshipped for subjugation or enchantment of men and women (&quot;vasikarana&quot;), annihilation of foes (&quot;uchchatana&quot;), someone&#x27;s death (&quot;marana&quot;) and causing hatred or hostilities between friends (&quot;vidveshana&quot;).

Acarya Ananda Jha, the author of the &quot;Chinnamasta Tattva&quot;, prescribes her worship by soldiers as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the &quot;Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana&quot;, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one&#x27;s foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).

=== Modes of worship ===

The Tantric texts &quot;Tantrasara&quot;, &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; and &quot;Mantra-mahodadhih&quot; give details about the worship of Chhinnamasta and other Mahavidyas, including her yantra, mantra and her &quot;dhyanas (&quot;meditative or iconographic forms). The &quot;Sri Chhinnamasta Nityarcana&quot; by Shri Swamiji (1979) details the rituals for the daily worship of Chhinnamasta.

In her puja, Chhinnamasta&#x27;s image or her yantra is worshipped, along with her attendants. The heterodox offerings of &quot;Panchamakara&quot; – wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and coitus – along with mainstream offerings such as flowers, light, incense, etc., are prescribed for her worship. A fire sacrifice and repetition of her &quot;stotra&quot; (hymn of praise) or her &quot;nama-stotra&quot; (name-hymn) are also prescribed in her worship. The &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; has her &quot;sahasranama&quot; (thousand name-hymn) as well as a compilation of her 108 names in a hymn.

Tantric texts tell the worshipper to imagine a red sun orb – signifying a yoni triangle – in his own navel. The popular form of Chhinnamasta is imagined to reside in the orb. The &quot;Tantrasara&quot; cautions a householder-man to invoke the goddess only in &quot;abstract terms&quot;. It further advises that, if woman invokes Chhinnamasta by her mantra, the woman will become a dakini and lose her husband and son, thereby becoming a perfect yogini. The &quot;Shaktisamgama Tantra&quot; prescribes her worship only by the left-handed path (Vamamarga). The &quot;Mantra-mahodadhih&quot; declares that such worship involves having sexual intercourse with a woman who is not one&#x27;s wife. The &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; tells the same, adding fire sacrifices, wine, and meat offerings at night. The best time to propitiate her is said to be the fourth quarter of the evening, that is, midnight.

Some hymns narrate that Chhinnamasta likes blood and thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines. The &quot;Shaktisamgama Tantra&quot; says that only brave souls (&quot;viras&quot;) should follow Vamamarga worship to the goddess. The &quot;Shakta Pramoda&quot; warns that improper worship brings severe consequences, with Chhinnamasta beheading the person and drinking his blood. Further, it explains the worship rituals to be followed by householders and those to be followed by renouncers. The &quot;Todala Tantra&quot; mentions that, as part of Chhinnamasta&#x27;s worship, Shiva or his fierce form, Bhairava, be worshipped as Kabandha (&quot;headless trunk&quot;) as the goddess&#x27;s consort. The worship of Kabandha, to the right of Chhinnamasta, is said to grant siddhis.

Chhinnamasta is typically worshipped at midnight along with the other Mahavidyas at Kali Puja, the festival of Kali. However, householders are cautioned not to worship her. The Bakhrabad area of Cuttack district and the 86 Palli pandal of Kolkata have unique traditions of worshipping Chhinnamasta, instead of Kali, on Kali Puja.

=== Temples ===

The Chintpurni (&quot;She who fulfills one&#x27;s wishes&quot;), temple of Chhinnamastika in Himachal Pradesh, is one of the Shakta pithas (considered the holiest goddess temples) and is where the goddess Sati&#x27;s forehead (&quot;mastaka&quot;) fell. Here, Chhinnamasta is interpreted as the severed-headed one as well as the foreheaded-one. The central icon is a &quot;pindi&quot;, an abstract form of Devi. While householders worship the goddess as a form of the goddess Durga, ascetic sadhus view her as the Tantric severed-headed goddess.

Another important shrine is the Chhinnamasta Temple near Rajrappa in Jharkhand, where a natural rock covered with an &quot;ashtadhatu&quot; (eight-metal alloy) &quot;kavacha&quot; (cover) is worshipped as the goddess. Though well-established as a centre of Chhinnamasta by the 18th century, the site is a popular place of worship among tribals since ancient times. Kheer and animal sacrifice are offered to the goddess.

A shrine dedicated to Chhinnamasta was built by a Tantric sadhu in the Durga Temple complex, Ramnagar, near Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, where tantrikas worship her using corpses. Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, has a shrine of the goddess that is open only three days a year, around Chaitra Navaratri. Her shrines are also situated in the Kamakhya Temple complex, Assam and Basukinath temple complex, Jharkhand along with other Mahavidyas. There is a Chhinnamasta temple at Bishnupur, West Bengal. The goddess Manikeswari, a popular goddess in Odisha, is often identified with Chhinnamasta.

Chhinnamasta&#x27;s shrines are also found in Nepal&#x27;s Kathmandu Valley. A shrine in the Changu Narayan Temple holds a 13th-century icon of Chhinnamasta. A chariot festival in the Nepali month of Baishakh is held in honour of the goddess. In the fields near the temple sits a small shrine to Chhinnamasta. A temple of the goddess in Patan built in 1732 contains her images in different postures and enjoys active worship.

<text>Bhairavi () is a Hindu goddess, described as one of the Mahāvidyas, the ten avatars of the mother goddess. She is the consort of Bhairava ( a form of Shiva).

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Bhairavi&quot; means &quot;terrifying&quot; or &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;.
==Iconography==
Her dhyana shloka in the Devi Mahatmya describes her form. She wears red garments and wears a garland of severed heads around her neck. She has three eyes and her head is adorned with a crescent moon.

Tripura Sundari and Tripura Bhairavi are closely associated but different.

==Legend==
Bhairavi is also a title for a female adept in Kundalini, Tantra. A yogini is a student of Tantra or an aspirant. A &quot;Bhairavi&quot; has succeeded in Tantra with the help of 64 yoginis. Yogini or Jogini are 64 in number. Yoginis, female supporting deities of Bhairavi. Bhairavi is the supreme leader of all 64 yoginis. Bhairav also has 52 supporting powers called &quot;52 Bhairav&quot;. Bhairavi is the consort of Bhairava according to the Puranas and Tantras. In Tantra Shastra all 64 yogini, 52 Bhairav and 56 Kalve work together.

Bhairavi is also called as Shubhankari, which means that she is the doer of auspicious deeds to her devotees who are her children, which means she is a good mother. She also favours violence, punishment and bloodshed to those who are irreligious and cruel, which also means that she is the mother of all violence to them. She is said to be seen as violent and terrible but is a benign mother to her children.

<doc id="286054" wikidata="Q849163" url="?curid=286054" title="DNS root zone">
<text>The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.

Before October 1, 2016, the root zone had been overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which delegates the management to a subsidiary acting as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Distribution services are provided by Verisign. Prior to this, ICANN performed management responsibility under oversight of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Oversight responsibility transitioned to the global stakeholder community represented within ICANN&#x27;s governance structures.

A combination of limits in the DNS definition and in certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a practical maximum of 13 root name server addresses that can be accommodated in DNS name query responses. However the root zone is serviced by several hundred servers at over 130 locations in many countries.

==Initialization of DNS service==
The DNS root zone is served by thirteen root server clusters which are authoritative for queries to the top-level domains of the Internet. Thus, every name resolution either starts with a query to a root server or uses information that was once obtained from a root server.

The root servers clusters have the official names &quot;a.root-servers.net&quot; to &quot;m.root-servers.net&quot;. To resolve these names into addresses, a DNS resolver must first find an authoritative server for the &quot;net&quot; zone. To avoid this circular dependency, the address of at least one root server must be known for bootstrapping access to the DNS. For this purpose, operating systems or DNS servers or resolver software packages typically include a file with all addresses of the DNS root servers. Even if the IP addresses of some root servers change, at least one is needed to retrieve the current list of all name servers. This address file is called &quot;named.cache&quot; in the BIND name server reference implementation. The current official version is distributed by ICANN&#x27;s InterNIC.

With the address of a single functioning root server, all other DNS information may be discovered recursively, and information about any domain name may be found.

==Redundancy and diversity==
The root DNS servers are essential to the function of the Internet, as most Internet services, such as the World Wide Web and email, are based on domain names. The DNS servers are potential points of failure for the entire Internet. For this reason, multiple root servers are distributed worldwide. The DNS packet size of 512 octets limits a DNS response to thirteen addresses, until protocol extensions (see Extension Mechanisms for DNS) lifted this restriction. While it is possible to fit more entries into a packet of this size when using label compression, thirteen was chosen as a reliable limit. Since the introduction of IPv6, the successor Internet Protocol to IPv4, previous practices are being modified and extra space is filled with IPv6 name servers.

The root name servers are hosted in multiple secure sites with high-bandwidth access to accommodate the traffic load. At first, all of these installations were located in the United States; however, the distribution has shifted and this is no longer the case. Usually each DNS server installation at a given site is a cluster of computers with load-balancing routers. A comprehensive list of servers, their locations, and properties is available at https://root-servers.org/. , there were 1708 root servers worldwide.

The modern trend is to use anycast addressing and routing to provide resilience and load balancing across a wide geographic area. For example, the &quot;j.root-servers.net&quot; server, maintained by Verisign, is represented by 104 () individual server systems located around the world, which can be queried using anycast addressing.

==Management==
The content of the Internet root zone file is coordinated by a subsidiary of ICANN which performs the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. Verisign generates and distributes the zone file to the various root server operators.

In 1997, when the Internet was transferred from U.S. government control to private hands, NTIA exercised stewardship over the root zone. A 1998 Commerce Department document stated the agency was &quot;committed to a transition that will allow the private sector to take leadership for DNS management&quot; by the year 2000, however, no steps to make the transition happen were taken. In March 2014, NTIA announced it would transition its stewardship to a &quot;global stakeholder community&quot;. 

According to Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, Lawrence E. Strickling, March 2014 was the right time to start a transition of the role to the global Internet community. The move came after pressure in the fallout of revelations that the United States and its allies had engaged in surveillance. The chairman of the board of ICANN denied the two were connected, however, and said the transition process had been ongoing for a long time. ICANN president Fadi Chehadé called the move historic and said that ICANN would move toward multi-stakeholder control. Various prominent figures in Internet history not affiliated with ICANN also applauded the move.

NTIA&#x27;s announcement did not immediately affect how ICANN performs its role. On March 11, 2016, NTIA announced that it had received a proposed plan to transition its stewardship role over the root zone, and would review it in the next 90 days.

The proposal was adopted, and ICANN&#x27;s renewed contract to perform the IANA function lapsed on September 30, 2016, resulting in the transition of oversight responsibility to the global stakeholder community represented within ICANN&#x27;s governance structures. As a component of the transition plan, it created a new subsidiary called Public Technical Identifiers (PTI) to perform the IANA functions which include managing the DNS root zone.

==Data protection of the root zone==
===Signing of the root zone===
Since July 2010, the root zone has been signed with a DNSSEC signature, providing a single trust anchor for the Domain Name System that can in turn be used to provide a trust anchor for other public key infrastructure (PKI). The root zone DNSKEY section is re-signed periodically with the root zone key signing key performed in a verifiable manner in front of witnesses in a key signing ceremony.
The KSK2017 with ID 20326 is valid as of 2020.

===ZONEMD record===
While the root zone file is signed with DNSSEC, some DNS records, such as NS records, are not covered by DNSSEC signatures. To address this weakness, a new DNS Resource Record, called ZONEMD, was introduced in RFC 8976. ZONEMD doesn&#x27;t replace DNSSEC. ZONEMD and DNSSEC must be used together to ensure the full protection of the DNS root zone file.

The ZONEMD deployment for the DNS root zone was completed on December 6, 2023.

===DNS over TLS===
The B-Root DNS servers offer experimental support for DNS over TLS (DoT) on port 853.

<text>Skittles is a historical lawn game and target sport of European origin, from which the modern sport of nine-pin bowling is descended. In regions of the United Kingdom and Ireland the game remains as a popular indoor pub game.

== Playing ==

Skittles is usually played indoors on a bowling alley, with one or more heavy balls, usually spherical but sometimes oblate, and several (most commonly nine) , or small bowling pins. The general object of the game is to use the ball(s) to knock over the skittles, either specific ones or all of them, depending upon game variant. Exact rules vary widely on a regional basis.

===Rules variations===
(Note: See Glossary below for explanation of named pins)

====Front pin first====
In this variant of the game, pins are counted only if the front pin is knocked over first. If the front pin is missed, any pins that are knocked over are not reset. In Devon Summer League, this rule is played frequently. In Bristol, this is the form of the game played and &quot;all in&quot; skittles tends to be looked down upon as involving less skill. In Worcestershire, this type of game is also known as King Pin.

====Nomination====
In this variant of the game, the player has to nominate the pin that will be hit first before the throw. Unless this pin is knocked over, the player will not score. The names given to the pins may vary from region to region; in Wiltshire they are usually referred to as &quot;front pin&quot;, &quot;front right quarter&quot;, &quot;front left quarter&quot;, &quot;outside right&quot; (or &quot;right winger&quot;), &quot;centre pin&quot;, &quot;outside left&quot; (or &quot;left winger&quot;), &quot;back right quarter&quot;, &quot;back left quarter&quot;, and &quot;back pin&quot;.

====Four-pins====
In this variant of the game, only four pins (the two coppers and the front and back pins) are put up and must be hit with the front pin first. It is often used in conjunction with nomination as well. It is currently used in North Somerset Cup games.

====London Bridge====
A variant of nomination but with only the landlord and two coppers set up, i.e. one has to hit a pin with each ball and nominate which one each time.

====Killer, Coffins, or German skittles====
A game for any number of people. Each starts with three lives. Each bowls only one ball at a time. The first bowls at a full frame and the skittles are not stuck up until all nine are hit down. Each time a player fails to hit at least one pin, they lose a life. The winner is the last one left with a life intact. Usually played for small amounts of money, the winner takes the combined player entry fees (typically £1 or 50p per game each). It is found in the Wiltshire, Somerset, and Bristol areas. Players might claim a &quot;tactical miss&quot; when they have multiple lives remaining and fail to hit the only pin still standing. This is to avoid giving the following player a full frame.

====Six-ball Westbury====
Another game for any number of people. Each player has one hand of six balls at a full frame. If all nine pins are knocked down within the hand, then they are reset, meaning that a player may score anywhere between 0 and 54. The winner is the player with the highest score. It is similar to killer in that it is usually played for money with the winner taking the pot.

====London Skittles====
London Skittles games are usually played over seven ends (legs). Competition matches are usually played over twenty-one ends. Games are played one-against-one, a chalk (a point) being scored by knocking all the pins over in fewer throws than one&#x27;s opponent. It is assumed that a player can get a single pin, so any standing pins each count as an extra throw. If the pins aren&#x27;t all down in four throws, five is scored. The order of play alternates - player A sets for player B then player B sets for player A and so on.

====Twenty ones====
This is played for money at the end of an evening of London Skittles. Players have one throw per turn and score the number of pins knocked down. The winner is the first player to reach exactly twenty one. If a player goes bust, their score goes back to twelve.

===Regional variations===
====Greater London====
Also known as Old English Skittles, the Greater London version uses nine pins (made of wood, traditionally hornbeam) and a thick circular disc known as a &#x27;cheese&#x27; (traditionally made of lignum vitae). The cheese is thrown at the pins using a swinging motion whilst stepping forwards. After an initial throw, the remaining pins (the &#x27;broken frame&#x27;) may end up in a variety of formations - many of which have a distinctive name, such as a London Bridge or the Novices. Knocking down all the pins at once is known as a &#x27;floorer&#x27; and is highly respected. The last time a player is known to have thrown three floorers in succession was in 1960.

While it was once a popular game played in pubs all over London (many sited by the Thames river), it is now only played at the Freemasons Arms in Hampstead. The origins of this skittles game are vague, but it is thought by some to have been started by Dutch sailors, possibly playing on the decks of moored barges.

A game of London skittles can be seen played in the film The Water Gipsies (film).

====Worcestershire====
=====Worcestershire Rules Variations=====
======The Alley, Pin diamond, Pins and Balls======
As with all variations of skittles the pins are laid out in a diamond and played on an alley, with the pins placed on painted squares known as plates. In the Worcestershire Leagues there is no set measurement for this, instead the size of the diamond should be &#x27;not less than and no greater than .

The pins and balls are known as the &#x27;Kit&#x27; and the balls should be made of wood, Tufnol or rubber and &#x27;must not exceed five and a quarter inches in diameter and no less than four and three quarter inches in diameter&#x27;. Despite guidelines for the diamond and balls there is no uniform size of pin needing only &#x27;to be uniform size and painted white, one and a half inches around the top.

The Alley itself should be &#x27;clean and well lit, with a bowling line approximately to the front pin of the diamond&#x27;. However this rule is not strictly enforced with some alleys being shorter than others. The Alley itself can be either Lino or Wood.

The front pin is known as the &#x27;King&#x27; and is painted with a white, one and a half inch wide vertical stripe. The two pins to either side are known as the &#x27;Quarter pins&#x27; and are marked with either a triangle or the numbers 1 and 2, in order to identify them. Traditionally the &#x27;King&#x27; is the heaviest pin, with the &#x27;Quarters&#x27; being heavier than the rest of the pins but not heavier than the &#x27;King&#x27;. Directly behind the &#x27;King&#x27; is the middle pin which is known as the &#x27;Birdie&#x27;, as the other pins form a &#x27;cage&#x27; around it. The back pin sits directly behind the &#x27;Birdie&#x27;, the &#x27;Back quarters&#x27; directly behind the &#x27;Quarter&#x27; pins, and the &#x27;Wingers&#x27; on the outside of the diamond. The &#x27;Birdie&#x27;, &#x27;Back Quarters&#x27;, &#x27;Back Pin&#x27; and &#x27;Wingers&#x27; are non-specific pins and are not marked so any of the six unmarked pins can be placed on any of the six plates.

Because of the lack of guidelines on pin size, the pins themselves vary in size. this leads to some &#x27;Kits&#x27; being higher scoring than others and some alleys being higher scoring than others, due to variations in length and diamond size

======Scoring pins======
All balls must touch the Alley before the &#x27;Line&#x27; to be deemed as legal. However the &#x27;Linesman&#x27; (a member of the opposing team who sits and watches the line) must call &#x27;Over&#x27; before the ball strikes a pin. If they fail to do this, the pins felled will count.
In Worcester skittles all pins are live until they land in the pit behind the diamond, or leave the alley on an open side. They can rebound off a side wall back into the diamond taking down other pin(s). In some alleys, such as the Saracens Head in Worcester, the Diamond is flanked by two side walls making the possibility of a spare, achieved by bouncing pins off the wall more of a possibility. It is more than common to hear the cries of &#x27;let it roll&#x27; go out in the alleys of the city to stop an over enthusiastic &#x27;sticker up&#x27; (a young person employed to put the pins back up after they have been knocked down) removing a pin from the alley before it has finished knocking down the others. However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.

======Spiders and Spares======
A Player scoring no pins after bowling three balls in the leg is known as scoring a &#x27;Spider&#x27;. A spider is recorded by drawing legs and a face onto the zero on the board and is greeted with delight when yayayayay the opposing team returns to the alley. A &#x27;Spare&#x27; where the pins are reset after being felled with balls to spare is denoted on the board by a circle drawn around the score. This is not greeted so favourably. The maximum score in a 9-pin frame is 27, however this is virtually unheard of, the highest spare in the history of the Worcester and District was thought to be a 24 scored by Gary Sandbrook whilst playing for the Independents Skittle team in the early 1990s, the highest spare in the friendly league was achieved by Scott Heywood with a full house score of 27 at the Alma tavern whilst playing for the Rushwick Cavalier on 18 September 2014. Fun fact:Spares are not uncommon however, and a good score in the Worcestershire in 49 plus.

=====Worcester and District Skittle League=====
The Worcester and District Skittle League, 12 players, playing 5 legs of 3 ball (winter league, men only, Tuesday nights) is the oldest skittle league running in the county, having been restarted post-war in 1946, and is a founder member of the Three cities Association. The Worcester and District is the county representative in the Three City Cup competition, played between Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire between September and May each season.

The rivalry between the District and the younger Friendly leagues (WFSL) in Worcester has always been great; however, in season 2004/05 it was decided by the District League that players signed on for a team registered for their competition were free to play for a team affiliated with the WFSL. Up to that point playing for a team in the WFSL while being signed on to a team affiliated with the Worcester and District would lead to a lifetime ban from the District League.

Until the end of season 2009/10 the scoring system was different for both leagues, with the Worcester and District League opting for the traditional 2 points for a win and 1 for a draw, and the WFSL opting for a system which awards 2 points for winning a leg and 10 points for the game, a total of twenty points. However at the start of season 2010/11 the same scoring system as the WFSL was adopted by the Worcester and District in order to increase the competitive nature of the League and hopefully stem the declining interest in the sport. In recent years, the popularity of Skittles has declined with the District League and WFSL both having to reduce the number of divisions from 5 down to 3.

=====District Cup Competitions=====
The District League compete for a number of cup competitions, with matches taking place on both Tuesday and Friday evenings. The premier cup competition being the Team Knock Out, but also the King Pin Cup (a variation in the rules applied so the front pin, or King pin as its known in Worcester has to be knocked over before scoring can commence) and the Mick Potter Memorial Trophy. There are also Singles (solo players) and Doubles (Teams of two) as well as a Six a side Trophy held each year.

=====The County Cup=====
The County Cup is played between the representative sides of the WFSL, Worcester and District, Worcester Ladies, Malvern Men&#x27;s League and the Malvern Ladies League. It is played on a Round Robin basis, with ten fixture dates (to include one bye), a play off, and a final. The Evesham League is not included, possibly due to too many rule variations (player v player format, mixed teams).

=====Worcester Friendly Skittle League (WFSL)=====
In the Worcester Friendly Skittle League (WFSL) of Worcestershire, both the men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; winter leagues are made up of 12 players. Men&#x27;s Matches are played on Monday and Wednesday Nights and Ladies on Thursdays.

=====Malvern Men&#x27;s Skittle league=====
Malvern Men&#x27;s Skittle League has been running for over 35 years within the Malvern area. This includes Great Malvern, Malvern Link, Madresfield, Barnards Green, Cradley, West Malvern, Hanley Swan, Colwall and Suckley.

League and Cup games are played on Thursday evenings, over a 42-week period beginning in September running through to the following June. With over 400 members from 31 teams who meet with their friends and teammates to play skittles; this makes Thursday night one of the busiest in the Malvern area&#x27;s pubs and clubs.

Each team consists of 9 players (although teams can sign as many players as they wish), league matches consist of 5 &#x27;legs&#x27; (each player bowling 3 balls), the winning team of each &#x27;leg&#x27; gaining one point. The team scoring most &#x27;pins&#x27; overall is also awarded 6 points. League matches are enhanced with team (Ken Baker Cup), 4 a side, doubles and singles cup competitions all played on Thursday evenings.

=====Evesham Skittles League=====
The league was formed in the early 1970s and is based around the Vale of Evesham and surrounding districts. It is played mostly in Public Houses, Working Men&#x27;s Clubs, British Legion Clubs, Social and Recreational Clubs within a radius of Evesham in Worcestershire. The league consisted of six divisions with a total of 72 teams competing These teams play from Monday to Thursday during the season, which stretches from early September through to late May. Teams included both men and women.

The Evesham League game has been structured upon the Long alley-Western type of game, whereby 9 pins are formed in the shape of a diamond facing the player The pins are normally placed upon a steel plate, which bear markings to identify placement of each pin The League allows pins to be made from either wood or high density polyurethane and the design is based upon the Gloucester pin Balls can be made from wood or composite material and are approximately in diameter. The League stipulates that the front pin facing the player should always be marked and is known as the &#x27;King&#x27; pin. The two pins next to the &#x27;King&#x27; pin are also marked and these are known as the &#x27;Quarter&#x27; pins All the alleys within the Evesham League are wood and are based upon general guidelines in terms of length and width.

Each Team consists of 10 Players, each player playing six legs consisting of 3 balls per leg. The game consists of 6 legs for each team, each player bowling once (3 balls) per leg. Points are awarded on the basis of each leg won, plus a further 6 points for an overall win, making a full six leg win 12 Points. Many years ago the League introduced a system of play, whereby each player bowls alternatively against a player of the opposing team for each leg. This proved to be a successful format creating tension and excitement down to the last leg - last man.

====Other counties in England====
The game is also very common in the southwest counties of Cornwall, Devon, and Dorset. In Dorset some games are played by bowling a technique known as the &#x27;Dorset flop&#x27;, it is mainly used by those without proper technique. This is where the bowler crouches on the alley and throws themselves and the ball forward landing on their stomach and letting the ball go between two bowling lines. In some parts of Somerset the ball has to hit a pitch plate (a diamond painted on the alley) in order for it to be a legal ball. It is also popular in South Wales.

====South Wales====
In the Cardiff and District skittles league the teams are made up of 12 players playing 5 legs of three balls. The league was founded in 1909 and is still very popular in the region with 10 men&#x27;s divisions. Other leagues within the Cardiff area are The Cardiff Combined clubs league with 9 men&#x27;s and 9 women&#x27;s divisions, Skittles Cardiff (a recent addition formed in 2010) and the Whitchurch and district skittles league

In the Newport and District skittle league (started ), Men-only teams are made up of 12 players playing in groups of four v four (three sections) each playing 3 legs of 3 balls, the league did have 7 men&#x27;s divisions of up to 15 teams but now down to 4 divisions, Premier, 1st, 2nd and 3rd (2016/17).

In the 2012/13 season, the scoring changed from 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw to 1 point for each leg and 2 points for the game. If the leg are drawn no points are awarded; however, if the game is drawn the a point is awarded to both sides.

There is a Ladies league that is played on a Tuesday.

They also play in the summer (started ) a mixed league. This has 3 divisions (2017), playing for 2 points a leg and 3 points for the game. There are cups to play for which are 8-a-side and also singles, pairs and fours. In 2016, Divisions 1, 2 &amp; 3 were won by Dean Street, Windsor A and The Nightingale respectively.

In the Conservative league (Men only), the scoring is slightly different, with 1 point for each leg and 2 points for the game. However, points are shared between both sides for a draw for the legs and the game.

====France====
The (&quot;nine-pin skittle game&quot;) of France, also known simply as or just , is a complicated variant with similarities to both British skittles and pétanque. It is popular only in the southwest of the country. It is an indoor game which is played on a hard-packed surface. The skittles are placed on a square court, each resting on a round piece of wood called or , apart from each other. A skittle measures about and weighs , and is made of beech wood. The bowl (ball) weighs about and has a diameter; it is made of walnut wood. There is also an eight-pin version, , and a version played with a mallet, , which is related to ground billiards and its variants such as croquet and paille-maille, and which has experienced a resurgence in Gascony since 1973.

====Ireland====
The Irish sport is a game played with five pins and three pieces of wood (skittles). Pins are numbered from 1 to 5, each representing a number of points. Throwers must toss the skittles towards the pins over a distance of approximately (this varies from county to county) in order to score points with the aim to scoring exactly 41. Points are recorded in descending order. If a player should score too many points (&quot;go bust&quot;, as in darts) they return to a score of 9 left, unless their previous score was above this in which case they return to that score.

The game is played frequently in pubs and Gaelic athletic clubs in various parts of the island with team leagues and cup matches.

====Germany, Central Europe and the United States====

The German sport kegel or nine-pin bowling is played in widely organized leagues through the country and is also popular in many other countries with long German connections, including Austria, Switzerland, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Liechtenstein and is currently gaining popularity in Australia. A variant was once also the dominant bowling game in the United States, but today only survives in a small area of rural Texas.

==Table skittles==

Table-top versions of the game also exist. These include:
* Hood skittles: a miniaturized version in which the pins are on a special table which is closed on three sides with a leather hood; a &#x27;cheese&#x27; is thrown at the pins underarm
* Devil among the tailors: another miniaturized version, in which a small ball is attached by a chain or string to a vertical pole, allowing it to be swung through the air in an arc to strike the pins. This game is seen in the British television period drama series Downton Abbey in episode 2.3. The game is seen being played in the library scene before dinner. A 10-pin version of this game was produced by Aurora Plastics and was sold in the United States under the name &quot;Skittle Bowl&quot; (©1969). The game is also seen in the Beatles film &quot;A Hard Days Night.&quot; Ringo leaves his pot of beer on the table of the game and when the ball comes around the glass is smashed. The owner then throws all of the Beatles out of the pub.

==Scattles and smite==
Scattles is a version of skittles in which all the pins are numbered. Players take turn in throwing the baton at the pins with a view to totalling exactly 50 points. If more than one pin is knocked over, the score received is that quantity of pins. But if only one pin is knocked over, the value on it is scored. If a player exceeds 50, their total reduces to 25. Pins are then placed upright where they stand, thus scattering. Scattles is made by Jaques of London and reminiscent of the older Cornish game, smite, itself based on the Finnish skittles game &quot;mölkky&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The phrase &quot;beer and skittles&quot; refers to indulgently spending one&#x27;s time at a pub, drinking and playing the game, and by extension any indulgent, irresponsible lifestyle choice.

A table-top version of the game is also featured in the first season of the Netflix series &quot;Easy&quot;, specifically episode seven. It also features in the episode &quot;Therapy&quot; (season 2, episode 8) of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;.

<text>Patrick Lalime (born July 7, 1974) is a Canadian ice hockey commentator and former professional ice hockey player who played twelve seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Ottawa Senators, St. Louis Blues, Chicago Blackhawks and Buffalo Sabres. Lalime retired from playing in 2011 to join the Réseau des sports (RDS) television network covering the Ottawa Senators, but has since left RDS to cover the Montreal Canadiens and the NHL for TVA Sports.

==Pre-NHL years==
As a youth, Lalime played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Drummondville Voltigeurs minor ice hockey team.

Lalime played his junior hockey with the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL. In 1992–93, Lalime posted a 10–24–4 record with a GAA of 4.67 and a .863 save percentage as the team failed to make the playoffs. In the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, Lalime was chosen by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the sixth round, the 156th overall pick. In 1993–94, he returned to the Cataractes and posted a 22–20–2 record with a GAA of 4.22. In the playoffs, Lalime struggled badly with a 1–3 record and GAA of 6.73.

In 1994–95, Lalime moved to the Hampton Roads Admirals of the ECHL where he posted a solid 15–7–3 record, a GAA of 3.35 and save percentage of .898 until January 1995. Then on January 26, Lalime signed a contract with the Penguins, who then assigned him to the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the IHL. He struggled with the Lumberjacks, with a 7–10–4 record and a 4.44 GAA and save percentage of .882.

In 1995–96, Lalime remained with the Lumberjacks, and helped lead the team to the playoffs with a 20–12–7 record, 3.86 GAA and save percentage of .893 in 41 games. He was recalled to the Penguins twice in December 1995 and served as a backup goalie for nine games, but never saw any action. He also served as a backup for the Penguins in the playoffs for four games and did not participate in Cleveland&#x27;s playoff run.

==NHL years==

===Early success===
Lalime went back to Cleveland for a third season in 1996–97 and remained with the Lumberjacks until early November. The Penguins then called him up and Lalime made his NHL debut on November 16 against the New York Rangers, as he replaced Ken Wregget midway through the game, allowing three goals on 14 shots in an 8–3 loss. Lalime&#x27;s next appearance was on December 6, replacing Wregget after the first period down 2–0, but Lalime made 16 saves and the Penguins rebounded for a 5–3 win, giving him his first career victory. Lalime was given the start the next night against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and he responded with 30 saves in a 5–3 victory. Lalime would go on to set an NHL record with the longest unbeaten streak to begin a career (16 games with a 14–0–2 record) before suffering his first defeat on January 23, a 4–3 OT loss to the Colorado Avalanche. During the streak, Lalime recorded his first shutout, a 4–0 win over the San Jose Sharks on December 13, and had a 49 save performance against the Calgary Flames on January 21, a 4–2 Penguins victory. After the streak ended, Lalime cooled off for the rest of the season and finished off with a 21–12–2 record, 2.94 GAA and a save percentage of .913. With Cleveland, Lalime was 6–6–2 with a 3.24 GAA. He dressed as the backup to Ken Wregget during the Penguins five playoff games that year. For his efforts, he was named to the NHL&#x27;s All-Rookie Team.

In 1997–98, Lalime and the Penguins could not agree on a contract, and he spent the season with the Grand Rapids Griffins of the IHL, appearing in 31 games and posting a 10–10–9 record with a team leading GAA of 2.61 and .918 save percentage. On March 24, 1998, the Penguins traded his rights to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for Sean Pronger, but Lalime stayed with the Griffins, and played in one playoff game, allowing four goals in an overtime loss.

In 1998–99, he failed to make the Mighty Ducks team during the pre-season, and the club assigned him to the Kansas City Blades of the IHL. Lalime rewrote the team&#x27;s record book with a 39–20–4 record, a 3.01 GAA and a save percentage of .900. He was named IHL goaltender of the month for March and earned a first team all-star selection after leading the league in wins, minutes played (3789) and saves (1708). In the playoffs, Lalime went 1–2 with a 2.08 GAA as Kansas City lost to the Long Beach Ice Dogs in the first round.

===Senators===
The Mighty Ducks traded Lalime to the Ottawa Senators for Ted Donato and Antti-Jussi Niemi on June 18, and he opened the 1999–2000 season as a Senator as he and Ron Tugnutt would split duties. Lalime began his Senators career with a 3–0 shutout victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on October 2. He would go on and have a solid season with a 19–14–3 record, a GAA of 2.33 and save percentage of .905. The Senators would trade Tugnutt to Pittsburgh in March for Tom Barrasso, and Lalime would serve as his backup for the remainder of the season. Lalime dressed for six playoff games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, but did not see any action as the Senators were put out in the first round.

The Senators gave Lalime the starting job in 2000–01, and he responded with a 36–19–5 record, 2.35 GAA, and a save percentage of .914 and helped the Senators to winning the Northeast Division, despite missing ten games with a sprained left MCL in mid-October. He was named NHL Player of the Week twice (November 27 – December 3 and February 12–18). In the playoffs, the Senators would meet the Maple Leafs for the second consecutive season, and Lalime played very well, with a GAA of 2.39, however the Senators struggled to score goals and were eliminated in four games.

In 2001–02 Lalime had a 27–24–8 record, 2.48 GAA and .903 save percentage. He was second in the league with seven shutouts and set a club record with a 149:41 shutout streak from October 23 to November 10. In the playoffs, the Senators faced off with the Philadelphia Flyers and were heavy underdogs, however, Lalime was unbeatable, as he allowed only two goals as Ottawa defeated the Flyers in five games. His GAA for the series was 0.40, and he had a .985 save percentage. In the second round, the Senators met up with the Maple Leafs for the third straight year, and with a 5–0 game one win, Lalime tied an NHL playoff record with four shutouts. However the Maple Leafs stormed back and eventually won the series in seven games. Lalime finished the 2002 playoffs with a 7–5 record and a 1.39 GAA.

In 2002–03, the Senators won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy for having the best regular season record, and Lalime led the way with a 39–20–7 record, 2.16 GAA and .911 save percentage. He was second in the NHL in wins, shutouts (8), fourth in minutes (3943) and fifth in GAA. He appeared in his first all-star game on February 2 after Ed Belfour pulled out with an injury. He made 18 saves on 19 shots in 25 minutes, then he allowed three goals during the shootout and took the loss. He broke his own record for shutout streak with 184:06 from January 9 to 18. In the playoffs, he helped the Senators defeat the New York Islanders in five games, then the Philadelphia Flyers in six games, before losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in seven games in the Eastern Conference Final. Lalime had an 11–7 record and GAA of 1.82 during the playoffs.

In 2003–04, Lalime finished with a 25–23–7 record with a 2.29 GAA and save percentage of .905. In the opening round of the playoffs, the Senators would meet their Battle of Ontario opponents, the Maple Leafs for the fourth time in five years. Lalime struggled during the series, allowing the opening goal in every game, and despite the Senators heavily outshooting the Maple Leafs, the series was tied after six games. In game seven, Lalime allowed two soft goals to Joe Nieuwendyk, and after the first period he was pulled out of the game with the Senators losing 3–0. They would eventually lose 4–1 and lost to the Maple Leafs for the fourth time in the playoffs. It marked the end of Lalime&#x27;s playing time in Ottawa.

===Post-Ottawa years===
After acquiring star goaltender Dominik Hašek via free agency, the Senators decided to trade Lalime to the St. Louis Blues for a fourth round conditional pick in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft on June 27, 2004. Lalime was set to be the Blues starter during the 2004–05 season, however the lockout wiped out the season, and Lalime did not play any hockey that year.

During the 2005–06 season, he earned his first win with the Blues on October 11 against the Chicago Blackhawks, making 32 saves in a 4–1 victory. However, this was a season to forget for Lalime, as he finished the year with a 4–18–8 record, 3.64 GAA and a .881 save percentage. He also spent a part of the season in the AHL, where he posted a record of 6–6–1, 2.86 GAA and .903 save percentage with the Peoria Rivermen. On April 2, Lalime played his final game as a Blue, as he suffered a torn ACL that had him out for the remainder of the season.

On July 1, 2006, Lalime was signed by the Chicago Blackhawks to a one-year, $700,000 contract, likely to be the backup to Nikolai Khabibulin. He ended up being injured just before training camp with a herniated disk. In his debut as a Blackhawk on February 7, 2007, Lalime stopped 34 shots and shut out the Vancouver Canucks as Chicago won the game 3–0. He went 4–6–1 in 12 games during the regular season with a 3.07 goals against average and a .896 save percentage. His play with the Blackhawks was good enough for the club to re-sign him to another one-year contract, this one worth $950,000.

On July 1, 2008, Lalime was signed by the Buffalo Sabres to a two-year, $2 million contract to play backup to Ryan Miller. In his first season with the Sabres, Lalime recorded a 5-13-3 record with a 3.10 goals against average.

On July 20, 2011, Lalime retired from the NHL and became an analyst on Ottawa Senators television broadcasts on RDS. Lalime worked 15 Senators games on the French-language network during the 2011-12 season as well as contributing to other hockey shows. He quit RDS in 2014 to become the primary NHL analyst for TVA Sports.

==Records==

* On May 2, 2002, Lalime became the fourteenth goaltender in NHL history to record four shutouts in one postseason, with a 27-save, 5–0 victory, in Toronto over the Maple Leafs. The win gave Lalime&#x27;s Senators a 1–0 lead in their Eastern Conference Semifinal series.
* Owns the Senators record for wins in a season (39 in 2002–03), along with career playoff wins (21).
* Longest unbeaten streak to start an NHL career: 16 games (14 wins, 2 ties)

==Awards==
* Nominated for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy (2008)

==Mask creativity==
Lalime is known for his distinguishing goalie mask theme - the use of cartoon eyes. His first mask in Pittsburgh featured a penguin with its eyes peeking through the ice. When he played for the Ottawa Senators, Lalime&#x27;s mask featured the Warner Brothers cartoon character Marvin the Martian. The use of the character was inspired by the similarity of Marvin&#x27;s costume to the Senators team logo. However, after a terrible St. Louis start (and getting sent to the minors), Lalime came back to the lineup with a completely different goalie mask which still featured the Marvin the Martian theme. This trend continued in Chicago, where Lalime had the same theme going with his Blackhawks helmet, though during that time, Marvin featured an Indian headdress. In 2010, Lalime signed a deal with the Buffalo Sabres and wore a mask featuring Marvin with the horns of a buffalo.

<text>Pervaporation (or pervaporative separation) is a processing method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporization through a non-porous or porous membrane.

==Theory==
The term &quot;pervaporation&quot; is a portmanteau of the two steps of the process: (a) permeation through the membrane by the permeate, then (b) its evaporation into the vapor phase. This process is used by a number of industries for several different processes, including purification and analysis, due to its simplicity and nature.

The membrane acts as a selective barrier between the two phases: the liquid-phase feed and the vapor-phase permeate. It allows the desired components of the liquid feed to transfer through it by vaporization. Separation of components is based on a difference in transport rate of individual components through the membrane.

Typically, the upstream side of the membrane is at ambient pressure and the downstream side is under vacuum to allow the evaporation of the selective component after permeation through the membrane. Driving force for the separation is the difference in the partial pressures of the components on the two sides and not the volatility difference of the components in the feed.

The driving force for transport of different components is provided by a chemical potential difference between the liquid feed/retentate and vapor permeate at each side of the membrane. The retentate is the remainder of the feed leaving the membrane feed chamber, which is not permeated through the membrane. 
The chemical potential can be expressed in terms of fugacity, given by Raoult&#x27;s law for a liquid and by Dalton&#x27;s law for (an ideal) gas. During operation, due to removal of the vapor-phase permeate, the actual fugacity of the vapor is lower than anticipated on basis of the collected (condensed) permeate.
Separation of components (&quot;e.g.&quot; water and ethanol) is based on a difference in transport rate of individual components through the membrane. This transport mechanism can be described using the solution-diffusion model, based on the rate/degree of dissolution of a component into the membrane and its velocity of transport (expressed in terms of diffusivity) through the membrane, which will be different for each component and membrane type leading to separation.

==Applications==
Pervaporation is effective for dilute solutions containing trace or minor amounts of the component to be removed. Based on this, hydrophilic membranes are used for dehydration of alcohols containing small amounts of water and hydrophobic membranes are used for removal/recovery of trace amounts of organics from aqueous solutions.

Pervaporation is an efficient energy conserving alternative to processes such as distillation and evaporation. It allows the exchange of two phases without direct contact.

Examples include solvent dehydration: dehydrating the ethanol/water and isopropanol/water azeotropes, continuous ethanol removal from yeast fermentors, continuous water removal from condensation reactions such as esterifications to enhance conversion and rate of the reaction, membrane introduction mass spectrometry, removing organic solvents from industrial waste waters, combination of distillation and pervaporation/vapour permeation, and concentration of hydrophobic flavour compounds in aqueous solutions (using hydrophobic membranes).

Recently, a number of organophilic pervaporation membranes have been introduced to the market. Organophilic pervaporation membranes can be used for the separation of organic-organic mixtures, e.g.: reduction of the aromatics content in refinery streams, breaking of azeotropes, purification of extraction media, purification of product stream after extraction, and purification of organic solvents.

==Materials==
Hydrophobic membranes are often polydimethylsiloxane based where the actual separation mechanism is based on the solution-diffusion model described above.

Hydrophilic membranes are more widely available. The commercially most successful pervaporation membrane system to date is based on polyvinyl alcohol. More recently also membranes based on polyimide have become available. To overcome the intrinsic disadvantages of polymeric membrane systems ceramic membranes have been developed over the last decade. These ceramic membranes consist of nanoporous layers on top of a macroporous support. The pores must be large enough to let water molecules pass through and retain any other solvents that have a larger molecular size such as ethanol. As a result, a molecular sieve with a pore size of about 4 Å is obtained. The most widely available member of this class of membranes is that based on zeolite A.

Alternatively to these crystalline materials, the porous structure of amorphous silica layers can be tailored towards molecular selectivity. These membranes are fabricated by sol-gel chemical processes. Research into novel hydrophilic ceramic membranes has been focused on titania or zirconia. Very recently a break-through in hydrothermal stability has been achieved through the development of an organic-inorganic hybrid material.
