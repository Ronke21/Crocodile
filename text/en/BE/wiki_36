<text>Swan Lake ( ), Op. 20, is a ballet composed by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1875–76. Despite its initial failure, it is now one of the most popular ballets of all time.

The scenario, initially in two acts, was fashioned from Russian and German folk tales and tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer&#x27;s curse. The choreographer of the original production was Julius Reisinger (Václav Reisinger). The ballet was premiered by the Bolshoi Ballet on at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Although it is presented in many different versions, most ballet companies base their stagings both choreographically and musically on the 1895 revival of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, first staged for the Imperial Ballet on 15 January 1895, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. For this revival, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score was revised by the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre&#x27;s chief conductor and composer Riccardo Drigo.

== History ==
=== Origins of the ballet ===
There is no evidence to prove who wrote the original libretto, or where the idea for the plot came from. Russian and German folk tales have been proposed as possible sources, including &quot;The Stolen Veil&quot; by Johann Karl August Musäus, but these tales differ significantly from the ballet.

One theory is that the original choreographer, Julius Reisinger, who was a Bohemian (and therefore likely to be familiar with &quot;The Stolen Veil&quot;), created the story. Another theory is that it was written by Vladimir Petrovich Begichev, director of the Moscow Imperial Theatres at the time, possibly with Vasily Geltser, danseur of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre. A surviving copy of the libretto bears his name. Since the first published libretto does not correspond with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music in many places, one theory is that the first published version was written by a journalist after viewing initial rehearsals (new opera and ballet productions were always reported in the newspapers, along with their respective scenarios).

Some contemporaries of Tchaikovsky recalled the composer taking great interest in the life story of Bavarian King Ludwig II, whose life had supposedly been marked by the sign of Swan and could have been the prototype of the dreamer Prince Siegfried.

Begichev commissioned the score of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; from Tchaikovsky in May 1875 for 800 rubles. Tchaikovsky worked with only a basic outline from Julius Reisinger of the requirements for each dance. Unlike the instructions for the scores of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, none of the original written instruction was thought to have survived. Most of what scholars knew about information such as choreography came from gossip and reviews of the performance. However, rehearsal notes dating as early as 1876 have been recently discovered in the Institute for Art Studies in Moscow, revealing more information about what the original 1877 production may have looked like.

=== Tchaikovsky&#x27;s influences ===
From around the time of the turn of the 19th century until the beginning of the 1890s, scores for ballets were almost always written by composers known as &quot;specialists&quot; who were highly skilled at scoring the light, decorative, melodious, and rhythmically clear music that was at that time in vogue for ballet. Tchaikovsky studied the music of &quot;specialists&quot; such as the Italian Cesare Pugni and the Austrian Ludwig Minkus, before setting to work on &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.

Tchaikovsky had a rather negative opinion of the &quot;specialist&quot; ballet music until he studied it in detail, being impressed by the nearly limitless variety of infectious melodies their scores contained. Tchaikovsky most admired the ballet music of such composers as Léo Delibes, Adolphe Adam, and later, Riccardo Drigo. He would later write to his protégé, the composer Sergei Taneyev, &quot;I listened to the Delibes ballet &quot;Sylvia&quot; ... what charm, what elegance, what wealth of melody, rhythm, and harmony. I was ashamed, for if I had known of this music then, I would not have written &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.&quot; Tchaikovsky most admired Adam&#x27;s 1844 score for &quot;Giselle&quot;, which used the &quot;Leitmotif&quot; technique: associating certain themes with certain characters or moods, a technique he would use in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and, later, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

Tchaikovsky drew on previous compositions for his &quot;Swan Lake&quot; score. According to two of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s relatives – his nephew Yuri Lvovich Davydov and his niece Anna Meck-Davydova – the composer had earlier created a little ballet called &quot;The Lake of the Swans&quot; at their home in 1871. This ballet included the famous &quot;Leitmotif&quot;, the &quot;Swan&#x27;s Theme&quot; or &quot;Song of the Swans&quot;. He also made use of material from &quot;The Voyevoda&quot;, an opera he had abandoned in 1868. Another number which included a theme from &quot;The Voyevoda&quot; was the &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; of the fourth scene and the opening of the Finale (Act IV, No. 29). The &quot;Grand adage&quot; (a.k.a. the &quot;Love Duet&quot;) from the second scene of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was fashioned from the final love duet from his opera &quot;Undina&quot;, abandoned in 1873.

By April 1876 the score was complete, and rehearsals began. Soon Reisinger began setting certain numbers aside that he dubbed &quot;undanceable&quot;. Reisinger even began choreographing dances to other composers&#x27; music, but Tchaikovsky protested and his pieces were reinstated. Although the two artists were required to collaborate, each seemed to prefer working as independently of the other as possible. At times, Tchaikovsky actually ended up turning to Alina Bryullova, a family acquaintance, for advice on how he should write music for ballet; she later recalled that due to her lack of expertise she &quot;could give him practically no advice.&quot;

=== Composition process ===
Tchaikovsky&#x27;s excitement with &quot;Swan Lake&quot; is evident from the speed with which he composed: commissioned in the spring of 1875, the piece was created within one year. His letters to Sergei Taneyev from August 1875 indicate, however, that it was not only his excitement that compelled him to create it so quickly but his wish to finish it as soon as possible, so as to allow him to start on an opera. Respectively, he created scores of the first three numbers of the ballet, then the orchestration in the fall and winter, and was still struggling with the instrumentation in the spring. By April 1876, the work was complete. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s mention of a draft suggests the presence of some sort of abstract but no such draft has ever been seen. Tchaikovsky wrote various letters to friends expressing his longstanding desire to work with this type of music, and his excitement concerning his current stimulating, albeit laborious task.

Original interpreters
==== Original production of 1877 ====
The première on 4 March 1877 was given as a benefit performance for the ballerina Pelageya Karpakova (also known as Polina Karpakova), who performed the role of Odette, with &quot;première danseur&quot; Victor Gillert as Prince Siegfried. Karpakova may also have danced the part Odile, although it is believed the ballet originally called for two different dancers. It is now common practice for the same ballerina to dance both Odette and Odile.

The Russian ballerina Anna Sobeshchanskaya was originally cast as Odette, but was replaced when a governing official in Moscow complained about her.

The première was not well received. Though there were a few critics who recognised the virtues of the score, most considered it to be far too complicated for ballet. It was labelled &quot;too noisy, too &#x27;Wagnerian&#x27; and too symphonic.&quot; The critics also thought Reisinger&#x27;s choreography was &quot;unimaginative and altogether unmemorable.&quot; The German origins of the story were &quot;treated with suspicion while the tale itself was regarded as &#x27;stupid&#x27; with unpronounceable surnames for its characters.&quot; Karpakova was a secondary soloist and &quot;not particularly convincing.&quot;
 Yet the fact remains (and is too often omitted in accounts of this initial production) that this staging survived for six years with a total of 41 performances – many more than several other ballets from the repertoire of this theatre.

==== Tchaikovsky pas de deux 1877 ====

On 26 April 1877, Anna Sobeshchanskaya made her début as Odette/Odile in &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and from the start, she was completely dissatisfied with the ballet. Sobeshchanskaya asked Marius Petipa—&quot;Premier Maître de Ballet&quot; of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres—to choreograph a &quot;pas de deux&quot; to replace the &quot;pas de six&quot; in the third act (for a ballerina to request a supplemental &quot;pas&quot; or variation was standard practice in 19th-century ballet, and often these &quot;custom-made&quot; dances were the legal property of the ballerina they were composed for).

Petipa created the &quot;pas de deux&quot; to music by Ludwig Minkus, ballet composer to the St Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The piece was a standard &quot;pas de deux classique&quot; consisting of a short &quot;entrée&quot;, the &quot;grand adage&quot;, a variation for each dancer individually, and a &quot;coda&quot;.

Tchaikovsky was angered by this change, stating that whether the ballet was good or bad, he alone should be held responsible for its music. He agreed to compose a new &quot;pas de deux&quot;, but soon a problem arose: Sobeshchanskaya wanted to retain Petipa&#x27;s choreography. Tchaikovsky agreed to compose a &quot;pas de deux&quot; that would match to such a degree, the ballerina would not even be required to rehearse. Sobeshchanskaya was so pleased with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s new music, she requested he compose an additional variation, which he did.

Until 1953 this &quot;pas de deux&quot; was thought to be lost, until a repétiteur score was accidentally found in the archives of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre, among orchestral parts for Alexander Gorsky&#x27;s revival of &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; (Gorsky had included the piece in his version of &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; staged in 1912). In 1960 George Balanchine choreographed a &quot;pas de deux&quot; to this music for Violette Verdy and Conrad Ludlow, performed at the City Center of Music and Drama in New York City as &quot;Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux&quot;, as it is still known and performed today.

==== Subsequent productions 1879–1894 ====
Julius Reisinger&#x27;s successor as balletmaster was Joseph Peter Hansen. Hansen made considerable efforts to salvage &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and on 13 January 1880 he presented a new production of the ballet for his own benefit performance. The part of Odette/Odile was danced by Evdokia Kalmykova, a student of the Moscow Imperial Ballet School, with Alfred Bekefi as Prince Siegfried. This production was better received than the original, but by no means a great success. Hansen presented another version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; on 28 October 1882, again with Kalmykova as Odette/Odile. For this production Hansen arranged a &quot;Grand Pas&quot; for the ballroom scene which he titled &quot;La Cosmopolitana&quot;. This was taken from the European section of the &quot;Grand Pas d&#x27;action&quot; known as &quot;The Allegory of the Continents&quot; from Marius Petipa&#x27;s 1875 ballet &quot;The Bandits&quot; to the music of Ludwig Minkus. Hansen&#x27;s version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was given only four times, the final performance being on 2 January 1883, and soon the ballet was dropped from the repertory altogether.

In all, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was performed 41 times between its première and the final performance of 1883 – a rather lengthy run for a ballet that was so poorly received upon its première. Hansen became Balletmaster to the Alhambra Theatre in London and on 1 December 1884 he presented a one-act ballet titled &quot;The Swans&quot;, which was inspired by the second scene of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. The music was composed by the Alhambra Theatre&#x27;s &quot;chef d&#x27;orchestre&quot; Georges Jacoby.

The second scene of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was then presented on 21 February in Prague by the Ballet of the National Theatre in a version mounted by the Balletmaster August Berger. The ballet was given during two concerts which were conducted by Tchaikovsky. The composer noted in his diary that he experienced &quot;a moment of absolute happiness&quot; when the ballet was performed. Berger&#x27;s production followed the 1877 libretto, though the names of Prince Siegfried and Benno were changed to Jaroslav and Zdeňek, with the rôle of Benno danced by a female dancer &quot;en travestie&quot;. The rôle of Prince Siegfried was danced by Berger himself with the ballerina Giulietta Paltriniera-Bergrova as Odette. Berger&#x27;s production was only given eight performances and was even planned for production at the Fantasia Garden in Moscow in 1893, but it never materialised.

==== Petipa–Ivanov–Drigo revival of 1895 ====

During the late 1880s and early 1890s, Petipa and Vsevolozhsky discussed with Tchaikovsky the possibility of reviving &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. However, Tchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893, just when plans to revive &quot;Swan Lake&quot; were beginning to come to fruition. It remains uncertain whether Tchaikovsky was prepared to revise the music for this revival. Whatever the case, as a result of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death, Riccardo Drigo revised the score, after receiving approval from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s younger brother, Modest. There are major differences between Drigo&#x27;s and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s scores. Today, it is Drigo&#x27;s revision, and not Tchaikovsky&#x27;s original score of 1877, that most ballet companies use.
In February 1894, two memorial concerts planned by Vsevolozhsky were given in honor of Tchaikovsky. The production included the second act of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, choreographed by Lev Ivanov, Second Balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. The turnout for the revival concert was not as great as anticipated due to the mixed program as well as higher-than-usual ticket prices, leaving the theater hall half-empty. Despite the small audience, Ivanov&#x27;s choreography for the memorial concert was unanimously praised by critics, and audiences received the concert with praise.

The revival of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was planned for Pierina Legnani&#x27;s benefit performance in the 1894–1895 season. The death of Tsar Alexander III on 1 November 1894 and the ensuing period of official mourning brought all ballet performances and rehearsals to a close for some time, and as a result all efforts could be concentrated on the pre-production of the full revival of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. Ivanov and Petipa collaborated on the production, with Ivanov retaining his dances for the second act while choreographing the fourth, with Petipa staging the first and third acts.

Modest Tchaikovsky was called upon to make changes to the ballet&#x27;s libretto, including the character of Odette changing from a fairy swan-maiden into a cursed mortal woman, the ballet&#x27;s villain changing from Odette&#x27;s stepmother to the magician von Rothbart, and the ballet&#x27;s finale: instead of the lovers simply drowning at the hand of Odette&#x27;s stepmother as in the original 1877 scenario, Odette dies by drowning herself, with Prince Siegfried choosing to die as well, rather than live without her, and soon the lovers&#x27; spirits are reunited in an &quot;apotheosis&quot;. Aside from the revision of the libretto the ballet was changed from four acts to three—with act 2 becoming act 1, scene 2.

All was ready by the beginning of 1895 and the ballet had its première on 27 January. Pierina Legnani danced Odette/Odile, with Pavel Gerdt as Prince Siegfried, Alexei Bulgakov as Rothbart, and Alexander Oblakov as Benno. Most of the reviews in the St. Petersburg newspapers were positive.

Unlike the première of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; did not dominate the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre in its first season. It was given only sixteen performances between the première and the 1895–1896 season, and was not performed at all in 1897. Even more surprising, the ballet was performed only four times in 1898 and 1899. The ballet belonged solely to Legnani until she left St. Petersburg for her native Italy in 1901. After her departure, the ballet was taken over by Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who was as much celebrated in the rôle as was her Italian predecessor.

==== Later productions ====
Throughout the performance history of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, the 1895 edition has served as the version on which most stagings have been based. Nearly every balletmaster or choreographer who has re-staged Swan Lake has made modifications to the ballet&#x27;s scenario, while still maintaining much of the traditional choreography for the dances, which is regarded as virtually sacrosanct. Likewise, over time the rôle of Siegfried has become more prominent, due largely to the evolution of ballet technique.

In 1922, Finnish National Ballet was the first European company that staged a complete production of the ballet. By the time Swan Lake premiered in Helsinki in 1922, it had only ever been performed by Russian and Czech ballet groups, and only visiting Russian ballet groups had brought it to Western Europe.

In 1940, the San Francisco Ballet became the first American company to stage a complete production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. The enormously successful production starred Lew Christensen as Prince Siegfried, Jacqueline Martin as Odette, and Janet Reed as Odile. Willam Christensen based his choreography on the Petipa–Ivanov production, turning to San Francisco&#x27;s large population of Russian émigrés, headed by Princess and Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia, to help him ensure that the production succeeded in its goal of preserving Russian culture in San Francisco.

Several notable productions have diverged from the original and its 1895 revival:
* In 1967, Erik Bruhn produced and danced in a new &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for the National Ballet of Canada, with striking largely black and white designs by Desmond Healey. Although substantial portions of the Petipa-Ivanov choreography were retained, Bruhn&#x27;s alterations were musical as well as choreographic. Most controversially, he recast Von Rothbart as the malevolent Black Queen, adding psychological emphasis to the Prince&#x27;s difficult relationships with women, his domineering mother included.
* &quot;Illusions Like &quot;Swan Lake&quot;&quot; 1976: John Neumeier, Hamburg Ballet. Neumeier interpolated the story of Ludwig II of Bavaria into the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; plot, via Ludwig&#x27;s fascination with swans. Much of the original score was used with additional Tchaikovsky material and the choreography combined the familiar Petipa/Ivanov material with new dances and scenes by Neumeier. The ballet finishes with Ludwig&#x27;s death by drowning while confined to an asylum, set to the dramatic music for the act 3 conclusion. With the theme of the unhappy royal being forced into heterosexual marriage for reasons of state and also the cross reference to the personal lives of actual royalty, this work anticipated both Bourne&#x27;s and Murphy&#x27;s interpretation. &quot;Illusions Like &quot;Swan Lake&quot; &quot; remains in the repertoire of major German ballet companies.
* Matthew Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; departed from the traditional ballet by replacing the female corps de ballet with male dancers and a plot focused on the psychological pressures of modern royalty on a prince struggling with his sexuality and a distant mother. It has been performed on extended tours in Greece, Israel, Turkey, Australia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Ireland in addition to the United Kingdom, and has won over thirty international awards to date.
* The 2000 American Ballet Theatre version (taped for television in 2005), rather than having the curtain down as the slow introduction is played, used this music to accompany a new prologue in which the audience is shown how Rothbart first transforms Odette into a swan. This prologue is similar to Vladimir Burmeister&#x27;s production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (firstly staged in Stanislavsky Theatre in Moscow, 1953) but has some differences. Rothbart in this production is played by two dancers; one appears as a handsome young man who is easily able to lure Odette in the new prologue, and the other dancer is covered in sinister &quot;monster makeup&quot; which reveals the magician&#x27;s true self. (In the film &quot;Black Swan&quot;, Natalie Portman, as Nina, dreams this in the film&#x27;s opening sequence). About half-an-hour of the complete score is omitted from this production.
* Graeme Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was first performed in 2002, and was loosely based on the breakdown of the marriage of Lady Diana to Prince Charles and his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. It combined the roles of Rothbart and Odile into that of a Baroness, and the focus of the story is a love triangle.
* In 2010, &quot;Black Swan&quot;, a film starring Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, contained sequences from &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.
* In 2010, South African choreographer and ballet dancer Dada Masilo, remade Tchaikovsky&#x27;s classic. Her version was a mix of classic ballet and African dance. She also made a plot twist by presenting Odile (the black swan) as a gay male swan rather than a female swan.
* &quot;A Swan Lake&quot;, choreographed by Alexander Ekman and composed by Mikael Karlsson, was created for the Norwegian National Ballet. The first act is part dance part theatre, about the original production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, which features two stage actors and a soprano. In the second act, the stage is filled in 5000 litres of water, and features the conflict between White Swan and Black Swan.

== Instrumentation ==
&quot;Swan Lake&quot; is scored for the typical late 19th-century large orchestra:
* Strings: violins I and II; violas, violoncellos; double basses, harp
* Woodwinds: piccolo; 2 flutes; 2 oboes; 2 clarinets in B, A and C; 2 bassoons
* Brass: 4 French horns in F; 2 cornets in A and B; 2 trumpets in F, D, and E; 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass); tuba
* Percussion: timpani; snare drum; cymbals; bass drum; triangle; tambourine; castanets; tam-tam; glockenspiel; chimes

== Roles ==
* Princess Odette (the Swan Queen, the White Swan, the Swan Princess), a beautiful princess, who has been transformed into a white swan
* Prince Siegfried, a handsome Prince who falls in love with Odette
* Baron Von Rothbart, an evil sorcerer, who has enchanted Odette
* Odile (the Black Swan), Rothbart&#x27;s daughter
* Benno von Sommerstern, the Prince&#x27;s friend
* The Queen, Prince Siegfried&#x27;s mother
* Wolfgang, his tutor
* Baron von Stein
* The Baroness, his wife
* Freiherr von Schwarzfels
* Freiherr von Schwarzfels&#x27; wife
* A herald
* A footman
* Court gentlemen and ladies, friends of the prince, heralds, guests, pages, villagers, servants, swans, cygnets

=== Variations to characters ===
By 1895, Benno von Sommerstern had become just &quot;Benno&quot;, and Odette &quot;Queen of the Swans&quot;. Also Baron von Stein, his wife, and Freiherr von Schwarzfels and his wife were no longer identified on the program. The sovereign or ruling Princess is often rendered &quot;Queen Mother&quot;.

The character of Rothbart (sometimes spelled Rotbart) has been open to many interpretations. The reason for his curse upon Odette is unknown; several versions, including two feature films, have suggested reasons, but none is typically explained by the ballet. He is rarely portrayed in human form, except in act 3. He is usually shown as an owl-like creature. In most productions, the couple&#x27;s sacrifice results in his destruction. However, there are versions in which he is triumphant. Yury Grigorovich&#x27;s version, which has been danced for several decades by the Bolshoi Ballet, is noted for including both endings: Rothbart was defeated in the original 1969 version, in line with Soviet-era expectations of an upbeat conclusion, but in the 2001 revision, Rothbart plays a wicked game of fate with Siegfried, which he wins at the end, causing Siegfried to lose everything. In the second American Ballet Theatre production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, he is portrayed by two dancers: a young, handsome one who lures Odette to her doom in the prologue, and a reptilian creature. In this version, the lovers&#x27; suicide inspires the rest of Rothbart&#x27;s imprisoned swans to turn on him and overcome his spell.

Odile, Rothbart&#x27;s daughter usually wears jet black (though in the 1895 production, she did not), and appears only in act 3. In most modern productions, she is portrayed as Odette&#x27;s exact double (though the resemblance is because of Rothbart&#x27;s magic), and therefore Siegfried cannot be blamed for believing her to be Odette. There is a suggestion that in the original production, Odette and Odile were danced by two different ballerinas. This is also the case in some avant garde productions.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Swan Lake&quot; is generally presented in either four acts, four scenes (primarily outside Russia and Eastern Europe) or three acts, four scenes (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe). The biggest difference of productions all over the world is that the ending, originally tragic, is now sometimes altered to a happy ending.

=== Prologue ===
Some productions include a prologue that shows how Odette first meets Rothbart, who turns Odette into a swan.

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;A magnificent park before a palace&quot;

[Scène: Allegro giusto] Prince Siegfried is celebrating his birthday with his tutor, friends, and peasants [Waltz]. The revelries are interrupted by his mother, the Queen [Scène: Allegro moderato], who is concerned about his carefree lifestyle. She tells him that he must choose a bride at the royal ball the following evening (some productions include the presentation of some possible candidates). He is upset that he cannot marry for love. His friend, Benno, and the tutor try to lift his troubled mood. As evening falls [&quot;Sujet&quot;], Benno sees a flock of swans flying overhead and suggests they go on a hunt [Finale I]. Siegfried and his friends take their crossbows and set off in pursuit of the swans.

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;A lakeside clearing in a forest by the ruins of a chapel. A moonlit night.&quot;
Siegfried has become separated from his friends. He arrives at the lakeside clearing, just as a flock of swans land [Scène. Moderato]. He aims his crossbow [Scène. Allegro moderato], but freezes when one of them transforms into a beautiful maiden named Odette [Scène. Moderato]. At first, she is terrified of him. When he promises not to harm her, she explains that she and her companions are victims of a spell cast by the evil owl-like sorcerer named Rothbart. By day they are turned into swans and only at night, by the side of the enchanted lake – created from the tears of Odette&#x27;s mother – do they return to human form. The spell can only be broken if one who has never loved before swears to love Odette forever. Rothbart suddenly appears [Scène. Allegro vivo]. Siegfried threatens to kill him but Odette intercedes – if Rothbart dies before the spell is broken, it can never be undone.

As Rothbart disappears, the swan maidens fill the clearing [Scène: Allegro, Moderato assai quasi andante]. Siegfried breaks his crossbow, and sets about winning Odette&#x27;s trust as they fall in love. But as dawn arrives, the evil spell draws Odette and her companions back to the lake and they are turned into swans again.

=== Act 3 ===
&quot;An opulent hall in the palace&quot;

Guests arrive at the palace for a costume ball. Six princesses are presented to the prince [Entrance of the Guests and Waltz], as candidates for marriage. Rothbart arrives in disguise [Scène: Allegro, Allegro giusto] with his daughter, Odile, who is transformed to look like Odette. Though the princesses try to attract Siegfried with their dances [Pas de six], he has eyes only for Odile. [Scène: Allegro, Tempo di valse, Allegro vivo] Odette appears at the castle window and attempts to warn him, but he does not see her. He then proclaims to the court that he will marry Odile before Rothbart shows him a magical vision of Odette. Grief-stricken and realizing his mistake (he vowed only to love Odette), he hurries back to the lake.

=== Act 4 ===
&quot;By the lakeside&quot;
Odette is distraught. The swan maidens try to comfort her. Siegfried returns to the lake and makes a passionate apology. She forgives him, but his betrayal cannot be undone. Rather than remain a swan forever, she chooses to die. He chooses to die with her and they leap into the lake, where they will stay together forever. This breaks Rothbart&#x27;s spell over the swan maidens, causing him to lose his power over them and he dies. In an apotheosis, they, who transform back into regular maidens, watch as Siegfried and Odette ascend into the Heavens together, forever united in love.

=== 1877 libretto synopsis ===
Act 1

Prince Siegfried, his friends, and a group of peasants are celebrating his coming of age. His mother arrives to inform him she wishes for him to marry soon so she may make sure he does not disgrace their family line by his marriage. She has organized a ball where he is to choose his bride from among the daughters of the nobility. After the celebration, he and his friend, Benno, spot a flock of flying swans and decide to hunt them.

Act 2

Siegfried and Benno track the swans to a lake, but they vanish. A woman wearing a crown appears and meets them. She tells them her name is Odette and she was one of the swans they were hunting. She tells them her story: her mother, a good fairy, had married a knight, but she died and he remarried. Odette&#x27;s stepmother is a witch who wanted to kill her, but her grandfather saved her. He had cried so much over her mother&#x27;s death, he created the lake with his tears. She and her companions live in it with him, and can transform themselves into swans whenever they wish. Her stepmother still wants to kill her and stalks her in the form of an owl, but she has a crown which protects her from harm. When she gets married, her stepmother will lose the power to harm her. Siegfried falls in love with her but she fears her stepmother will ruin their happiness.

Act 3

Several young noblewomen dance at Siegfried&#x27;s ball, but he refuses to marry any of them. Baron von Rothbart and his daughter, Odile, arrive. Siegfried thinks Odile looks like Odette, but Benno does not agree. He dances with her as he grows more and more enamored of her, and eventually agrees to marry her. At that moment, Rothbart transforms into a demon, Odile laughs, and a white swan wearing a crown appears in the window. Siegfried runs out of the castle.

Act 4

In tears, Odette tells her friends Siegfried did not keep his vow of love. Seeing him coming, they leave and urge her to go with them, but she wants to see him one last time. A storm begins. He enters and begs her for forgiveness. She refuses and attempts to leave. He snatches the crown from her head and throws it in the lake, saying, &quot;Willing or unwilling, you will always remain with me!&quot; The owl flies overhead, carrying the crown away. &quot;What have you done? I am dying!&quot; Odette says, and falls into his arms. The lake rises from the storm and drowns them. The storm quiets, and a group of swans appear on the lake.

=== Alternative endings ===

Many different endings exist, ranging from romantic to tragic.
* In 1950, Konstantin Sergeyev staged a new &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for the Mariinsky Ballet (then the Kirov) after Petipa and Ivanov, but included some bits of Vaganova and Gorsky. Under the Soviet regime, the tragic ending was replaced with a happy one, so in the Mariinsky and Bolshoi versions, Odette and Siegfried lived happily ever after.
* In the version danced today by the Mariinsky Ballet, the ending is one of a &quot;happily ever after&quot; in which Siegfried fights Rothbart and tears off his wing, killing him. Odette is restored to human form and she and Siegfried are happily united. This version has often been used by Russian and Chinese ballet companies.
* In the 1966 version Rudolf Nureyev choreographed for the Vienna State Ballet, Rothbart takes Odette away and leaves Siegfried to drown in the storm he created, leaving Odette in captivity.
* In the 1986 version Rudolf Nureyev choreographed for the Paris Opera Ballet, Rothbart fights with Siegfried, who is overcome and dies, leaving Rothbart to take Odette triumphantly up to the Heavens.
* In the 1988 Dutch National Ballet production, choreographed by Rudi van Dantzig, Siegfried realized he cannot save Odette from the curse, so he drowns himself. His friend, Alexander, finds his body and carries him.
* In the 1988 version of the London Festival Ballet, Odette dies in Siegfried&#x27;s arms, who carries her to the lake, where they both drown themselves. This breaks the curse and they are united in death.
* Although the 1969 Bolshoi Ballet production by Yury Grigorovich contained a happy ending similar to the Mariinsky Ballet version, the 2001 revision changed the ending to a tragic one. Siegfried is defeated in a confrontation with the Evil Genius, who seizes Odette and takes her away to parts unknown before the lovers can unite, and Siegfried is left by himself at the lake. The major-key rendition of the main leitmotif and the remainder of the &quot;Apotheosis&quot; (retained in the 1969 production) are replaced with a modified, transposed repeat of the &quot;Introduction&quot; followed by the final few bars of &quot;No. 10&quot;/&quot;No. 14&quot;, closing the ballet on a dour note.
* In a version which has an ending very close to the 1895 Mariinsky revival, danced by American Ballet Theatre starting in 2000 (with a video recording published in 2005), Siegfried&#x27;s mistaken pledge of fidelity to Odile consigns Odette to remain a swan forever. After realizing her last moment of humanity is at hand, Odette throws herself into the lake, killing herself. Siegfried follows her to his death. This act of sacrifice and love breaks Rothbart&#x27;s power, and he is destroyed. In the final tableau, the lovers are seen rising together to Heaven in apotheosis.
* In a version danced by New York City Ballet in 2006 (with choreography by Peter Martins after Lev Ivanov, Marius Petipa, and George Balanchine), Siegfried&#x27;s declaration he wishes to marry Odile constitutes a betrayal that condemns Odette to remain a swan forever. She is called away into swan form, and Siegfried is left alone in grief as the curtain falls.
* In the 2006 version by Stanton Welch for Houston Ballet, also based upon Petipa and Ivanov, the last scene has Siegfried attempting to kill Rothbart with his crossbow, but he misses and hits Odette instead. She falls, Rothbart&#x27;s spell now broken, and regains human form. Siegfried embraces her as she dies, then carries her body into the lake, where he also drowns himself.
* In the 2006 version by Michael Pink for Milwaukee Ballet, Rothbart stabs Odette before Siegfried&#x27;s eyes. Odette mortally wounded, is carried to the lake by Siegfried where they drown themselves. Their love defeats both Rothbart and Odile. As in the 1895 Mariinsky revival, the apotheosis reveals the lovers reunited in death.
* In a version danced by San Francisco Ballet in 2009, Siegfried and Odette throw themselves into the lake, as in the 1895 Mariinsky revival, and Rothbart is destroyed. Two swans, implied to be the lovers, are then seen flying past the Moon.
* In a version danced by National Ballet of Canada in 2010, Odette forgives Siegfried for his betrayal and the promise of reconciliation shines momentarily before Rothbart summons forth a violent storm. He and Siegfried struggle. When the storm subsides, Odette is left alone to mourn the dead Siegfried.
* In the 2012 version performed at Blackpool Grand Theatre by the Russian State Ballet of Siberia Siegfried drags Rothbart into the lake and they both drown. Odette is left as a swan.
* In the 2015 English National Ballet version &quot;My First Swan Lake&quot;, specifically recreated for young children, the power of Siegfried and Odette&#x27;s love enables the other swans to rise up and defeat Rothbart, who falls to his death. This breaks the curse, and Siegfried and Odette live happily ever after. This is like the Mariinsky Ballet&#x27;s &quot;Happily ever after&quot; endings. In a new production in 2018, Odile helps Siegfried and Odette in the end. Rothbart, who is Odile&#x27;s brother in this production, is forgiven and he gives up his evil power. Odette and Siegfried live happily ever after and stay friends with Rothbart and Odile.
* In Hübbe and Schandorff&#x27;s 2015 and 2016 Royal Danish Ballet production, Siegfried is forced by Rothbart to marry Odile, after condemning Odette to her curse as a swan forever by mistakenly professing his love to Odile.
* In the 2018 Royal Ballet version, Siegfried rescues Odette from the lake, but she turns out to be dead, even though the spell is broken. The pre-2018 versions don&#x27;t have this ending, only the 1895 ending. 
* In David Hallberg’s 2023 Australian Ballet version, Odette makes an irrevocable promise to von Rothbart, vowing eternal obedience in order to save Siegfried. Triumphantly, Rothbart takes Odette away from Siegfried. Alone in his grief, Siegfried throws himself off a cliff and dies.

== Adaptations and references ==
=== Live-action film ===
* The opening credits for the first sound version of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) starring Bela Lugosi includes a modified version of the Swan Theme from act 2. The same piece was later used for the credits of &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932) as well as &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1932) and is often used as a backing track for the silent film, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925).
* The film &quot;I Was an Adventuress&quot; (1940) includes a long sequence from the ballet.
* The documentary &quot;World Assembly of Youth&quot; features the New York City Ballet performing Black Swan at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in August 1951
* The plot of the 1965 British comedy film &quot;The Intelligence Men&quot; reaches its climax at a performance of the ballet, with an assassination attempt on the ballerina portraying Odette.
* The 1966 American political thriller film &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews contains a scene from the ballet Swan Lake. The lead couple of the film, played by Newman and Andrews, are escaping from East Berlin during the Cold War and attend a performance of the ballet as part of their escape plan. They are spotted and reported to the police by the lead ballerina (Tamara Toumanova) during the ballet performance. Their dramatic escape from the theatre during the ballet is a high point of the film.
* In 1968–69, the Kirov Ballet along with Lenfilm studios produced a filmed version of the ballet starring Yelena Yevteyeva as Odette.
* In the film &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), Barbra Streisand, playing Fanny Brice, dances in a comedic spoof of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.
* In the film &quot;A Woman Under The Influence&quot; (1974), Gena Rowlands, Mabel Longhetti dances in the garden with her children to &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and later hums the melody.
* The ballet is central to the plot of &quot;Étoile&quot; (1989).
* In &quot;Brain Donors&quot; (1992), the three main characters try and succeed in sabotaging a fictional production of the ballet.
* The 1998 Czech fantasy film &quot;Jezerní královna&quot; directed by Václav Vorlíček is a loose adaptation of the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; story. Odette (played by Jitka Schneiderová) is one of seven princesses kidnapped by the eponymous Queen of the Lake (Ivana Chýlková) to be her slaves, dancing for her underwater and transforming into swans on the surface.
* Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010) focuses on two characters from &quot;Swan Lake&quot;-the Princess Odette, sometimes called the White Swan, and her evil duplicate, the witch Odile (the Black Swan), and takes its inspiration from the ballet&#x27;s story, although it does not literally follow it. Clint Mansell&#x27;s score contains music from the ballet, with more elaborate restructuring to fit the horror tone of the film.
* In &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot; (2011), the climactic Swan Lake music is played at the monks&#x27; Last Supper-reminiscent dinner.
* In the film &quot;T-34&quot;, music from Swan Lake could be heard while the main characters test-drive a captured T-34 for the Germans and pulling off ballet-style moves with the tank.
* As of August 2020, a live-action adaptation of the ballet is being produced by Mandeville Films, written by Olivier Award-winning playwright Jessica Swale and starring Felicity Jones with Universal Pictures set to distribute.
* The end of the ballet is in the film &quot;The Courier&quot; (2020).
* The ballet is referenced in the film &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023) by Jason Momoa&#x27;s character Dante.

=== Animated theatrical and direct-to-video productions ===
* &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (1981) is a feature-length anime produced by the Japanese company Toei Animation and directed by Koro Yabuki. The adaptation uses Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score and remains relatively faithful to the story. Two separate English dubs were made, one featuring regular voice actors, and one using celebrities as the main principals (Pam Dawber as Odette, Christopher Atkins as Siegfried, David Hemmings as Rothbart, and Kay Lenz as Odille). The second dub was recorded at Golden Sync Studios and aired on American Movie Classics in December 1990 and The Disney Channel in January 1994. It was presently distributed in the United States by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It was also distributed in France and the United Kingdom by Rouge Citron Production.
* &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (1994) is a 28-minute traditional two-dimensional animation narrated by Dudley Moore. It is one of five animations in the &quot;Storyteller&#x27;s Classics&quot; series. Like the 1981 version, it also uses Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music throughout and is quite faithful to the original story. What sets it apart is the climactic scene, in which the prince swims across the lagoon towards Rothbart&#x27;s castle to rescue Odette, who is being held prisoner there. Rothbart points his finger at the prince and zaps him to turn him into a duck – but then, the narrator declares, &quot;Sometimes, even magic can go very, very wrong.&quot; After a moment, the duck turns into an eagle and flies into Rothbart&#x27;s castle, where the prince resumes his human form and engages Rothbart in battle. This animation was produced by Madman Movies for Castle Communications. The director was Chris Randall, the producer was Bob Burrows, the production co-ordinator was Lesley Evans and the executive producers were Terry Shand and Geoff Kempin. The music was performed by the Moscow State Orchestra. It was shown on TVOntario in December 1997 and was distributed on home video in North America by Castle Vision International, Orion Home Video and J.L. Bowerbank &amp; Associates.
* &quot;The Swan Princess&quot; (1994) is a Nest Entertainment film based on the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; story. It stays fairly close to the original story, but does contain many differences. For example, instead of the Swan Maidens, we have the addition of sidekicks Puffin the puffin, Speed the tortoise, and Jean-Bob the frog. Several of the characters are renamed – Prince Derek instead of Siegfried, his friend Bromley instead of Benno and his tutor Rogers instead of Wolfgang; Derek&#x27;s mother is named Queen Uberta. Another difference is Odette and Derek knowing each other from when they were children, which introduces us to Odette&#x27;s father, King William and explains how and why Odette is kidnapped by Rothbart. The character Odile is replaced by an old hag (unnamed in this movie, but known as Bridget in the sequels), as Rothbart&#x27;s sidekick until the end. Also, this version contains a happy ending, allowing both Odette and Derek to survive as humans once Rothbart is defeated. It has eleven sequels, &quot;Escape from Castle Mountain&quot; (1997), &quot;The Mystery of the Enchanted Treasure&quot; (1998), &quot;Christmas&quot; (2012), &quot;A Royal Family Tale&quot; (2014), &quot;Princess Tomorrow, Pirate Today&quot; (2016), &quot;Royally Undercover&quot; (2017), &quot;A Royal MyZtery&quot; (2018), &quot;Kingdom of Music&quot; (2019), &quot;A Royal Wedding&quot; (2020), &quot;A Fairytale is Born&quot; (2023), and &quot;Far Longer than Forever&quot; (2023) which deviate even further from the ballet. None of the films contain Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music.
* &quot;Barbie of Swan Lake&quot; (2003) is a direct-to-video children&#x27;s movie featuring Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music and motion capture from the New York City Ballet and based on the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; story. In this version, Odette is not a princess by birth, but a baker&#x27;s daughter; instead of being kidnapped by Rothbart and taken to the lake against her will, she discovers the Enchanted Forest when she willingly follows a unicorn there. She is also made into a more dominant heroine in this version, as she is declared as the one who is destined to save the forest from Rothbart&#x27;s clutches when she frees a magic crystal. Another difference is the addition of new characters, such as Rothbart&#x27;s cousin the Fairy Queen, Lila the unicorn, Erasmus the troll, and the Fairy Queen&#x27;s fairies and elves, who have also been turned into animals by Rothbart. These fairies and elves replace the Swan Maidens from the ballet. It is also the Fairy Queen&#x27;s magic that allows Odette to return to her human form at night, not Rothbart&#x27;s spell. Other changes include renaming the Prince Daniel and a happy ending, instead of the ballet&#x27;s tragic ending. Like the 1877 production, Odette wears a magic crown that protects her.
* &quot;Barbie in the Pink Shoes&quot; (2013) features an adaptation of Swan Lake amongst its many fairytales.

=== Computer/video games ===
* The 1988 NES video game &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; used a minor portion of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; just before fighting the Lamia Queen boss. In the WonderSwan Color and later versions the portion is longer.
* The 1990 LucasArts adventure game &quot;Loom&quot; used a major portion of the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; suite for its audio track, as well as incorporating a major swan theme into the storyline. It otherwise bore no resemblance to the original ballet.
* The 1991 DMA Design puzzle game &quot;Lemmings&quot; used &quot;Dance of the Little Swans&quot; in its soundtrack.
* The 1993 Treasure platform game &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; uses a portion of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; as background music for one of its levels.
* The 2008 Nintendo DS game &quot;&quot; contains a shortened version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. The main character, who is directly controlled by the player of the game, dances to three shortened musical pieces from Swan Lake. Two of the pieces are solos and the third piece is a &quot;pas de deux&quot;.
* The 2009 SEGA video game &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games&quot; includes &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in its figure skating competition.
* The 2015 game &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s 3&quot; contains a music box version of a piece from &quot;Swan Lake.&quot;
* The 2016 Blizzard Entertainment game &quot;Overwatch&quot; contains two unlockable costumes for the character Widowmaker based on Odette and Odile.
* The 2020 Nintendo Switch game &quot;Paper Mario: The Origami King&quot; features a comedic ballet production of the song, as well as a punk remix.
* The 2022 game &quot;Signalis&quot; contains a cassette tape the player can find that plays a section of &quot;Swan Lake.&quot;
* The 2023 rhythm game &quot;Just Dance 2024 Edition&quot; features a remix of the song&quot;.&quot;

=== Dance ===

* The Swedish dancer/choreographer Fredrik Rydman has produced a modern dance/street dance interpretation of the ballet entitled &quot;Swan Lake Reloaded&quot;. It depicts the &quot;swans&quot; as heroin addict prostitutes who are kept in place by Rothbart, their pimp. The production&#x27;s music uses themes and melodies from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score and incorporates them into hip-hop and techno tunes.

=== Literature ===
* &quot;Amiri &amp; Odette&quot; (2009) is a verse retelling by Walter Dean Myers with illustrations by Javaka Steptoe. Myers sets the story in the Swan Lake Projects of a large city. Amiri is a basketball-playing &quot;Prince of the Night&quot;, a champion of the asphalt courts in the park. Odette belongs to Big Red, a dealer, a power on the streets.
* &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (1999) is a fantasy novel written by Mercedes Lackey that re-imagines the original story and focuses heavily on Odile. Rothbart&#x27;s daughter is a sorceress in her own right who comes to sympathise with Odette.
* &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003) is a fantasy novel by Irina Izmailova, a retelling of the ballet&#x27;s plot. The boyish and careless Siegfried consciously prefers the gentle, equally childlike Odile, while the stern and proud Odette is from the very beginning attracted to Rothbart (who later turns out to be the kingdom&#x27;s rightful monarch in hiding).
* &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (1989) is a children&#x27;s novel written by Mark Helprin and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg, which re-creates the original story as a tale about political strife in an unnamed Eastern European country. In it, Odette becomes a princess hidden from birth by the puppetmaster (and eventually usurper) behind the throne, with the story being retold to her child.

=== Music ===
* British instrumental band The Cougars had a #33 UK hit with the single &quot;Saturday Nite at the Duck-Pond&quot;, which used music from Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The song achieved some notoriety for being banned by the BBC. The reason for the ban was reported in the musical press, saying Saturday Nite At The Duck Pond was &quot;a travesty of a major classical work&quot;.
* Japanese instrumental rock group Takeshi Terauchi &amp; Bunnys recorded this on their 1967 album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Unmei&quot;.
* Belgian band Wallace Collection quote from Act 2 Scene 10 in their track &quot;Daydream&quot; (1969). 
* British ska band Madness featured a ska version in 1979 on their debut album &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot;
* British post-punk band Public Image Ltd&#x27;s 1979 single &quot;Death Disco&quot; borrows elements of the main theme. The track appears on their 1979 album Metal Box under the title Swan Lake. 
* South Korean group Shinhwa re-imagines the main theme into a hip-hop k-pop song &quot;T.O.P. (Twinkling of Paradise)&quot; (1999)
* Los Angeles group Sweetbox uses the main theme for the chorus of their song &quot;Superstar&quot; from the 2001 album &quot;Classified&quot;.
* German singer Jeanette Biedermann uses the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; melody structure for her 2001 single release &quot;How It&#x27;s Got To Be&quot;.
* Spanish symphonic metal band Dark Moor borrows elements on the song &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, the first track of their 2009 album Autumnal.
* A reggae version of the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; ballet appears on the 2017 album &quot;Classical Made Modern 3&quot;.
* Canadian metal band The Agonist has made an a cappella version of act 2&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Scène&quot;. Moderato&quot;, which is included in their second studio album, &quot;Lullabies for the Dormant Mind&quot;.
* Beyoncé uses the ballet&#x27;s famous theme in her &quot;visual album&quot; &quot;Lemonade&quot;, a reference that underscores the film&#x27;s meditation on infidelity.
* Scott Hamilton – Tenor Saxophone. Jazz interpretation – Scott Hamilton CLASSICS
* X Japan uses a short excerpt of it in &quot;Silent Jealousy&quot;.

=== Musicals/opera ===
* &quot;Odette – The Dark Side of Swan Lake&quot;, a musical written by Alexander S. Bermange and Murray Woodfield, was staged at the Bridewell Theatre, London in October 2007.
* In &quot;Radio City Christmas Spectacular&quot;, The Rockettes do a short homage to Swan Lake during the performance of the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas (Rock and Dance Version)&quot;, with the line &quot;Seven Swans A-Swimming&quot;.
* &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot; incorporates the most famous section of Matthew Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in a dance number, in which the main character dances while shadowed by his future, adult self.
* The musical &quot;Anastasia&quot; includes a scene in which several of the main characters attend a performance of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; in Paris near the show&#x27;s climax. The four characters sing about their inner conflicts and desires as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score blends into the musical&#x27;s melodies, the dancers onstage representing both the ballet&#x27;s characters and the thoughts of each singer in turn.
* The top of the third act of the opera &quot;The Abduction of Figaro&quot; (1984) includes a parody of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; where Odile is portrayed as a Carmen Miranda character.

=== Television ===
* During the era of the Soviet Union, Soviet state television preempted large announcements with video recordings of Swan Lake on four infamous occasions. In 1982 state television broadcast recordings following the death of Leonid Brezhnev. In 1984 recordings preempted the announcement of the death of Yuri Andropov. In 1985, recordings preempted the announcement of the death of General Secretary Konstantin Chernenko. The final and most oft-cited instance of the use of Swan Lake in this context was during the August 1991 Soviet coup attempt leading up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
* When independent Russian news channel TV Rain was forced to shut down due to censorship laws caused by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the station chose to end its final newscast with Swan Lake in a reference to its use in 1991.
* &quot;Princess Tutu&quot; (2002) is an anime television series whose heroine, Duck, wears a costume reminiscent of Odette&#x27;s. She is a duck transformed by a writer into a girl (rather than the other way around), while her antagonist, Rue, dressed as Odile, is a girl who had been raised to believe she is a raven. Other characters include Mytho in the role of Siegfried, who is even referred to by this name towards the end of the second act, and Drosselmeyer playing in the role of Rothbart. The score of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, along with that of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, is used throughout, as is, occasionally, the Petipa choreography, most notably in episode 13, where Duck dances the climactic &quot;pas de deux&quot; alone, complete with failed lifts and catches.
* In the second season of the anime &quot;Kaleido Star&quot;, a circus adaptation of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; becomes one of the Kaleido Stage&#x27;s most important and successful shows. Main character Sora Naegino plays Princess Odette, with characters Leon Oswald as Prince Siegfried and May Wong as Odile.
* In episode 213 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Rudolf Nureyev performs &quot;Swine Lake&quot; with a giant ballerina pig.
* In episode 105 of &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;, Det. Chris Cagney went to this with her boyfriend and hated it so that she fell asleep in the second act.
* &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was heard in two episodes of the Playhouse Disney series &quot;Little Einsteins&quot;: &quot;Quincy and the Magic Instruments&quot; and &quot;The Blue Footed Boobey Bird Ballet&quot;.
* In the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Loon Lake&quot;, Babs Bunny helps out Shirley the Loon after she was ridiculed by a group of snobbish swans in ballet class while preparing for a performance of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.

== Symbolism ==
In the 2020s, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; became a symbol of protest in Russia. The symbolism dates to the failed Soviet coup of 1991. On August 19 of that year, as tanks rolled into Moscow, state television aired the entire ballet on loop. Communist hardliners then announced that they had seized control of the country from Mikhail Gorbachev, whom they had arrested. Boris Yeltsin responded by climbing on a tank in central Moscow and urging citizens to turn out in protest. For three days, thousands of protesters stood off the army, after which the coup leaders relented. Within four months, the Soviet Union was gone.

In 1991, there was a tradition of interrupting regular programming by airing the ballet on loop when the government was in crisis: it happened with the death of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982, while a successor was selected, and again with the deaths of Yuri Andropov in 1984 and Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. &quot;Swan Lake&quot; thus became &quot;a sign of political instability and upheaval.&quot;

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, public opposition to the war was made illegal. &quot;Swan Lake&quot; became a coded symbol of protest against the war or the Putin regime. Graffiti of the &quot;Dance of the Cygnets&quot; appeared in Russian cities, and when the independent Russian news outlet TV Rain signed off for the last time, due to government pressure over its coverage of the war, it ended with a clip from &quot;Swan Lake.&quot; It has become &quot;a sign that we are waiting for Putin to die.&quot; Putin has not established a successor, meaning that &quot;there&#x27;s always the risk that Tchaikovsky&#x27;s swans may dance again.&quot;

<text>Rita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino; October 17, 1918May 14, 1987) was an American actress, dancer, and pin-up girl. She achieved fame in the 1940s as one of the top stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and appeared in 61 films in total over 37 years. The press coined the term &quot;The Love Goddess&quot; to describe Hayworth, after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top pin-up girl for GIs during World War II.

Hayworth is widely known for her performance in the 1946 film noir &quot;Gilda&quot;, opposite Glenn Ford, in which she played the &quot;femme fatale&quot; in her first major dramatic role. She is also known for her performances in &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939), &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; (1941), &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; (1941), &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; (1947), &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1957), and &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958). Fred Astaire, with whom she made two films, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941) and &quot;You Were Never Lovelier&quot; (1942), once called her his favorite dance partner. She also starred in the Technicolor musical &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944), with Gene Kelly. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the American Film Institute&#x27;s survey, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Stars.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Hayworth received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1645 Vine Street in 1960.

In 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which contributed to her death in 1987 at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer&#x27;s, and helped to increase public and private funding for research into the disease.

==Early life==
Hayworth was born as Margarita Carmen Cansino in Brooklyn, New York, the oldest child of two dancers. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was Spanish, but of Romani descent from Castilleja de la Cuesta, a little town near Seville, Spain.

Her mother, Volga Hayworth, was an American of Irish and English descent who had performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. The couple married in 1917. They also had two sons: Eduardo Jr. and Vernon. Her maternal uncle Vinton Hayworth was also an actor.

Margarita&#x27;s father wanted her to become a professional dancer, while her mother hoped that she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Antonio Cansino instructed Rita Hayworth in her first dance lesson. Hayworth later recalled, &quot;From the time I was three and a half... as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons.&quot; She noted &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it very much... but I didn&#x27;t have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood.&quot;

She attended dance classes every day for a few years in a Carnegie Hall complex, where she was taught by her uncle Angel Cansino. Before her fifth birthday she was one of the Four Cansinos featured in the Broadway production of &quot;The Greenwich Village Follies&quot; at the Winter Garden Theatre. In 1926, at the age of eight, she was featured in &quot;La Fiesta&quot;, a short film for Warner Bros.

In 1927, her father took the family to Hollywood. He believed that dancing could be featured in the movies and that his family could be part of it. He established his own dance studio, where he taught such stars as James Cagney and Jean Harlow.

In 1931, Eduardo Cansino partnered with his 12-year-old daughter to form an act called the Dancing Cansinos. Her hair was dyed from brown to black to give her a more mature and &quot;Latin&quot; appearance. Since under California law Margarita was too young to work in nightclubs and bars, her father took her with him to work across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. In the early 1930s, it was a popular tourist spot for people from Los Angeles. Because she was working, Cansino never graduated from high school, but she completed the ninth grade at Hamilton High in Los Angeles.

Cansino took a bit part in the film &quot;Cruz Diablo&quot; (1934) at age 16, which led to another bit part in the film &quot;In Caliente&quot; (1935) with the Mexican actress Dolores del Río. She danced with her father in such nightspots as the Foreign and the Caliente clubs. Winfield Sheehan, the head of the Fox Film Corporation, saw her dancing at the Caliente Club and quickly arranged for Hayworth to do a screen test a week later. Impressed by her screen persona, Sheehan signed her to a six-month contract at Fox under the name Rita Cansino, the first of two name changes during her film career.

==Career==
===Early career===

During her time at Fox, Hayworth was billed as Rita Cansino and appeared in unremarkable roles, often cast as the exotic foreigner. In late 1934, aged 16, she performed a dance sequence in the Spencer Tracy film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1935), and was put under contract in February 1935. She had her first speaking role as an Argentinian girl in &quot;Under the Pampas Moon&quot; (1935). She played an Egyptian girl in &quot;Charlie Chan in Egypt&quot; (1935), and a Russian dancer in &quot;Paddy O&#x27;Day&quot; (1935). Sheehan was grooming her for the lead in the 1936 Technicolor film &quot;Ramona&quot;, hoping to establish her as Fox Film&#x27;s new Dolores del Río.

By the end of her six-month contract, Fox had merged into 20th Century Fox, with Darryl F. Zanuck serving as the executive producer. Dismissing Sheehan&#x27;s interest in her and giving Loretta Young the lead in &quot;Ramona&quot;, Zanuck did not renew Cansino&#x27;s contract. Sensing her screen potential, salesman and promoter Edward C. Judson, with whom she would elope in 1937, got freelance work for her in several small-studio films and a part in the Columbia Pictures feature &quot;Meet Nero Wolfe&quot; (1936). Studio head Harry Cohn signed her to a seven-year contract and tried her out in small roles.

Cohn argued that her image was too Mediterranean, which limited her to being cast in &quot;exotic&quot; roles that were fewer in number. He was heard to say her last name sounded too Spanish. Judson acted on Cohn&#x27;s advice: Rita Cansino became Rita Hayworth when she adopted her mother&#x27;s maiden name, to the consternation of her father. With a name that emphasized Irish-American ancestry, people were more likely to regard her as a classic &quot;American&quot;.

With Cohn and Judson&#x27;s encouragement, Hayworth changed her hair color to ginger red hair and had electrolysis to raise her hairline and broaden the appearance of her forehead.

Hayworth appeared in five minor Columbia pictures and three minor independent movies in 1937. The following year, she appeared in five Columbia B movies. In 1939, Cohn pressured director Howard Hawks to use Hayworth for a small, but important, role as a man-trap in the aviation drama &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, in which she played opposite Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.

Cohn began to build up Hayworth in 1940 in features such as &quot;Music in My Heart&quot;, &quot;The Lady in Question&quot;, and &quot;Angels Over Broadway&quot;. That year, she was first featured in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine cover story. While on loan to Warner Bros., Hayworth appeared as the second female lead in &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; (1941), opposite James Cagney.

She returned in triumph to Columbia Pictures, and was cast in the musical &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941) opposite Fred Astaire in one of the highest-budgeted films Columbia had ever made. The picture was so successful, the studio produced and released another Astaire-Hayworth picture the following year, &quot;You Were Never Lovelier&quot;. Astaire&#x27;s biographer Peter Levinson writes that the dancing combination of Astaire and Hayworth was &quot;absolute magnetism on the screen&quot;. Although Astaire made 10 films with Ginger Rogers, his other main dancing partner, Hayworth&#x27;s sensuality surpassed Rogers&#x27; cool technical expertise. &quot;Rita&#x27;s youthful exuberance meshed perfectly with Fred&#x27;s maturity and elegance&quot;, says Levinson.

When Astaire was asked who his favorite dance partner was, he tried not answering the question, but later admitted it was Hayworth: &quot;All right, I&#x27;ll give you a name&quot;, he said. &quot;But if you ever let it out, I&#x27;ll swear I lied. It was Rita Hayworth.&quot; Astaire commented that &quot;Rita danced with trained perfection and individuality ... She was better when she was &#x27;on&#x27; than at rehearsal.&quot; Biographer Charlie Reinhart describes the effect she had on Astaire&#x27;s style:

In August 1941, Hayworth was featured in an iconic &quot;Life&quot; photo in which she posed in a negligee with a black lace bodice. Bob Landry&#x27;s photo made Hayworth one of the top two pin-up girls of the World War II years; the other was Betty Grable, in a 1943 photograph. For two years, Hayworth&#x27;s photograph was the most requested pin-up photograph in circulation. In 2002, the satin nightgown Hayworth wore for the photo sold for $26,888.

In March 1942, Hayworth visited Brazil as a cultural ambassador for the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy, under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. During the 1940s Hayworth also contributed to the OCIAA&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives in support of Pan-Americanism through her broadcasts to South America on the CBS &quot;Cadena de las Américas&quot; radio network.
===Peak years at Columbia===
Hayworth had top billing in one of her best-known films, the Technicolor musical &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, released in 1944. The film established her as Columbia&#x27;s top star of the 1940s, and it gave her the distinction of being the first of only six women to dance on screen with both Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. &quot;I guess the only jewels of my life&quot;, Hayworth said in 1970, &quot;were the pictures I made with Fred Astaire ... And &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, too.&quot;

For three consecutive years, starting in 1944, Hayworth was named one of the top movie box-office attractions in the world. She was adept in ballet, tap, ballroom, and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth&#x27;s dance talents. Columbia featured her in the Technicolor films &quot;Tonight and Every Night&quot; (1945) with Lee Bowman and &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (1947) with Larry Parks.

Her sexy, glamorous appeal was most noted in Charles Vidor&#x27;s film noir &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946) with Glenn Ford, which caused censors some consternation. The role, in which Hayworth wore black satin and performed a legendary one-glove striptease, &quot;Put The Blame On Mame&quot;, made her into a cultural icon as a &quot;femme fatale&quot;.

While &quot;Gilda&quot; was in release, it was widely reported that an atomic bomb that was scheduled to be tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: &quot;Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they&#x27;d put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry... She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn&#x27;t let her because it would be unpatriotic.&quot; Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn&#x27;s part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.

On the June 30, 1946, broadcast of &quot;Orson Welles Commentaries&quot;, Welles said of the imminent test, &quot;I want my daughter to be able to tell her daughter that grandmother&#x27;s picture was on the last atom bomb ever to explode.&quot;

The fourth atomic bomb ever to be detonated was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Above it was stenciled the device&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Gilda&quot; - the name of the film in which she was starring at the time - in two-inch black letters.

Hayworth&#x27;s performance in Welles&#x27; 1947 film &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; was critically acclaimed. The film&#x27;s failure at the box office was attributed in part to Hayworth&#x27;s famous red hair being cut short and bleached platinum blonde for the role. Cohn had not been consulted and was furious that Hayworth&#x27;s image was changed.

Also in 1947, Hayworth was featured in a &quot;Life&quot; cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed &quot;The Love Goddess&quot;. The term was adopted and used later as the title of a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, &quot;Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don&#x27;t. I never made nude movies. I didn&#x27;t have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed.&quot;

Her next film, &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1948) with Glenn Ford, was the first film co-produced by Columbia and Hayworth&#x27;s production company, The Beckworth Corporation (named for Rebecca, her daughter with Welles). It was Columbia&#x27;s biggest moneymaker that year. She received a percentage of the profits from this and all her subsequent films until 1954, when she dissolved Beckworth to pay off debts.

===The Hollywood princess===

In 1948, at the height of her fame, Hayworth traveled to Cannes and was introduced to Prince Aly Khan. They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.

Because Hayworth was already one of the best-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles during the early days of her courtship with the prince, Hayworth also received some negative backlash, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.

Though Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan&#x27;s flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.

In 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they divorced in 1953.

===Returning to Columbia===

After the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her &quot;comeback&quot; picture, &quot;Affair in Trinidad&quot; (1952) which again paired her with Glenn Ford. Director Vincent Sherman recalled that Hayworth seemed &quot;rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture&quot;. She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, &quot;Gilda&quot;.

She continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: &quot;Salome&quot; with Charles Laughton and Stewart Granger, and &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot; with José Ferrer and Aldo Ray. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer Dick Haymes. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal . By the time she returned to the screen for &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1957) with Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon, Kim Novak had become Columbia&#x27;s top female star. Her last musical was &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1957) with Frank Sinatra and Novak (Hayworth had top billing in both pictures but actually played a supporting role in &quot;Pal Joey&quot;). Hayworth then left Columbia for good.

She received good reviews for her performances in &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958), with Burt Lancaster and David Niven, &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; (1959) with Gary Cooper and &quot;The Story on Page One&quot; (1960). She was meant to be in &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; with Lancaster but both withdrew after the original play failed on Broadway. She continued working throughout the 1960s. In 1962, her planned Broadway debut in &quot;Step on a Crack&quot; was cancelled for undisclosed health reasons. In 1964 Circus World was released, in which John Wayne was her co-star and for which she received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress in a dramatic role. &quot;The Money Trap&quot; (1965) paired her, for the last time, with good friend Glenn Ford. She continued to act in films until the early 1970s. She made comedic television appearances on &quot;Laugh In&quot; and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in the 1970s. Her last film was &quot;The Wrath of God&quot; (1972), a western.

===Struggles with Columbia Pictures===
Hayworth had a strained relationship with Columbia Pictures for many years. In 1943, she was suspended without pay for nine weeks because she refused to appear in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. During this period in Hollywood, contract players could not choose their films; they were on salary rather than receiving a fixed amount per picture.

In 1947, Hayworth&#x27;s new contract with Columbia provided a salary of $250,000 plus 50% of films&#x27; profits. In 1951, Columbia alleged it had $800,000 invested in properties for her, including the film that she had walked out on that year. Hayworth left Hollywood to marry Prince Aly Khan and was suspended for failing to report to work on the film &quot;Affair in Trinidad&quot;. In 1952, Hayworth refused to report for work because she objected to the script. She said,

I was in Switzerland when they sent me the script for &quot;Affair in Trinidad&quot; and I threw it across the room. But I did the picture, and &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn &quot;owned&quot; me!&quot;

In 1955, she sued Columbia Pictures to be released from her contract, but asked for her $150,000 salary, alleging that the filming failed to start on &quot;Joseph and His Brethren&quot; (1961) when agreed. The film was later filmed in 1961 by a foreign company as &quot;The Story of Joseph and His Brethren&quot; (film). Cohn had a reputation as a taskmaster, but he had his own criticisms of Hayworth. He had invested heavily in her before she began an affair with the married Aly Khan, and it could have caused a backlash against her career and Columbia&#x27;s success. For instance, an article in the British periodical &quot;The People&quot; called for a boycott of Hayworth&#x27;s films:

Hollywood must be told its already tarnished reputation will sink to rock bottom if it restores this reckless woman to a place among its stars.&quot;

Cohn expressed his frustration in a 1957 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine:

Hayworth might be worth ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit and she had to get married and had to get out of the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn&#x27;t make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!&quot;

Years after her film career had ended and long after Cohn had died, Hayworth still resented her treatment by both him and Columbia. She spoke bluntly in a 1968 interview:

I used to have to punch a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That&#x27;s what it was like. I was under exclusive contract, like they owned me ... I think he had my dressing room bugged ... He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn&#x27;t want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him ... You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.

Later on, in 1972 she said :

Harry Cohn thought of me as one of the people he could exploit, and make a lot of money... And I did make a lot of money for him, but not much for me.

Hayworth resented the fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to encourage her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed to be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.

&quot;I wanted to study singing&quot;, Hayworth complained, &quot;but Harry Cohn kept saying, &#x27;Who needs it?&#x27; and the studio wouldn&#x27;t pay for it. They had me so intimidated that I couldn&#x27;t have done it anyway. They always said, &#x27;Oh, no, we can&#x27;t let you do it. There&#x27;s no time for that; it has to be done right now!&#x27; I was under contract, and that was it.&quot;

===Public image===
Hayworth was a top glamour girl in the 1940s, a pin-up girl for military servicemen and a beauty icon for women. At and , she was tall enough to be a concern for dancing partners such as Fred Astaire. She reportedly changed her hair color eight times in eight movies.

In 1949, Hayworth&#x27;s lips were voted best in the world by the Artists League of America. She had a modeling contract with Max Factor to promote its Tru-Color lipsticks and Pan-Stik make-up.

==Personal life==
===Marriages, relationships and family===

Hayworth confided to Orson Welles that her father began to sexually abuse her as a child when they were touring together as the Dancing Cansinos. Her biographer, Barbara Leaming, wrote that her mother may have been the only person to know; she slept in the same bed as her daughter to try to protect her. Leaming wrote that the abuse experienced by Hayworth as a young girl contributed to her difficulty in relationships as an adult.

In 1941, Hayworth said she was the antithesis of the characters she played: &quot;I naturally am very shy ... and I suffer from an inferiority complex.&quot; Her provocative role in &quot;Gilda&quot;, in particular, was responsible for people expecting her to be what she was not. Hayworth once said, with some bitterness, &quot;Men go to bed with Gilda, but wake up with me.&quot; She said, &quot;Basically, I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.&quot;

Hayworth&#x27;s two younger brothers, Eduardo Cansino Jr. and Vernon Cansino, both served in World War II. Vernon left the United States Army in 1946 with several medals, including the Purple Heart, and later married Susan Vail, a dancer. Eduardo Jr. followed Hayworth into acting; he was also under contract with Columbia Pictures. In 1950, he made his screen debut in &quot;The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd&quot;.

Hayworth married and divorced five times in twenty-four years. She had affairs with several of her leading men, most notably with Victor Mature in 1942, during the filming of &quot;My Gal Sal&quot;.

She had two daughters and two grandsons, one by each daughter. Her older daughter, Rebecca Welles, (1944-2004) had a son, Marc McKerrow, whom she gave birth to in 1966, and put up for adoption at birth. Marc had three children, and died at age 44 as a result of complications from a nocturnal seizure related to a serious car accident that he had when he was 21 years old. Marc is featured in the 2008 documentary &quot;Prodigal Sons&quot;. Hayworth&#x27;s younger daughter, Yasmin Aga Khan, had one son, Andrew Ali Aga Khan Embiricos, who died unmarried at age 25.

====Edward Charles Judson====

When Hayworth was 18, she married Edward C. Judson, an oilman turned promoter who was more than twice her age. They married in Las Vegas. Judson, who helped launch her acting career, was a shrewd businessman, but domineering. &quot;He helped me with my career&quot;, Hayworth conceded after they divorced, adding &quot;and helped himself to my money.&quot; She alleged that Judson compelled her to transfer a considerable amount of her property to him, and she promised to pay him $12,000 under threats that he would do her &quot;great bodily harm&quot;.

Hayworth filed for divorce from him on February 24, 1942, with a complaint of cruelty. She noted to the press that his work took him to Oklahoma and Texas while she lived and worked in Hollywood. Judson was as old as her father, who was enraged by the marriage, which caused a rift between Hayworth and her parents until the divorce. Judson had failed to tell Hayworth before they married that he had previously been married twice. When she left him, she had no money; she asked her friend Hermes Pan if she could eat at his home.

====Orson Welles====

Hayworth married Orson Welles on September 7, 1943, during the run of &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot;. None of her colleagues knew about the planned wedding (before a judge) until she announced it the day before. For the civil ceremony, she wore a beige suit, a ruffled white blouse, and a veil. A few hours after they got married, they returned to work at the studio. They had a daughter, Rebecca, who was born on December 17, 1944, and died at the age of 59 on October 17, 2004. They struggled in their marriage, with Hayworth saying that Welles did not want to be tied down:
During the entire period of our marriage, he showed no interest in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, he told me he didn&#x27;t want the responsibility. Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.

On November 10, 1947, she was granted a divorce that became final the following year. The divorce was civil and they remained friendly afterwards.

====Relationship with Glenn Ford====

Hayworth also had an intermittent, long-term relationship with Glenn Ford, which started during the filming of &quot;Gilda&quot; in 1945, and continued through each other&#x27;s numerous marriages. Their relationship is documented in the 2011 biography &quot;Glenn Ford: A Life&quot; by Ford&#x27;s son, Peter Ford. Peter revealed in his book that Hayworth became pregnant during the filming of &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; and traveled to France to get an abortion. Ford later moved next door to her in Beverly Hills in 1960, and they continued their relationship until the early 1980s.

====Prince Aly Khan====

In 1948, Hayworth left her film career to marry Prince Aly Khan, a son of Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III, the leader of the Ismaili community of Shia Islam. They were married on May 27, 1949. Her bridal trousseau was designed by Jacques Fath.

Aly Khan and his family were heavily involved in horse racing, owning and racing horses. Hayworth had no interest in the sport, but became a member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club anyway. Her filly, Double Rose, won several races in France and finished second in the 1949 Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

In 1951, while still married to Hayworth, Khan was spotted dancing with the actress Joan Fontaine in the nightclub where he and Hayworth had met. Hayworth threatened to divorce him in Reno, Nevada. In early May, Hayworth moved to Nevada to establish legal residence to qualify for a divorce. She stayed at Lake Tahoe with their daughter, saying there was a threat the child would be kidnapped. Hayworth filed for divorce from Khan on September 2, 1951, on the grounds of &quot;extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature&quot;.

Hayworth once said she might convert to Islam, but did not. During the custody fight over their daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, born , the prince said he wanted her to be raised as a Muslim; Hayworth wanted the child to be raised as a Christian. Hayworth rejected his offer of $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim from age seven and allow her to go to Europe to visit with him for two or three months each year, stating:
Nothing will make me give up Yasmin&#x27;s chance to live here in America among our precious freedoms and habits. While I respect the Moslem faith, and all other faiths, it is my earnest wish that my daughter be raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith. There isn&#x27;t any amount of money in the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child&#x27;s privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn&#x27;t anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that. And I&#x27;m going to give it to Yasmin regardless of what it costs.

In January 1953, Hayworth was granted a divorce from Aly Khan on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty. Her daughter Yasmin, only three years old, played about the court while the case was being heard, finally climbing on to the judge&#x27;s lap.

====Dick Haymes====

When Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he was still married and his singing career was waning. Haymes was desperate for money because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad that when he tried to return to California, he was arrested. 

On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Eddington got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in child support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes&#x27;s debts.

Haymes was born in Argentina and did not have solid proof of American citizenship. Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the Sands Hotel, Las Vegas, and their wedding procession went through the casino.

From the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply in debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in Philadelphia, audiences sharply declined. Haymes&#x27;s $5,000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes&#x27;s ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in Manhattan at the Hotel Madison while sheriff&#x27;s deputies waited outside, threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. 

At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in Westchester County. They were found and photographed by a reporter from &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine.

After a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.

Hayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support, which she claimed had never been paid. This effort was unsuccessful and added to her stress.

====James Hill====

Hayworth began a relationship with film producer James Hill, whom she went on to marry on February 2, 1958. He put her in one of her last major films, &quot;Separate Tables&quot;. This film was popular and highly praised, although &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; named her the worst actress of 1958 for her performance. On September 1, 1961, Hayworth filed for divorce, alleging extreme mental cruelty. Hill later wrote &quot;Rita Hayworth: A Memoir&quot;, in which he suggested that their marriage collapsed because he wanted Hayworth to continue making movies, while she wanted them both to retire from Hollywood.

In his autobiography, Charlton Heston wrote about Hayworth&#x27;s brief marriage to Hill. One night, Heston and his wife Lydia joined the couple for dinner at a restaurant in Spain with the director George Marshall and the actor Rex Harrison, Hayworth&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Happy Thieves&quot;. Heston wrote that the occasion &quot;turned into the single most embarrassing evening of my life&quot;, describing how Hill heaped &quot;obscene abuse&quot; on Hayworth until she was &quot;reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands&quot;. Heston wrote that the others sat stunned, witnesses to a &quot;marital massacre&quot;, and, though he was &quot;strongly tempted to slug him&quot; (Hill), he left with his wife Lydia after she stood up, almost in tears. Heston wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m ashamed of walking away from Miss Hayworth&#x27;s humiliation. I never saw her again.&quot;

===Health===
Orson Welles noted Hayworth&#x27;s problem with alcohol during their marriage, but he never believed that her problem was alcoholism. &quot;It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way&quot;, he recalled in 1983. &quot;She&#x27;d fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she&#x27;d get in a car and I&#x27;d have to get in the car and try to control her. She&#x27;d drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And I just saw this lovely girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much.&quot;

Yasmin Aga Khan spoke of her mother&#x27;s long struggle with alcohol:
I remember as a child that she had a drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with the ups and downs of the business ... As a child, I thought, &#x27;She has a drinking problem, and she&#x27;s an alcoholic.&#x27; That was very clear, and I thought, &#x27;Well, there&#x27;s not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.&#x27; It&#x27;s very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner ... Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.

In 1972, the 54-year-old Hayworth wanted to retire from acting, but she needed money. At the suggestion of Robert Mitchum, she agreed to film &quot;The Wrath of God&quot;. The experience exposed her poor health and her worsening mental state. Because she could not remember her lines, her scenes were shot one line at a time. In November, she agreed to complete one more movie, the British film &quot;Tales That Witness Madness&quot;, but because of her worsening health, she left the set and returned to the United States. She never returned to acting.

In March 1974, both of her brothers died within a week of each other, which caused her great sadness and led to heavy drinking. In January 1976, at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport, Hayworth was removed from a TWA flight after having an angry outburst while traveling with her agent. The event attracted much negative publicity; a photograph where she looked disheveled was published in newspapers the next day. Hayworth&#x27;s alcoholism hid symptoms of what was eventually understood to be Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Yasmin Aga Khan spoke of her mother&#x27;s disease:

It was the outbursts. She&#x27;d fly into a rage. I can&#x27;t tell you. I thought it was alcoholismalcoholic dementia. We all thought that. The papers picked that up, of course. You can&#x27;t imagine the relief just in getting a diagnosis. We had a name at last, Alzheimer&#x27;s! Of course, that didn&#x27;t really come until the last seven or eight years. She wasn&#x27;t diagnosed as having Alzheimer&#x27;s until 1980. There were two decades of hell before that.
Biographer Barbara Leaming wrote that Hayworth aged prematurely because of her addiction to alcohol and also because of the many stresses in her life. &quot;Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress&quot;, she wrote of Hayworth&#x27;s arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, her first film in three years. &quot;Deep lines had crept around her eyes and mouth, and she appeared worn, exhaustedolder than her thirty-eight years.&quot;

Alzheimer&#x27;s disease had been largely forgotten by the medical community since its discovery in 1906. Medical historian Barron H. Lerner wrote that when Hayworth&#x27;s diagnosis was made public in 1981, she became &quot;the first public face of Alzheimer&#x27;s, helping to ensure that future patients did not go undiagnosed ... Unbeknownst to her, Hayworth helped to destigmatize a condition that can still embarrass victims and their families.&quot;

In July 1981, Hayworth&#x27;s health had deteriorated to the point that a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that she should be placed under the care of her daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan of New York City. Hayworth lived in an apartment at The San Remo on Central Park West adjoining that of her daughter, who arranged for her mother&#x27;s care during her final years. When asked how her mother was doing, Yasmin replied, &quot;She&#x27;s still beautiful. But it&#x27;s a shell.&quot;

In 1983, Rebecca Welles arranged to see her mother for the first time in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit&#x27;s effect on his daughter. &quot;Rita barely knows me now,&quot; Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event that the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. &quot;When it was over, I came over to her table, and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn&#x27;t know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly.&quot;

In an interview that he gave the evening before his death in 1985, Welles called Hayworth &quot;one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived&quot;.

===Political views===
Hayworth was a lifelong Democrat who was an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was active in the campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election. In 1968, Hayworth was part of a Hollywood committee that endorsed Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===Religion===
Hayworth was a Catholic whose marriage to Prince Aly Khan was deemed illicit by Pope Pius XII.

===Death===

Hayworth lapsed into a semicoma in February 1987. She died at age 68, from complications associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, on May 14, 1987, at her home in Manhattan. President Ronald Reagan, who was one of Hayworth&#x27;s contemporaries in Hollywood (and who went on to also suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s in his final years), issued a statement:

Rita Hayworth was one of our country&#x27;s most beloved stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita&#x27;s death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.

A funeral service was held on May 18, 1987, at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Pallbearers included actors Ricardo Montalbán, Glenn Ford, Cesar Romero, Anthony Franciosa, choreographer Hermes Pan, and a family friend, Phillip Luchenbill. She was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her headstone includes Yasmin&#x27;s sentiment: &quot;To yesterday&#x27;s companionship and tomorrow&#x27;s reunion.&quot;

==Filmography==
==Accolades==

Hayworth received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance in &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964).

In 1978, at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D. C., Hayworth was presented with the inaugural National Screen Heritage Award of the National Film Society, a group that published &quot;American Classic Screen&quot; magazine (1976–1984).

In 1999, Hayworth was acknowledged as one of the top-25 greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood cinema in the American Film Institute&#x27;s survey, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Stars.

==Legacy==
The public disclosure and discussion of Hayworth&#x27;s illness drew international attention to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which was little known at the time, and it helped to greatly increase federal funding for Alzheimer&#x27;s research.

The Rita Hayworth Gala, a benefit for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, is held annually in Chicago and New York City. The program was founded in 1985 by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, in honor of her mother. She is the hostess for the events and is a major sponsor of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease charities and awareness programs. , a total of more than $72 million had been raised through events in Chicago, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida.

On October 17, 2016, a press release from the Springer Associates Public Relations Agency announced that Rita Hayworth&#x27;s former manager and friend, Budd Burton Moss, initiated a campaign to solicit the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp featuring Hayworth. Springer Associates also announced that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would be lobbied in hopes of having an honorary Academy Award issued in memory of Hayworth. The press release added that Hayworth&#x27;s daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association of Greater Los Angeles, and numerous prominent personalities of stage and screen were supporting the Moss campaign. The press release stated the target date for fulfillment of the stamp and Academy Award to be on October 17, 2018, the centennial of Hayworth&#x27;s birth.

== Cultural references ==

The film &quot;I Remember Better When I Paint&quot; (2009) describes how Hayworth took up painting while struggling with Alzheimer&#x27;s. In 1983, Lynda Carter, who was of a similar Irish and Hispanic ancestry, played and danced as Hayworth in a TV biopic &quot;Rita Hayworth: The Love Goddess&quot;.

In the &quot;Baptiste&quot; episode &quot;Shell&quot;, Baptiste talks to Kim about Hayworth in an attempt to gain information from her about Natalie after noticing that she has several DVDs of Hayworth&#x27;s films; the Dream Room has a poster of &quot;Gilda&quot;.

Hayworth&#x27;s name can be heard in the Madonna hit from 1990, &quot;Vogue&quot;, (&quot;Rita Hayworth gave good face&quot;) among other artists from classical Hollywood cinema. Her name is also mentioned in Tom Waits&#x27;s song &quot;Invitation to the Blues&quot;, from his 1976 album &quot;Small Change&quot;.

In the Sicilian scenes of the film &quot;The Godfather&quot;, the bodyguard of Michael Corleone is heard shouting the name &quot;Rita Hayworth&quot; to GI&#x27;s passing by in jeeps.

Hayworth is the main topic of the song, &quot;Take, Take, Take&quot; by the White Stripes and also referenced in &quot;White Moon&quot;; both from their &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; album, released in 2005. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jack White said, &quot;Rita Hayworth became an all-encompassing metaphor for everything I was thinking about while making the album.&quot;

The film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was adapted from a Stephen King novella, &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot;, from his 1982 collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;. A succession of posters, starting with one of Rita Hayworth, hides a hole in a jail cell wall in the novella. In the film, a poster of Rita Hayworth was used for the first third of the film, then changed to a poster of Marilyn Monroe for the middle third, then Raquel Welch for the last third. The film also includes a scene where the prison movie night shows Rita Hayworth&#x27;s film &quot;Gilda.&quot;

In the film &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, an amnesiac character who cannot remember her real name gives herself the name Rita. She sees the name on a poster for Hayworth’s film &quot;Gilda&quot; that hangs in the room where she’s standing at the time she’s first asked her name.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to neuroscience:

[[Neuroscience]] is the scientific study of the structure and function of the nervous system. It encompasses the branch of biology that deals with the anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology of neurons and neural circuits. It also encompasses cognition, and human behavior. Neuroscience has multiple concepts that each relate to learning abilities and memory functions. Additionally, the brain is able to transmit signals that cause conscious/unconscious behaviors that are responses verbal or non-verbal. This allows people to communicate with one another.

==Branches of neuroscience==

===Neurophysiology===
Neurophysiology is the study of the function (as opposed to structure) of the nervous system.

* Brain mapping
* Electrophysiology
* Extracellular recording
* Intracellular recording
* Brain stimulation
* Electroencephalography
** Intermittent rhythmic delta activity
* :Category: Neurophysiology
* :Category: Neuroendocrinology
* :Neuroendocrinology

===Neuroanatomy===
Neuroanatomy is the study of the anatomy of nervous tissue and neural structures of the nervous system.

* Immunostaining
* :Category: Neuroanatomy

===Neuropharmacology===
Neuropharmacology is the study of how drugs affect cellular function in the nervous system.

* Drug
* Psychoactive drug
* Anaesthetic
* Narcotic

===Behavioral neuroscience===
Behavioral neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, biopsychology, or psychobiology, is the application of the principles of biology to the study of mental processes and behavior in human and non-human animals.

* Neuroethology

===Developmental neuroscience===
Developmental neuroscience aims to describe the cellular basis of brain development and to address the underlying mechanisms. The field draws on both neuroscience and developmental biology to provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex nervous systems develop.

* Human brain development timeline 
* Development of the nervous system in humans 
* Prenatal development - Cognitive development
* Aging and memory

(&quot;see also Child development - Mechanisms&quot;)

===Cognitive neuroscience===
Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with the scientific study of biological substrates underlying cognition, with a focus on the neural substrates of mental processes.

* Neurolinguistics
* Neuroimaging
* Functional magnetic resonance imaging
* Positron emission tomography
===Systems neuroscience===
Systems neuroscience is a subdiscipline of neuroscience which studies the function of neural circuits and systems. It is an umbrella term, encompassing a number of areas of study concerned with how nerve cells behave when connected together to form neural networks.

* Neural circuit
* Neural network (biology)
* Neural oscillation

===Molecular neuroscience===
Molecular neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that examines the biology of the nervous system with molecular biology, molecular genetics, protein chemistry and related methodologies (&quot;ie. concerning neurotransmitters moving via physiology of synapses etc&quot;)

* Neurochemistry 
* Nutritional neuroscience
* Neuropeptide

[ also see Neuropharmacology above]

===Computational neuroscience===
Computational neuroscience includes both the study of the information processing functions of the nervous system, and the use of digital computers to study the nervous system. It is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology, electrical engineering, computer science, physics and mathematics.

* Neural network
* Neuroinformatic
* Neuroengineering
* Brain–computer interface
* Mathematical neuroscience

===Neurophilosophy===
Neurophilosophy or &quot;philosophy of neuroscience&quot; is the interdisciplinary study of neuroscience and philosophy. Work in this field is often separated into two distinct approaches. The first approach attempts to solve problems in philosophy of mind with empirical information from the neurosciences. The second approach attempts to clarify neuroscientific results using the conceptual rigor and methods of philosophy of science.

* Philosophy of mind
* Neuroethics
* Neuroscience of free will

===Neurology===
Neurology is the medical specialty dealing with disorders of the nervous system. It deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of disease involving the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems.

* Stroke
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
* Huntington&#x27;s disease
* Multiple sclerosis
* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
* Rabies
* Schizophrenia
* Epilepsy
* Hydrocephalus
** Brain damage
* Traumatic brain injury
* Closed head injury
* Coma
* Paralysis
* Level of consciousness
* Neurosurgery

===Neuropsychology===
Neuropsychology studies the structure and function of the brain related to psychological processes and behaviors. The term is used most frequently with reference to studies of the effects of brain damage in humans and animals.

* Agraphia
* Agnosia
* Alexia
* Amnesia
* Anosognosia
* Aphasia 
* Apraxia
* Dementia
* Dyslexia
* Hemispatial neglect
* Neurobiological effects of physical exercise

<text>Elohim (: ), the plural of (), is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;godhood&quot;. Although the word is grammatically plural, in the Hebrew Bible it most often takes singular verbal or pronominal agreement and refers to a single deity, particularly the God of Israel. In other verses it refers to the singular gods of other nations or to deities in the plural.

Morphologically, the word is the plural form of the word () and related to &quot;el&quot;. It is cognate to the word &quot;″l-h-m&quot; which is found in Ugaritic, where it is used as the pantheon for Canaanite gods, the children of El, and conventionally vocalized as &quot;Elohim&quot;. Most uses of the term &quot;Elohim&quot; in the later Hebrew text imply a view that is at least monolatrist at the time of writing, and such usage (in the singular), as a proper title for Deity, is distinct from generic usage as &quot;elohim&quot;, &quot;gods&quot; (plural, simple noun).

Rabbinic scholar Maimonides wrote that &quot;Elohim&quot; &quot;Divinity&quot; and &quot;elohim&quot; &quot;gods&quot; are commonly understood to be homonyms. 
One modern theory suggests that the notion of divinity underwent radical changes in the early period of Israelite identity and development of Ancient Hebrew religion. In this view, the ambiguity of the term &quot;elohim&quot; is the result of such changes, cast in terms of &quot;vertical translatability&quot;, i.e. the re-interpretation of the gods of the earliest recalled period as the national god of monolatrism as it emerged in the 7th to 6th century BCE in the Kingdom of Judah and during the Babylonian captivity, and further in terms of monotheism by the emergence of Rabbinical Judaism in the 2nd century CE.
Another theory, building on an idea by Gesenius, argues that even before Hebrew became a distinct language, the plural &quot;elohim&quot; had both a plural meaning of &quot;gods&quot; and an abstract meaning of &quot;godhood&quot; or &quot;divinity&quot;, much as the plural of &quot;father&quot;, &quot;avot&quot;, can mean either &quot;fathers&quot; or &quot;fatherhood&quot;. &quot;Elohim&quot; then came to be used so frequently in reference to specific deities, both male and female, domestic and foreign (for instance, the goddess of the Sidonians in 1 Kings 11:33), that it came to be concretized from meaning &quot;divinity&quot; to meaning &quot;deity&quot;, though still occasionally used adjectivally as &quot;divine&quot;.

==Grammar and etymology==

The word &quot;elohim&quot; or&quot; &#x27;elohiym&quot; (&quot;ʼĕlôhîym&quot;) is a grammatically plural noun for &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;deities&quot; or various other words in Biblical Hebrew.

In Hebrew, the ending &quot;-im&quot; normally indicates a masculine plural. However, when referring to the Jewish God, &quot;Elohim&quot; is usually understood to be grammatically singular (i.e., it governs a singular verb or adjective). In Modern Hebrew, it is often referred to in the singular despite the &quot;-im&quot; ending that denotes plural masculine nouns in Hebrew.

It is generally thought that &quot;Elohim&quot; is derived from &quot;eloah&quot;, the latter being an expanded form of the Northwest Semitic noun &quot;&#x27;il&quot;. The related nouns &quot;eloah&quot; () and &quot;el&quot; () are used as proper names or as generics, in which case they are interchangeable with &quot;elohim&quot;. The term contains an added &quot;heh&quot; as third radical to the biconsonantal root. Discussions of the etymology of &quot;elohim&quot; essentially concern this expansion. An exact cognate outside of Hebrew is found in Ugaritic &quot;ʾlhm&quot;, the family of El, the creator god and chief deity of the Canaanite pantheon, in Biblical Aramaic &quot;ʼĔlāhā&quot; and later Syriac &quot;Alaha&quot; (&quot;God&quot;), and in Arabic &quot;ʾilāh&quot; (&quot;god, deity&quot;) (or &quot;Allah&quot; as &quot;The [single] God&quot;). &quot;El&quot; (the basis for the extended root &quot;ʾlh&quot;) is usually derived from a root meaning &quot;to be strong&quot; and/or &quot;to be in front&quot;.

==Canaanite religion==
The word &quot;el&quot; (singular) is a standard term for &quot;god&quot; in Aramaic, paleo-Hebrew, and other related Semitic languages including Ugaritic. The Canaanite pantheon of gods was known as &quot;&#x27;ilhm&quot;, the Ugaritic equivalent to &quot;elohim&quot;. For instance, the Ugaritic Baal Cycle mentions &quot;seventy sons of Asherah&quot;. Each &quot;son of god&quot; was held to be the originating deity for a particular people (KTU 2 1.4.VI.46).

==Usage==
&quot;Elohim&quot; occurs frequently throughout the Torah. In some cases (e.g., , &quot;&quot;Elohim&quot; called unto him out of the midst of the bush ...&quot;), it behaves like a singular noun in Hebrew grammar and is then generally understood to denote the single God of Israel. In other cases, &quot;elohim&quot; acts as an ordinary plural of the word &quot;eloah&quot; and refers to the polytheistic notion of multiple gods (for example, , &quot;You shall have no other gods before me&quot;).

The word &quot;Elohim&quot; occurs more than 2500 times in the Hebrew Bible, with meanings ranging from &quot;gods&quot; in a general sense (as in , where it describes &quot;the gods of Egypt&quot;), to specific gods (the frequent references to Yahweh as the &quot;elohim&quot; of Israel), to seraphim, and other supernatural beings, to the spirits of the dead brought up at the behest of King Saul in , and even to kings and prophets (e.g., ). The phrase &quot;bene elohim&quot;, translated &quot;sons of the Gods&quot;, has an exact parallel in Ugaritic and Phoenician texts, referring to the council of the gods.

Elohim occupy the seventh rank of ten in the medieval rabbinic scholar Maimonides&#x27; Jewish angelic hierarchy. Maimonides wrote: &quot;I must premise that every Hebrew [now] knows that the term Elohim is a homonym, and denotes God, angels, judges, and the rulers of countries ...&quot;

===With plural verb===
In the Hebrew Bible, , &quot;elohim&quot; is used with a plural verb. The witch of Endor tells Saul that she saw &quot;elohim&quot; ascending (&quot;olim&quot; , plural verb) out of the earth when she summoned the spirit of the Prophet Samuel at Saul&#x27;s request. The word &quot;elohim&quot;, in this context, can refer to spirits as well as deities. Some traditional Jewish sources say that the spirits of deceased human beings are being referred to. The Babylonian Talmud states: &quot;&quot;olim&quot; indicates that there were two of them. One of them was Samuel, but the other, who was he? – Samuel went and brought Moses with him.&quot; Rashi gives this interpretation in his commentary on the verse. Regarding this, Sforno states that &quot;every disembodied creature is known as elohim; this includes the soul of human beings known as [the] &#x27;Image of God&#x27;.&quot;

In , Abraham, before the polytheistic Philistine king Abimelech, says that &quot;Elohim (translated as &#x27;God&#x27;) caused (, plural verb) me to wander&quot;. Whereas the Greek Septuagint (LXX) has a singular verb form (ἐξήγαγε(ν), aorist II), most English versions usually translate this as &quot;God caused&quot; (which does not distinguish between a singular and plural verb). Regarding this, the Jerusalem Talmud states: &quot;All Names written regarding our father Abraham are holy [i.e., referring to the one God] except one which is profane, &quot;it was when the gods made me err from my father&#x27;s house.&quot; But some say this one also is holy, [i.e.,] &#x27;were it not for God, they [humans] already would have made me err&#x27;.&quot; The same disagreement appears in Tractate Soferim, where Haninah ben Ahi R. Joshua maintained that the word is &quot;holy&quot;. An alternative view (held by Onkelos, Bahya ben Asher, Jacob ben Asher, Sforno, and Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg) is that the word means &quot;gods&quot; and the verse means that Abraham&#x27;s distaste for the idolatry of his father Terah led him to decide to wander far from home. Others, such as Chizkuni, interpret &quot;elohim&quot; as a reference to wicked rulers like Amraphel (often equated with Nimrod).

In , Jacob builds an altar at El-Bethel &quot;because there &quot;elohim&quot; revealed himself [plural verb] to [Jacob]&quot;. The verb &quot;niglu&quot; (&quot;revealed himself&quot;) is plural, even though one would expect the singular. This is one of several instances where the Bible uses plural verbs with the name &quot;elohim&quot;. Some Jewish sources (e.g., Targum Jonathan, Ibn Ezra, add Chizkuni), seeking to explain the plural language of Genesis 35:7, translate &quot;elohim&quot; here as &quot;angels&quot;, noting that in the story being referenced Jacob experiences a vision of &quot;malakhei elohim&quot; (angels of God) ascending and descending the ladder. Radak agrees that this is a reference to angels but also presents the alternative view that the plural form in the verse is a majestic plural, as seen in other verses such as and . &quot;Elohim&quot; can be seen used in reference to the angels in a variety of other cases, such as in and .

===With singular verb===
&quot;Elohim&quot;, when meaning the God of Israel, is mostly grammatically singular, and is commonly translated as &quot;God&quot;, and capitalised. For example, in , it is written: &quot;Then Elohim (translated as God) said (singular verb), &#x27;Let us (plural) make (plural verb) man in our (plural) image, after our (plural) likeness. In the traditional Jewish understanding of the verse, the plural refers to God taking council with His angels (who He had created by this point) before creating Adam. It should also be noted that in the following verse of Genesis 1:27: &quot;So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them&quot;; the singular verb בָּרָא (bārāʾ), meaning &quot;He created&quot; is used as it is elsewhere in all the acts of creation featured in Genesis. This shows us that the actual creation of man (and everything else) in Genesis was a singular act by God alone.

Wilhelm Gesenius and other Hebrew grammarians traditionally described this as the (plural of excellence), which is similar to the (plural of majesty, or &quot;Royal we&quot;).
Gesenius comments that the singular Hebrew term &quot;Elohim&quot; is to be distinguished from &quot;elohim&quot; used to refer to plural gods, and remarks that:

There are a number of notable exceptions to the rule that &quot;Elohim&quot; is treated as singular when referring to the God of Israel, including , , and , and notably the epithet of the &quot;Living God&quot; ( etc.), which is constructed with the plural adjective, &quot;Elohim ḥayyim&quot; () but still takes singular verbs. The treatment of &quot;Elohim&quot; as both singular and plural is, according to Mark Sameth, consistent with a theory put forth by Guillaume Postel (16th century) and (19th century) that the God of Israel was understood by the ancient priests to be a singular, dual-gendered deity.

In the Septuagint and New Testament translations, &quot;Elohim&quot; has the singular even in these cases, and modern translations follow suit in giving &quot;God&quot; in the singular. The Samaritan Torah has edited out some of these exceptions.

===Angels and judges===

In a few cases in the Greek Septuagint (LXX), Hebrew &quot;elohim&quot; with a plural verb, or with implied plural context, was rendered either &quot;angeloi&quot; (&quot;angels&quot;) or (&quot;the judgement of God&quot;). These passages then entered first the Latin Vulgate, then the English King James Version (KJV) as &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;judges&quot;, respectively. From this came the result that James Strong, for example, listed &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;judges&quot; as possible meanings for &quot;elohim&quot; with a plural verb in his &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot;, and the same is true of many other 17th–20th century reference works. Both Gesenius&#x27; Hebrew Lexicon and the Brown–Driver–Briggs Lexicon list both &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;judges&quot; as possible alternative meanings of &quot;elohim&quot; with plural verbs and adjectives.

Gesenius and Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg have questioned the reliability of the Septuagint translation in this matter. Gesenius lists the meaning without agreeing with it. Hengstenberg stated that the Hebrew Bible text never uses &quot;elohim&quot; to refer to &quot;angels&quot;, but that the Septuagint translators refused the references to &quot;gods&quot; in the verses they amended to &quot;angels&quot;.

The Greek New Testament (NT) quotes in Hebrews 2:6b-8a, where the Greek NT has () in vs. 7, quoting (8:6 in the LXX), which also has in a version of the Greek Septuagint. In the KJV, &quot;elohim&quot; (Strong&#x27;s number H430) is translated as &quot;angels&quot; only in Psalm 8:5.

The KJV translates &quot;elohim&quot; as &quot;judges&quot; in ; Exodus 22:8; twice in Exodus 22:9 as &quot;judge&quot; in 1 Samuel 2:25, and as &quot;gods&quot; in Exodus 22:28, Psalm 82:1, Psalm 82:6, Psalm 95:3, Psalm 96:4, Psalm 97:9, and Psalm 138:1.

Angels cited in the Hebrew Bible and external literature often contain the related noun &quot;ʾĒl&quot; () in their theophoric names such as Michael and Gabriel.

===Other plural-singulars in biblical Hebrew===
The Hebrew language has several nouns with &quot;-im&quot; (masculine plural) and &quot;-oth&quot; (feminine plural) endings which nevertheless take singular verbs, adjectives and pronouns. For example, &quot;Baalim&quot;, &quot;Adonim&quot;, &quot;Behemoth&quot;. This form is known as the &quot;honorific plural&quot;, in which the pluralization is a sign of power or honor. A very common singular Hebrew word with plural ending is the word &quot;achoth&quot;, meaning sister, with the irregular plural form achioth.

Alternatively, there are several other frequently used words in the Hebrew language that contain a masculine plural ending but also maintain this form in singular concept. The major examples are: Sky/Heavens ( ), Face ( ), Life ( - ), Water ( ). Of these four nouns, three appear in the first sentence of Genesis (along with &quot;elohim&quot;). Three of them also appear in the first sentence of the Eden creation story (also along with &quot;elohim&quot;). Instead of &quot;honorific plural&quot; these other plural nouns terms represent something which is constantly changing. Water, sky, face, life are &quot;things which are never bound to one form&quot;.

===The Divine Council===


Marti Steussy, in &quot;Chalice Introduction to the Old Testament&quot;, discusses: &quot;The first verse of Psalm 82: &#x27;Elohim has taken his place in the divine council.&#x27; Here elohim has a singular verb and clearly refers to God. But in verse 6 of the Psalm, God says to the other members of the council, &#x27;You [plural] are elohim.&#x27; Here &quot;elohim&quot; has to mean gods.&quot;

Mark Smith, referring to this same Psalm, states in &quot;God in Translation&quot;: &quot;This psalm presents a scene of the gods meeting together in divine council ... Elohim stands in the council of El. Among the elohim he pronounces judgment: ...&quot;

In &quot;Hulsean Lectures for...&quot;, H. M. Stephenson discussed Jesus&#x27; argument in concerning . (In answer to the charge of blasphemy Jesus replied:) &quot;Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?&quot; – &quot;Now what is the force of this quotation &#x27;I said ye are gods.&#x27; It is from the Asaph Psalm which begins &#x27;Elohim hath taken His place in the mighty assembly. In the midst of the Elohim He is judging.

===Sons of God===
The Hebrew word for &quot;son&quot; is &quot;ben&quot;; plural is &quot;bānim&quot; (with the construct state form being &quot;benei&quot;). The Hebrew term &quot;benei elohim&quot; (&quot;sons of God&quot; or &quot;sons of the gods&quot;) in compares to the use of &quot;sons of gods&quot; (Ugaritic: &quot;b&#x27;n il&quot;) sons of El in Ugaritic mythology. Karel van der Toorn states that gods can be referred to collectively as &quot;bene elim&quot;, &quot;bene elyon&quot;, or &quot;bene elohim&quot;.

==Elohist==

The Hebrew Bible uses various names for the God of Israel. According to the documentary hypothesis, these variations are the products of different source texts and narratives that constitute the composition of the Torah: &quot;Elohim&quot; is the name of God used in the Elohist (E) and Priestly (P) sources, while &quot;Yahweh&quot; is the name of God used in the Jahwist (J) source. Form criticism postulates the differences of names may be the result of geographical origins; the P and E sources coming from the North and J from the South. There may be a theological point, that God did not reveal his name, &quot;Yahweh&quot;, before the time of Moses, though Hans Heinrich Schmid showed that the Jahwist was aware of the prophetic books from the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.

The Jahwist source presents Yahweh anthropomorphically: for example, walking through the Garden of Eden looking for Adam and Eve. The Elohist source often presents Elohim as more distant and frequently involves angels, as in the Elohist version of the tale of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, in which there is a ladder to the clouds, with angels climbing up and down, with Elohim at the top. In the Jahwist version of the tale, Yahweh is simply stationed in the sky, above the clouds without the ladder or angels. Likewise, the Elohist source describes Jacob wrestling with an angel.

The classical documentary hypothesis, first developed in the late 19th century among biblical scholars and textual critics, holds that the Jahwist portions of the Torah were composed in the 10th-9th century BCE and the Elohist portions in the 9th-8th century BCE, i.e. during the early period of the Kingdom of Judah. This, however, is not universally accepted as later literary scholarship seems to show evidence of a later &quot;Elohist redaction&quot; (post-exilic) during the 5th century BCE which sometimes makes it difficult to determine whether a given passage is &quot;Elohist&quot; in origin, or the result of a later editor.

== Latter Day Saint movement==

In the Latter Day Saint movement and Mormonism, &quot;Elohim&quot; refers to God the Father. Elohim is the father of Jesus in both the physical and the spiritual realms, whose name before birth is said to be Jehovah.

In the belief system held by the Christian churches that adhere to the Latter Day Saint movement and most Mormon denominations, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the term &quot;God&quot; refers to Elohim (the Eternal Father), whereas &quot;Godhead&quot; means a council of three distinct gods: Elohim (God the Father), Jehovah (the Son of God, Jesus Christ), and the Holy Ghost, in a non-trinitarian conception of the Godhead. In Mormonism, the three persons are considered to be physically separate beings, or personages, but united in will and purpose; this conception differs significantly from mainline Christian trinitarianism. As such, the term &quot;Godhead&quot; differs from how it is used in mainstream Christianity. This description of God represents the orthodoxy of the LDS Church, established early in the 19th century.

The Book of Abraham, a sacred text accepted by some branches of the Latter Day Saint movement, contains a paraphrase of the first chapter of Genesis which explicitly translates &quot;Elohim&quot; as &quot;the Gods&quot; multiple times; this is suggested by Mormon apostle James E. Talmage to indicate a &quot;plurality of excellence or intensity, rather than distinctively of number,&quot; in contrast to his contemporary apostle Orson F. Whitney&#x27;s explanation that, while to &quot;the modern Jew [Elohim] means the plural of majesty, not of number...to the Latter-day Saint it signifies both.&quot;

==Raëlism==
The new religious movement and UFO religion International Raëlian Movement, founded by the French journalist Claude Vorilhon (who later became known as &quot;Raël&quot;) in 1974, claims that the Hebrew word &quot;Elohim&quot; from the Book of Genesis actually means “those who came from the sky” and refers to a species of extraterrestrial aliens.

==Gnosticism==
In the Gnostic text known as the Secret Book of John, Elohim is another name for Abel, whose parents are Eve and Yaldabaoth. He rules over the elements of water and earth, alongside Cain, who is seen as Yahweh ruling over the elements of fire and wind. However, the 2nd century Gnostic teacher Justin proposed a cosmological model with three original divinities. The first is a transcendental being called the Good, the second is Elohim, appearing here as an intermediate male figure, and the third is an Earth-mother called Eden. The world along with the first humans are created from the love between Elohim and Eden, but when Elohim learns about the existence of the Good above him and ascends trying to reach it, he causes evil to enter the universe.

<doc id="277978" wikidata="Q4384332" url="?curid=277978" title="Ethnic joke">
<text>An ethnic joke is a remark aiming at humor relating to an ethnic, racial or cultural group, often referring to an ethnic stereotype of the group in question for its punchline.

Perceptions of ethnic jokes are ambivalent. Christie Davies gives examples that, while many find them racist and offensive, for some people jokes poking fun at one&#x27;s own ethnicity may be considered acceptable. He points out that ethnic jokes are often found funny exactly for the same reason they sound racist for others; it happens when they play on negative ethnic stereotypes. Davies maintains that ethnic jokes reinforce ethnic stereotypes and sometimes lead to calls for violence. The perceived damage to the ethnic group can be of great concern as when the ethnic Polish jokes became so common in the 1970s, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs approached the U.S. State Department to complain.

==Academic theories of ethnic humor==
The predominant and most widely known theory of ethnic humor attempts to discover social regularities in the anecdote traditions of different countries by contextually describing jokes. Christie Davies, author of this theory, has posed the main arguments in his article &quot;Ethnic Jokes, Moral Values and Social Boundaries&quot;, published in 1982. His approach is based on Victor Raskin&#x27;s (1985) &quot;Semantic Script Theory of Humor&quot;, or to be more precise, on the arguments connected with ethnic humor on binary oppositions. While Raskin merely describes the main binary oppositions providing examples (mostly from Jewish humor), Davies explores the situations where the scripts apply; for example, he has discovered that the most common opposition, stupid/clever, is applied under particular circumstances in the social reality of two ethnic groups concerned.

Davies in his monograph published in 1990 has surmised that &quot;Jokes in every country (or reasonably homogeneous cultural and linguistic domain) have certain targets for stupidity jokespeople who dwell on the edge of that nation or domain and who are perceived as culturally ambiguous by the dominant people of the center. In addition, they will likely be rustic people or immigrants in search of unskilled and low-prestige manual work. They are to a great extent similar to the joke-tellers themselves, share the same cultural background or even speak a similar or identical language.&quot; According to Davies, ethnic jokes are centered on the three main themes of stupidity, canniness and sexual behavior.

Davies is featured in the 2010 documentary film, &quot;Polack&quot;, exploring the source of the Polish joke.

L Perry Curtis, in examining ethnic humour aimed at the Irish in Victorian England, describes the descent that the ethnic joke and the accompanying stereotype can undergo as the target that they are aimed at descends into depictions of violent behaviour: &quot;My curiosity of &#x27;Paddy&#x27;s&#x27; transformation in comic art from a rather primitive, rustic, or simple-minded peasant to a degenerate man... bent on murder or outrage.&quot;

According to Samuel Schmidt, ethnic jokes can also be a form of social resistance, and so they are addressed by the joke-tellers against those whom they see as the aggressors, like the multiple jokes published in Mexico about Americans (also called gringos there).

<doc id="277980" wikidata="Q114218" url="?curid=277980" title="Man o' War">
<text>Man o&#x27; War (March 29, 1917 – November 1, 1947) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who is widely regarded as one of the greatest racehorses of all time. Several sports publications, including &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and the Associated Press, voted Man o&#x27; War as the best American racehorse of the 20th century. During his racing career, just after World War I, Man o&#x27; War won 20 of 21 races and $249,465 () in purses. He was the unofficial 1920 American horse of the year and was honored with Babe Ruth as the outstanding athlete of the year by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957. On March 29, 2017, the museum opened a special exhibit in his honor, &quot;Man o&#x27; War at 100&quot;.

In 1919, Man o&#x27; War won 9 of 10 starts, including the Hopeful Stakes and Belmont Futurity, then the most important races for two-year-old horses in the United States. His only loss came at Saratoga Race Course, later nicknamed the Graveyard of Champions, where he lost by a neck to a colt fittingly named Upset.

Man o&#x27; War was not entered in the 1920 Kentucky Derby because his owner, Samuel Riddle, did not believe in racing at the distance of so early in a young horse&#x27;s career. Instead, Man o&#x27; War made his three-year-old debut in the Preakness Stakes where he defeated Upset by lengths. Man o&#x27; War later won the Belmont Stakes by 20 lengths while setting a world record. Throughout the summer and fall, he continued to dominate his fellow three-year-olds, setting multiple records while conceding large amounts of weight to his rivals. The only time he faced older horses was in the final race of his career in a match race against Sir Barton, who had won what would later be known as the American Triple Crown in 1919. Man o&#x27; War won easily by seven lengths in the first horserace to be filmed in its entirety.

Riddle originally intended to race Man o&#x27; War in 1921 but decided against it because Man o&#x27; War would have been assigned record weights in the handicap format used in almost all races for older horses at the time. Instead, Man o&#x27; War was retired to stud, where he became a leading sire whose multiple champions included Triple Crown winner War Admiral. He was the grandsire of Seabiscuit and his sire line continues today through horses such as In Reality, Tiznow, Da&#x27; Tara and Tourist. Also successful as a broodmare sire, Man o&#x27; War is found in almost all modern American pedigrees.

==Background==
Man o&#x27; War was a chestnut horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead. He was foaled at Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. He was bred by August Belmont Jr., whose father&#x27;s accomplishments were recognized through the naming of the Belmont Stakes in 1867. Belmont Jr. was an equally notable horseman who served as the chairman of The Jockey Club from 1895 until his death in 1924. Belmont Park was named in the family&#x27;s honor when it opened in 1905.
Man o&#x27; War was sired by Fair Play, a multiple stakes winner who finished second in the 1908 Belmont Stakes to the undefeated Colin. Man o&#x27; War was the second foal out of Mahubah, a lightly raced mare by English Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand. Not long after the colt was foaled on March 29, 1917, Belmont Jr. joined the United States Army at age 65 to serve in France during World War I. While he was overseas, his wife named the foal &quot;Man o&#x27; War&quot; in honor of her husband. Originally, the Belmonts intended to race Man o&#x27; War themselves. However, in the summer of 1918 with the ongoing war effort, they decided to liquidate their racing stable. At the Saratoga yearling sale, Man o&#x27; War was sold at a final bid of $5,000 () to Samuel D. Riddle, who brought him to his Glen Riddle Farm near Berlin, Maryland. The underbidder at the auction was Robert L. Gerry, Sr., who is reported to have said to his wife, &quot;Forty-five hundred is enough to spend for any yearling.&quot; Two years later in 1920, Riddle declined an offer of $400,000 for the horse.

At maturity, Man o&#x27; War stood , with prominent withers and a high croup, but was sometimes faulted for a dipped back that grew more pronounced with age. He had virtually flawless legs and solid bone, traits he passed on to his offspring. He had a slightly Roman nose and notably high head carriage. His nickname was &quot;Big Red&quot;, though his coat had tinges of yellow and gold. An energetic, spirited horse, he is often pictured standing very still and gazing off into the distance, described as the &quot;look of eagles&quot;. His stride was measured at 28 feet and, to this day, is believed to still be the longest of all time.

==Racing career==

Man o&#x27; War was the odds-on favorite in every start of his career and justified that faith even in his sole defeat. He typically won in front-running fashion and was only closely pushed in two of his starts. He won the Belmont Stakes by twenty lengths and the Lawrence Realization by a hundred lengths. He set record times in both of those races plus many more at distances ranging from . In many of his starts, he won under heavy restraint and often conceded his rivals large amounts of weight. He retired as the then-leading money-earner in American history.

Developing this talent was not easy for trainer Louis Feustel due to Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s occasionally wild temperament. In his early days, Man o&#x27; War would routinely dump his exercise riders, once getting free for over 15 minutes after a morning workout. &quot;He fought like a tiger,&quot; Riddle later recalled. &quot;He screamed with rage and fought us so hard that it took several days before he could be handled with safety.&quot; Feustel brought the colt along slowly and gradually settled him into a regular routine. Man o&#x27; War developed a strong bond with his groom Frank Loftus, who taught the horse to fetch and to carry his hat. Oranges were Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s favorite treat.

===1919: Two-year-old season===
Man o&#x27; War made his debut at Belmont Park on June 6, 1919, in a maiden race over . At the time, horses raced clockwise at Belmont Park rather than counter-clockwise like all the other American tracks of the day, so horses had to learn to race in both directions. This practice ended in 1922 after Man o&#x27; War retired. He won his first race by six lengths, then three days later was entered in the Keene Memorial Stakes at a distance of on a muddy track at Belmont Park. At this point in his career, Man o&#x27; War had not yet learned how to start quickly but soon settled into fourth place. With an eighth of a mile remaining, jockey Johnny Loftus urged him to run and the horse responded by pulling away from his rivals to win by three lengths. Twelve days later, Man o&#x27; War followed up with another win in the Youthful Stakes at Jamaica Race Course. Two days after that, he swept to victory in the Hudson Stakes at Aqueduct to record his fourth win in 18 days. Less than two weeks later, he returned to win the Tremont Stakes at Aqueduct on July 5.

He was then shipped upstate for the summer meet at Saratoga Race Course, where the competition would be much fiercer. He made his first appearance there in the United States Hotel Stakes on August 2. Despite getting a bad start and carrying 130 pounds, Man o&#x27; War won by two lengths in his first meeting with a well-regarded colt named Upset.

His next start was the Sanford Memorial Stakes on August 13, where he went off as the odds-on favorite with Upset as the third betting choice. This race is notorious in racing history as Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s only defeat, playing a part in developing Saratoga&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Graveyard of Champions&quot;. In the early 1900s, there were no starting gates. Horses circled around and then lined up behind a piece of webbing known as the barrier and were sent away when it was raised. In the Sanford, most sources state that Man o&#x27; War was still circling with his back to the starting line when the barrier was raised (though some accounts say he was turned only slightly sideways). What is undisputed is that Man o&#x27; War had a terrible start, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; attributed to the absence of the regular starting official. The start was delayed for several minutes as other colts repeatedly broke through the barrier and the starter finally released the field when only the horses near the rail were ready. As a result, Man o&#x27; War was far behind the other starters. Loftus then put him in a bad position, getting boxed in by other horses, then checked by tiring horses. Despite this, Man o&#x27; War came close to winning, losing by about a neck while conceding 15 pounds to Upset.

It is sometimes erroneously thought that Upset&#x27;s unexpected win popularized a new phrase in sports (meaning an underdog beating the favorite) – in fact, the term &quot;upset&quot; had been in use to describe such a situation for decades. The two horses faced off five times during their racing careers, with Man o&#x27; War beating Upset four times.

The loss only enhanced Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s reputation. J.L. Dempsey of &quot;The Daily Racing Form&quot; wrote, &quot;Without attempting to detract from the merits of [Upset&#x27;s] performance, Man o&#x27; War proved himself in the running unquestionably the best. It was Upset&#x27;s advantage at the start, coupled with 15 pounds weight concession, a perfect ride he received from Knapp and his success in saving ground on the stretch turn that brought his triumph over Man o&#x27; War. Had the race been a sixteenth farther the finish would have been reversed.&quot;

Man o&#x27; War gained his revenge with a victory in the Grand Union Hotel Stakes on August 23, beating Upset by two lengths with Blazes in third. After the race, Loftus stated that Man o&#x27; War was the best horse he had ever ridden and that his ride had been responsible for the loss in the Sanford. While carrying 130 pounds, Man o&#x27; War tied the stakes record of 1:12 2/5 for that had been set by Garbage while carrying only .

Seven days later, Man o&#x27; War entered the Hopeful Stakes, whose purse of $30,000 made it one of the richest prizes in racing at the time. He faced eight rivals, a small field at the time for such a prestigious race. Heavy rain started to fall as the field headed to the starting post, and Man o&#x27; War broke through the barrier several times, delaying the race by twelve minutes. Despite this, he won with &quot;ridiculous ease&quot; by six lengths.

Man o&#x27; War then returned to Belmont Park for the Futurity Stakes on September 14. The Futurity had a purse of $5,000 added, meaning the prize money was increased by nomination and entry fees. Because the Futurity was one of the preeminent races of the day, the added money was large enough to increase the winner&#x27;s share of the purse to $26,650. Man o&#x27; War briefly dueled for the lead with a well-regarded sprinter named Dominique, then opened up a commanding lead. Turning into the stretch, John P. Grier swept into second with an all-out drive but failed to make up any ground on Man o&#x27; War, who had not been urged at any point in the race and won by three lengths while carrying 127 pounds, 10 pounds more than John P. Grier. Journalists, horsemen, and fans agreed that Man o&#x27; War had to be considered as one of the greatest American horses of his age, and they compared him favorably to the unbeaten Colin. He completed his two-year-old campaign with nine wins from ten starts and earnings of $82,275. He was named the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1919. He was rated at 136 pounds by handicapper C.C. Ridley of the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;, 16 pounds ahead of the second-ranked colt, Blazes.

===1920: Three-year-old season===
In 1920, Johnny Loftus was denied a renewal of his jockey&#x27;s license by The Jockey Club, a development that was rumored to be related to Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s defeat in the Sanford. He was replaced as the colt&#x27;s rider by Clarence Kummer. Over the winter, Man o&#x27; War had grown to high and filled out to about with a girth.
Riddle decided early on to restrict Man o&#x27; War to races within his own age division, in large part because the most valuable races in the country were restricted to three-year-olds. He decided not to enter him in the Kentucky Derby because it was run only a few days before his preferred target, the Preakness Stakes, which was held close to the Riddle farm where Man o&#x27; War had spent the winter. Riddle also did not like racing in Kentucky and believed it was too early in the year for a young horse to go a mile and a quarter. Thus, Man o&#x27; War did not have a chance to complete what later became known as the U.S. Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, consisting of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes. The previous year, Sir Barton had won the three races, which gained in prestige and importance 10 years later when Gallant Fox accomplished the same feat under a great deal of media attention.

Instead, Man o&#x27; War made his three-year-old debut on May 18 in the Preakness Stakes, then run at a distance of miles. Despite the long layoff and never having raced beyond , he went off as the 4-5 favorite in a field of nine horses that included his old rival Upset, who had finished second in the Derby. Man o&#x27; War broke alertly and took the lead within the first 10 yards, then established a two-length lead down the backstretch while under restraint. As they rounded the final turn, Upset started to close ground so Kummer loosened his grip. Man o&#x27; War responded by again pulling away, completing the opening mile in what would have been a new Pimlico track record of 1:38. Eased in the final furlong, he won by lengths over Upset in a final time of 1:51.

The horse was then returned to his home base at Belmont Park, where a crowd of 25,000 turned out to watch him in the Withers Stakes on May 29. He was sent off at &quot;generous&quot; odds of 1–7 against two rivals: Wildair, winner of the Metropolitan Handicap who was at odds of 6–1, and the overmatched David Harum at 30–1. Man o&#x27; War again seized the early lead, completing the first quarter-mile in : while tugging at the bit. When Wildair tried to close ground around the turn, Kummer briefly released his hold and Man o&#x27; War opened up his lead again. Eased in the final sixteenth of a mile, he won by two lengths while setting an American race record of 1:35 for the mile.

Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s next start was on June 12 in the Belmont Stakes, then run at a distance of miles. The race establish him as one of the all-time greats with an &quot;almost unbelievably brilliant performance&quot; before a crowd of 25,000. At odds of 1-20, he faced one rival, the well-regarded colt Donnaconna. Man o&#x27; War led from the start, and Kummer let him run freely at the top of the stretch, allowing Man o&#x27; War to draw away by 20 lengths. Although eased in the final furlong, he set a world record of 2:14, beating the previous standard set in England by over two seconds and beating Sir Barton&#x27;s American record by over three seconds. This time stood as the American record until 1961, when Wise Ship ran the distance in 2:14 flat on a turf course. It stood as the American dirt record until 1991.

Ten days later, Man o&#x27; War returned in the Stuyvesant Handicap, which he won against one rival. His odds of 1 to 100 were believed to be the lowest ever offered in an American horse race.

His next start in the Dwyer Stakes on July 10 proved far more demanding. The colt John P. Grier, who had challenged Man o&#x27; War in the Belmont Futurity at age two, had matured into the second-best three-year-old in the country. Under the conditions of the Dwyer, Man o&#x27; War was assigned 126 pounds while John P. Grier carried only 108. The two colts scared away all rivals, turning the Dwyer into a match race. They raced side by side down the backstretch, with Man o&#x27; War on the rail blocking John P. Grier from the view of the spectators. The horses ran the race as a sprint, completing the first three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 2/5 – an American record. As they entered the turn, Man o&#x27; War started to open up an advantage but John P. Grier rallied and got back on even terms. They completed the mile together in a time of 1:35 3/5, breaking Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s American record set in the Withers. John P. Grier made another surge, and for a moment the spectators believed that he would win the race. Kummer then hit Man o&#x27; War with the whip, and he made a final surge, opening up a lead of two lengths in the final fifty yards. The final time was 1:49 1/5, a world record for miles.
Man o&#x27; War was then shipped to Saratoga and was entered in the Miller Stakes on August 7. There was a then-record crowd of 35,000, many of whom gathered in the saddling area where Man o&#x27; War was surrounded by twelve Pinkerton guards. His jockey for the race was Earl Sande, replacing an injured Kummer. As expected, Man o&#x27; War took the early lead and was unchallenged in a six-length victory. He had been tightly restrained, but even so, his time of 1:56 3/5 for the distance of miles was just seconds off the track record. &quot;I never felt anything like that horse in my life,&quot; said Sande after the race. &quot;He strides farther than anything I ever rode and does it so handily that you would not think he was running at all.&quot;

His connections had a brief scare when Man o&#x27; War exhibited signs of lameness after a workout on August 17, but he quickly recovered. On August 21, he entered the Travers Stakes where he faced his two strongest rivals: Upset for the fifth and last time, and John P. Grier for the third time. A record crowd overflowed the grandstand and stretched down the rail and track apron. As a result, Saratoga management opened the infield, and 5,000 people moved across the track to line the inner rail.

Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s jockey for the race was Andy Schuttinger as Kummer was still recovering from injury and Sande was not available. After the start, John P. Grier tried to match strides with Man o&#x27; War but could not keep up. After establishing a clear lead by the first turn, Schuttinger took hold of Man o&#x27; War for the rest of the race. Upset made a late run to move into second, but Man o&#x27; War won by three lengths. Despite not being extended, he completed the distance of miles in 2:01 4/5, equaling the track record set earlier in the year by Sir Barton. This record stood until 1941. It is possible the time was also a world record, as the existing record time of 2:00 flat credited to Whisk Broom II in 1913 was disputed.

Riddle contemplated entering Man o&#x27; War against older horses for the first time in the $5,000 Saratoga Gold Cup but ultimately chose to enter the $15,000 Lawrence Realization Stakes against three-year-olds instead. When his only rival scratched from the race, it nearly became a walkover until Mrs. Riddle&#x27;s niece, Sarah Jeffords, entered Hoodwink. To compensate for the lack of competition, Riddle announced that Man o&#x27; War would be allowed to show his speed. He was reunited with regular jockey Kummer, after being ridden by Sande and Schuttinger while Kummer recovered from an injury. Kummer neither restrained the horse nor urged him at any point in the race. Running as he pleased, Man o&#x27; War won by slightly more than a quarter-mile – the official margin was 100 lengths – while setting a world record of 2:40 4/5 for a mile and five-eighths. This broke the world record set in England by seconds and lowered the American record by over four seconds. This world record stood until 1956, when it was broken by Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s great-grandson Swaps.

The performance drew superlatives from the racing community. Turf writer B.K. Beckwith later called it &quot;the most astounding display of arrogant annihilation&quot;, adding, &quot;[Man o&#x27; War] was like a big red sheet of flame running before a prairie wind&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;at Belmont Park yesterday [Man o&#x27; War] gave what was undoubtedly the greatest exhibition of speed over a considerable distance of ground ever witnessed anywhere.&quot;

Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s next start was the Jockey Club Gold Cup on September 12, the first time he entered a race open to older horses. The race organizers tried to lure Sir Barton into entering by promising to increase the purse from $15,000 to $25,000 if he did so, but Sir Barton needed more time to recover from his last race. It was also speculated that Sir Barton&#x27;s owner was holding out for an even higher purse for a match race with Man o&#x27; War. The connections of Exterminator, another future Hall of Famer, were also considering the race but bypassed it because, under the weight-for-age conditions of the Gold Cup, he would have had to concede Man o&#x27; War five pounds. As it was, Man o&#x27; War faced only one competitor and won under tight restraint by fifteen lengths. Although it was declared a hollow victory by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Man o&#x27; War still set an American record for miles of 2:28 4/5, breaking the existing mark by 4/5 seconds.

Man o&#x27; War next entered the Potomac Handicap at Havre de Grace Racetrack in Maryland on September 18. He was assigned 138 pounds, conceding from 24 to 34 pounds to his rivals, which included Kentucky Derby winner Paul Jones. Man o&#x27; War faced an early challenge from Blazes, then turned back a late run by Wildair to win by lengths while breaking the track record by seconds. Although Man o&#x27; War was not seriously challenged, the high weight and a poorly maintained racing surface took a toll: He came out of the race with a swollen tendon on his right foreleg.
The final start of Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s career came in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, in the Kenilworth Park Gold Cup on October 12. The event was so highly anticipated that it became the first horse race to be filmed in its entirety, with the resulting footage later shown in movie theaters across the country. The race was originally intended to be a face-off between the three great horses of the time: Man o&#x27; War, Sir Barton, and Exterminator. However, the owners of Sir Barton and Man o&#x27; War agreed to a distance of miles, which was too short for Exterminator to run his best, and they agreed to a weight-for-age format, under which the older Exterminator would concede weight to Man o&#x27; War. Therefore, Exterminator was not entered, and in fact, raced that same day on a different track.

In what was now essentially a match race, the advantage shifted to Man o&#x27; War, whose front-running style allowed him to dictate the pace. He was almost flat-footed at the break but quickly gathered speed to draw clear of Sir Barton in the first furlong. Kummer then slowed the pace while maintaining a two-length lead down the backstretch. On the final turn, Man o&#x27; War put in a brief spurt and quickly opened the lead to five lengths. Kummer again pulled him in and Man o&#x27; War maintained a steady pace to the wire to win by seven lengths in a &quot;ridiculously easy&quot; fashion. Although the time of 2:03 was well off the American record shared by Man o&#x27; War and Sir Barton, it still broke the track record by over six seconds. Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s share of the purse made him the highest-earning horse in American history. The gold trophy presented in the winner&#x27;s circle, designed by Tiffany &amp; Co, was later donated by Mrs. Riddle to Saratoga and is now used as the trophy for the Travers Stakes.

There were no formal awards for American Horse of the Year at the time, but Man o&#x27; War was informally acknowledged as such in a retroactive poll of turf writers. In its summary of the sporting year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;A superman (Babe Ruth) and a superhorse – these were sport&#x27;s greatest contributions to the history of the year about to close. Some might rate the superhorse, Man o&#x27; War, as the outstanding figure of the two, for he has passed on from the field of competition and has left a story of achievement which may never be surpassed.&quot;

Over his two-year career, Man o&#x27; War won 20 of 21 races, setting three world records, two American records, and three track records.

===Weight carrying===
At the time, there were few weight-for-age races in the United States. The majority of races were run under handicap conditions, with better horses being assigned higher weights in an attempt to equalize the chances of the other horses in the field. As one writer put it, &quot;the one certain thing about racing is that weight will eventually stop the greatest of racers and bring them down to equal terms with horses of much less quality.&quot; As a two-year-old, Man o&#x27; War carried in six races; few racehorses have ever carried that much at any age. As a three-year-old, he carried as much as in races, conceding as much as to other horses. Had he raced at age four, the handicappers would have started him at 140 pounds, increasing the amount each time he won until such time as Man o&#x27; War either lost or was injured. For this reason, Riddle decided to retire him at the end of his three-year-old campaign.

==Race record==
==Stud record==
After his undefeated season as a three-year-old, Man o&#x27; War was retired to stud in Lexington, originally at Elizabeth Daingerfield&#x27;s Hinata Farm. In May 1922, he was moved to Faraway Farm, a property on Huffman Mill Pike outside of Lexington that had been jointly purchased by Riddle, his wife&#x27;s niece Sarah Jeffords and her husband, Walter. This land, including the stallion barn, is now part of Mt. Brilliant Farm. In late 1936 or early 1937, the Riddle horses were moved to an adjacent property, also called Faraway Farm, where Man o&#x27; War spent his final years. This portion of Faraway is now called Man o&#x27; War Farm.

During his lifetime, over 500,000 people signed the guest book at Faraway Farm and as many as 1.5 million are estimated to have visited him there. His longtime groom, Will Harbut, would lead the stallion out on display and proudly proclaim his charge&#x27;s many accomplishments. Man o&#x27; War and Harbut were featured together on the cover of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1941. This photograph inspired a popular collectors&#x27; plate, &quot;Forever Friends&quot;, by equine artist Fred Stone.

Man o&#x27; War was the leading sire in North America of 1926 and was runner-up in 1928, 1929 and 1937. The Jockey Club credits him with 62 stakes winners from 381 named foals. Riddle restricted Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s book to about 25 mares a year, most of which were owned by him or his friends and family. Though many breeding experts believe that Riddle did not breed the stallion to enough good mares (especially after the first five seasons), he still sired many leading horses. Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s first crop included three horses who were considered champions: American Flag (Belmont Stakes), Florence Nightingale (Coaching Club American Oaks) and Maid at War (Alabama Stakes). His second crop was highlighted by Crusader, who won the Belmont Stakes in 1926 and was largely accepted as the best racehorse of 1926. Among Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s other famous offspring were 1929 Kentucky Derby winner Clyde Van Dusen, Battleship (who won the 1938 English Grand National steeplechase), and War Admiral, the 1937 Triple Crown winner and the second official Horse of the Year. Another of his offspring, Hard Tack, sired Seabiscuit, who was Horse of the Year in 1938.

Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s most successful sons at stud were War Admiral and War Relic, and War Relic&#x27;s branch of the male line survives today. Tiznow, Tourist, Da&#x27; Tara, In Reality, Desert Vixen, Honour and Glory, Bal a Bali, Skywalker and Bertrando are all sire-line descendants of Man o&#x27; War. His line is also still active in Europe through classic winner Known Fact and his champion son Warning.

Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s influence in modern pedigrees is magnified by the success of his daughters as broodmares. Although Man o&#x27; War never led the broodmare sire list, he was the runner-up ten times and finished in the top ten 22 times. Female line descendants from Man o&#x27; War include Eight Thirty, Stymie, Nijinsky, Sword Dancer, Pavot, Riverman, Jim French, Sir Ivor and Kelso. War Admiral was also a leading broodmare sire, especially when crossed with the influential mare La Troienne and his name can be found in many modern pedigrees through such horses as Seattle Slew, Buckpasser and Dr. Fager. American Flag also contributed to Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s modern influence as he was the sire of the second dam of Raise A Native, who is an almost &quot;omnipresent name in American pedigrees&quot;. Some modern breeders design matings to concentrate the influence of Man o&#x27; War through deep inbreeding. For example, he appears 23 times in the bloodline of American Pharoah, the 2015 Triple Crown winner.

==Death==

Man o&#x27; War was retired from stud in 1943 after suffering a heart attack. He died on November 1, 1947, at age 30 of another apparent heart attack, a short time after Harbut died. His funeral was broadcast live on NBC Radio. Kentucky horseman Ira Drymon said, &quot;He touched the imagination of men and they saw different things in him. But one thing they will all remember was that he brought exaltation into their hearts.&quot; An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;No other horse ever won such fame as Man o&#x27; War. None was more beautiful, with lovelier lines of grace and power. None was more beloved by an admiring and faithful public. Few have lived so long. The American scene seems a little vacant with Man o&#x27; War gone to the Elysian Fields where all good horses go.&quot;

Man o&#x27; War was embalmed and buried in a casket lined with Riddle&#x27;s black-and-gold racing silks. He was originally interred at Faraway Farm, but in the early 1970s, he was re-interred at a new burial site at the Kentucky Horse Park, where his grave is marked with a statue by American sculptor Herbert Haseltine.

==Legacy==
Man o&#x27; War was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957. In 1959, the Man o&#x27; War Stakes was created in his honor. In &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine 1999 ranking of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Man o&#x27; War was ranked No. 1. He was also ranked No. 1 by the Associated Press as the greatest horse of the 20th century in a separate poll. He was also ranked No. 1 greatest horse in racing history by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (panel of 7) in 1992. ESPN ranked Man o&#x27; War as number 84 on their list of the top North American athletes of the 20th century, compiled for the &quot;SportsCentury&quot; documentary series. He was one of three racehorses on their list, along with Secretariat (34th) and Citation (97th).

There is a roadside historical marker at the location of his birthplace in Lexington (Nursery Stud), though the site has since been redeveloped. The stallion barn at Faraway Farm where he spent most of his life was renovated in the early 2000s - it is now part of Mt. Brilliant Farm. His stall door was loaned to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga as part a special exhibit, &quot;Man o&#x27; War at 100&quot;, that opened on March 29, 2017.

Glen Riddle Farm in Maryland was home to Man o&#x27; War during the off seasons of his racing career. The land was redeveloped in the early 2000s as GlenRiddle, a gated community with two golf courses, one of which is named in Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s honor. The barn in which Man o&#x27; War stayed was converted into the golf clubhouse. In the 1950s, the Riddle estate sold the property Riddle had owned in Glen Riddle, Pennsylvania, which became the Riddlewood housing development. One of the roads in Riddlewood is named Man o&#x27; War Drive, another is War Admiral Lane. Man o&#x27; War Boulevard, a major arterial that circles to the south of Lexington, is also named in the horse&#x27;s honor. Central of Georgia Railway once ran a Man o&#x27; War passenger train between Atlanta and Columbus.

===In books and film===
He has been the subject of several biographies. The first, titled &quot;Big Red&quot;, was by C. W. Anderson and was published in 1943. &quot;Man o&#x27; War&quot;, by Page Cooper and Roger Treat, was published in 1950, and is a classic of its kind. Walter Farley, author of &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; series, also wrote a slightly fictional biography of Man o&#x27; War in 1962. In 2000, Edward L. Bowen wrote a biography called &quot;Man o&#x27; War: Thoroughbred Legends&quot; from Eclipse Press. In 2006, Dorothy Ours wrote a new, extensively sourced biography titled &quot;Man o&#x27; War: A Legend Like Lightning&quot;. Man o&#x27; War is also featured in several books on Thoroughbred breeding, including Avalyn Hunter&#x27;s &quot;American Classic Pedigrees (1914–2002)&quot;.

In 1925, Man o&#x27; War was seen in the film &quot;Kentucky Pride&quot; which was directed by John Ford.

===Cultural references===
In Sterling A. Brown&#x27;s poem about Kentucky and an African American in pre-Civil Rights America, &quot;Kentucky Blues&quot; from &quot;Southern Road&quot;, a reference is made to Man o&#x27; War. The poem discusses Thoroughbred horses and other characteristics attributed to the state.

According to Joey DeMaio, the heavy metal band Manowar was named after the horse.

In the 1970 motion picture &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, the character Trapper John makes the apocryphal claim that a necropsy performed upon Man o&#x27; War following his death revealed that he was a homosexual horse, despite his prolific breeding history.

The song &quot;Action Man&quot; by the band Widespread Panic tells the story of Man o&#x27; War. The song references his Sire and Dam, Fair Play and Mahubah, as well as his offspring War Admiral.

==Pedigree==
Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s grandsire Hastings was purchased by August Belmont Jr. as a two-year-old and won the Belmont Stakes for him in 1896. Hastings had a notoriously vicious temperament that he tended to pass on to his offspring in varying degrees. The mare Fairy Gold, a stakes-winning daughter of Epsom Derby winner Bend Or, was imported by Belmont to America and bred to Hastings in 1904. The resulting foal was Fair Play, who was one of the best racehorses of his year and even better as a stallion, leading the American sire list three times (1920, 1924 and 1927). Fair Play inherited a difficult temperament from Hastings, and his disposition was completely soured after an unsuccessful period spent racing in England. In addition to Man o&#x27; War, he also sired Hall of Famer Discovery.

Belmont Jr. also bred the mare Mahubah, who raced only five times with one win. She was the daughter of Rock Sand, who was imported by Belmont to the United States after winning the English Triple Crown. Mahubah produced five foals, all of them by Fair Play, including Man o&#x27; War and stakes winner My Play. Mahubah is also the fourth dam of American Triple Crown winner Assault.

An asterisk before a horse&#x27;s name means the horse was imported to the United States.

Through his sire, Man o&#x27; War is a descendant of the first English Triple Crown champion, West Australian. This male line traces to the Godolphin Arabian (Man o&#x27; War is 14 generations removed from the Godolphin Arabian).

<doc id="277983" wikidata="Q505820" url="?curid=277983" title="Pragmaticism">
<text>&quot;Pragmaticism&quot; is a term used by Charles Sanders Peirce for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order to distance himself and it from pragmatism, the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the &quot;literary journals&quot;. Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage &quot;pragmaticism&quot;, saying that it was &quot;ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers&quot; (&quot;Collected Papers&quot; (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, &quot;pragmatism&quot; is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce&#x27;s view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe. In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with principles of statistics and modes of inference in his &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series of articles in 1877-8.

==Pragmatic maxim==
Whether one chooses to call it &quot;pragmatism&quot; or &quot;pragmaticism&quot;—and Peirce himself was not always consistent about it even after the notorious renaming—his conception of pragmatic philosophy is based on one or another version of the so-called &quot;pragmatic maxim&quot;. Here is one of his more emphatic statements of it:

Pragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows: Consider what effects, that might &quot;conceivably&quot; have practical bearings, you &quot;conceive&quot; the objects of your &quot;conception&quot; to have. Then, your &quot;conception&quot; of those effects is the whole of your &quot;conception&quot; of the object (CP 5.438).

In the 1909 &quot;Century Dictionary Supplement&quot;, the entry for pragmaticism by John Dewey was

pragmaticism (prag-mat′i-sizm), &quot;n.&quot; [&quot;pragmatic&quot; + &quot;ism&quot;.] A special and limited form of pragmatism, in which the pragmatism is restricted to the determining of the meaning of concepts (particularly of philosophic concepts) by consideration of the experimental differences in the conduct of life which would conceivably result from the affirmation or denial of the meaning in question. He [the writer] framed the theory that a conception, that is, the rational purport of a word or other expression, lies exclusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life. . . . To serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word &quot;&quot;pragmaticism&quot;.&quot;      &quot;C. S. Peirce&quot;, in The Monist, April, 1905, p. 166.

==Pragmatism&#x27;s origin==
Pragmatism as a philosophical movement originated in 1872 in discussions in The Metaphysical Club among Peirce, William James, Chauncey Wright, John Fiske, Francis Ellingwood Abbot, and lawyers Nicholas St. John Green and Joseph Bangs Warner (1848–1923). The first use in print of the name &quot;pragmatism&quot; appears to have been in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with having coined the name during the early 1870s.

James, among others, regarded Peirce&#x27;s 1877-8 &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series, especially &quot;&quot; (1878) as pragmatism&#x27;s foundation. Peirce (CP 5.11-12), like James saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method of thinking and resolving dilemmas. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In a 1906 manuscript, Peirce wrote that, in the Metaphysical Club decades earlier, Nicholas St. John Greenoften urged the importance of applying Bain&#x27;s definition of belief, as &quot;that upon which a man is prepared to act.&quot; From this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism. James and Peirce, inspired by crucial links among belief, conduct, and disposition, agreed with Green. John Shook has said, &quot;Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as a vital alternative to rationalistic speculation.&quot;

Pragmatism is regarded as a distinctively American philosophy. As advocated by James, John Dewey, F. C. S. Schiller, George Herbert Mead, and others, it has proved durable and popular. But Peirce did not seize on this fact to enhance his reputation, and even coined the word &quot;pragmaticism&quot; to distinguish his philosophical position.

==Clarification of ideas in inquiry==
Pragmatism starts with the idea that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism is about conceptions of objects. His pragmatism is a method for fruitfully sorting out conceptual confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needful) formal yet not practical differences. It equates any conception of an object with a conception of that object&#x27;s effects to a general extent of those conceived effects&#x27; conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception&#x27;s meaning. The meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the conception as true. Peirce&#x27;s pragmaticism, in the strict sense, is about the conceptual elucidation of conceptions into such meanings — about how to make our ideas clear. Making them true, in the sense of proving and bearing them out in fruitful practice, goes beyond that. A conception&#x27;s truth is its correspondence to the real, to that which would be found by investigation taken far enough. A conception&#x27;s actual confirmation (if it occurs) is neither its meaning nor its truth &quot;per se&quot;, but an actual upshot.

In &quot;&quot;, Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: &lt;br&gt;
:1. Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
:2. Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its definition&#x27;s parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea &quot;distinct&quot;, that is, clarified by analysis of just what elements make the given idea applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce calls such a definition &quot;nominal&quot; (CP 5.553).
:3. Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object&#x27;s effects as conceived of, such as can lead to fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduces that which he later called the pragmatic maxim.

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. To reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner&#x27;s self-regulation, that the truth is independent of our vagaries of opinion and is discoverable. In clearness&#x27;s second grade (the &quot;nominal&quot; grade), he defines truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object, and the real as the object (be it a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law) to which a true sign corresponds, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness&#x27;s third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defines truth — not as actual consensus, such that to inquire would be to poll the experts — but as that which &quot;would&quot; be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. (Peirce held that one cannot have absolute theoretical assurance of having actually reached the truth, and later said that the confession of inaccuracy and one-sidedness is an essential ingredient of a true abstract statement.) Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce&#x27;s theory of truth, see the Peirce section in Pragmatic theory of truth. Peirce&#x27;s discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for deflationary and correspondence theories of truth.

Peirce said that a conception&#x27;s meaning consists in &quot;all general modes of rational conduct&quot; implied by &quot;acceptance&quot; of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception&#x27;s meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual trends of opinion. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to &quot;vulgar&quot; pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce&#x27;s pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification to test the truth of putative knowledge.

Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism, as method and theory of &quot;definitions and the clearness of ideas&quot;, is a department within his theory of inquiry, which he variously called &quot;Methodeutic&quot; and &quot;Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric&quot;. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

Peirce called his pragmatism &quot;the logic of abduction&quot;, that is, the logic of inference to explanatory hypotheses. As a method conducive to hypotheses as well as predictions and testing, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:

:* Deduction from self-evident truths, or &quot;rationalism&quot;;

:* Induction from experiential phenomena, or &quot;empiricism&quot;.

His approach is distinct from foundationalism, empiricist or otherwise, as well as from coherentism, by the following three dimensions:

:* Active process of theory generation, with no prior assurance of truth;

:* Subsequent application of the contingent theory in order to clarify its logical and practical implications;

:* Testing and evaluation of the provisional theory&#x27;s utility for the &quot;anticipation&quot; of future experience, and that in dual senses of the word: &quot;prediction&quot; and &quot;control&quot;. Peirce&#x27;s appreciation of these three dimensions serves to flesh out a physiognomy of inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization &quot;simpliciter&quot;, which is merely the relabeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions.

A theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists.

In &quot;The Fixation of Belief&quot;, Peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth &quot;per se&quot; but as the struggle to settle disturbances or conflicts of belief, irritating, inhibitory doubts, belief being that on which one is willing to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry not only as a special kind of inquiry in a broader spectrum, but also, like inquiry generally, as based on actual doubts, not mere verbal doubts (such as hyperbolic doubt), which he held to be fruitless, and it let him also frame it, by the same stroke, as requiring that proof rest on propositions free from actual doubt, rather than on ultimate and absolutely indubitable propositions. He outlined four methods, ordered from least to most successful in achieving a secure fixation of belief:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness, but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others&#x27; views, as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well fail to avoid noticing when another&#x27;s opinion is as good as one&#x27;s own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the &quot;a priori&quot; — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of &quot;what is agreeable to reason.&quot; Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of science — the only one whereby inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong (fallibilism), and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research, which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and to practical ends; reason&#x27;s &quot;first rule&quot; is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. What recommends the scientific method of inquiry above all others is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the ultimately most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can eventually be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth &quot;per se&quot; but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce shows how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

==Pragmaticism&#x27;s name==
 It is sometimes stated that James&#x27; and other philosophers&#x27; use of the word &quot;pragmatism&quot; so dismayed Peirce that he renamed his own variant &quot;pragmaticism&quot;. Susan Haack has disagreed, pointing out the context in which Peirce publicly introduced the latter term in 1905. Haack&#x27;s excerpt of Peirce begins below at the words &quot;But at present ...,&quot; and continues with some ellipses. The fuller excerpt below supports her case further:
Then, in a surviving draft letter to Calderoni, dated by the CP editors as &quot;circa&quot; that same year 1905, Peirce said regarding his above-quoted discussion:

Indeed in the &quot;Monist&quot; article Peirce had said that the coinage &quot;pragmaticism&quot; was intended &quot;to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition&quot;. Of course this does not mean that Peirce regarded his fellow pragmatist philosophers as word-kidnappers. To the contrary he had said, regarding James&#x27;s and Schiller&#x27;s uses of the word &quot;pragmatism&quot;: &quot;So far, all went happily.&quot; So it would seem that Peirce intended the coinage &quot;pragmaticism&quot; for two distinguishable purposes: (1) protection from literary journals and word-kidnappers, and (2) reference strictly to his own form of pragmatism, as opposed even to other pragmatisms that had not moved him to the new name. In the letter to Calderoni, Peirce did not reject all significant affiliation with fellow pragmatists, and instead said &quot;the rest of us&quot;. Nor did he reject all such affiliation in later discussions.

However, in the following year 1906, in a manuscript &quot;A Sketch of Logical Critics&quot;, Peirce wrote:

(Peirce proceeded to criticize J. S. Mill but acknowledged probable aid from Mill&#x27;s &quot;Examination&quot;.)

Then, in 1908, in his article &quot;&quot;, mentioning both James and the journalist, pragmatist, and literary author Giovanni Papini, Peirce wrote:
In 1871, in a Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Mass., I used to preach this principle as a sort of logical gospel, representing the unformulated method followed by Berkeley, and in conversation about it I called it &quot;Pragmatism.&quot; In December 1877 and January 1878 I set forth the doctrine in the &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot;, and the two parts of my essay were printed in French in the &quot;Revue Philosophique&quot;, volumes vi. and vii. Of course, the doctrine attracted no particular attention, for, as I had remarked in my opening sentence, very few people care for logic. But in 1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed to sound logic. About the time Professor Papini discovered, to the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of definition, which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and accordingly, in April 1905, I renamed it &quot;Pragmaticism&quot;.

Peirce proceeded in &quot;A Neglected Argument&quot; to express both deep satisfaction and deep dismay with his fellow pragmatists. He singled F. C. S. Schiller out by name and was vague about which among the others he most particularly referred to. Peirce wrote &quot;It seems to me a pity they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death. ... &quot;

There has been some controversy over Peirce&#x27;s relation to other pragmatists over the years and over the question of what is owed to Peirce, with visible crests in titles such as literary essayist Edward Dahlberg&#x27;s &quot;Cutpurse Philosopher&quot; about James, in which Dahlberg claimed that Peirce had &quot;tombstone reticences&quot; about making accusations, and Kenneth Laine Ketner&#x27;s and Walker Percy&#x27;s &quot;A Thief of Peirce&quot;, in which Percy described himself as &quot;a thief of Peirce&quot; (page 130). Meanwhile, Schiller, James&#x27;s wife Alice, and James&#x27;s son Henry James III believed that James had a habit of overstating his intellectual debts to others such as Peirce.

In another manuscript &quot;A Sketch of Logical Critic&quot; dated by the CP editors as 1911, Peirce discussed one of Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes, that of Achilles and the Tortoise, in terms of James&#x27;s and others&#x27; difficulties with it. Peirce therein expressed regret at having used a &quot;contemptuous&quot; manner about such difficulties in his 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism (which James had arranged), and said of James, who had died in August 1910: &quot;Nobody has a better right to testify to the morality of his attitude toward his own thoughts than I, who knew and loved him for forty-nine or fifty years. But owing to his almost unexampled incapacity for mathematical thought, combined with intense hatred for logic — probably for its pedantry, its insistence on minute exactitude — the &quot;gêne&quot; of its barbarous formulations, etc. rendered him an easy victim to Zeno and the Achilles. ... &quot;, called James &quot;about as perfect a lover of truth as it is possible for a man to be. ... &quot; and said: &quot;In speaking, then, of William James as I do, I am saying the most that I could of any man&#x27;s intellectual morality; and with him this was but one of a whole diadem of virtues.&quot;

<text>Apples to Apples is a party game originally published by Out of the Box Publishing Inc., and now by Mattel. Players start with a hand of seven &quot;red apple&quot; cards, which feature nouns. A player is selected to be the first judge, and that judge plays a &quot;green apple&quot; card, which features an adjective. The round is won by playing the &quot;red apple&quot; card that the judge determines to be the best match for the &quot;green apple&quot; card. The role of the judge rotates, and the number of rounds is determined by the number of players. The game is designed for four to ten players and played for 30–75 minutes.

&quot;Apples to Apples&quot; was chosen by Mensa International in 1999 as a &quot;Mensa Select&quot; prizewinner, an award given to five games each year. It was also named &quot;Party Game of the Year&quot; in the December 1999 issue of &quot;Games&quot; magazine and received the National Parenting Center&#x27;s seal of approval in May 1999. The popularity of the game led to an increased interest in similar card-matching/answer-judging party games. On September 8, 2007, Out of the Box Publishing sold the rights for &quot;Apples to Apples&quot; to Mattel.

==Game versions==

The original boxed set contained:

* One hundred eight green cards (green apples), each of which has an adjective printed on one side.
* Three hundred twenty-four red cards (red apples), each of which has a noun printed on one side.
* A tray for holding the cards.

Four expansion sets were available, adding 72 extra green apple cards and 216 additional red apple cards each. In 2002, &quot;Expansion Set 3&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement of 2001&quot;. As of 2005[update], the original set and its expansions have been retired and replaced by a &quot;Party Box&quot; with the combined contents of the basic set and its first two expansions, and &quot;Party Box Expansion 1&quot; set with the combined contents of the third and fourth expansions, and a &quot;Party Box Expansion 2&quot;, which contains new cards. &quot;Apples to Apples Junior,&quot; for ages nine and up, &quot;Apples to Apples Kids,&quot; for ages seven and up, and a variety of themed editions were also developed. Mattel has continued to update card sets and packaging and add themed editions.

==Reception==
In 2019, &quot;Apples to Apples&quot; was inducted into the Origins Award Hall of Fame.

<doc id="277987" wikidata="Q575248" url="?curid=277987" title="Jesus (1979 film)">
<text>Jesus (also known as The Jesus Film) is a 1979 American Biblical drama film directed by Peter Sykes and John Krish, and produced by John Heyman. In &quot;Jesus&quot;, the life of Jesus Christ is depicted, primarily using the Gospel of Luke as the main basis for the story. A voice-over narration is featured sporadically throughout the film, providing background information on characters and events.

Shot on location in Israel, the film was financed primarily by Campus Crusade for Christ with a budget of $6 million, and was released without production or cast credits, as producer John Heyman declared that the creators of this picture were “simply being translators” of the New Testament&#x27;s Gospel of Luke, “so nobody will know who produced or directed the film.” The end of the film states that the Good News Bible (Today&#x27;s English Version) was used during filming, and instead of telling a parallel story or embellishing the Biblical account like other Biblical films, the filmmakers chose to adhere to the Gospel of Luke as closely as possible.

&quot;Jesus&quot; is often described as the most-watched motion picture of all time, in addition to being the most translated film of all time.

==Plot==
During the days of Emperor Augustus and King Herod the Great, Mary is visited by the angel Gabriel who tells her that she will give birth to Jesus, the Son of God. Later, Mary visits Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, who tells her that she is the most blessed of women and that her child is blessed.

When the Romans hold a census, Mary travels with her husband Joseph to his hometown of Bethlehem to register. There, Jesus is born in a manger. A week later, Mary and Joseph travel to Jerusalem to present Jesus at the Temple. There, they are greeted by Simeon, who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a Passover trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in His Father&#x27;s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor Tiberius and King Herod Antipas, John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the Jordan River and the Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus.

Jesus is subsequently tempted in the wilderness by Satan but withstands the Devil&#x27;s trials. Travelling to Capernaum, Jesus recruits the disciples Peter, James, and John after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus resurrects the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve apostles from among His disciples including Matthew and Judas Iscariot. Jesus&#x27; followers also include several women including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna.

The film covers several of Jesus&#x27; teachings and messages including the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, the Beatitudes, the Golden Rule, loving your enemy, and the Parable of the Sower. While visiting the home of the Pharisee Simon, a sinful woman anoints Jesus&#x27; feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the Sea of Galilee where he calms the storm. At Gerasa, Jesus exorcises a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At Bethsaida, Jesus feeds five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets Moses and Elijah and is transfigured.

As Jesus&#x27; preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector Zaccheus, convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the Parable of the Tenants and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the Last Supper, Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.

At the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. Peter denies knowing Jesus three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before Pontius Pilate, who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the religious leaders and crowd demand Jesus&#x27; death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, Simon of Cyrene is obliged to carry his cross. At Golgotha, Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus&#x27; death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before ascending back to Heaven, Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Bill Bright, founder of the Campus Crusade for Christ, spent a lot of his early career in Los Angeles trying to convert Hollywood celebrities, and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, British Jewish producer John Heyman approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.

Eshleman was pleased with Heyman&#x27;s short film on the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke and convinced Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film&#x27;s dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from clergy and scholars. On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: &quot;I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.&quot; Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; or &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the Gospel of Luke.

After failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the &quot;Jesus&quot; film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters Bunker and Caroline Hunt for a sum of $6 million. Almost every line spoken by Jesus in the film is quoted directly from the gospel of Luke, with over 450 leaders and scholars who had reassessed the script for biblical accuracy. Historical accuracy also was assured by implementing clothing, pottery and other props made with 1st century techniques to depict a 2,000-year-old Galilean culture.

===Filming===

Brian Deacon, a Shakespearean actor, was cast as Jesus for his &quot;ethnically correct&quot; olive complexion. In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast Yemenite Jews as background extras because, according to Eshleman, &quot;their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.&quot;

Filming began late November 1979 on location in Tiberias, Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers &quot;were required to re-film three days&#x27; work,&quot; because they &quot;had shown eucalyptus trees in a variety of shots,&quot; when, &quot;Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later&quot;.

Deacon grew his hair and beard during production, but Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig, and as well as a prosthetic nose so that he had a Mediterranean look. Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several Bible translations a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ&#x27;s teachings. Because Deacon developed pneumonia during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon&#x27;s dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.

Eshleman revealed that Niko Nitai (Simon Peter) became a believer during shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent halos to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan. Heyman&#x27;s original cut of the &quot;Jesus&quot; film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the accent of the Israeli cast members and decided that they all should be dubbed over by English voice actors using the Received Pronunciation accent.

==Release==
&quot;Jesus&quot; was theatrically released by Warner Bros. in the United States in 330 venues principally in the South and West, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an &quot;overtly religious picture&quot;. To promote the film, Eshleman worked with both evangelical and Catholic churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watched the &quot;Jesus&quot; film in late 1980–81. Though popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream viewers. It was not financially successful, and left John Heyman&#x27;s Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.

In Australia, it was released on April 3, 1981; in Portugal on April 9, 1981; in Sweden on November 1, 1985; in Finland on March 14, 1986; in Hungary on 13 December 1990; and in Czechoslovakia in 1991. The film has been screened in 229 countries.

===Lawsuit===
Warner Bros. received backlash for distributing simultaneously with &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979), another studio release stigmatised by some religious leaders for its satirical characterisation of events surrounding Jesus Christ, although the studio considered the coinciding releases as &quot;something for everybody&quot;. The &quot;Jesus&quot; producers evaluated whether to take legal action against the studio for a conflict of interest.

===Ratings and classifications===
Despite scenes involving crucifixion and flagellation, &quot;Jesus&quot; received a G rating by the Motion Picture Association of America and, likewise in Australia, received the same classification from the Australian Classification Board. In the United Kingdom, however, it was granted a PG by the British Board of Film Classification for &quot;mild violence and horror&quot;.

===Later versions===

;1999-2002
To make the film more relevant for younger viewers, new footage for &quot;The Story of Jesus for Children&quot; was shot in 1999. Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edit of the original film and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the creation of humans, the expulsion from Eden, Abraham&#x27;s blocked sacrifice of his son, and the prophesies of Isaiah was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus&#x27; life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of &quot;Jesus&quot; commemorating the September 11 attacks (83 minutes) was distributed in the VHS format. It contains introductions by New York City firefighters and police officers.

;2003
An edited DVD edition was also packaged with &quot;JESUS: Fact or Fiction?&quot;, produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the &quot;Journey of Spiritual Discovery&quot;. Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a &quot;discovery glass&quot; icon, can access relevant comments. Once finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.

The version was promoted to Muslims of Iraq during the hardships of the Iraqi War, where its website featured a banner advert that said &quot;Send videocassettes of &#x27;JESUS&#x27; to Iraq&quot;. The 2003 version premiered in a politically unstable and fundamentally Islamic region in northern Egypt. Documentarian Deep Sehgal filmed the screening as part of a six-month project.

;2014
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, a digitally remastered, high definition DVD and Blu-ray version was released in April 2014, with its 173,000 frames being retouched and re-colored. Featuring a new score by John Bisharat and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, all voices were dubbed over by unknown British voice actors, though Brian Deacon reprised the voiceover for Jesus. With a runtime of 128 minutes, the remastered version includes several bonus featurettes: &quot;The Making of The Jesus Film&quot;, &quot;The Impact of the Jesus Film&quot;, and &quot;Historical Notes&quot;.

On the remaster, The Jesus Film Project executive director Erick Schenkel states: &quot;We believe this new remastered version will give audiences an accurate picture of who Jesus is and why individuals around the world have chosen to follow Him, shown with production values they have come to expect.&quot;

==Reception==
While praising its &quot;meticulous attention to authenticity&quot;, critics maligned &quot;Jesus&quot; for being &quot;painfully monotonous&quot; and &quot;little more than an illustrated gospel, with nothing in the way of historical and social context.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it a &quot;...dull Sunday-School treatment of the life of Christ, meticulously but unimaginatively culled from Luke 3-24.&quot; 

Despite Bright&#x27;s endorsement, Heyman&#x27;s relationship with his former Campus Crusade collaborators deteriorated due to his perception that the latter overlooked his contributions. Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions. When Campus Crusade produced &quot;The Story of Jesus for Children&quot;, which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.

Regarding the foreign reception, Seghal said &quot;The events we witnessed were often bewildering,&quot; he says. &quot;But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.&quot; After the film&#x27;s reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly converting. In Phaphamani, a small village in South Africa with no electricity, the film was screened on a projector which attracted over 350 people, who had probably never watched a motion picture in their life. According to distributor Brian Helstrom, &quot;You could see them physically jump back at the sight of the serpent tempting Jesus. When soldiers whip Jesus, you could hear grown adults crying.&quot;

=== Statistics ===
Project leaders state that as of May 2020 it has been viewed over 8.1 billion times by over 4 billion people, making it overwhelmingly the most watched movie of all time. This claim, however, has detractors such as Evangelical leader Vinay Samuel, former executive director of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Mission Theologians, who claimed: &quot;These numbers are, to say the least, not gathered in a social-scientific way&quot;, and &quot;They have no way of knowing this&quot;. However, according to the Jesus Film Project, a research firm calculated the known viewings of the film from 1979 to 2015 as greater than 7.3 billion.

It is officially accredited by &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;Most Translated Film&quot; in history, having been translated and available for download in 1,977 languages as of May 2022, with many others in process.

Regarding the film&#x27;s popularity, Schenkel said that foreigners and non-believers &quot;saw Jesus speaking their language, they understood that Jesus saw them and loved them... And so we saw movements of people coming to Christ in every one of these people groups.&quot; Furthermore, he said, &quot;[In t]hirty-five years, there have [been] 6 billion viewings of the film and over 200 million people have indicated they wanted to become followers of Jesus after seeing the film. So the reach is just more than we could have asked and it really has been a privilege to see how God has used this tool.&quot;

In agreement with his missionary agenda, Bright created the Jesus Video Project (JVP) in 1981, which not only spread Jesus to global evangelical activities, but also began on a goal to distribute a copy to every U.S. household. Based on the distribution rate by 2005, JVP did not expect to reach countrywide status until 2040 or later. As of August 2018, over 8 billion viewers were reported through in-person film showings, online platforms and apps, though these reports are likely vastly overinflated.

==International versions==
In 1980, Bright created the Jesus Film Project organization with the goal of accurately translating &quot;Jesus&quot; into other languages and showing them around the world. The first translation was done for the Tagalog-speaking people of the Philippines. One of the group&#x27;s first projects, they ordered for the broadcast of a Hindi version in Indian television. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture. The Mandarin Chinese version of the film is widely distributed in China by the government-linked China Christian Council&#x27;s Amity Foundation in Nanjing, both on VCDs and DVD.

Distribution in the United States has included direct mail campaigns sponsored by churches to deliver a copy of the film to every address in select ZIP codes across the country, with more than 4.8 million copies sent to Ohio and Texas alone. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both &quot;Jesus&quot; and &quot;The Story of Jesus for Children&quot; are available in DVD and VHS formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available. It is the only film that has been dubbed into more than 1000 languages of the world. As of now, more than 1600 languages spoken all over the world have the &quot;Jesus&quot; film, including in all major international languages. Also in 2004, 300 employees at an office in Orlando, FL translated the film into languages such as Kwanyama, spoken in Angola and Namibia, and as well as the seven varieties of Quechua, a tongue of Quechua people in the Andes.

Regarding its worldwide spread and translations, Eshleman states, &quot;People ask &#x27;Why do you go to those far away places?&#x27; It&#x27;s because those people haven&#x27;t had a chance. That&#x27;s all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the message of Christ in an understandable language near where they live.&quot; John Meyer, one of the team members who has helped distributing and translating the film, has said, &quot;I&#x27;m willing to lay down my life for Jesus, should it come to that,&quot; he told the documentary maker Sehgal. &quot;So if there&#x27;s a recording in a war-torn country, I&#x27;m more than willing to go. Or anywhere else, to be honest.&quot;

American aid workers in Afghanistan, who had not been working for the Jesus Film Project, were arrested by the Taliban in 2001 for screening the film to a family there. They were ultimately rescued by US Marines. President George W. Bush welcomed them back to America, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s been an uplifting experience to talk to these courageous souls&quot;.

In the Philippines, the film is traditionally aired every Holy Week yearly (except in 2020 and in 2021, when the film was aired on GTV) on GMA Network, since it premiered on March 29, 2018, and is dubbed in Filipino, along with its children&#x27;s counterpart, &quot;The Story of Jesus for Children&quot;.

<text>Hammer DeRoburt (25 September 1922 – 15 July 1992) was a Nauruan politician and independence leader. He led negotiations for independence from Australia and the end of the country&#x27;s status as a United Nations trust territory. He was subsequently elected as the inaugural president of Nauru, serving four terms in office (1968–1976, 1978–1986, 1986, 1986–1989). Prior to independence he was head chief of Nauru and chair of the Nauru Local Government Council.

==Early life==
DeRoburt was born in Nauru on 25 September 1922. He was the son of DeRoburt and Eidumunang; his maternal grandfather Daimon was the island&#x27;s head chief from 1920 to 1930. He also had Banaban heritage, as his grandmother was from the island. DeRoburt was a member of the Iruwa tribe. He was raised in Boe District. After being educated on Nauru, he attended the Gordon Institute of Technology in Geelong, Australia. After returning to Nauru, he started working as a teacher.

During the Japanese occupation of Nauru he was deported to Truk by the Japanese, along with most of the Nauruan population. When he returned to Nauru in 1946 he started working at the Department of Education. He decided to stand in the first elections to the Local Government Council in 1951, and although he gained enough support to be nominated as a candidate in the Boe constituency, he was disqualified due to irregularities in his nomination. Local residents and European residents protested without success, whilst a petition to the 1953 Visiting Mission from the United Nations was also overlooked.

In 1955 elections he stood again in the Boe constituency and was elected to the Council. In 1956, the Council elected him the last Head Chief of Nauru.

==Presidency of post-independence Nauru==

===Electoral and political record===
On 31 January 1968, Nauru&#x27;s Independence Day, DeRoburt was elected by the Legislative Assembly as one of the five members of the Council of State, an interim body tasked with exercising executive power pending the adoption of a final constitution. He was elected chairman of the Council of State, serving until 17 May 1968 when the legislature unanimously elected him as the country&#x27;s inaugural president upon the adoption of the new constitution. Austin Bernicke and Buraro Detudamo received nominations but declined to stand for election.

In addition to the presidency, DeRoburt assumed the cabinet portfolios of external affairs, internal affairs, and island development and industry. He was re-elected as president unopposed in January 1971 after the 1971 Nauruan parliamentary election. In his second term, DeRoburt faced opposition from a ginger group of young MPs, who felt he had mismanaged the economy, was governing without consultation, and had failed to renew his cabinet. His opponents formed the Nauru Party, the first formal political party on the island. In July 1976, parliament failed to pass financial legislation introduced by DeRoburt. He treated the defeat as a motion of no confidence and resigned as president, but renominated himself in the ensuing election and was re-elected unopposed.

On 22 December 1976, following the 1976 Nauruan parliamentary election, DeRoburt was unexpectedly defeated in his bid for re-election to the presidency, with 30-year-old Bernard Dowiyogo defeating him by nine votes to seven and appointing a Nauru Party cabinet. Dowiyogo had reportedly not expected to win the ballot and offered to resign in DeRoburt&#x27;s favour if he agreed to make concessions on cabinet choices, but DeRoburt refused to do so. He subsequently pressured Dowiyogo to resign and moved a motion attempting to declare Dowiyogo&#x27;s election as unconstitutional, on the grounds that the constitution had not allowed for party politics.

DeRoburt remained an influential figure in Nauruan politics following his ouster and with his supporters managed to force Dowiyogo to an early election in November 1977. Dowiyogo was re-elected as president, but remained in office only until April 1978 when he resigned following a defeat on a phosphate royalties bill. His successor Lagumot Harris was ousted only a month later on a vote on an appropriations bill, with DeRoburt returning as president.

DeRoburt&#x27;s second term in office lasted until his resignation on 19 September 1986 and replacement by Kennan Adeang. Adeang&#x27;s government collapsed only two weeks, with DeRoburt returning as president on 1 October 1986.

===Domestic affairs===
In his first years in office, DeRoburt&#x27;s government established Air Nauru, the first national carrier, and Nauru Pacific Shipping Lines.

===Foreign affairs===
In his final term, DeRoburt&#x27;s government filed a case against Australia in the International Court of Justice for not rehabilitating mined-out areas of the island. His last public appearance was in the ICJ hearing in November 1991.

==Personal==
DeRoburt married Lukale Rowena Harris in 1950, with whom he had one daughter. He was precedeased by his wife and died on 15 July 1992 while in Melbourne for medical treatment. He was accorded a state funeral, before being buried in Boe cemetery, Nauru.

He was given an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 1982.

DeRoburt is credited with popularising Australian rules football to Nauru, which became the national sport.

<text>Roast beef is a dish of beef that is roasted, generally served as the main dish of meal. In the Anglosphere, roast beef is one of the meats often served at Sunday lunch or dinner. Yorkshire pudding is a standard side dish. Sliced roast beef is also sold as a cold cut, and used as a sandwich filling. Leftover roast beef may be minced and made into hash.

Roast beef is a characteristic national dish of England and holds cultural meaning for the English dating back to the 1731 ballad &quot;The Roast Beef of Old England&quot;. The dish is so synonymous with England and its cooking methods from the 18th century that a French nickname for the English is &quot;les Rosbifs&quot;.

==Culinary arts==
The beef on weck sandwich is a tradition in western New York dating back to the late 1800s. Roast beef is sometimes served with horseradish or horseradish sauce. In Denmark, it is mostly used in open sandwiches, called&quot; smørrebrød.&quot;

==Roast beef sandwich==

In the UK the roast beef sandwich is often served hot with fried onions, gravy and horseradish sauce. When it is served cold it consists of bread, cold roast beef, lettuce or rocket, tomatoes and horseradish sauce or mustard

<doc id="278003" wikidata="Q243213" url="?curid=278003" title="Mountain zebra">
<text>The mountain zebra (Equus zebra) is a zebra species in the family Equidae, native to southwestern Africa. There are two subspecies, the Cape mountain zebra (&quot;E. z. zebra&quot;) found in South Africa and Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra (&quot;E. z. hartmannae&quot;) found in south-western Angola and Namibia.

==Taxonomy==
The mountain zebra comprises two subspecies:
In 2004, C. P. Groves and C. H. Bell investigated the taxonomy of the zebras (genus &quot;Equus&quot;, subgenus &quot;Hippotigris&quot;). They concluded that the mountain zebra (&quot;Equus zebra zebra&quot;) and Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra (&quot;Equus zebra hartmannae&quot;) are distinct, and suggested that the two would be better classified as separate species, &quot;Equus zebra&quot; and &quot;Equus hartmannae&quot;.

However, in a sexual genetic study that included 295 mountain zebra specimens, Moodley and Harley (2005) found nothing to support the separation of the two mountain zebra populations into separate species. They concluded that the Cape mountain zebra and Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra should remain as subspecies.

This is consistent with the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (2005), which lists the mountain zebra as a single species (&quot;Equus zebra&quot;) with two subspecies.

==Appearance==
The mountain zebra has a dewlap, which is more conspicuous in &quot;E. z. zebra&quot; than in &quot;E. z. hartmannae&quot;. Like all extant zebras, mountain zebras are boldly striped in black or dark brown, and no two individuals look exactly alike. The whole body is striped except for the belly. In the Cape mountain zebra, the ground colour is effectively white, but the ground colour in Hartmann&#x27;s zebra is slightly buff.

Adult mountain zebras have a head-and-body length of and a tail of long. Wither height ranges from . They weigh from .

Groves and Bell found that Cape mountain zebras exhibit sexual dimorphism, females being larger than males, whereas Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebras do not. Hartmann&#x27;s zebra is on average slightly larger than the Cape mountain zebra.

==Habitat==
Mountain zebras are found on mountain slopes, open grasslands, woodlands, and areas with sufficient vegetation, but their preferred habitat is mountainous terrain, especially escarpment with a diversity of grass species.

==Ecology==
Mountain zebras live in hot, dry, rocky, mountainous and hilly habitats. They prefer slopes and plateaus as high as above sea level, although they do migrate lower during winter. Their preferred diet is tufted grass, but in times of shortage, they browse, eating bark, twigs, leaves, buds, fruit, and roots.

They drink every day. When no surface water is available due to drought, they commonly dig for ground water in dry river beds.

The Cape mountain zebra and Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra are now allopatric, meaning that their present ranges do not overlap, which prevents them from crossbreeding. This was not always so, and the current situation is a result of their populations being fragmented when hunters exterminated them throughout the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Historically, mountain zebras could be found across the entire length of the escarpments along the west coast of southern Africa and in the fold mountain region in the south. However, they generally inhabited poorly productive land and were nowhere really numerous in comparison to those species of zebras or antelope that inhabited the plains, for example.

==Behavior and life cycle==

Mountain zebras do not aggregate into large herds like plains zebras; they form small family groups consisting of a single stallion and one to five mares, together with their recent offspring. Bachelor males live in separate groups, and mature bachelors attempt to capture young mares to establish a harem. In this they are opposed by the dominant stallion of the group.

Mares give birth to one foal at a time, for about 3 years baby foals gets weaned onto solid forage. Cape mountain zebra foals generally move away from their maternal herds sometime between the ages of 13 and 37 months. However, with Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra, mares try to expel their foals when they are aged around 14 to 16 months. Young males may wander alone for a while before joining a bachelor group, while females are either taken into another breeding herd or are joined by a bachelor male to form a new breeding herd.

==Threats==
The main threats to the species are the loss of habitat to agriculture, hunting, and persecution. Poaching for food (for example, during guerrilla fighting) has decreased their numbers.

==Conservation==
The species is listed as vulnerable under the IUCN Red List and both sub-species are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction. In the 1930s, their population was reduced to about 100 individuals. However, consistent and vigorous conservation measures have succeeded in reversing the decline, and in 1998, the population of the Cape mountain zebra was estimated to have increased to some 1200, about 540 in national parks, 490 in provincial nature reserves, and 165 in other reserves. However, the population has increased to about over 2,700 in the wild due to conservation efforts.

Though both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, they are still threatened. The European Zoos Endangered Species Program and co-operative management of zoo populations worldwide have been set up for them.

<text>Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham, (13 September 1799 – 19 September 1841) was a British businessman, politician, diplomat and the first Governor General of the united Province of Canada.

==Early life, family, education==
Born at Waverley Abbey House, near Farnham, Surrey, Thomson was the son of John Buncombe Poulett Thomson, a London merchant, by his wife Charlotte, daughter of John Jacob. His father was the head of J. Thomson, T. Bonar and Company, a successful trading firm that had dealings with Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, and was a principal merchant house in the Russian–Baltic trade.

After attending private schools until age 16, Thomson entered the family firm at Saint Petersburg. In 1817 he came home due to poor health, and embarked on a prolonged tour of Southern Europe. He returned to Russia in 1821 and over the next three years travelled extensively in Eastern Europe. He established permanent residence in London in 1824 but frequently visited the Continent, especially Paris.

==Political career==
Thomson was returned to the House of Commons as MP for Dover in 1826. In 1830 he joined Earl Grey&#x27;s government as Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy, an office he held until 1834. In November 1831 Thomson accompanied Lord Durham to Paris to negotiate a new commercial treaty with July Monarchy France, but the project was not accomplished. He was then President of the Board of Trade under Lord Melbourne in 1834 and succeeded Lord Auckland as president, and again between 1835 and 1839. A free-trader and an expert in financial matters, he was elected MP for Manchester in 1832, a seat which he held until 1839. He was continuously occupied with negotiations affecting international commerce until 1839, when he accepted the Governorship of Canada. After his appointment as a governor general of British North America, he persuaded the legislature of Upper Canada to consent to a union with Lower Canada, and framed the constitution of the united province. In 1832 he organised a special statistical department at the board of trade, and in 1837 instituted the school of design at Somerset House, in accordance with the recommendation of a select committee of the House of Commons made in 1835.

==Governor General of Canada==

Sydenham succeeded Lord Durham as Governor General of Canada in 1839. He was responsible for implementing the Union Act in 1840, uniting Upper Canada and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada, and moving the seat of government to Kingston. Upper Canadians were given a choice in the matter of union, which they accepted; Lower Canada had no say, and as a result, many French Canadians were opposed to both the union and Sydenham himself.

Later that year, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Sydenham, of Sydenham in the County of Kent and of Toronto in Canada and was appointed knight grand cross of the Order of the Bath.

Sydenham was just as anti-French as Lord Durham had been, and he encouraged British immigration to make the French Canadian population less significant. French Canadians referred to him as &quot;le poulet&quot;, &quot;the chicken&quot;. Realising he had almost no support in Lower Canada (at this time Canada East), he reorganised electoral ridings to give the Anglo-Canadian population more votes, and in areas where that was infeasible, he allowed English mobs to beat up French candidates. Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine was one such candidate who suffered from Sydenham&#x27;s influence; Lafontaine eventually left Canada East to work with Robert Baldwin in creating a fairer union for both sides. The new constitution, after being carried through the colonial parliaments and ratified by the House of Commons, came into force on 10 February 1841. It led ultimately to the great confederation of 1867. In addition to this measure he carried another for local government, and he set on foot improvements in the matters of emigration, education, and public works. Charles Greville, in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; wrote about Thomson:
Sydenham also settled the Protestant land dispute over the clergy reserves in Upper Canada (at this time Canada West), which the Family Compact had interpreted to refer only to the Anglican Church. Sydenham convinced the legislators to pass an Act whereby half of the land set aside for Protestant churches would be shared between Anglicans and Presbyterians, and the other half would be shared between the other Protestant denominations.

Sydenham wanted to make Canada more financially independent, so that there would less danger of annexation by the United States. He had been working on this policy throughout the 1830s, when he was President of the Board of Trade in Britain, though he had little time to implement any economic reforms once he had arrived in Canada.

===Death===
After less than two years as Governor General, Sydenham died in 1841, at age 42. He had been described as sickly and an autopsy revealed severe gout. Shortly before his death, he had resigned his position and was due to return to England within weeks. However, on 4 September, Sydenham was riding a spirited horse near Parliament House, but could not, for a long time, get the animal to pass that building. After a severe application of spur and whip, however, the horse proceeded, but immediately after, put his foot upon a large stone ... not being able to recover, fell and dragged his rider with him, fracturing the leg, and lacerating it above the knee. This apparently led to a deadly infection. For fifteen days, Sydenham was described as suffering extreme pain, then died the morning of 19 September 1841. As he was unmarried, his peerage became extinct. He was buried at Kingston, in the crypt of St George&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Legacy===

====Owen Sound====
Soon after its founding, the present-day city of Owen Sound, Ontario, was named Sydenham in 1842 in honour of the recently deceased Governor of Canada; in 1856, the community became a town and was renamed Owen Sound after the adjacent body of water. Sydenham is the name of the principal river that runs through Owen Sound. Sydenham was also the name of the former Township of Sydenham, which bordered Owen Sound to the east, and in 2001 amalgamated into the municipality of Meaford, Ontario. Sydenham Community School is in Owen Sound. For more than half a century, Owen Sound&#x27;s main street was called Poulett Street; in 1909, the community&#x27;s street names were renumbered on the New York City model, and Poulett Street became 2nd Avenue East.

====Kingston====
Sydenham Public School in Kingston, Ontario, which has operated as an educational facility since its construction in 1853 as the Kingston County Grammar School, was renamed in the 1890s in memory of Lord Sydenham. It is in downtown Kingston, and is an Ontario-designated heritage building.

Sydenham High School, Ontario, a regional high school, is in the village of Sydenham, Frontenac County, Ontario, northwest of Kingston.

Sydenham Street, in downtown Kingston, runs north-south, and is a two-section street. Its southern section runs from West Street to Brock Street. Its northern section runs from Princess Street to Raglan Road. The two sections are separated by a block of buildings between Brock and Princess Streets.

Sydenham Road, also in Kingston, runs from outer Princess Street northwards to Highway 401 and beyond, to the village of Sydenham.

Sydenham Ward, a municipal electoral district in Kingston, is one of twelve such districts in the city, and this designation has been used in Kingston municipal politics since the 1840s, albeit with its boundaries modified several times over the ensuing years.

The Old Sydenham Heritage Conservation District, in the southeastern sector of Downtown Kingston, was formally designated by the city council on 24 March 2015.

====Rest of Ontario====
Sydenham Street in Simcoe, Ontario, is named in his honour.

Sydenham Street in London, Ontario, which runs between Wellington and Talbot Streets, north of Oxford Street, is also named after him.

Dixie was once named Sydenham.

====Memoirs====
His memoirs were published by his brother, G. J. Poulett Scrope, in 1844.

<doc id="278008" wikidata="Q3569613" url="?curid=278008" title="Riverdale, Bronx">
<text>Riverdale is a residential neighborhood in the northwestern portion of the New York City borough of the Bronx. Riverdale, which had a population of 47,850 as of the 2000 United States Census, contains the city&#x27;s northernmost point at the College of Mount Saint Vincent. Riverdale&#x27;s boundaries are disputed, but it is commonly agreed to be bordered by Yonkers to the north, Van Cortlandt Park and Broadway to the east, the Kingsbridge neighborhood to the southeast, either the Harlem River or the Spuyten Duyvil neighborhood to the south, and the Hudson River to the west. Riverdale Avenue is the primary north–south thoroughfare through Riverdale.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 8, and its ZIP Codes include 10463 and 10471. The area is patrolled by the 50th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
Legend states that in 1664, Anthony Van Corlaer (later determined to be a fictional character) died while attempting to swim across the Harlem River from nearby Spuyten Duyvil. In the legend, a witness to Van Corlaer&#x27;s death stated that &quot;the devil&quot; in the shape of a giant fish swam up and proceeded to &quot;seize the sturdy Anthony by the leg and drag him beneath the waves.&quot; This fictional account may be a reference to the earliest recorded shark attack in the New World. In the late 17th century, Frederick Philipse, the lord of Philipse Manor in Westchester County, received permission to construct a bridge across Spuyten Duyvil Creek and charge tolls. &quot;King&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, located roughly south of and parallel to where West 230th Street lies today, opened in 1693.

Early in its residential development, Riverdale was a 19th-century estate district where many of Manhattan&#x27;s moguls built their country estates; for example, in northern Riverdale, what is now Fieldston was part of the estate of Major Joseph Delafield, who purchased in 1829, and named it after his family&#x27;s estate in England. At the turn of the century, the new popularity of railroad commutes enabled wealthy businessmen to make Riverdale their year-round residence. Fieldston, owned by a private association, is a particularly intact example of a turn-of-the-century upper-class suburb. The Hudson Hill neighborhood retains many historic mansions. Riverdale&#x27;s elite private schools and historic churches also reflect this past. Development of the neighborhood began in the latter half of the 19th century once the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad came through. The tracks originally crossed Spuyten Duyvil Creek and into Manhattan on the west side, but Cornelius Vanderbilt wanted to consolidate his railroad operations into one terminal. He had tracks laid along the north side of the Harlem River so that trains coming south from Albany could join with the Harlem and New Haven lines and come into Manhattan down the Park Avenue main line, along modern-day Park Avenue, into his new Grand Central Depot. This is the route still used by the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line.

The Delafield family laid out lots in Fieldston in 1909 – the year after the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line (present-day ) was extended to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street, intending to develop the land, which at first was called &quot;Delafield Woods&quot;. Rather than use a grid plan, civil engineer Albert E. Wheeler, following the suggestions made by Frederick Law Olmsted and James R. Croes in 1876, designed a street plan which followed the contours of the land and preserved as much of the wooded areas as possible. The first house was begun in 1910 and finished in 1911; by the beginning of the 21st century, Fieldston, a privately owned community, was one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in New York City. Leland Weintraub, the commissioner who moved for the district&#x27;s creation, noted that &quot;most of the features commonly associated with the American romantic suburb of the mid-19th century&quot;, including &quot;a picturesque site, landscaping and architecture; connection to the city by accessible transportation and a layout adapted to the topography&quot; are present in the area.

In 1928, Genevieve Ludlow Griscom, who was a member of a small religious group called the Outer Court of the Order of the Living Christ, built a mansion at 360 West 253rd Street – also addressed as 5200 Longview Place – for the express purpose of housing Jesus Christ when the Second Coming occurred. After being derelict for a number of years under successive owners, the mansion was bought in 1987 by entrepreneur Jerry Galuten, who renovated it into an even more opulent 17 room home. After being on- and off-the market for eight years, with an asking price as high as $15 million, the house sold in January 2017 for $6.25 million.

As the 20th century progressed, upscale apartment buildings and smaller houses were added to the neighborhood. To this day, Riverdale continues to maintain its character as an affluent enclave in the city of New York. The rich history of Riverdale has led to the creation of the Riverdale Historic District.

In May 2009, the FBI ran a sting operation to prevent a bombing plot in which two Riverdale synagogues were the suggested targets. This followed a Molotov cocktail attack in 2000 on a different Riverdale synagogue and the 1989 firebombing of the Riverdale Press.

On July 26, 2010, the National Weather Service confirmed that an EF1 tornado had hit Riverdale the day before. There were no fatalities, but seven people were injured.

On December 1, 2013, a train derailment near Spuyten Duyvil station resulted in four deaths and over 70 injuries, of which 11 were critical.

== Geography ==

Riverdale covers about in area. It has one of the highest elevations in New York City, affording it views of the Empire State Building, George Washington Bridge, Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades. It is also noted for the numerous parks and expanses of greenery and original forest that complement its hilly landscape. The neighborhood is bordered on the north by the city of Yonkers in Westchester County, and on the west by the Hudson River, but its eastern and southern boundaries are frequently disputed. The &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; gives Broadway as the eastern boundary, and the Harlem River as the southern. There are several long-debated subsections of Riverdale:
* Central Riverdale (the &quot;downtown&quot; area of Riverdale – from Manhattan College Parkway to West 232nd Street and from the Henry Hudson Parkway to Riverdale Avenue and Waldo Avenue)
* Fieldston (Riverdale south of West 250th Street, east of the Henry Hudson Parkway, north of Manhattan College Parkway, and west of Tibbett Avenue)
* Hudson Hill (Riverdale above West 246th Street and west of Henry Hudson Parkway)
* North Riverdale (Riverdale above West 254th Street and west of Fieldston Road)
* Mosholu (Riverdale East of Fieldston Road and above West 254th Street, includes Spencer Ave, Huxley Rd, Post Rd, and Broadway)
* Spuyten Duyvil / South Riverdale (the southernmost section of Riverdale, below West 232nd Street or West 239th Street by some definitions. Also included is the business, commercial and shopping district located at West 231st Street and Broadway)
* Villanova Heights (a sub-division bounded by Fieldston Road on the east, 250th Street on the south, and the Henry Hudson Parkway on the west and north)

The leafy, scenic enclave of Fieldston was designated a historic district by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006. There is also a 15-acre Riverdale Historic District in the northwest of the neighborhood, designated in 1990.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Riverdale was 27,860, a change of −153 (−0.5%) from the 28,013 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 67.5% (18,794) White, 7.7% (2,136) African American, 0.1% (26) Native American, 5.3% (1,468) Asian, 0% (4) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (91) from other races, and 1.6% (446) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.6% (4,895) of the population. The neighborhood has a substantial Jewish presence. In 2003, a majority of the Jewish population in the Bronx lived in Riverdale.

The entirety of Community District 8, which comprises Riverdale, Fieldston, and Kingsbridge, had 102,927 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 80.9 years. This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 20% are between the ages of between 0–17, 28% between 25–44, and 25% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 18% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 8 was $53,986. In 2018, an estimated 15% of Riverdale residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 52% in Riverdale, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Riverdale is considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

== Housing ==

Riverdale is home to the modernist landmark Saul Victor house, designed by Ferdinand Gottlieb in 1967. Other famous mansions in the Hudson Hill neighborhood include: Greyston (1864), Alderbrook (1880), Stonehurst (1861) and Oaklawn (1863). Since 2005, Central Riverdale has experienced a building boom with the addition of many mid- and high-rise condominium buildings. With a median residence value of $579,196 as of 2013, Riverdale is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in New York City and is considered one of the most sought-after residential neighborhoods.

Before the wider development of Riverdale, housing consisted of large, architecturally distinguished mansions built in the early 20th century, mostly in Georgian- and Tudor-revival styles, which recall scenes of &quot;rural Connecticut&quot; rather than the city. These are mostly concentrated in the Fieldston section of Riverdale, known as the estate area. In addition, more affordable pre-war buildings and smaller houses are scattered throughout Riverdale. The 1950s saw the construction of many low-rise (six-story) brick buildings. By the early to mid-1960s, a number of larger brick towers (10–20 stories) started popping up. Many of these full-service buildings featuring doormen were designed by architect Philip Birnbaum, who designed more thn 300 buildings in the city, including Skyview, the Windsors and the Whitehall in Riverdale.

In 1974, a large, fortress-like residential compound and school was established in North Riverdale by the Permanent Mission of the USSR to the United Nations (now the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the UN) to house diplomats and their families. The 20-story building was constructed from the top down, with the upper floors built first.

By the 1980s, most of the apartment buildings that were owned by single landlords and rented, were converted into cooperatives. Unlike most of the Bronx, Riverdale is mostly owner-occupied housing. Spuyten Duyvil has the greatest concentration of high rises in Riverdale with the Century, 555 Kappock, and Winston Churchill next to one another. Since 2005, Central Riverdale has experienced a building boom with the addition of many mid- and high-rise condominium buildings that contrast with the older brick style.

===Arbor===
In August 2008, Columbia University purchased an almost-completed apartment building near Henry Hudson Parkway for use as faculty housing. This building would go on to be named the Arbor. The Arbor is located at 3260 Henry Hudson Parkway, at the corner of West 235th Street. It houses Columbia students who take classes at the CUIMC, Morningside, or Manhattanville campuses. Students sign one-year leases for apartments that have between one and three bedrooms.

The Arbor Shuttle operates between Morningside, CUIMC, and the Arbor, using cutaway vans. It is billed as the main means of transport between the Arbor and Morningside, but it only operates on weekdays on an hourly schedule. The shuttle formerly also served the 231st Street station, but has since been cut back to only serve the Arbor.

<doc id="278014" wikidata="Q27501462" url="?curid=278014" title="Hobo spider">
<text>The hobo spider (Eratigena agrestis, formerly Tegenaria agrestis) is a member of the family of spiders known colloquially as funnel web spiders, but not to be confused with the Australian funnel-web spider. Individuals construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto their webs. Hobo spiders sometimes build their webs in or around human habitations. Despite past claims, there is no clear evidence that the hobo spider has venom that is dangerous to humans.

== Taxonomy ==

The species was first described in 1802 by naturalist Charles Athanase Walckenaer as &quot;Aranea agrestis&quot;, in reference to its western European habitat in fields, woods, and under rocks. In 1841, Walckenaer transferred the species to the genus &quot;Tegenaria&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Tegenaria&quot; was split up, and the hobo spider was transferred to a new genus &quot;Eratigena&quot;, an anagram of &quot;Tegenaria&quot;.

==Identification==
Spiders, including the hobo spider, vary considerably in appearance, and identification can be difficult. The hobo spider is 7–14 mm in body length, and brownish in color. Identification relies on an examination of the spider&#x27;s anatomy. Like many species of spider the positive identification of &quot;Eratigena agrestis&quot; requires microscopic examination of the epigynum and palpal bulb (the female and male sex organs respectively) and is best done by an arachnologist. However, the following characteristics identify hobo spiders among other species with a similar general appearance:

* Hobo spiders lack the colored bands found on many spiders of the family Agelenidae where the leg joints meet.
* The abdomen has chevron (V-shaped) patterns (possibly many of them) down the middle, with the chevrons pointing towards the head.
* Hobo spiders have a light stripe running down the middle of the sternum. If the spider instead has three or four pairs of light spots on the lateral portions of the sternum, then it is one of the other two related &quot;Eratigena&quot; species. However absence of spots is not conclusive proof that the spider is a hobo spider, since the spots on other &quot;Eratigena&quot; species may be extremely faint and not readily visible.
* Hobo spiders do not have two distinct longitudinal dark stripes on the top side of the cephalothorax, instead showing indistinct or diffused patterns. Washington spiders with distinct dark stripes include spiders from the genera &quot;Agelenopsis&quot; and &quot;Hololena&quot; and possibly some wolf spiders.

== Distribution and habitat ==

&quot;Eratigena agrestis&quot; is distributed from Europe to Central Asia, and is also found in western North America, in the Pacific Northwest and Great Basin. It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species, and is present on the small artificial island of Peberholm, probably having been carried there by trains.

It is a resident of fields, avoiding human habitations occupied by major competitors, particularly the giant house spider (&quot;Eratigena atrica&quot;), which is a common resident of houses and other man-made structures in Europe. As a result, human contacts with the hobo spider are uncommon in Europe. Hobo spiders build a horizontal, trampoline-like web near brick walls or wood piles where the spider has shelter and awaits prey.

The hobo spider lays its eggs in September and they hatch during late spring. After the male hobo spider mates it dies.

==Bite effects==

Although the toxicity and aggression of the hobo spider have long been debated, there is little evidence that the hobo spider is a dangerously venomous species. The CDC reported case studies in the 1990s claiming that the hobo spider bite caused isolated cases of necrosis in people, but as of 2017, the CDC no longer lists the hobo spider among venomous species. In Canada, there is no evidence that hobo spider bites cause skin necrosis. Some bites reportedly from the closely related desert grass spider, &quot;Agelenopsis aperta,&quot; may have been inaccurately reported and may have actually been from the hobo spider.

<text>Charles Henry Holden (12 May 1875 – 1 May 1960) was an English architect best known for designing many London Underground stations during the 1920s and 1930s, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London&#x27;s headquarters at 55 Broadway, for the University of London&#x27;s Senate House and for Bristol Central Library. He created many war cemeteries in Belgium and northern France for the Imperial War Graves Commission.

After working and training in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, but for most of his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings&#x27; intended functions. After the First World War, he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He was a member of the Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers&#x27; Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.

Although not without its critics, his architecture is widely appreciated. He was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects&#x27; (RIBA&#x27;s) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation&#x27;s standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.

== Early life ==
Charles Henry Holden was born on 12 May 1875 at Great Lever, Bolton, the fifth and youngest child of Joseph Holden (1842–1918), a draper and milliner, and Ellen (née Broughton, 1841–1890) Holden. Holden&#x27;s childhood was marred by his father&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1884 and his mother&#x27;s death when he was fifteen years old. Following the loss of his father&#x27;s business, the family moved to St Helens, where his father returned to his earlier trade and worked as an iron turner and fitter and where he attended a number of schools.

He briefly had jobs as a laboratory assistant and a railway clerk in St Helens. During this period he attended draughting classes at the YMCA and considered a career as an engineer in Sir Douglas Fox&#x27;s practice. In 1891 he began working for his brother-in-law, David Frederick Green, a land surveyor and architect in Bolton. In April 1892 he was articled to Manchester architect Everard W. Leeson and, while training with him, also studied at the Manchester School of Art (1893–94) and Manchester Technical School (1894–96).

While working and studying in Manchester, Holden formed friendships with artist Muirhead Bone and his future brother-in-law Francis Dodd. About this time Holden was introduced to the writings of Walt Whitman and became friends with James William Wallace and a number of the members of Bolton&#x27;s Whitman society known as the &quot;Eagle Street College&quot;. Whitman&#x27;s writings and those of Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Edward Carpenter were major influences on Holden&#x27;s life. He incorporated many of their philosophies and principles into his style of living and method of working.

In 1895 and 1896 Holden submitted designs to &quot;Building News&quot; Designing Club competitions using the pseudonym &quot;The Owl&quot;. Although the number of competing submissions made was not always large, from nine competition entries, Holden won five first places, three second places and one third place. In 1897, he entered the competition for the RIBA&#x27;s prestigious Soane Medallion for student architects. Of fourteen entries, Holden&#x27;s submission for the competition&#x27;s subject, a &quot;Provincial Market Hall&quot;, came third. Holden described the design as being inspired by the work of John Belcher, Edgar Wood and Arthur Beresford Pite.

== Family life ==

Around 1898 Holden began living with Margaret Steadman (née Macdonald, 1865–1954), a nurse and midwife. They were introduced by Holden&#x27;s older sister, Alice, and became friends through their common interest in Whitman. Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman, a university tutor, because of his alcoholism and abuse. Steadman and her husband were never divorced and, though she and Holden lived as a married couple and Holden referred to her as his wife, the relationship was never formalised, even after James Steadman&#x27;s death in 1930.

The Holdens lived in suburban Norbiton, Surrey (now Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames) until 1902, when they moved to Codicote in Hertfordshire. Around 1906, they moved to Harmer Green near Welwyn, where Holden designed a house for them. The house was plainly furnished and the couple lived a simple life, described by Janet Ashbee in 1906 as &quot;bananas and brown bread on the table; no hot water; plain living and high thinking and strenuous activity for the betterment of the World&quot;. The couple had no children together, though Margaret had a son, Allan, from her marriage. Charles and Margaret Holden lived at Harmer Green for the rest of their lives.

Holden left Leeson&#x27;s practice in 1896 and worked for Jonathan Simpson in Bolton in 1896 and 1897, working on house designs there and at Port Sunlight, before moving to London to work for Arts and Crafts designer Charles Robert Ashbee. His time with Ashbee was short and, in October 1899, he became chief assistant in H. Percy Adams&#x27; practice, where he remained for the rest of his career.

A number of Holden&#x27;s early designs were for hospitals, which Adams&#x27; practice specialised in. At this early stage in his career, he produced designs in a variety of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences of a number of architects. Holden soon took charge of most of the practice&#x27;s design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School. He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.

His red brick arts and craft façades for the Belgrave Hospital for Children in Kennington, south London (1900–03), were influenced by Philip Webb and Henry Wilson and feature steeply pitched roofs, corner towers and stone window surrounds. The building, now converted to apartments, is Grade II* listed.

In 1902, Holden won the architectural competition to design the Bristol Central Library. His Tudor Revival façades in bath stone incorporate modernist elements complementing the adjacent Abbey Gate of Bristol Cathedral. The front façade features oriel windows and sculpture groups with Chaucer, Bede and Alfred the Great by Charles Pibworth. Internally, the design is classical, with the furniture designed by Holden and the stone carving mostly by William Aumonier. It was described by architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;free Neo-Tudor&quot; and &quot;extremely pretty&quot; and by Andor Gomme as &quot;one of the great masterpieces of the early Modern Movement&quot;. It has been compared with Charles Rennie Mackintosh&#x27;s Glasgow School of Art and it is sometimes suggested that Mackintosh&#x27;s designs for the later part of the school were inspired by Holden&#x27;s, although Pevsner noted that Mackintosh&#x27;s designs were in circulation earlier. The building is Grade I listed.

At Midhurst, West Sussex, Holden designed Tudor-style façades for the Sir Ernest Cassel-funded King Edward VII Sanatorium (1903–06). The building features long wings of south-facing rooms to maximise patients&#x27; exposure to sunlight and fresh air. The design is in keeping with the building&#x27;s rural setting, with façades in the local tile-hung style. Pevsner called this &quot;certainly one of the best buildings of its date in the country&quot; and &quot;a model of how to build very large institutions&quot;. He designed the sanitorium&#x27;s V-shaped open-air chapel so that it could be used for both outdoor and indoor worship. Both buildings are Grade II* listed. Other hospitals he designed in this period include the British Seamen&#x27;s Hospital in Istanbul (1903–04) and the Women&#x27;s Hospital in Soho, central London (1908).

For The Law Society he designed (1902–04) a simplified neoclassical extension to the existing Lewis Vulliamy-designed building in Chancery Lane with external sculptures by Charles Pibworth and a panelled arts and crafts interior with carving by William Aumonier and friezes by Conrad Dressler. Pevsner considered the façades to be Mannerist: &quot;The fashionable term Mannerism can here be used legitimately; for Holden indeed froze up and invalidated current classical motifs, which is what Mannerist architects did in the Cinquecento.&quot;

In 1906, Holden won the architectural competition to design a new headquarters for the British Medical Association on the corner of The Strand and Agar Street (now Zimbabwe House). The six-storey L-shaped building replaced a collection of buildings on the site already occupied by the Association and provided it with accommodation for a council chamber, library and offices on the upper floors above space for shops on the ground floor and in the basement. Described by Powers as &quot;classicism reduced to geometric shapes&quot;, the first three storeys are clad in grey Cornish granite with Portland stone above. Located at second floor level was a controversial series of tall sculptures representing the development of science and the ages of man by Jacob Epstein. The building is Grade II* listed. Alastair Service considered it &quot;perhaps his best London building&quot;.

In 1909, Holden won the design competition for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently, dedicated to the memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey loggias, and are a further simplification of Holden&#x27;s style.

The practice became Adams &amp; Holden in 1907 when Holden became a partner and Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson when Lionel Pearson became a partner in 1913. In 1913, Holden was awarded the RIBA&#x27;s Godwin medal and £65 to study architecture abroad. He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments at American universities in preparation for his design of the Wren-influenced Kings College for Women, Kensington. Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in Holborn and Oxford Street, an extension in red brick of Alfred Waterhouse&#x27;s Shire Hall in Bedford, and Arts and Crafts Sutton Valence School, Kent.

Holden also worked with Epstein on the tomb of Oscar Wilde at Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris (1911–12). In 1915, he was a founding member of the Design and Industries Association and he was a member of the Art Workers&#x27; Guild from 1917. Unsuccessful competition entries for which he produced designs include Strathclyde Royal Infirmary (1901), Manchester Royal Infirmary (1904), County Hall (1907), the National Library of Wales (1909), Coventry Town Hall (1911) and the Board of Trade building (1915).
=== War cemeteries and memorials ===
The Holdens shared a strong sense of personal duty and service. In the First World War, Margaret Holden joined the &quot;Friends&#x27; Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in distress&quot; which helped refugees of those countries stranded in London by the conflict. Charles Holden served with the Red Cross&#x27;s London Ambulance Column as a stretcher-bearer transferring wounded troops from London&#x27;s stations to its hospitals. Holden also served on the fire watch at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral between 1915 and 1917.

On 3 October 1917, Holden was appointed a temporary lieutenant with the army&#x27;s Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He travelled to the French battlefields for the first time later that month and began planning new cemeteries and expanding existing ones. Holden described his experience:

The country is one vast wilderness, blasted out of recognition where once villages &amp; orchards &amp; fertile land, now tossed about &amp; churned in hopeless disorder with never a landmark as far as the eye can reach &amp; dotted about in the scrub and untidiness of it all are to be seen here &amp; there singly &amp; in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried.
In September 1918, Holden transferred to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, probably on the one at Forceville that was selected as the prototype for all that followed.

In 1920, he was promoted to be the fourth principal architect. His work for the Commission included memorials to the New Zealand missing dead at Messines Ridge British Cemetery, and the Buttes New British Cemetery at Zonnebeke. His designs were stripped of ornament, often using simply detailed masses of Portland stone in the construction of the shelters and other architectural elements. Philip Longworth&#x27;s history of the Commission described Holden&#x27;s pavilions at Wimereux Communal Cemetery as &quot;almost cruelly severe&quot;.

In 1922, Holden designed the War Memorial Gateway for Clifton College, Bristol, using a combination of limestone and gritstone to match the Gothic style of the school&#x27;s buildings. For the British War Memorials Committee, he produced a design for a Hall of Remembrance (1918) that would have been in the form of an art gallery, and for New College, Oxford, he created a design for a tiny memorial chapel (1919). Neither was constructed.

=== London Transport ===

Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association, Holden met Frank Pick, general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this changed through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster Underground station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL&#x27;s pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL&#x27;s own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.

During the later 1920s, Holden designed a series of replacement buildings and new façades for station improvements around the UERL&#x27;s network. Many of these featured Portland stone cladding and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension. At Piccadilly Circus, one of the busiest stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.

In 1926, Holden began the design of a new headquarters for the UERL at 55 Broadway above St James&#x27;s Park station. Above the first floor, the steel-framed building was constructed to a cruciform plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a central clock tower tall. The arrangement maximises daylight to the building&#x27;s interior without the use of light wells. Like his stations of the period and his pre-First World War commercial buildings, the block is austerely clad in Portland stone. Holden again detailed the façades with commissioned sculptures; &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot;, two compositions by Epstein, are at first floor level, and a series of eight bas-reliefs at the seventh floor represent the four winds (two for each of the cardinal directions, on each side of the projecting wings). The building is Grade I listed.

In 1930, Holden and Pick made a tour of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to see the latest developments in modern architecture. The UERL was planning extensions of the Piccadilly line to the west, north-west and north of London, and a new type of station was wanted. Adapting the architectural styles he had seen on the tour, Holden created functional designs composed of simple forms: cylinders, curves and rectangles, built in plain brick, concrete and glass. The extensions to the west and north-west were over existing routes operated by the District line and required a number of stations to be rebuilt to accommodate additional tracks or to replace original, basic buildings. Sudbury Town, the first station to be rebuilt in 1931, formed a template for many of the other new stations that followed: a tall rectangular brick box with a concrete flat roof and panels of vertical glazing to allow light into the interior. The Grade II* listed building was described by Pevsner as &quot;an outstanding example of how satisfying such unpretentious buildings can be, purely through the use of careful details and good proportions.&quot;

For Arnos Grove station, one of eight new stations on the northern extension of the line, Holden modified the rectangular box into a circular drum, a design inspired by Gunnar Asplund&#x27;s Stockholm Public Library. Also notable on the northern extension is Southgate station; here Holden designed a single-storey circular building with a canopied flat roof. Above this, the central section of roof rises up on a continuous horizontal band of clerestory windows, supported internally by a single central column. The building is topped by an illuminated feature capped with a bronze ball. Other stations show the influence of Willem Marinus Dudok&#x27;s work in Hilversum, Netherlands. In order to handle such a large volume of work, Holden delegated significant design responsibility to his assistants, such as Charles Hutton, who took the lead on Arnos Grove Station. For some other Piccadilly line stations the design was handled in-house by Stanley Heaps or by other architectural practices. All followed the modern brick, glass and concrete house style defined by Holden, but some lacked Holden&#x27;s originality and attention to detail; Pick dubbed these &quot;Holdenesque&quot;.

The UERL became part of London Transport in 1933, but the focus remained on high quality design. Under Pick, Holden&#x27;s attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of London&#x27;s transport network, from designing bus and tram shelters to a new type of six-wheeled omnibus. In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at Highgate, East Finchley and Finchley Central and new stations at Elstree South and Bushey Heath for the Northern line&#x27;s Northern Heights plan. Holden&#x27;s designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: Dick Whittington for Highgate, a Roman centurion at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley. Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled. Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part; the other plans were scrapped. East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below. Making use of the station&#x27;s air-rights, Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms. Eric Aumonier provided the statue &quot;The Archer&quot;, a prominent feature of the station.

Holden&#x27;s last designs for London Transport were three new stations for the Central line extension in north-east London. These were designed in the 1930s, but were also delayed by the war and were not completed until 1947. Post-war austerity measures reduced the quality of the materials used compared with the 1930s stations and the building at Wanstead was adapted from a temporary structure constructed during the line&#x27;s wartime use as an underground factory. Gants Hill is accessed through subways and has no station building, but is notable for the design of its platform level concourse, which features a barrel vaulted ceiling inspired by stations on the Moscow Metro.
=== University of London ===
After the First World War, the University of London needed a replacement for its overcrowded and scattered accommodation in Kensington. A site was acquired in Bloomsbury near the British Museum and Holden was commissioned in 1931 to design the new buildings, partly due to the success of 55 Broadway. His original plan was for a single structure covering the whole site, stretching almost from Montague Place to Torrington Street. It comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to the perimeter façade and enclosing a series of courtyards. The scheme was to be topped by two towers: a smaller one to the north, and a 19-storey, tall Senate House.

Construction began in 1932, but due to a shortage of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden&#x27;s intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.

Senate House divided opinion. Pevsner described its style as &quot;strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism&quot;, and summarised: &quot;The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden&#x27;s smaller Underground stations.&quot; Others have described it as Stalinist, or as totalitarian due to its great scale. Functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn wrote to Holden in 1938 that he was &quot;very much taken and ... convinced that there is no finer building in London.&quot; Historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a &quot;static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years&quot;, but thought &quot;the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece.&quot; The onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme, although Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson did design further buildings for the university in the vicinity.

=== Town planning ===
With virtually no new work being commissioned, Holden spent the war years planning for the reconstruction that would be required once it was over. Holden was a member of the RIBA&#x27;s twelve-man committee which formulated the institute&#x27;s policy for post-war reconstruction. Holden&#x27;s town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville where workers could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.

In 1944–45, Holden produced plans for the reconstruction of Canterbury, Kent, with the City Architect Herbert Millson Enderby. Canterbury had been badly damaged by Luftwaffe bombing including the Baedeker raids in May and June 1942. Holden and Enderby aimed to preserve much of the character of the city, but planned for the compulsory purchase of of the town centre for large scale reconstruction including a new civic way from the cathedral to a new town hall. Outside the city, they planned bypasses and a ring road at a two-mile (3.2-kilometre) radius of the centre. Although approved by the city council, the plan was widely opposed by residents and freeholders and the &quot;Canterbury Citizens Defence Association&quot; issued an alternative plan before taking control of the council at local elections in November 1945. The change in administration ended the proposals, although a new plan prepared in 1947 without Holden&#x27;s or Enderby&#x27;s involvement retained some of their ideas including the ring road.

The City of London&#x27;s first reconstruction plan was written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and William Morrison, Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the City of London Corporation to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed. Holden&#x27;s and Holford&#x27;s City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.

In 1947, Holden planned a scheme on behalf of the London County Council for the South Bank of the River Thames between County Hall and Waterloo Bridge, including a plan for a concert hall with the council&#x27;s architect Edwin Williams. The scheme received little attention and was almost immediately superseded by plans to develop the area as the site of the Festival of Britain. Holden was also architectural and planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh and to the Borough of Tynemouth.

=== Final years ===
Although Charles Holden had gradually reduced his workload, he was still continuing to go into the office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, but even then he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.

One of Holden&#x27;s last public engagements was when he acted as a sponsor at the award of the RIBA&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal to Le Corbusier in 1953. The last project that Holden worked on was a much criticised headquarters building for English Electric in Aldwych, London. In 1952, Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson were appointed by English Electric&#x27;s chairman, Sir George Nelson, and Holden designed a monolithic stone building around a courtyard. In 1955, the London County Council persuaded English Electric to put the scheme aside and hold a limited architectural competition for a new design. Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson submitted a design, but were beaten by Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners. When that practice later refused Sir George Nelson&#x27;s request to redesign the façades, Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson were reappointed and Charles Holden revised his practice&#x27;s competition entry. The new design was criticised by the Royal Fine Art Commission and a further redesign was carried out by one of Holden&#x27;s partners to produce the final design, described by Pevsner as &quot;a dull, lifeless building, stone-faced and with nothing to recommend it&quot;.

Holden died on 1 May 1960. He was cremated at Enfield Crematorium and his ashes were spread in the garden of the Friends&#x27; Meeting House in Hertford. On 2 June 1960 a memorial service was held at St Pancras New Church, where Holden had designed the altar in 1914. Obituaries were published in daily newspapers &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and in construction industry periodicals including &quot;The Builder&quot;, &quot;Architectural Review&quot;, &quot;Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects&quot; and &quot;Journal of the Town Planning Institute&quot;. Generally, the obituaries were positive about Holden&#x27;s early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice&#x27;s later works. The Harmer Green house and most of its contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left £8,400 to friends and staff and £2,000 to charity.

== Holden on architecture ==
Holden recognised that his architectural style placed him in &quot;rather a curious position, not quite in the fashion and not quite out of it; not enough of a traditionalist to please the traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please the modernists.&quot; He believed that the principal aim of design was to achieve &quot;fitness for purpose&quot;, and repeatedly called for a style of architecture that avoided unnecessary architectural adornment.

In 1905, in an essay titled &quot;If Whitman had been an Architect&quot;, Holden made an anonymous plea to architects for a new form of modern architecture: &quot;Often I hear of the glory of the architecture of ancient Greece; of the proud Romans; of sombre Egypt; the praise of vast Byzantium and the lofty Middle Ages, too, I hear. But of the glory of the architecture of the Modern I never hear. Come, you Modern Buildings, come! Throw off your mantle of deceits; your cornices, pilasters, mouldings, swags, scrolls; behind them all, behind your dignified proportions, your picturesque groupings, your arts and crafts prettinesses and exaggerated techniques; behind and beyond them all hides the one I love.&quot;

In his 1936 speech when presented with the RIBA&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal, Holden defined his position: &quot;It was not so much a matter of creating a new style, as of discarding those incrustations which counted for style ... surface embroidery empty of structural significance&quot;. His method was to focus on &quot;those more permanent basic factors of architecture, the plan, and the planes and masses arising out of the plan.&quot; He described his ideal building as one &quot;which takes naturally and inevitably the form controlled by the plan and the purpose and the materials. A building which provides opportunities for the exercise and skill and pleasure in work not only to the designer but also for the many craftsmen employed and the occupants of the building.&quot;

In a 1957 essay on architecture, he wrote &quot;I don&#x27;t seek for a style, either ancient or modern, I want an architecture which is through and through &quot;good building&quot;. A building planned for a specific purpose, constructed in the method and use of materials, old or new, most appropriate to the purpose the building has to serve.&quot;

== Recognition and legacy ==
Holden won the RIBA&#x27;s London Architecture Medal for 1929 (awarded 1931) for 55 Broadway. In 1936 he was awarded the RIBA&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal for his body of work. He was Vice President of the RIBA from 1935 to 1937 and a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 1933 to 1947. In 1943 he was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry for the design of transport equipment. He was awarded honorary doctorates by Manchester University in 1936 and London University in 1946. Many of Holden&#x27;s buildings have been granted listed status, protecting them against demolition and unapproved alteration.

Holden declined the invitation to become a Royal Academician in 1942, having previously been nominated, but refused because of his connection to Epstein. He twice declined a knighthood, in 1943 and 1951, as he considered it to be at odds with his simple lifestyle and considered architecture a collaborative process.

The RIBA holds a collection of Holden&#x27;s personal papers and material from Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson. The RIBA staged exhibitions of his work at the Heinz Gallery in 1988 and at the Victoria and Albert Museum between October 2010 and February 2011. A public house near Colliers Wood Underground station has been named &quot;The Charles Holden&quot;, taking &quot;inspiration&quot; from the architect.

<text>PSK31 or &quot;Phase Shift Keying, 31 Baud&quot;, also BPSK31 and QPSK31, is a popular computer-sound card-generated radioteletype mode, used primarily by amateur radio operators to conduct real-time keyboard-to-keyboard chat, most often using frequencies in the high frequency amateur radio bands (shortwave). PSK31 is distinguished from other digital modes in that it is specifically tuned to have a data rate close to typing speed, and has an extremely narrow bandwidth, allowing many conversations in the same bandwidth as a single voice channel. This narrow bandwidth makes better use of the RF energy in a very narrow space thus allowing relatively low-power equipment (5 watts) to communicate globally using the same skywave propagation used by shortwave radio stations.

== History ==
PSK31 was developed and named by English amateur radio operator Peter Martinez (call sign G3PLX) and introduced to the wider amateur radio community in December 1998.

The 31 baud BPSK modulation system used in PSK31 was introduced by Pawel Jalocha (SP9VRC) in his SLOWBPSK program written for Motorola&#x27;s EVM radio. Instead of the traditional frequency-shift keying, the information is transmitted by patterns of polarity-reversals (sometimes called 180-degree phase shifts). PSK31 was enthusiastically received, and its usage spread rapidly worldwide, lending a new popularity and tone to the on-air conduct of digital communications. Due to the efficiency of the mode, it became, and still remains, especially popular with operators whose circumstances do not permit the installation of large antenna systems, the use of high power, or both.

== Use and implementation ==
A PSK31 operator typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver connected to the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an audio tone that sounds, to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight warble. This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive attenuator to reduce the sound card&#x27;s output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.
From the perspective of the transmitter, the sound amounts to little more than somebody whistling into the microphone. However, the software rapidly shifts the phase of the audio signal between two states (hence the name &quot;phase-shift keying&quot;), forming the character codes. These phase shifts serve the same function as the two tones used in traditional RTTY and similar systems.

To decode PSK31, the audio whistle received from the transceiver&#x27;s headphone output is fed into a computer sound card&#x27;s audio input, and software decodes it. The software displays the decoded text.

Because PSK31 was developed for use through a computer&#x27;s sound card, many programs have since been created to use the same technology for other modes, such as RTTY, Hellschreiber, and Olivia MFSK. So, once it has been set up to run PSK31, a computer can be used for a variety of digital message transmission modes.

Aside from a standard radio transceiver and a computer with a sound card, very little equipment is required to use PSK31. Normally, an older computer and a few cables will suffice, and many PSK31 software applications are free and open source. Many operators now use a commercially available interface/modem device (or &quot;nomic&quot; ) between their computers and radios. These devices incorporate the necessary impedance matching and sound level adjustment to permit the sound card output to be injected into the microphone input, send the radio&#x27;s audio output to the sound card input, and handle the radio&#x27;s transmit-receive switching. Sound card to radio interfaces typically use isolation transformers on both the send and receive audio paths
to eliminate hum caused by ground-loops. Many interfaces also incorporate their own sound card and can be powered and run from the computer via a single USB connection. Some modern transceivers have these interfaces built in, requiring only a USB connection from the computer to the radio.

== Resistance to interference ==
Like other narrow band digital modes, PSK31 can often overcome interference and poor propagation conditions in situations where voice or other methods of communication fail. However, PSK31 was designed only for leisure use by amateurs, and due to its relatively slow speed and limited error control, is not suitable for transmitting large blocks of data or text, or critical data requiring high immunity from errors.

PSK31 works well over propagation paths that preserve phase, and resists fading (QSB) well. However, it can be adversely affected by propagation modes—such as transpolar paths—where auroral &quot;flutter&quot; or multipathing can disrupt the signal phase continuity. In such cases the use of QPSK (see below) is often beneficial.

Some software supports PSK10 and PSK05 variants, running at 10 baud and 5 baud, respectively. These slower speeds sacrifice throughput to provide greater resistance to noise and other interference. Conversely, PSK63 is increasingly used for faster exchanges, especially during amateur radio contest operating.

== Technical information ==

PSK31 is typically created by software that generates an amplitude- and phase-modulated waveform that is converted to an audio frequency analog signal by a sound card. In the most-commonly-used variant, BPSK31, binary information is transmitted by either imparting a 180-degree phase shift (a binary &quot;zero&quot;) or no phase shift (a binary &quot;one&quot;) in each 32ms symbol interval. The 180-degree phase shift for a &quot;zero&quot; bit code occurs at a null amplitude.

As shown in the figure, a cosine filter is used to smooth the rise and fall times of the audio waveform and eliminate key clicks. All subsequent amplification of the signal must be linear to preserve the modulation waveform and ensure minimum occupied bandwidth. In practice, this means limiting the transmit audio volume to below the level where the transmitter generates Automatic Level Control (ALC) feedback and disabling any audio compression or speech processing.

The Varicode is a kind of Fibonacci code where the boundaries between character codes are marked by two or more consecutive zeros. Like all Fibonacci codes, since no character code contains more than one consecutive zero, the software can easily identify the spaces between characters, regardless of the length of the character. The idle sequence, sent when an operator is not typing, is a continuous sequence of phase-shifts, which do not print on the screen. Martinez arranged the character alphabet so that, as in Morse code, the more frequently occurring characters have the shortest encodings, while rarer characters use longer encodings. He named this encoding scheme &quot;varicode&quot;.

PSK31&#x27;s symbol rate of 31.25 Hz was chosen because a normal typing speed of about 50 words per minute requires a bit rate of about 32 bits per second, and specifically because 31.25 Hz could easily be derived from the 8 kHz sample rate used in many DSP systems, including those used in the computer sound cards commonly used for PSK31 operation (31.25 Hz is 8 kHz divided by 256, and so can be derived from 8 kHz by halving the frequency eight times in succession).

== BPSK31 and QPSK31 variants ==
Colloquial usage of the term &#x27;PSK31&#x27; in amateur radio usually implies the use of the most commonly used variant of PSK31: binary phase shift keying (BPSK). The BPSK variant of PSK31 uses no error control. QPSK31, the variant based on quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), uses four phases instead of two. It is simple to switch from BPSK to QPSK if difficulties arise during a contact; QPSK31 has the same number of symbols per second, and hence the same bandwidth as the BPSK variant. In a coherent receiver, the bit error probability of QPSK is the same as for BPSK operating at the same power, making QPSK31 the generally preferable mode from a robustness, and thus reach, point of view.

Using four instead of two constellation points provides twice the physical layer bit rate, which allows addition of redundant information to provide a degree of forward error correction. When QPSK is used, after encoding into varicode, the bits of the binary data signal is subject to a rate-1/2 channel code, which means that for every information bit, two code bits are calculated and transmitted. For that, a convolutional code with constraint length 5 (i.e. the last five bits from the input are incorporated to select two output bits per input bit) is used.

The resulting bits are mapped to a quaternary set of phases. At the receiver, a decoder for the convolutional code needs to be used, typically the Viterbi Algorithm, which is able to reconstruct the most likely sent sequence, even if multiple symbols were received incorrectly. Optimal decoding must take into account the same constraint length of information bits as encoding, yielding a 5-symbol decoding delay, which corresponds to 160 ms of delay.

== Spectrum efficiency compared to other modes ==
PSK31&#x27;s efficiency and narrow bandwidth make it highly suitable for low-power and crowded-band operation. PSK31 contacts can be conducted at less than 100 Hz separation, so with disciplined operation at least twenty simultaneous PSK31 contacts can be carried out side-by-side in the 2.5 kHz bandwidth required for just one SSB voice contact.

== Common frequencies ==
The following amateur radio frequencies are commonly used for transmitting and receiving PSK31 signals. They normally occupy the lower edge of each band&#x27;s digital modes section. PSK31 operators generally use upper sideband (USB), even on frequencies below 10 MHz where the convention normally calls for lower sideband. This is because (a) signals then spread upwards into the digimode section from the &quot;base&quot; frequency, and (b) using QPSK requires both stations to use the same sideband.

* Current usage as of 2010, based on observation, is centered on 7,070.15 and 21,070.15. 7,035.15 is commonly used in Region 2 as of 2012. There is no authoritative list, as the frequencies are determined by common convention.

** PSK has moved from 18.100 to 18.097 due to FT8 use of the 18.100 frequency as of November, 2019.

The IARU Region 1 Bandplan was revised in March 2009 to reflect the expanded 40 meter band. The CW-only section within Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the former USSR is now 7.000 to 7.040. Region 2 - The Americas - followed in September 2013. Region 3 - South Asia and Australasia - has not yet synchronised its bandplan with Regions 1 and 2.

<text>The National Basketball Association All-Star Game is the annual all-star game hosted each February by the National Basketball Association (NBA) and showcases 24 of the league&#x27;s star players. Since 2022, it was held on the third Sunday of February, the same day that the Daytona 500 was held usually the week after the Super Bowl. It is the featured event of NBA All-Star Weekend, a three-day event which goes from Friday to Sunday. The All-Star Game was first played at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951.

The starting lineup for each squad is selected by a combination of fan, player, and media voting, while head coaches choose the reserves, seven players from their respective conferences, so each side has a 12-man roster. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. If a selected player cannot participate because of injury, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement.

Traditionally, the NBA All-Star Game pitted the top players from both the Eastern Division/Eastern Conference and the Western Division/Western Conference. From 2018 to 2023, the teams were represented by the leading vote-getter from each conference and each player regardless of conference was chosen to either team via a draft. The teams also play for a charity of their choice to help the games remain competitive.

The head coach of the team with the best record in each conference is chosen to lead their respective conference in the All-Star Game, with a prohibition against consecutive appearances. Known as the &quot;Riley Rule&quot;, it was created after perennially successful Los Angeles Lakers head coach Pat Riley earned the right to coach the Western Conference team eight times in nine seasons between 1982 and 1990. The coach of the team with the next best record gets to coach instead.

==History==
The idea of holding an All-Star Game was conceived during a meeting between NBA President Maurice Podoloff, NBA publicity director Haskell Cohen and Boston Celtics owner Walter A. Brown. At that time, the basketball world had just been rocked by the college basketball point-shaving scandal.

To regain public attention to the league, Cohen suggested the league to host an exhibition game featuring the league&#x27;s best players, similar to Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-Star Game. Although most people, including Podoloff, were pessimistic about the idea, Brown remained confident that it would be a success, and he offered to host the game and to cover all the expenses or potential losses incurred from the game. 

The first All-Star Game was hosted at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951, where the Eastern All-Stars team defeated the Western All-Stars team, 111–94. Boston Celtics&#x27; Ed Macauley was named as the first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, and the All-Star Game became a success, drawing an attendance of 10,094, much higher than that season&#x27;s average attendance of 3,500. 

In 2010, the NBA All-Star Game set the attendance record for a basketball game with 108,713 people attending at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This shattered the existing attendance record previously held at Ford Field on December 13, 2003, when 78,129 attendees watched Michigan State play Kentucky.

The 2017 All-Star Weekend was originally awarded to Charlotte, North Carolina. On March 23, 2016, North Carolina passed House Bill 2, also known as a &quot;bathroom bill&quot;, which was seen as discriminatory against transgender persons. As a result, the NBA announced that it would move the game to another city if the bill was not repealed or revised. After North Carolina took no action, on July 21, 2016, the NBA announced that the 2017 game would be moved to New Orleans. In March 2017, after several provisions of the bill were partially repealed, the NBA awarded the 2019 All-Star Weekend to Charlotte.

On October 3, 2017, the NBA and NBPA announced changes to the game format, starting in 2018. Instead of being divided by conference, the top vote leaders for each conference would be team captains and hold a draft to choose among the rest of the starters and reserves, regardless of conference.

In 2023, Candace Parker became the first female color commentator for an NBA All-Star Game.

On October 25, 2023, the NBA brought back the conference-based format for the 2024 All-Star Game. The untimed fourth quarter (known as Elam Ending), which had been in used since 2020 in honor of Kobe Bryant, was also removed. However, the charity aspect was retained, with the team that scores the most points in each quarter winning a cash prize that went to their chosen charity.

A new format for the 2025 All-Star Game featured a mini-tournament with four teams of eight players: three teams featuring 24 NBA All-Star selections, and a fourth team composed of the winning team from the Rising Stars Challenge, an exhibition game pitting a mix of NBA rookies and sophomores plus standouts from the NBA G League. Each team was named after the analysts of &quot;Inside the NBA&quot;. The head coaches in the tournament will still come from the teams who had the best record in their respective conference through February 2, with the assistant coaches from either team taking over the Rising Stars team and the remaining All-Star team. Three games will be played, and whichever team scores 40 points wins.

==Rosters selection==
The starting five from each conference consists of three frontcourt players and two guards, selected by a combination of fan, player, and media voting. In 2017, the NBA moved from a pure fan vote to a weighted process wherein fan voting accounts for 50%, with player and media voting account for 25% each. Prior to 2013, fans selected two forwards and one center instead of generic frontcourt players. The NBA in 2003 began offering All-Star ballots in three languages—English, Spanish and Chinese—for fan voting of the starters.

NBA coaches vote for the reserves for their respective conferences, but they cannot choose players from their own team. Each coach selects two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards, with each selected player ranked in order of preference within each category. If a multi-position player is to be selected, coaches are encouraged to vote for the player at the position that is &quot;most advantageous for the All-Star team&quot;, regardless of where the player is listed on the All-Star ballot or the position he is listed in box scores. If a player is unavailable for the game due to injury, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement for the roster. If the replacement is for a fan-selected starter, the All-Star Game coach chooses the replacement in the starting lineup, and is not limited to the commissioner&#x27;s addition to the roster. 

Multiple All-Star players can be chosen from one team, with the record being four. This has occurred nine times, the first such instance being in 1962, when four players each from the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers were chosen. The most recent game with four All-Star players from one team was the Golden State Warriors in the 2018 game.

==The game==
The game is played under normal NBA rules with some differences. Since the starting All-Stars are selected by fans, players, and media, players sometimes start the game at atypical positions. For instance, in the 2007 game, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady were chosen as the starting Western Conference guards. As both players normally play shooting guard, Bryant started the game as a point guard. Gameplay usually involves players attempting spectacular slam dunks and alley oops and defensive effort is limited. The final score is generally much higher than a competitive NBA game. 

If the score is close, the fourth quarter becomes more competitive. The fourth quarter was changed in 2020 to use the Elam Ending. In normal Elam Ending rules, the game clock is turned off with four minutes remaining and a target score is set; whoever reaches the target wins the game. In 2020, the NBA took the score at the end of three quarters and added 24 points (in honor of Kobe Bryant, who had been killed in a helicopter crash a month prior). With Team Giannis leading Team LeBron 133–124 at the end of the third quarter, the target score was 157 points, and Team LeBron won the contest.

The player introductions are accompanied by significant fanfare, including lighting effects, dance music, DJ&#x27;s, elaborate portable stages, and pyrotechnics. Special uniforms are designed for the game each year, usually red for the Western Conference and blue for the Eastern Conference. From 1997 to 2002, players could wear their normal team uniforms. The &quot;host conference&quot; also traditionally has light uniforms, except from 2010 to 2014. In the past, players who wore the same number were given the option to pick a different numeral. For example, Patrick Ewing, who normally wore #33, ended up wearing #3 early in his career as Larry Bird also had that number. Since 1997, players can keep their uniform numbers. A major recording artist typically sings &quot;O Canada&quot; and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; prior to tipoff.

Halftime is longer than a typical NBA game partly due to musical performances by popular artists. The first such halftime show happened in the 2000 game, with Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Mary J. Blige, 98 Degrees, Montell Jordan, Martina McBride, and LL Cool J performing.

List of each All-Star Game, the venue at which it was played, and the Game MVP. Parenthesized numbers indicate multiple times that venue, city, or player has occurred as of that instance (e.g. &quot;Michael Jordan (2)&quot; in 1996 indicates that was his second All-Star MVP award). , the Eastern Conference leads with a record of 38 wins and 29 losses. 
Note: Venue names are listed as of the date of the All-Star Game.

;Notes
* * – a city without an NBA team in play during that calendar year.
* ** – a game played at the &quot;third&quot; Madison Square Garden on 8th Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, site of the first three NBA All-Star Games played in Madison Square Garden (1954, 1955 and 1968).
* *** – a game played at the &quot;fourth&quot; (as of 2017) Madison Square Garden that runs from 31st to 33rd Streets from 8th to west of 7th Avenues above the western half of Penn Station in Manhattan that opened in February 1968, approximately one month after the 1968 game was played in the &quot;old&quot; MSG.
* † – an NBA All-Star Game that is held at an NFL or MLB stadium.
* § – a stadium or arena whose venue name has since changed AND the venue has hosted a subsequent NBA All-Star Game under the alternate name.
* Portland, Sacramento, Memphis, and Oklahoma City are the only NBA cities that have not yet hosted an NBA All-Star Game. The Kings did host 2 All-Star Games when they were in Rochester in 1956 and in Cincinnati in 1966 when they were the Royals, and the Thunder had hosted it twice when they were in Seattle in 1974 and 1987 when they were the SuperSonics. Thus leaving the Portland Trail Blazers and the Memphis Grizzlies as the only two franchises never to play host to an NBA All-Star Game.
* Despite playing in Los Angeles since 1984, the Clippers never hosted an All-Star Game individually until 2026 with the game set to play at Intuit Dome in Inglewood. The team previously co-hosted the 2004, 2011 and 2018 games with the Lakers at Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center), due to being co-tenants of the arena. Its previous incarnation, the Buffalo Braves, never hosted an All-Star Game.
* New arenas that have not hosted the All-Star Game are Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, TD Garden in Boston, Kaseya Center in Miami, American Airlines Center in Dallas (the venue did host the 2010 Rookie Challenge and All-Star Saturday), Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, FedExForum in Memphis, Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, and Golden 1 Center in Sacramento. 
* Market Square Arena in Indianapolis and The Summit in Houston were the only former NBA arenas to host All-Star Saturday but not the All-Star Game as the latter took place in bigger venues within their respective cities, in this case the Hoosier Dome and the Astrodome.
* Other NFL or MLB stadiums that could host the NBA All-Star Game include Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Ford Field in Detroit, NRG Stadium in Houston, Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood (Los Angeles metropolitan area), U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, State Farm Stadium in Glendale (Phoenix metropolitan area), and Rogers Centre in Toronto. Lucas Oil Stadium, however, would host the 2024 NBA All-Star Saturday Night events.
* # – Arlington, Texas does not have an NBA team within its city limits, but it is a part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex that has an NBA team (the Dallas Mavericks).
* ‡ – the first game played under the Elam scoring format, where instead of a time limit, the fourth quarter would end when either team reached the target score, defined as 24, in honor of Kobe Bryant, plus whichever team had more points after three quarters. Team Giannis led 133–124 after three quarters, so the target score was 157. Anthony Davis hit a walk-off free throw to win it.

==Other All-Star events==

The All-Star Game is the featured event of All-Star Weekend, and it is held on a Sunday night. All-Star Weekend also features popular exhibition games and competitions featuring NBA players, celebrities, and alumni as well as players from the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and NBA G League (G League).

<text>The Zip drive is a removable floppy disk storage system that was announced by Iomega in 1994 and began shipping in March 1995. Considered medium-to-high-capacity at the time of its release, Zip disks were originally launched with capacities of 100 MB, then 250 MB, and finally 750 MB.

The format became the most popular of the superfloppy products which filled a niche in the late 1990s portable storage market. However, it was never popular enough to replace the standard -inch floppy disk. Zip drives fell out of favor for mass portable storage during the early 2000s as CD-RW and USB flash drives became prevalent. The Zip brand later covered internal and external CD writers known as Zip-650 or Zip-CD, despite the dissimilar technology.

==Overview==
The Zip drive is a &quot;superfloppy&quot; disk drive that has all of the standard -inch floppy drive&#x27;s convenience, but with much greater capacity options and with performance that is much improved over a standard floppy drive. However, Zip disk housings are similar to but slightly larger than those of standard -inch floppy disks.

In the Zip drive, the heads fly in a manner similar to a hard disk drive. A linear actuator uses the voice coil actuation technology related to modern hard disk drives.

The original Zip drive has a maximum data transfer rate of about 1.4 MB/s (comparable to 8× CD-R; although some connection methods are slower, down to approximately 50 kB/s for maximum-compatibility parallel &quot;nibble&quot; mode) and a seek time of 28 ms on average, compared to a standard 1.44 MB floppy&#x27;s effective ≈16 kB/s and ≈200 ms average seek time. Typical desktop hard disk drives from mid-to-late 1990s revolve at 5,400 rpm and have transfer rates from 3 MB/s to 10 MB/s or more, and average seek times from 20 ms to 14 ms or less.

Early-generation Zip drives were in direct competition with the SuperDisk (LS-120) drives, which hold 20% more data and can also read standard -inch 1.44 MB diskettes, but they have a lower data-transfer rate due to lower rotational speed.

The Zip drive was Iomega&#x27;s third generation of products, different from Iomega&#x27;s earlier Bernoulli Boxes in many ways, including the absence of the Bernoulli plate of the earlier products.

===Interfaces===

Zip drives were produced in multiple interfaces including:

* IDE True ATA (very early ATA internal Zip drives mostly sold to OEMs; these drives exhibit software compatibility issues because they do not support the ATAPI command set)
* ATAPI (all Zip generations)
* USB 1.1 (Zip 100 MB and 250 MB generations) 
* USB 2.0 (Zip 750 MB generation; backwards compatible with USB 1.1 systems)
* IEEE 1284 (parallel port) with printer pass through (Zip 100 MB and 250 MB generations) &quot;(See NB 3)&quot;
* IEEE 1394 (FireWire) (Zip 250 MB and 750 MB generations)
* SCSI (Zip 100 MB and 250 MB generations; both internal and external editions; external editions limited to ID 5 and 6)
* &quot;Plus&quot; (Zip 100 MB external drive with both SCSI and IEEE 1284 connections; SCSI ID limited to ID 5 and 6).

Parallel port external Zip drives are actually SCSI drives with an integrated Parallel-to-SCSI controller, meaning a true SCSI bus implementation but without the electrical buffering circuits necessary for connecting other external devices. Early Zip 100 drives use an AIC 7110 SCSI controller and later parallel drives (Zip Plus and Zip 250) used what was known as Iomega MatchMaker. The drives are identified by the operating system as &quot;IMG VP0&quot; and &quot;IMG VP1&quot; respectively.

Early external SCSI-based Zip drives were packaged with an included SCSI adapter known as Zip Zoom. The Zip Zoom is a relabeled ISA Adaptec SCSI host controller. Also, originally sold separately was a PCMCIA-to-SCSI adapter for laptop compatibility, also a relabeled Adaptec.

Driver support:

* DOS (requires a minimum of a 80286 or processor)
* Microsoft Windows family (Parallel drives not supported on Windows 7 and above)
* Some Linux / BSD etc. (not universal)
* Oracle Solaris 8, 9, 10, 11 
* IBM OS/2
* Macintosh System 6.x,(See NB 1) 7.1–7.5, and Mac OS 7.6–9.2
* macOS
* RISC OS Requires !zip drivers.
* AmigaOS 3.5 or higher
* BeOS from version 3 onwards.
* IRIX 6.4 or higher (SCSI only)
&quot;NB 3: Requires a driver older than 5.x.&quot;

==Compatibility==
Zip disks must be used in a drive with an equal or greater storage capacity. Higher-capacity drives can read lower-capacity media. The 250 MB drive writes much more slowly to 100 MB disks than the 100 MB drive, and the Iomega software is unable to perform a &quot;long&quot; (thorough) format on a 100 MB disk (They can be formatted in any version of Windows as normal; the advantage of the Iomega software is that the long format can format the 100 MB disks with a slightly higher capacity. 250 MB disks format to the same size either way). The 750 MB drive can read and write to 250MB disks, but has read-only support for 100 MB disks.

The retroreflective spot differs between the 100 MB disk and the 250 MB such that if the larger disk is inserted in a smaller-capacity drive, the disk is immediately ejected again without any attempt being made to access it. The 750 MB disk has no reflective spot.

==Sales, problems, and licensing==
Zip drives initially sold well after their shipments began in 1995, owing to their low price and high (for the time) capacity. The drive was initially sold for just under US$200 with one cartridge included, and additional 100 MB cartridges for US$20. At this time hard disks typically had a capacity of 500 MB and cost around US$200 , and so backing up with Zip disks was very economical for home users—some computer suppliers such as Dell, Gateway and Apple Inc. included internal Zip drives in their machines. Zip drives also made significant inroads in the graphic arts market, as a cheaper alternative to the Syquest cartridge hard disk system. The price of additional cartridges swiftly dropped further over the next few years, as more companies began supplying them. Eventually, the suppliers included Fujifilm, Verbatim, Toshiba and Maxell, Epson and NEC. NEC also produced a licensed 100 MB drive model with its brand name.

Sales of Zip drives and disks declined steadily from 1999 to 2003. Zip disks had a relatively high cost per megabyte compared to the falling costs of then-new CD-R and CD-RW discs.

The growth of hard disk drives to multi-gigabyte capacity made backing up with Zip disks less economical. Furthermore, the advent of inexpensive recordable CD and DVD drives for computers, followed by USB flash drives, pushed the Zip drive out of the mainstream market. Nevertheless, during their prime, Zip disks greatly eased the exchange of files that were too big to fit into a standard -inch floppy or an email attachment, and there was no high-speed connection to transfer the file to the recipient. However, the advantages of magnetic media over optical media and flash memory, in terms of long-term file storage stability and high erase/rewrite cycles, still affords them a niche in the data-storage arena.

In September 1998, a class action suit was filed against Iomega over a type of Zip drive failure dubbed the &quot;Click of Death&quot;, accusing Iomega of violation of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act.

In 2006, &quot;PC World&quot; rated the Zip drive as the 15th worst technology product of all time. Nonetheless, in 2007, &quot;PC World&quot; rated the Zip drive as the 23rd &quot;best&quot; technology product of all time despite its known problems.

==Legacy==
Zip drives are still used today by retro-computing enthusiasts as a means to transfer large amounts (compared to the retro hardware) of data between modern and older computer systems. The Commodore-Amiga, Atari ST, Apple II, and &quot;old world&quot; Macintosh communities often use drives with the SCSI interface prevalent on those platforms. They have also found a small niche in the music production community, as SCSI-compatible Zip drives can be used with vintage samplers and keyboards of the 1990s.

Zip disks were still in use in aviation until at least 2014. Jeppesen distributed navigation database updates, and Universal Avionics supplies TAWS, UniLink and Performance databases for upload into flight management systems via 100 and 250 MB Zip disks.

==ZipCD==
Iomega also produced a line of internal and external recordable CD drives under the Zip brand in the late 1990s, called the ZipCD 650. It used regular CD-R media and had no format relation to the magnetic Zip drive. The external models were installed in a Zip-drive-style case, and used standard USB 1.1 connections.

Iomega used the DirectCD software from Adaptec to allow UDF drive-letter access to CD-R or CD-RW media.

The company released an open standard CD-R drive and CD-RW media under the same ZipCD name.

Early models of ZipCD drives were relabeled Philips drives, which were also so unreliable that a class action lawsuit succeeded. Later models were sourced from Plextor.

<doc id="278065" wikidata="Q136579" url="?curid=278065" title="ZZ Top's First Album">
<text>ZZ Top&#x27;s First Album is the debut studio album by American rock band ZZ Top, produced by Bill Ham and released in January 1971 by London Records. Establishing ZZ Top&#x27;s attitude and humor, the album incorporates styles such as blues, boogie, hard rock, and Southern rock influences. &quot;(Somebody Else Been) Shakin&#x27; Your Tree&quot; was the only single released from the album.

==Background, recording and release==
The album was recorded at Robin Hood Studios in Tyler, Texas. ZZ Top frontman Billy Gibbons said: 
We called the record &quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s First Album&quot; because we wanted everyone to know that there would be more. We weren&#x27;t certain if we&#x27;d get another chance in the studio, but we had high hopes.
The only single released from the album was &quot;(Somebody Else Been) Shakin&#x27; Your Tree&quot; (backed with &quot;Neighbor, Neighbor&quot;) on London Records (release number 45-138). It failed to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

In 1987, the album was remixed for CD release. In 2013, the original vinyl mix was released on HD Tracks in high-resolution digital download formats. The original mix of the album was released on CD in June 2013 as part of the box set &quot;The Complete Studio Albums (1970–1990)&quot;. In October 2017 a 180 gram vinyl edition of the album was released, using the original mix. In August 2024, the original stereo master tapes were used by Kevin Gray to cut lacquers for another 180 gram vinyl release.

==Reception==

AllMusic retrospectively gave it 3 stars, stating: &quot;&quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s First Album&quot; may not be perfectly polished, but it does establish their sound, attitude, and quirks.&quot;

==Track listing==

<text>Rio Grande Mud is the second studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top. It was released in 1972 by the London Records label. The album title was inspired by the Rio Grande, the river that forms the border between Mexico and Texas.

==Background==
ZZ Top frontman Billy Gibbons said of the album: It was the first record that brought us into step with the writing experience. We started documenting events as they happened to us on the road; all of these elements went into the songwriting notebook. As we went along, we were keeping track of skeleton ideas as they popped up. The craft was certainly developing.

==Release==
The only single released from the album was &quot;Francine&quot;, which peaked at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The A-side was the album version, while the B-side featured the song with the vocals re-recorded in Spanish. Another 45 version was released in the UK and Germany backed with &quot;Down Brownie&quot;. Various official ZZ Top releases throughout the years, beginning in 1972, have used the alternative spelling &quot;Francene&quot;, especially on the various 45 releases both within and outside the United States as well as the first edition of the LP.

In 1987, the album was remixed for CD release. On January 11, 2011, Rhino released a remastered version from the original 1972 mix on vinyl only. This album was put up for download on Amazon&#x27;s MP3 store and iTunes as a digital download in 2012, and features the original mixes of the tracks that are on &quot;Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ&quot;, and the 1987 remixes of the tracks that are not from that box set. The original mix of the album was released on CD in June 2013 as part of the box set &quot;The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990)&quot;.

==Reception==
AllMusic retrospectively gave the album 3.5 stars, stating: &quot;With their second album, &quot;Rio Grande Mud&quot;, ZZ Top uses the sound they sketched out on their debut as a blueprint, yet they tweak it in slight but important ways.&quot;

The album peaked at number 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in June 1972.

<text>A maxi yacht usually refers to a racing yacht of at least in length.

==Origin==
The term &quot;maxi&quot; originated with the International Offshore Rule (IOR) rating system, which in the 1970s and 1980s measured offshore racing yachts and applied a single-number rating to each boat. This number was approximately equal to the sailing waterline length in feet, plus or minus speed enhancing or reducing factors in the design. A yacht with a rating of was generally about in length overall. The IOR had upper and lower rating limits of and , so a yacht designed and built to exceed the maximum limit of rating was known as a &quot;maxi&quot;.
==Competition==
The IOR Maxis were generally long overall, and raced boat-for-boat without handicap, unlike the rest of the IOR fleet which raced with a time correction factor depending on the boat&#x27;s rating.
In the 1980s they were the most glamorous, exciting, expensive and high-visibility racing yachts in the world, with regular appearances at most of the great races such as the Fastnet, Sydney-Hobart, Bermuda Race, and their own private series of regattas in the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas. The maxis were also prominent as line honour contestants in the Whitbread Round the World Race from 1973 to 1993.

==Modern maxis==

Modern maxi yachts are usually custom-designed and built to the IRC rule but regardless of handicap in order to achieve line honour victories. In 2001 however two Reichel/Pugh boats were built to the &quot;maxZ86&quot; class in order to match boat speed evenly, but the class did not generate further interest.
For the 2009 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia increased the IRC rating upper limit for length of hull from , and most yachts have been lengthened to this size. In order to achieve higher speeds, maxi yachts were early adopters of modern materials and technologies such as carbon fibre, thermoformed sails, rotating wingmasts, water ballasts, canting keels, and hydrofoils. Previous smaller maxi yachts are still raced with corrected time class victories in mind whilst the &quot;mini-maxi&quot; yachts now have a class of their own. Maxi yachts are raced in both inshore and offshore races.

<doc id="278119" wikidata="Q103939" url="?curid=278119" title="Charlie Sheen">
<text>Carlos Irwin Estévez (born September 3, 1965), known professionally as Charlie Sheen, is an American actor. He is known as a leading man in film and television. Sheen has received numerous accolades including a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 1994, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Charlie Sheen followed in the footsteps of his father Martin Sheen in becoming an actor. He starred in a slew of successful films such as &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988), &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), &quot;The Rookie&quot; (1990), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Arrival&quot; (1996). In the 2000s, when Sheen replaced Michael J. Fox as the star of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Spin City&quot;, his portrayal of Charlie Crawford earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. He then starred as Charlie Harper on the CBS sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2003–11), for which he received multiple Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy nominations, and as Dr. Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Goodson on the FX series &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2012–14). In 2010, Sheen was the highest-paid actor on television, earning US$1.8 million per episode of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

In March 2011, Sheen was terminated from his &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; contract by CBS and Warner Bros. following a public series of substance-abuse issues, marital problems and comments made towards the series&#x27; creator, Chuck Lorre. In 2015, Sheen publicly revealed that he is HIV positive, which led to an increase in HIV prevention and testing which was dubbed the &quot;Charlie Sheen effect&quot;. Post-&quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, he starred in the films &quot;Machete Kills&quot; (2013) and &quot;9/11&quot; (2017), and had a recurring role on Lorre&#x27;s Max series &quot;Bookie&quot; (2023–24).

==Early life==
Carlos Irwin Estévez was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City, the youngest son of actor Martin Sheen (whose real name is Ramón Estévez) and artist Janet Templeton. His paternal grandparents were emigrants from Galicia (Spain) and Ireland, respectively. Sheen said in 2011 that his father was Catholic and his mother was Southern Baptist. He has two older brothers, Emilio and Ramon, and a younger sister, Renée, all actors. His parents moved to Malibu, California, after Martin&#x27;s Broadway run in &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot;. Sheen&#x27;s first movie appearance was at age nine in his father&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot;. Sheen attended Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, along with Robert Downey Jr., where he was a star pitcher and shortstop for the baseball team.

At Santa Monica High School, he showed an early interest in acting, making amateur Super 8 films with his brother Emilio and school friends Rob Lowe and Sean Penn under his birth name. A few weeks before his scheduled graduation from Santa Monica High School, Sheen was expelled from school for poor grades and attendance. He then chose to become an actor, and adopted the stage name Charlie Sheen. His father had adopted the surname Sheen in honor of the Catholic archbishop and theologian Fulton J. Sheen, and Charlie was an English form of his given name Carlos.

== Career ==

=== 1983–1999: Breakthrough and stardom ===
Sheen&#x27;s film career began in 1983, when he was cast to portray Ron in &quot;Grizzly II: The Predator&quot;, the sequel to the 1976 low-budget horror movie &quot;Grizzly&quot;, which remained unreleased until 2020. In 1984, he had a role in the Cold War teen drama &quot;Red Dawn&quot; with Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. 

Sheen and Grey reunited in a small scene in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986). He also appeared in an episode of the anthology series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Sheen had his first major role in the Vietnam War drama &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986). 

In 1987, he starred with his father in &quot;Wall Street&quot; in which he played the role of Bud Fox, a young and ambitious stockbroker. Both &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;Platoon&quot; were directed by Oliver Stone. In 1988, Stone asked Sheen to star in his new film &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989) but later cast Tom Cruise instead. Sheen was never notified by Stone, and he only found out when he heard the news from his brother Emilio. Sheen did not take a lead role in Stone&#x27;s subsequent films, although he did have a cameo role in &quot;Money Never Sleeps&quot;.

In 1988, he starred in the baseball film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; as outfielder Happy Felsch. Also in 1988, he appeared opposite his brother Emilio in &quot;Young Guns&quot; and again in 1990 in &quot;Men at Work&quot;. In 1989, Sheen, John Fusco, Christopher Cain, Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio Estévez and Kiefer Sutherland were honored with a Bronze Wrangler for their work on the film &quot;Young Guns&quot;.

In 1990, he starred alongside his father in &quot;Cadence&quot; as a rebellious inmate in a military stockade and with Clint Eastwood in the buddy cop film &quot;The Rookie&quot;. The films were directed by Sheen and Eastwood, respectively. In 1992, he featured in &quot;Beyond the Law&quot; with Linda Fiorentino and Michael Madsen. In 1994, Sheen was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1997, Sheen wrote his first movie, &quot;Discovery Mars&quot;, a direct-to-video documentary revolving around the question, &quot;Is There Life on Mars?&quot;. The next year, Sheen wrote, produced and starred in the action movie &quot;No Code of Conduct&quot;.

Sheen appeared in several comedy roles, including the &quot;Major League&quot; films, &quot;Money Talks&quot;, and the spoof &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; films. Sheen has also done voices for animation, appearing as Charlie in &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven 2&quot; (1996), replacing Burt Reynolds. In 1999, Sheen appeared in a sitcom pilot for ABC, called &quot;Sugar Hill&quot;, which was not picked up. In 1999, Sheen played himself in &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;.

=== 2000–2011: Sitcom roles ===

In 2000, Sheen debuted on the small screen when he replaced Michael J. Fox for the last two seasons of the sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot;. For his work on &quot;Spin City&quot;, Sheen was nominated for two ALMA Awards and won his first Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy. The series ended in 2002. He also appeared in &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; (2003), &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006) and &quot;Scary Movie 5&quot; (2013) entries in the popular horror-spoof series &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. 

In 2003, Sheen was cast as Charlie Harper in the CBS sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, which followed the popular Monday night time slot of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. Sheen&#x27;s role on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; was loosely based on Sheen&#x27;s bad-boy image. The role garnered him an ALMA Award and he gained three Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe award nominations. During his eighth and final season on the show, Sheen earned $1.8 million per episode.

==== Warner Bros. dismissal and publicity ====
Production of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; went on hiatus in January 2011 while Sheen underwent a substance rehabilitation program in his home, his third attempt at rehab in 12 months. The following month, CBS canceled the season&#x27;s four remaining episodes after Sheen publicly made offensive comments about the series&#x27; creator, Chuck Lorre, and Warner Bros. Television banned Sheen from entering its production lot. Sheen, already the highest-paid actor on television, responded by publicly demanding a 50-percent raise, claiming that in comparison to the amount that the series was making, he was &quot;underpaid&quot;.

CBS and Warner Bros. Television terminated Sheen&#x27;s contract on March 7, 2011. He was replaced by Ashton Kutcher. In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen continued to feud with Chuck Lorre, and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros. Television, which was settled the following September 26. That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed &quot;everybody here from &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;&quot; and stated, &quot;From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and I know you will continue to make great television.&quot; In 2012, Sheen returned to television in &quot;Anger Management&quot;, the spin-off of the film of the same name. The series ended after a 100-episode run in the second season.

In the wake of the dismissal, Sheen had a highly publicized meltdown which was broadcast on television and the Internet. He made claims in television interviews suggesting that he was a &quot;warlock&quot; with &quot;tiger blood&quot; and &quot;Adonis DNA&quot;, and that he was &quot;winning&quot;. He also posted videos to YouTube showing himself smoking cigarettes through his nose, and cursing out his former employers. He told one TV interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of pretending I&#x27;m not special. I&#x27;m tired of pretending I&#x27;m not a total bitchin&#x27; rock star from Mars.&quot; After being accused of antisemitism in 2011, Sheen claimed that his mother was Jewish, although &quot;Jewish Standard&quot; reporter Nate Bloom wrote that he found no evidence to support this and described Sheen&#x27;s claim as &quot;exceedingly unlikely&quot;. Sheen said later that year that his father was Catholic and his mother was Southern Baptist.

On September 19, 2011, Sheen was roasted on Comedy Central. It was watched by 6.4 million people, making it the highest-rated roast on Comedy Central to date. Also that year, he played a role in the hip hop music video &quot;Steak &amp; Mash Potatoes&quot; by Chain Swangaz featuring Brother Marquis. The video features both rappers as fast-food employees who create havoc while their boss (Sheen) is gone.

=== 2012–present===
In 2012, Sheen was cast to star alongside Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray in Roman Coppola&#x27;s surreal comedy film &quot;A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III&quot;. That same year he voiced Dex Dogtective in the Lionsgate animated comedy &quot;Foodfight&quot; (2012). For the 2013 film &quot;Machete Kills&quot;, in which Sheen played the President of the United States, he was credited under his birth name Carlos Estévez. It was a one-time move due to the film&#x27;s Hispanic theme; it was Sheen&#x27;s idea to use his birth name for the film. The trailer and opening credits for the film used an &quot;and introducing...&quot; tag when showing Sheen&#x27;s birth name. Sheen&#x27;s next feature film project was the ensemble film &quot;9/11&quot; (2017), an adaptation of the 9/11 stage play &quot;Elevator&quot; written by Patrick Carson. The film also featured Whoopi Goldberg, Gina Gershon, Luis Guzmán, Wood Harris, Jacqueline Bisset, and Bruce Davison.

In October 2018, Sheen flew to Australia for his &quot;An Evening with Charlie Sheen&quot; tour. During this time, he filmed an advert for car servicing company Ultra Tune, which was the next installment in their controversial &quot;Unexpected Situations&quot; series alongside Parnia Porsche, Laura Lydall, Tyana Hansen, and Imogen Lovell.

==Other ventures==

In 2006, Sheen launched a clothing line for children, called Sheen Kidz. In 2011, Sheen set a Guinness World Record as the &quot;Fastest Time to Reach 1 Million Followers&quot; on Twitter, adding an average of 129,000 new followers daily, as well as a Guinness record for &quot;Highest Paid TV Actor Per Episode – Current&quot; at $1.25 million while he was a part of the cast of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; sitcom. On March 3, 2011, Sheen signed with Ad.ly marketing agency specializing in Twitter and Facebook promotions.

On March 10, 2011, Sheen announced a nationwide tour, &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option&quot;, which began in Detroit on April 2. The tour sold out in 18 minutes, a Ticketmaster record. However, on April 1, 2011, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; featured an article that stated as of March 30 that there were over 1000 tickets available from a third-party reseller, some at 15% less than the cheapest seats sold at the Fox Theater. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reported that it was expected Sheen would earn $1 million in 2011 from Twitter endorsements and $7 million from the North American tour. Many of those attending the performance of April 2 in Detroit found it disappointing; the subsequent performance in Chicago, which featured some adjustments, received a more positive reception.

Sheen was announced as the face of and partner in &quot;NicoSheen&quot;, a line of disposable E-cigarettes and related products.

On August 13, 2011, Sheen hosted at the 12th annual Gathering of the Juggalos, an event created by the Insane Clown Posse. He received a mixed reaction from the audience, but has expressed appreciation for the culture by describing himself as a Juggalo and wearing a baseball cap featuring the Psychopathic Records logo in public and during production meetings for &quot;Anger Management&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===

Sheen has been married three times. He has five children and one grandchild.

His oldest daughter is from a relationship with his former high school girlfriend, Paula Profit, whose name has also been given as Paula Speert. Through their daughter, Cassandra Estevez, Sheen has one granddaughter, named Luna.

In January 1990, Sheen&#x27;s fiancée, Kelly Preston, was hit by shrapnel after a gun went off in their house. She broke off the engagement shortly thereafter. In the 1990s, Sheen subsequently dated a number of pornographic film actresses, including Ginger Lynn and Heather Hunter.

On September 3, 1995, Sheen married his first wife, Donna Peele. That same year, Sheen was named as one of the clients of an escort agency operated by Heidi Fleiss. Sheen and Peele divorced in 1996.

Sheen met actress Denise Richards on the set of &quot;Good Advice&quot; in 2000. They began dating in October 2001, when Richards guest-starred on Sheen&#x27;s TV show &quot;Spin City&quot;. They became engaged on December 26, 2001, and married on June 15, 2002, at the estate of &quot;Spin City&quot; creator Gary David Goldberg. They have two daughters together (born in 2004 and 2005). In March 2005, Richards filed for divorce, accusing Sheen of alcohol and drug abuse with threats of violence, as well as accusations of Sheen looking at gay pornography featuring &quot;boys who looked underage&quot; and being &quot;attracted&quot; to underage girls. Sheen would later deny these claims, and stated that the FBI was &quot;aware&quot; of the allegations and had searched his computers. The divorce was finalized in November 2006 and preceded a custody dispute over their two daughters.

On May 30, 2008, Sheen married his third wife, Brooke Mueller. Mueller gave birth to their twin sons, Bob and Max, on March 14, 2009. In November 2010, Sheen filed for divorce. On March 1, 2011, police removed the couple&#x27;s sons from Sheen&#x27;s home. Sheen told NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;I stayed very calm and focused.&quot; According to &quot;People&quot;, social services took the children after Mueller obtained a restraining order against Sheen. The document said, &quot;I am very concerned that [Sheen] is currently insane.&quot; Asked if he would fight for the children, Sheen texted &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Born ready. Winning.&quot; Sheen and Mueller&#x27;s divorce became final on May 2, 2011.

On March 1, 2011, Sheen was concurrently living with 24-year-old pornographic actress Bree Olson and 24-year-old model and graphic designer Natalie Kenly, whom he collectively nicknamed his &quot;goddesses&quot;. Olson left Sheen in April 2011, and Kenly left in June 2011. In a January 2013 interview on &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot;, Sheen stated that he was in a relationship with adult film actress and 2011 &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine Pet of the Month Georgia Jones.

In February 2014, Sheen became engaged to former adult film star Brett Rossi, who began going by her real name, Scottine. With a wedding planned for November 2014, the engagement was broken off in October with an announcement that the two had &quot;mutually decided&quot; to separate. Sheen stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve decided that my children deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now. I still have a tremendous fondness for Scotty and I wish her all the best.&quot; A month later it was reported that Rossi was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose. In 2015, Rossi sued Sheen after his announcement of being HIV-positive and for various other allegations such as &quot;assault and battery, emotional distress, false imprisonment and negligence&quot;. The suit was referred to arbitration. Another girlfriend of Sheen sued him in 2017, claiming that in 2015 he had concealed his HIV status from her until after they had unprotected sex. The lawsuit was settled in 2022 with Sheen paying $120,000 to the woman.

In June 2022, Sheen&#x27;s second daughter, Sami, created an OnlyFans account. Sheen initially disapproved of the action. He later changed his mind, citing points made by her mother.

===Residences===
For many years, Sheen resided in Beverly Hills, California. However, he sold his property for $6.6 million in 2020. As of 2022, Sheen resides in a rented house in Malibu, California.

Sheen has also owned properties in Agoura Hills, Sherman Oaks and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

===Substance abuse, legal issues and health===
On May 20, 1998, Sheen had a stroke after overdosing while using cocaine and was hospitalized. Sheen was found in his seaside home by a friend, after which paramedics rushed him to Los Robles Hospital &amp; Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, California, where he was described as being in &quot;serious condition&quot; after his stomach was pumped. Days later, Sheen checked into a rehab clinic, then told doctors that he did not intend to stay. Sheen left, but sheriff&#x27;s deputies forced Sheen back to the clinic. On August 11, 1998, Sheen, already on probation in California for a previous drug offense, had his probation extended by one year and entered a rehab clinic. In a 2004 interview, Sheen disclosed that his previous overdose was caused by injecting cocaine.

On December 25, 2009, Sheen was arrested for assaulting his wife at the time, Brooke Mueller, in Aspen, Colorado. He was released the same day from jail after posting an $8,500 bond. Sheen was charged with felony menacing, as well as third-degree assault and criminal mischief. On August 2, 2010, Sheen, represented by Yale Galanter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault as part of a plea bargain that included dismissal of the other charges against him. Sheen was sentenced to 30 days in a drug rehab center, 30 days of probation, and 36 hours of anger management.

On October 26, 2010, the police removed Sheen from his suite at the Plaza Hotel after he reportedly caused $7,000 in damage. According to the NYPD, Sheen admitted to drinking and using cocaine the night of the incident.

On November 17, 2015, Sheen publicly revealed that he was HIV-positive, having been diagnosed roughly four years earlier. In an interview, he referred to the acronym HIV as &quot;three hard letters to absorb&quot;. He manages his condition with a triple cocktail of antiretroviral drugs, and said that it was impossible that he could have knowingly infected any of his partners. Sheen noted that since 2011, he had paid extortionists approximately $10 million to keep his HIV status secret. Sheen stated that he was upfront about his HIV-positive condition with all of his past partners.

In an episode of &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; taped in late 2015 and aired January 12, 2016, Sheen stated that he had &quot;been off [his] meds for about a week now,&quot; receiving alternative treatment in Mexico from Sam Chachoua, who claims to have an effective vaccine for HIV; according to his manager, however, after the episode was taped he resumed taking his medications.

In April 2016, Sheen had his monthly child support payments to his two ex-wives, Richards and Mueller, reduced from $55,000 to $10,000. The same month, it was announced that Sheen was under investigation by the LAPD stalking unit for threatening to kill his former fiancée Scottine Ross.

=== Corey Feldman allegation ===
In 2017, Sheen sued the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; over a story alleging that, in 1986, he raped his 13-year-old co-star Corey Haim on the set of &quot;Lucas&quot;. The case was settled in 2018. Haim&#x27;s mother, Judy Haim, identified a different actor as her son&#x27;s rapist on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;, and told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that Sheen never raped her son, calling the claims &quot;made up&quot;.

In March 2020, actor Corey Feldman repeated the claim that Sheen raped Haim in his documentary &quot;(My) Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys&quot;, corroborated by Feldman&#x27;s ex-wife Susie Feldman and his &quot;Lost Boys&quot; co-star Jamison Newlander. Sheen, through his publicist, denied the allegations, calling them &quot;sick, twisted and outlandish&quot;.

==Activism==
===The Charlie Sheen effect===
Sheen&#x27;s disclosure of his HIV-positive diagnosis corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searches ever recorded in the United States. During the three weeks following his disclosure, there were about 2.75 million more searches than expected that included the term HIV, and 1.25 million searches were directly relevant to public-health outcomes because they included search terms for condoms, HIV symptoms, or HIV testing (e.g., &quot;get HIV tested&quot;).

A later study found Sheen&#x27;s disclosure also corresponded with a 95% increase in over-the-counter at-home HIV testing kits.

The study&#x27;s authors dubbed it &quot;The Charlie Sheen Effect&quot; with commenters noting &quot;Charlie Sheen did more for HIV education than most UN events do.&quot; Sheen spoke out for HIV prevention, citing the studies as motivation, later adding he was &quot;humbled&quot; to &quot;be of service.&quot;

===Charity work===
Sheen was the 2004 spokesperson for the Lee National Denim Day breast cancer fundraiser that raised millions of dollars for research and education regarding the disease. Sheen stated that a friend of his died from breast cancer, and he wanted to try to help find a cure for the disease.

A major donor and supporter of Aid For AIDS since 2006, Sheen was honored with an AFA Angel Award, one of only a few ever given, at the nonprofit&#x27;s 25th Silver Anniversary Reception in 2009. In addition to his financial support, he has volunteered to act as a celebrity judge for several years for their annual fundraiser, Best In Drag Show, which raises around a quarter of a million dollars each year in Los Angeles for AIDS assistance.
He has brought other celebrities to support the event, including his father, actor Martin Sheen. Sheen&#x27;s interest in AIDS was first reported in 1987 with his support of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who became a national spokesperson for AIDS awareness after being infected with AIDS through a blood transfusion for his hemophilia.

On March 27, 2008, Sheen and Jenna Elfman co-hosted the Scientology-affiliated New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project charity event.

Sheen donated one dollar from each ticket sold from his &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option Show&quot; 2011 tour to the Red Cross Japanese earthquake Relief Fund.

In 2011, Sheen took on a Twitter challenge by a grieving mother to help critically ill babies born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia by supporting the Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research, Awareness and Support (CDHRAS).

Sheen is a lifelong fan of the Cincinnati Reds. In August 2012, he announced that he would donate $50,000 to the team&#x27;s community fund, which supports various charities. The donation came after the team raised another $50,000 in an attempt to get sportscaster Marty Brennaman to shave his head on the field after a Reds victory. After Brennaman shaved his head, Sheen offered to match the previous donation total.

==Opinions==

===Political views===
In a 2015 interview, Sheen described himself as a &quot;constitutional Republican&quot;. Sheen discussed his desire of running for U.S. President in 2016. Despite having been an active critic of the Bush administration during the office years, Sheen spoke fondly of George W. Bush in 2014. Further, Sheen Bush&#x27;s service as president by stating: &quot;He did the best he could with what he was confronted with, and it is beyond anything I can comprehend&quot;.

Sheen has been publicly scathing against former president Donald Trump. In 2016, he labeled Trump a &quot;charlatan&quot; and wished death upon him.

===September 11 attacks===
Sheen is an outspoken advocate of the 9/11 truth movement. On September 8, 2009, he appealed to President Barack Obama to set up a new investigation into the attacks. Presenting his views as a transcript of a fictional encounter with Obama, he was characterized by the press as believing the 9/11 Commission was a whitewash and that the former George W. administration may have been responsible for the attacks.

===Anti-vaccination===
Sheen is staunchly opposed to vaccinations. After separating from Denise Richards, he sent a legal notice to his daughters&#x27; physician stating his lack of consent to vaccinate them. The dispute over vaccines seems to have played an important role in the failure of the marriage. Richards said in an interview in 2008, &quot;When I vaccinated Sam, he accused me of poisoning her. And I knew when he said that that the marriage wasn&#x27;t going to work.&quot;

<text>Formula SAE is a student design competition organized by SAE International (previously known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE). The competition was started in 1980 by the SAE student branch at the University of Texas at Austin after a prior asphalt racing competition proved to be unsustainable.

==Concept==

The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a student design team to develop a small Formula-style race car. The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving. There are combustion and electric divisions of the competition, primarily only differing in their rules for powertrain. 

The prototype race car is judged in a number of different events. The points schedule for most Formula SAE events is:

In addition to these events, various sponsors of the competition provide awards for superior design accomplishments. For example, best use of E-85 ethanol fuel, innovative use of electronics, recyclability, crash worthiness, analytical approach to design, and overall dynamic performance are some of the awards available. At the beginning of the competition, the vehicle is checked for rule compliance during the Technical Inspection. Its braking ability, rollover stability and noise levels are checked before the vehicle is allowed to compete in the dynamic events (Skidpad, Autocross, Acceleration, and Endurance).

Large companies, such as General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, can have staff interact with more than 1000 student engineers. Working in teams of anywhere between two and 30, these students have proven themselves to be capable of producing a functioning prototype vehicle.

The volunteers for the design judging include some of the racing industry&#x27;s most prominent engineers and consultants including the late Carroll Smith, Bill Mitchell, Doug Milliken, Claude Rouelle, Jack Auld, John LePlante, Ron Tauranac, and Bryan Kubala.

Today, the competition has expanded and includes more than 12 events all over the world. For example, Formula Student is a similar SAE-sanctioned event in the UK, as well as Formula SAE Australasia (Formula SAE-A) taking place in Australia. The Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) holds the Formula Student Germany competition at the Hockenheimring.

In 2007, an offshoot called Formula Hybrid was inaugurated. It is similar to Formula SAE, except all cars must have gasoline-electric hybrid power plants. The competition takes place at the New Hampshire International Speedway. 

In 2010, the Formula Student Electric was inaugurated, which requires the students to build a fully electrically powered racing vehicle.

In 2017, the Formula Student Driverless was inaugurated.

==Summary of rules==

===Student competition===

Formula SAE has relatively few performance restrictions. The team must be made up entirely of active college students (including drivers) which places obvious restrictions on available work hours, skill sets, experience, and presents unique challenges that professional race teams do not face with a paid, skilled staff. This restriction means that the rest of the regulations can be much less restrictive than most professional series.

Students are allowed to receive advice and criticism from professional engineers or faculty, but all of the car design must be done by the students themselves. Students are also solely responsible for fundraising, though most successful teams are based on curricular programs and have university-sponsored budgets. Additionally, the points system is organized so that multiple strategies can lead to success. This leads to a great variety among cars, which is a rarity in the world of motorsports.

===Engine (IC Competition)===
The engine must be a four-stroke, Otto-cycle piston engine with a displacement no greater than 710cc. An air restrictor of circular cross-section must be fitted downstream of the throttle and upstream of any compressor, with a diameter no greater than 20mm for gasoline engines, forced induction or naturally aspirated, or 19mm for ethanol-fueled engines. The restrictor keeps power levels below 100 hp in the vast majority of FSAE cars. Most commonly, production four-cylinder 600cc sport bike engines are used due to their availability and displacement. However, there are many teams that use smaller V-twin and single-cylinder engines, mainly due to their weight-saving and packaging benefits. Very rarely do teams build an engine from scratch, few examples include Western Washington University&#x27;s 554cc V8 entry in 2001, University of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;WATTARD&quot; engine in 2003–2004, and University of Auckland&#x27;s V twin.

=== Electric Powertrain (EV Competition) ===

The accumulator must not have a voltage greater than 600V, but does not have a capacity limit. An energy meter is installed at competition ensuring no more than 80kW are drawn. Most teams elect to use lithium-ion cells, but both lead acid cells as well as other energy storage devices such as capacitors are also permitted — this accounts for the commonly referred &quot;battery pack&quot; being referred to as an &quot;accumulator&quot; in this competition. Cell voltages and temperatures must be monitored and individual cell connected via fusible links. These challenges lead many (especially young) teams to use preconfigured cell modules that are connected together in the accumulator enclosure. The competition organizers attempt to prepare teams for competition EV technical inspection by having teams complete an Electrical Safety Form (ESF) prior to competition — this form outlines many of the parts used in the high voltage system as well as design decisions the team is making.

===Suspension===
The suspension is unrestricted save for safety regulations and the requirement to have 50mm total of wheel travel. Most teams opt for four-wheel independent suspension, almost universally double-wishbone. Active suspension is legal.

===Aerodynamics===
Complex aerodynamic packages, while not required to compete at competition are common among the fastest teams at competition. With the low speeds of the FSAE competition rarely exceeding , designs must be thoroughly justified in the design judging event through wind tunnel testing, computational fluid dynamics, and on track testing. Aerodynamic devices are regulated through maximum size and powered aerodynamic devices are outlawed.

===Weight===
There is no weight restriction. The weight of the average competitive Formula SAE car is usually less than in race trim. However, the lack of weight regulation combined with the somewhat fixed power ceiling encourages teams to adopt innovative weight-saving strategies, such as the use of composite materials, elaborate and expensive machining projects, and rapid prototyping. In 2009 the fuel economy portion of the endurance event was assigned 100 of the 400 endurance points, up from 50. This rules change has marked a trend in engine downsizing in an attempt to save weight and increase fuel economy. Several top-running teams have switched from high-powered four-cylinder cars to smaller, one- or two-cylinder engines which, though they usually make much less power, allow weight savings of or more, and also provide much better fuel economy. If a lightweight single-cylinder car can keep a reasonable pace in the endurance race, it can often make up the points lost in overall time to the heavier, high-powered cars by an exceptional fuel economy score. 
:Example: At the 2009 Formula SAE West endurance event, third-place finishers Rochester Institute of Technology completed the endurance course in 22 minutes, 45 seconds with their four-cylinder car, while fourth-place finishers Oregon State University finished in 22 minutes, 47 seconds with their single-cylinder car; this gave RIT 290.6 of 300 points for the race portion of the event and OSU 289.2 points. However, OSU used the least fuel of any car (, or over the entire endurance race) and received the full 100 points for fuel economy, while RIT used () and was thus only awarded 23.9 of the available points. RIT went on to win the overall competition by only 8.9 points over OSU, having scored slightly better in all of the other dynamic events.

===Safety===
The majority of the regulations pertain to safety. Cars must have two steel roll hoops of designated thickness and alloy, regardless of the composition of the rest of the chassis. There must be an impact attenuator in the nose, and impact testing data on this attenuator must be submitted prior to competing. Cars must also have two hydraulic brake circuits, full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing. Tilt-tests ensure that no fluids will spill from the car under heavy cornering, and there must be no line-of-sight between the driver and fuel, coolant, or oil lines. Electric vehicles are also fitted with a &quot;Shutdown Circuit&quot;, which is the physical electrical path the current takes that closes the main contactors of the vehicle. All safety buttons, switches, and circuits are part of the Shutdown Circuit such that removing any should make it physically impossible for high voltage to be present outside the accumulator.

==History==

In 1979 the only SAE Mini-Indy was held at the University of Houston. Conceived by Dr. Kurt M. Marshek, the competition was inspired by a how-to article that appeared in Popular Mechanics magazine, for a small, &quot;Indy-style&quot; vehicle made out of wood, and powered by a five-horsepower Briggs and Stratton engine. Using the Mini Baja competitions as a guide, engineering students had to design and build small, &quot;Indy-style&quot; vehicles using the same stock engine used in the &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; article. Thirteen schools entered and eleven competed. The University of Texas at El Paso won the overall competition under chief supervision.

Although Dr. William Shapton (who had recently left the University of Cincinnati to join Michigan Technological University) broached the idea of hosting a similar competition in 1980, no one stepped up to organize another Mini-Indy.

In 1980 when the members of the new SAE student branch at the University of Texas (Austin) learned that the Mini-Indy had died, they generated the concept for a new intercollegiate student engineering design competition that would allow students to apply what they were learning in the classroom to a complex, real-world engineering design problem: design and development of a race car. UT SAE student branch members Robert Edwards and John Tellkamp led a discussion among UT SAE members and envisioned a competition that would involve designing and constructing a race car along the lines of the SCCA Formula 440 entry-level racing series that was popular at the time. Prof. Matthews came up with the “Formula SAE” name following the format of Formula A and Formula Vee but emphasizing that this new race car was an engineering competition rather than a driver&#x27;s competition. Schools would meet after the end of the academic year to compete and determine who had built the best car. Edwards, Tellkamp, and fellow UT SAE students Joe Green, Dick Morton, Mike Best, and Carl Morris drafted a set of safety and competition rules and presented them to the SAE student branch membership and to UT SAE Faculty Advisor Prof. Ron Matthews. Prof. Matthews then contacted Bob Sechler of the SAE Educational Relations Department at SAE headquarters and asked for his permission both to establish the new intercollegiate student engineering design competition and to host the first Formula SAE competition during the summer of 1981, and he agreed. The newly formed UT SAE branch, consisting mostly of automotive and motorcycle enthusiasts pursuing engineering degrees, including several who had left careers in fields for which the job market had virtually disappeared due to the depressed economy in the early 1980s – including some experienced auto mechanics, embraced and adopted the concept with little idea of what they were getting themselves into. SAE student branch officers Mike Best, Carl Morris, and Sylvia Obregon, along with Dr. Matthews began planning and organizing the event to be held the following year.

Here, it is important to note that Formula SAE was NOT a simple renaming of the Mini-Indy competition but was instead an entirely new intercollegiate student engineering design competition. Unlike all previous SAE-sanctioned student racing/design competitions including Mini-Indy, the Formula SAE rules left the selection of the engine to the design team, as long as a 4 stroke engine with a one-inch diameter intake restrictor was used. (The current Formula SAE rules allow the teams to use 4-stroke engines up to 710 cc, with a smaller restrictor.) Also, unlike all previous SAE-sanctioned student racing/design competitions including Mini-Indy, engine modifications were both allowed and encouraged. 
The first Formula SAE competition was held in the parking lot of the UT baseball field (Disch-Falk field) on the University of Texas campus on Memorial Day weekend, 1981. Judges included legendary race car engineer/owner/driver and Indy 500 champion Jim Hall. While a sudden Texas rain storm sent everyone scrambling for cover just before the endurance event that day, the weather failed to dampen the spirits of the students, judges, or spectators and Formula SAE was born. 
The University of Texas continued to host the event from 1982 to 1984 as the popularity and number of participants grew. In these subsequent years, UT moved the Formula SAE competition to other parking areas that included elevation changes and driveway aprons that forced the use of functioning suspensions. The event became international in 1982 with the entry of Universidad La Salle team from Mexico City. The significant rules changes for 1982 were: 1) a displacement limit of 600 cc (300 cc for Wankels), but the 1 inch diameter restrictor rule was retained, 2) a requirement for 4-wheel independent suspension (Mini-Indy did not have any suspension rules), and 3) the addition of a temporary “B&amp;S” class of vehicles that were originally designed for Mini-Baja, had to retain the 8 hp Briggs &amp; Stratton engine, and did not need to comply with the 4-wheel independent suspension rule. Formula SAE continued to be an international competition when the team from Universidad La Salle returned. With the only engine restrictions being a displacement limit of 600 cc and a 1-inch maximum diameter for the intake, creativity flourished. Also in 1983, the temporary B&amp;S class was eliminated, the University of Texas at Austin entered the first composite Formula SAE vehicle and Marquette University entered the first turbocharged engine. The rules allowed a Formula SAE car to compete for two years in recognition of the effort required to build and test a quality car. This also allowed students the experience of re-engineering and improving on design elements that did not work. The rules for 1984 specifically allowed turbochargers, superchargers, and use of nitrous oxide but the engine had to breathe through a 25.4 mm exit bore of the carburetor casting (1984 was well before electronic fuel injection). Engine intake restrictors were later tightened as cars became faster year over year as knowledge was passed on within and between teams. Also, a 65-100 inch wheelbase rule was promulgated, as was a rule requiring all vehicles to have a “body that resembles a formula car”. The Formula SAE field had grown to eleven cars in 1984, so the University of Texas at Austin decided that the competition had matured sufficiently that it was safe to pass it on to other hosts.

The University of Texas at Austin hosted the competition through 1984. In 1985, the competition was hosted by The University of Texas at Arlington. There, Dr. Robert Woods, with guidance from the SAE student activities committee, changed the concept of the competition from one where students built a pure racing car, to one that mirrored the SAE Mini-Baja competitions, where they were to design and build a vehicle for limited series production.

General Motors hosted the competition in 1991, Ford Motor Co. in 1992, and Chrysler Corp. in 1993. After the 1992 competition, the three formed a consortium to run Formula SAE.

At the end of the 2008 competition, the consortium ceased to exist. The event is now funded by SAE through company sponsorships and donations along with the teams&#x27; enrollment fees.

<text>The Urnfield culture () was a late Bronze Age culture of Central Europe, often divided into several local cultures within a broader Urnfield tradition. The name comes from the custom of cremating the dead and placing their ashes in urns, which were then buried in fields. The first usage of the name occurred in publications over grave sites in southern Germany in the late 19th century. Over much of Europe, the Urnfield culture followed the Tumulus culture and was succeeded by the Hallstatt culture. Some linguists and archaeologists have associated this culture with a pre-Celtic language or Proto-Celtic language family. By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Urnfield Tradition had spread through Italy, northwestern Europe, and as far west as the Pyrenees. It is at this time that fortified hilltop settlements and sheet‐bronze metalworking also spread widely across Europe, leading some authorities to equate these changes with the expansion of the Celts. These links are no longer accepted.

==Chronology==

It is believed that in some areas, such as in southwestern Germany, the Urnfield culture was in existence around 1200 BC (beginning of Hallstatt A or Ha A), but the Bronze D Riegsee-phase already contains cremations. As the transition from the middle Bronze Age to the Urnfield culture was gradual, there are questions regarding how to define it.

The Urnfield culture covers the phases Hallstatt A and B (Ha A and B) in Paul Reinecke&#x27;s chronological system, not to be confused with the Hallstatt culture (Ha C and D) of the following Iron Age. This corresponds to the Phases Montelius III-IV of the Northern Bronze Age. Whether Reinecke&#x27;s Bronze D is included varies according to author and region.

The Urnfield culture is divided into the following sub-phases (based on Müller-Karpe sen.):
The existence of the Ha B3-phase is contested, as the material consists of female burials only. As can be seen by the arbitrary 100-year ranges, the dating of the phases is highly schematic. The phases are based on typological changes, which means that they do not have to be strictly contemporaneous across the whole distribution. All in all, more radiocarbon and dendro-dates would be highly desirable.

==Origin==
The Urnfield culture grew from the preceding Tumulus culture. The transition is gradual, in the pottery as well as the burial rites. In some parts of Germany, cremation and inhumation existed simultaneously (facies Wölfersheim). Some graves contain a combination of Tumulus-culture pottery and Urnfield swords (Kressbronn, Bodenseekreis) or Tumulus culture incised pottery together with early Urnfield types (Mengen). In the North, the Urnfield culture was only adopted in the HaA2 period.
16 pins deposited in a swamp in Ellmoosen (Kr. Bad Aibling, Germany) cover the whole chronological range from Bronze B to the early Urnfield period (Ha A). This demonstrates a considerable ritual continuity. In the Loire, Seine, and Rhône, certain fords contain deposits from the late Neolithic onward up to the Urnfield period.

The origins of the cremation rite are commonly believed to be in Hungary, where it was widespread since the first half of the second millennium BC. The neolithic Cucuteni–Trypillia culture of modern-day northeastern Romania and Ukraine were also practicing cremation rituals as early as approximately 5500 BC. Some cremations begin to be found in the Proto-Lusatian and Trzciniec culture.

==Distribution and local groups==
The Urnfield culture was located in an area stretching from western Hungary to eastern France, from the Alps to near the North Sea.
Local groups, mainly differentiated by pottery, include:

South-German Urnfield culture
* Northeast-Bavarian Group, divided into a lower Bavarian and an upper Palatinate group
* Lower-Main-Swabian group in southern Hesse and Baden-Württemberg, including the Marburger, Hanauer, lower Main and Friedberger facies
* Rhenish-Swiss group in Rhineland-Palatinate, Switzerland and eastern France, (abbreviated RSFO in French)
Lower-Rhine Urnfield culture
* Lower Hessian Group
* North-Netherlands-Westphalian group
* Northwest-Group in the Dutch Delta region

Middle-Danube Urnfield culture
* Velatice-Baierdorf in Moravia and Austria
* Čaka culture in western Slovakia
* Gáva culture
* Belegiš culture
* Piliny culture
* Kyjatice culture
* Milavce culture in southwestern Bohemia
* Unstrut culture in Thuringia
* Virovitica in Slovenia and Croatia
* Lusatian culture in northern Bohemia, Lusatia and Poland

Sometimes the distribution of artifacts belonging to these groups shows sharp and consistent borders, which might indicate some political structures, like tribes. Metalwork is commonly of a much more widespread distribution than pottery and does not conform to these borders. It may have been produced at specialised workshops catering for the elite of a large area.

Important French cemeteries include Châtenay and Lingolsheim (Alsace). An unusual earthwork was constructed at Goloring near Koblenz in Germany.

==Related cultures==

The central European Lusatian culture forms part of the Urnfield tradition, but continues into the Iron Age without a notable break.

The Piliny culture in northern Hungary and Slovakia grew from the Tumulus culture, but used urn burials as well. The pottery shows strong links to the Gáva culture, but in the later phases, a strong influence of the Lusatian culture is found.


In Italy the late Bronze Age Canegrate and Proto-Villanovan cultures and the early Iron Age Villanovan culture show similarities with the urnfields of central Europe. The Italic peoples are descended from the Urnfield and Tumulus culture, who inhabited Italy from at least the second millennium BC onwards. Latins achieved a dominant position among these tribes, establishing the ancient Roman civilization. During this development, other Italic tribes adopted the Latin language and culture in a process known as Romanization.

Urnfields are found in the French Languedoc and Catalonia from the 9th to 8th centuries. The change in burial custom was most probably influenced by developments further east.

Evidence for an association between the Urnfield culture and a hypothetical Italo-Celtic language group has been discussed by scholars such as Peter Schrijver.

Placename evidence has also been used to point to an association of the Urnfield materials with the Proto-Celtic language group in central Europe, and it has been argued that it was the ancestral culture of the Celts. The Urnfield layers of the Hallstatt culture, &quot;Ha A&quot; and &quot;Ha B&quot;, are succeeded by the Iron Age &quot;Hallstatt period&quot; proper: &quot;Ha C&quot; and &quot;Ha D&quot; (8th-6th centuries BC), associated with the early Celts; &quot;Ha D&quot; is in turn succeeded by the La Tène culture, the archaeological culture associated with the Continental Celts of antiquity.

The Golasecca culture in northern Italy developed with continuity from the Canegrate culture. Canegrate represented a completely new cultural dynamic to the area expressed in pottery and bronzework, making it a typical western example of the Urnfield culture, in particular the Rhine-Switzerland-Eastern France (RSFO) Urnfield culture. The Lepontic Celtic language inscriptions of the area show the language of the Golasecca culture was clearly Celtic making it probable that the 13th-century BC language of at least the RSEF area of the western urnfields was also Celtic or a precursor to it.

The influence of the Urnfield culture spread widely and found its way to the northeastern Iberian coast, where the nearby Celtiberians of the interior adapted it for use in their cemeteries. Evidence for east-to-west early Urnfield (Bronze D-Hallstatt A) elite contacts such as rilled-ware, swords and crested helmets has been found in the southwest of the Iberian peninsula. The appearance of such elite status markers provides the simplest explanation for the spread of Celtic languages in this area from prestigious, proto-Celtic, early-Urnfield metalworkers.
==Migrations==
The numerous hoards of the Urnfield culture and the existence of fortified settlements (hill forts) were taken as evidence for widespread warfare and upheaval by some scholars.

Written sources describe several collapses and upheavals in the Eastern Mediterranean, Anatolia and the Levant around the time of the Urnfield origins:
* End of the Mycenean culture with a conventional date of  1200 BC
* Destruction of Troy VI  1200 BC
* Battles of Ramses III against the Sea Peoples, 1195–1190 BC
* End of the Hittite empire 1180 BC
* Settlement of the Philistines in Canaan  1170 BC

Some scholars, among them Wolfgang Kimmig and P. Bosch-Gimpera have postulated a Europe-wide wave of migrations. The so-called Dorian invasion of Greece was placed in this context as well (although more recent evidence suggests that the Dorians moved in 1100 BC into a post Mycenaean vacuum, rather than precipitating the collapse).

==Ethnicity==
The variety of regional groups belonging to this culture makes it possible to exclude the presence of ethnic uniformity. Marija Gimbutas connected the various Central European regional groups to as many proto-populations: proto-Celts, proto-Italics, proto-Veneti, proto-Illyrians and proto-Phrygians (as well as proto-Thracians and proto-Dorians), who would establish themselves later, through migrations, in their historic locations. This migration (disputed by some) occurred during the period called late Bronze Age collapse and was perhaps caused by climate changes. Communities of peasants and herders, led by a warrior aristocracy, introduced the new rite of cremation, new ceramic styles and the mass production of metal objects as well as a new religion and Indo-European languages in various regions of Western and Southern Europe.

==Settlements==
The number of settlements increased sharply in comparison with the preceding Tumulus culture. Few of them have been comprehensively excavated. Fortified settlements, often on hilltops or in river-bends, are typical for the Urnfield culture. They are heavily fortified with dry-stone or wooden ramparts. Excavations of open settlements are rare, but they show that large 3-4 aisled houses built with wooden posts and wall of wattle and daub were common. Pit dwellings are known as well; they might have served as cellars.

===Fortified settlements===

Fortified hilltop settlements become common in the Urnfield period. Often a steep spur was used, where only part of the circumference had to be fortified. Depending on the locally available materials, dry-stone walls, gridded timbers filled with stones or soil or plank and palisade type &quot;pfostenschlitzmauer&quot; fortifications were used. Other fortified settlements used river-bends and swampy areas.

Metal working is concentrated in the fortified settlements. On the Runder Berg near Urach, Germany, 25 stone moulds have been found.

Hillforts are interpreted as central places. Some scholars see the emergence of hill forts as a sign of increased warfare. Most hillforts were abandoned at the end of the Bronze Age.

Examples of fortified settlements include Bullenheimer Berg, Ehrenbürg, Hünenburg bei Watenstedt, Heunischenburg, Hesselberg, Bürgstadter Berg, Farrenberg, Gelbe Burg and Ipf in Germany, Burgstallkogel, Thunau am Kamp and Oberleiserberg in Austria, Corent and Gannat in France, Hořovice and Plešivec in the Czech Republic, Biskupin in Poland, Ormož in Slovenia, Corneşti-Iarcuri, Sântana and Teleac in Romania, Gradište Idoš in Serbia, and Velem and Csanádpalota–Földvár in Hungary.

The 30.5 ha plateau of the Bullenheimer Berg in Germany was the site of a &quot;large, walled, city-like fortification&quot; in the later Urnfield period. Excavations have revealed a dense settlement across the whole plateau, including courtyard-type buildings located on artificially raised terraces. The fortified settlement on the Ehrenbürg, also covering about 30 ha and surrounded by a timber and stone wall, was another regional centre and the residence of a regional elite. At the hill fort of Hořovice near Beroun (Czech Republic), 50 ha were surrounded by a stone wall. Most settlements were much smaller however.

Corneşti-Iarcuri in Romania was the largest prehistoric settlement in Europe, at almost 6 km across, with four fortification lines and an inner settlement with a diameter of c. 2 km. Magnetic mapping and excavations have indicated the existence of a well-organised settlement of proto-urban character during the Urnfield period. An estimated 824,00 tonnes of earth had to be moved for the construction of the fortification walls alone. Magnetometric surveys at Sântana have revealed the existence of buildings with lengths exceeding 40 m, including a building approximately 60 m long and 40 m wide.

&quot;Mega forts&quot; such as Corneşti-Iarcuri, Sântana and Gradište Idoš were surrounded by numerous smaller settlements, including fortified sites. They formed part of a general movement towards large fortified sites across Europe in the Late Bronze Age, possibly in response to new styles of warfare. The general uniformity in design, material culture, and the density of settlements in Romania and Serbia at this time is indicative of societies that were organized under a common political framework. Kristiansen and Suchowska-Ducke (2015) describe these mega-sites as &quot;part of a political centralisation process, a complex chiefdom, or archaic state&quot;.

In 2018, the remains of a Late Bronze Age &#x27;feasting hall&#x27; were excavated at the site of Lăpuş in Romania.

===Open settlements===

Urnfield period houses were one or two-aisled. Some were quite small, 4.5 m × 5 m at the Runder Berg (Urach, Germany), 5-8m long in Künzig (Bavaria, Germany), others up to 20 m long. They were built with wooden posts and walls of wattle and daub. At the Velatice-settlement of Lovčičky (Moravia, Czech Republic) 44 houses have been excavated. Large bell shaped storage pits are known from the Knovíz culture. The settlement of Radonice (Louny) contained over 100 pits. They were most probably used to store grain and demonstrate a considerable surplus-production.

===Pile dwellings===

On lakes of southern Germany and Switzerland, numerous pile dwellings were constructed. They consist either of simple houses made of wattle and daub, or log-built. The settlement at Zug, Switzerland, was destroyed by fire and gives important insights into the material culture and the settlement organisation of this period. It has yielded a number of dendro-dates as well.

==Material culture==
===Pottery===

The pottery is normally well made, with a smooth surface and a normally sharply carinated profile. Some forms are thought to imitate metal prototypes. Biconical pots with cylindrical necks are especially characteristic. There is some incised decoration, but a large part of the surface was normally left plain. Fluted decoration is common. In the Swiss pile dwellings, the incised decoration was sometimes inlaid with tin foil.
Pottery kilns were already known (Elchinger Kreuz, Bavaria), as is indicated by the homogeneous surface of the vessels as well.
Other vessels include cups of beaten sheet-bronze with riveted handles (type Jenišovice) and large cauldrons with cross attachments. Wooden vessels have only been preserved in waterlogged contexts, for example from Auvernier (Neuchâtel), but may have been quite widespread.

===Tools and weapons===

The early Urnfield period (1300 BC) was a time when the warriors of central Europe could be heavily armored with body armor, helmets and shields all made of bronze, most likely borrowing the idea from Mycenaean Greece.

The leaf-shaped Urnfield sword could be used for slashing, in contrast to the stabbing-swords of the preceding Tumulus culture. It commonly possessed a ricasso. The hilt was normally made from bronze as well. It was cast separately and consisted of a different alloy. These solid hilted swords were known since Bronze D (Rixheim swords). Other swords have tanged blades and probably had a wood, bone, or antler hilt. Flange-hilted swords had organic inlays in the hilt. Swords include Auvernier, Kressborn-Hemigkofen, Erbenheim, Möhringen, Weltenburg, Hemigkofen and Tachlovice-types.

Protective gear like shields, cuirasses, greaves and helmets are rare and almost never found in burials. The best-known example of a bronze shield comes from Plzeň in Bohemia and has a riveted handhold. Comparable pieces have been found in Germany, Western Poland, Denmark, Great Britain and Ireland. They are supposed to have been made in upper Italy or the Eastern Alps and imitate wooden shields. Irish bogs have yielded examples of leather shields (Clonbrinn, Co. Wexford). Bronze cuirasses are known since Bronze D (Čaka, grave II, Slovakia).

Complete bronze cuirasses have been found in Saint Germain du Plain, nine examples, one inside the other, in Marmesse, Haute Marne (France), fragments in Albstadt-Pfeffingen (Germany). Bronze dishes (phalerae) may have been sewn on a leather armour. Greaves of richly decorated sheet-bronze are known from Kloštar Ivanić (Croatia) and the Paulus cave near Beuron (Germany).

===Chariots and wagons===

About a dozen wagon-burials of four wheeled wagons with bronze fittings are known from the early Urnfield period. They include Hart an der Altz (Kr. Altötting), Mengen (Kr. Sigmaringen), Poing (Kr. Ebersberg), Königsbronn (Kr. Heidenheim) from Germany and St. Sulpice (Vaud), Switzerland. In Alz, the chariot had been placed on the pyre, and pieces of bone are attached to the partially melted metal of the axles. Bronze (one-part) bits appear at the same time. Two-part horse bits are only known from late Urnfield contexts and may be due to eastern influence. Wood- and bronze spoked wheels are known from Stade (Germany), a wooden spoked wheel from Mercurago, Italy. Wooden dish-wheels have been excavated at Courcelettes, Switzerland and the Wasserburg Buchau, Germany (diameter 80 cm).

Bronze spoked wheels from Hassloch and Stade (in Germany) have been described as &quot;the most ambitious craft endeavour of all Bronze Age bronze objects&quot;, representing &quot;the highest achievement of prehistoric bronze casters in non-Greek Europe ... In terms of casting technique, they are on a par with the casting of a Greek bronze statue.&quot; 

====Cult wagon models====

In Milavče near Domažlice, Bohemia, a four-wheeled miniature bronze wagon bearing a large cauldron (diameter 30 cm) contained a cremation. This exceptionally rich burial was covered by a barrow. The bronze wagon model from Acholshausen in (Bavaria) comes from a male burial. 

Such wagons are also known from the Nordic Bronze Age. The Skallerup wagon, Denmark, contained a cremation as well. At Peckatel (Kr. Schwerin) in Mecklenburg a cauldron-wagon and other rich grave goods accompanied an inhumation under a barrow (Montelius III/IV). Another example comes from Ystad in Sweden. South-eastern European examples include Kanya in Hungary and Orăştie in Romania. Clay miniature wagons, sometimes with waterfowl, were known there since the middle Bronze Age (Dupljaja, Vojvodina, Serbia). 

A Lusatian chariot model from Burg (Brandenburg, Germany) has three wheels on a single axle, on which waterfowl perch. The grave of Gammertingen (Kr. Sigmaringen, Germany) contained two socketed horned applications that probably belonged to a miniature wagon comparable to the Burg example, together with six miniature spoked wheels.

===Hoards===
Hoards are very common in the Urnfield culture. The custom was abandoned at the end of the Bronze Age. They were often deposited in rivers and wet places like swamps. As these spots were often quite inaccessible, they most probably represent gifts to the gods. Other hoards contain either broken or miscast objects that were probably intended for reuse by bronze smiths. As Late Urnfield hoards often contain the same range of objects as earlier graves, some scholars interpret hoarding as a way to supply personal equipment for the hereafter. In the river Trieux, Côtes du Nord, complete swords were found together with numerous antlers of red deer that may have had a religious significance as well.

==Iron==

An iron knife or sickle from Ganovce in Slovakia, possibly dating from the 18th century BC, may be the earliest evidence of smelted iron in Central Europe. Other early finds include an iron ring from Vorwohlde (Germany) dating from c. the 15th century BC (Reinecke B), and an iron chisel from Heegermühle (Germany) dating from . During the late Bronze Age, iron was used to decorate the hilts of swords (Schwäbisch-Hall-Gailenkirchen, Unterkrumbach, Kr. Hersbruck), knives (Dotternhausen, Plettenberg, Germany), pins and some other ornaments. The Carpathian Basin was an early centre of iron technology, with iron artefacts dating from the 10th century BC, and possibly as early as the 12th century BC. Regular use of iron for weapons and tools in Central Europe began with the Hallstatt culture.
==Economy==

Cattle, pigs, sheep and goats were kept, as well as horses, dogs and geese. The cattle were rather small, with a height of 1.20 m at the withers. Horses were not much bigger with a mean of 1.25 m.

Forest clearance was intensive in the Urnfield period. Probably open meadows were created for the first time, as shown by pollen analysis. This led to increased erosion and sediment-load of the rivers. New crops and more intensive agrarian regimes are introduced, transforming landscapes on a large scale.

Wheat and barley were cultivated, together with pulses and the horse bean. Poppy seeds were used for oil or as a drug. Millet and oats were cultivated for the first time in Hungary and Bohemia, and rye was already cultivated; further west it was only a noxious weed. Flax seems to have been of reduced importance, maybe because mainly wool was used for clothes.
Hazel nuts, apples, pears, sloes and acorns were collected. Some rich graves contain bronze sieves that have been interpreted as wine-sieves (Hart an der Alz). This beverage would have been imported from the South, but supporting evidence is lacking.
In the lacustrine settlement of Zug, remains of a broth made of spelt and millet have been found. In the lower-Rhine urnfields, leavened bread was often placed on the pyre and burnt fragments have thus been preserved.

Wool was spun (finds of spindle whorls are common) and woven on the warp-weighted loom; bronze needles (&quot;Unteruhldingen&quot;) were used for sewing.

Weighing scales were used for trade and weighed metal was used as a form of payment or money. Bronze sickles are also thought to have served as a form of commodity money.

There is some suggestion that the Urnfield culture is associated with a wetter climatic period than the earlier Tumulus cultures. This may be associated with the diversion of the mid-latitude winter storms north of the Pyrenees and the Alps, possibly associated with drier conditions in the Mediterranean basin.

==Numerals==
Large hoards of sickles dating from the Bronze Age have been excavated across central Europe which feature a range of cast markings. An analysis of the Frankleben hoard and other sickle hoards from Germany dating from the Tumulus and Urnfield periods found that markings on the sickles constitute a numeral system related to the lunar calendar. According to the Halle State Museum of Prehistory:


The sickles also feature other marks or symbols which the archaeologist Christoph Sommmerfeld (1994) suggests may represent &#x27;conceptual signs&#x27;, or a type of proto-writing. Markings on sickles and tools from across Bronze Age Europe have been interpreted by other authors as ownership marks, sign systems, number systems or &quot;units of information&quot; of unknown meaning.

&#x27;Counting marks&#x27; have also been identified on bronze armrings and ingots from the Urnfield period, possibly related to trade. Similar markings found on pottery have been interpreted as serving a calendar function.

Simple numerals in the form of lines and dots are found on identical &#x27;ritual objects&#x27; from Haschendorf in Austria and Balkåkra in Sweden, which represent assembly instructions for the objects. The decorated discs on both objects have been interpreted as solar calendars.

The archaeologist Mikkel Hansen (2019) has suggested that the Urnfield sickle-numeral system may be related to &#x27;hand signs&#x27; found among petroglyphs from the Nordic Bronze Age, which may have a similar numerical and calendrical meaning.

==Golden hats==

Four elaborate cone-shaped hats made from thin sheets of gold have been found in Germany and France dating from c. 1500-800 BC (the Tumulus culture to Urnfield period). They may have been worn as ceremonial hats by individuals described by researchers as &quot;king-priests&quot; or oracles.

The gold hats are covered in bands of ornaments or symbols along their whole length and extent. The symbols – mostly disks and concentric circles, sometimes wheels, crescents, pointed oval shapes and triangles – were punched using stamps, rolls or combs. The discs and concentric circles are interpreted as solar and possibly lunar symbols.

An analysis of the Berlin Gold Hat found that the symbols numerically encode a lunisolar calendar based on the 19-year Metonic cycle. According to Wilfried Menghin &quot;The symbols on the hat are a logarithmic table which enables the movements of the sun and the moon to be calculated in advance.&quot; Similar information is thought to be encoded on the hats from Ezelsdorf-Buch, Schifferstadt and Avanton.

According to the Neues Museum the Berlin Gold Hat could also be used to predict lunar eclipses. Astronomers Rahlf Hansen and Christine Rink have argued that the Berlin hat encodes knowledge of Saros lunar eclipse cycles. Evidence for knowledge of these cycles is also known from the later Hallstatt period.

The various ornaments on the Berlin hat include a band of 19 &#x27;star and crescent&#x27; symbols, placed above 19 pointed-oval symbols which are thought to represent the planet Venus. Similar &#x27;Venus&#x27; symbols are found on the gold hats from Ezelsdorf-Buch and Schifferstadt. According to some researchers a Venus calendar is encoded on the gold hats.

Circular symbols similar to those on the gold hats are also found on gold bowls dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, including those from the Eberswalde hoard. Some of these are also thought to contain calendrical information.

Astronomical and calendrical interpretations have been proposed for a variety of other decorated artefacts dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, including gold artefacts from the Bullenheimer Berg in Germany, a gold diadem from Velem in Hungary, gold appliqués from Lake Bled in Slovenia, gold discs and a gold belt from the Czech Republic, the Trundholm Sun Chariot from Denmark, bronze discs from Germany and Denmark, and bronze urns from Germany, Denmark and Poland (including Seddin, Gevelinghausen and Herzberg).

The gold hats and diadems have been linked to the Casco de Leiro from Spain and the Comerford Crown from Ireland, as well as to gold diadems from Mycenae in Greece, all of which bear similar symbols.

In his analysis of the Velem diadem, archaeologist Gabor Ilon writes: &quot;high-ranking members of the elite in Bronze Age Europe were proud owners of gold foil-covered costume adornments and symbols of status and power as well as of golden vessels, objects of social display, decorated with an identical set of symbols ... embodying what was presumably an identical and coherent spiritual background.&quot; According to the Musée d&#x27;Archaeologie Nationale, &quot;these precious and remarkably executed objects evoke a complex society, undoubtedly strictly hierarchical, with advanced technical and astronomical knowledge, organized around work in the fields&quot;.

==Funerary customs==

===Graves===
In the Tumulus period, multiple inhumations under barrows were common, at least for the upper levels of society. In the Urnfield period, inhumation and burial in single flat graves prevails, though some barrows exist.

In the earliest phases of the Urnfield period, man-shaped graves were dug, sometimes provided with a stone lined floor, in which the cremated remains of the deceased were spread. Only later, burial in urns became prevalent. Some scholars speculate that this may have marked a fundamental shift in people&#x27;s beliefs or myths about life and the afterlife.

The size of the urnfields is variable. In Bavaria, they can contain hundreds of burials, while the largest cemetery in Baden-Württemberg in Dautmergen has only 30 graves.
The dead were placed on pyres, covered in their personal jewellery, which often shows traces of the fire and sometimes food-offerings. The cremated bone-remains are much larger than in the Roman period, which indicates that less wood was used. Often, the bones have been incompletely collected.
Most urnfields are abandoned with the end of the Bronze Age, only the Lower Rhine urnfields continue in use in the early Iron Age (Ha C, sometimes even D).

The cremated bones could be placed in simple pits. Sometimes the dense concentration of the bones indicates a container of organic material, sometimes the bones were simply shattered.

If the bones were placed in urns, these were often covered by a shallow bowl or a stone. In a special type of burial (bell-graves) the urns are completely covered by an inverted larger vessel. As graves rarely overlap, they may have been marked by wooden posts or stones.
Stone-pacing graves are typical of the Unstrut group.

===Grave gifts===

The urn containing the cremated bones is often accompanied by other, smaller ceramic vessels, like bowls and cups. They may have contained food. The urn is often placed in the centre of the assemblage. Often, these vessels have not been placed on the pyre. Metal grave gifts include razors, weapons that often have been deliberately destroyed (bent or broken), bracelets, pendants and pins. Metal grave gifts become rarer towards the end of the Urnfield culture, while the number of hoards increase.
Burnt animal bones are often found, they may have been placed on the pyre as food. The marten bones in the grave of Seddin may have belonged to a garment (pelt).
Amber or glass beads (Pfahlbautönnchen) are luxury items.

===Upper-class graves===
Upper-class burials were placed in wooden chambers, rarely stone cists or chambers with a stone-paved floor and covered with a barrow or cairn. The graves contain especially finely made pottery, animal bones, usually of pigs, sometimes gold rings or sheets, and in exceptional cases miniature wagons.
Some of these rich burials contain the remains of more than one person. In this case, women and children are normally seen as sacrifices. Until more is known about the status distribution and the social structure of the late Bronze Age, this interpretation should be viewed with caution, however.
Towards the end of the Urnfield period, some bodies were burnt in situ and then covered by a barrow, reminiscent of the burial of Patroclus as described by Homer and the burial of Beowulf (with the additional ship burial element). The grave of Seddin (c. 9th century BC) has been described as a &quot;Homeric burial&quot; due to its close similarity to contemporary elite burials in Greece and Italy. In the early Iron Age, inhumation became the rule again.

==Cult==
An obsession with waterbirds is indicated by numerous pictures and three-dimensional representations. Combined with the hoards deposited in rivers and swamps, it indicates religious beliefs connected with water. This has led some scholars to believe in serious droughts during the late Bronze Age.
Sometimes the water-birds are combined with circles, the so-called sun-barque or solar boat motif. Moon-shaped clay firedogs or &#x27;moon idols&#x27; are thought to have a religious significance, as well as crescent shaped razors.

The Goloring earthwork enclosure in Germany (c. 1200-800 BC) was a cult site with a possible calendar function, similar to earlier sites such as Pömmelte in Germany and Stonehenge in Britain with which it shares similar proportions and circular design.

The Kyffhäuser caves in Thuringia contain headless skeletons and animal bones that have been interpreted as sacrifices. Other deposits include grain, knotted vegetable fibres and hair and bronze objects (axes, pendants and pins). The Ith-caves (Lower Saxony) have yielded comparative material.

==Genetics==
A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in March 2015 examined the remains of an Urnfield male buried in Halberstadt, Germany ca 1100-1000 BC. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1a1a1b1a2 and the maternal haplogroup H23.

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in March 2019 found a significant increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia during the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. The authors of the study suggested that the spread of the Urnfield culture was associated with this transition, during which the Celtiberians may have emerged. A Celtiberian male examined in the study was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup I2a1a1a.

<text>Tres Hombres is the third studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top, released on July 26, 1973, by London Records. It was the band&#x27;s first collaboration with engineer Terry Manning. The album would be ZZ Top&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in the United States charts. It peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; albums chart in 1974. Its lead single &quot;La Grange&quot; reached number 41 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;. It is the first of many ZZ Top albums to incorporate the use of Spanish terminology in their branding. &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; means &quot;three men&quot; in Spanish.

== Recording and production ==

The track &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Bus&quot; segues into &quot;Jesus Just Left Chicago&quot; almost seamlessly. &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; entertainment writer Andrew Dansby wrote in 2013 that this fusing of the songs was not the original plan. Dansby claimed that the album&#x27;s engineer was splicing tape and cut too much, leaving no gap between the songs. The album&#x27;s engineer Terry Manning, who performed the edit, counter-claimed in a 2017 blog post that it was no accident. Manning admitted that although it was not planned, as an engineer he was &quot;always looking very carefully at the timings between songs... counting time, feeling how different time sigs go together, different keys, different feels&quot;. Manning wrote that he &quot;tried several things to see how those two [songs] would go together&quot; when it dawned on him that they could &quot;come together as one song, exactly as if played that way.&quot; Manning wrote that when he initially presented the edit, Billy Gibbons loved it, while the album&#x27;s producer Bill Ham was confused and wary of it. &quot;[A]fter several plays,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it was obvious (to) everyone that there was no other way they could ever exist again.&quot;

== Release ==
The album was released in July 1973. Frontman Billy Gibbons said in 2013:

We could tell that we had something special. The record became quite the turning point for us. The success was handwriting on the wall, because from that point we became honorary citizens of Memphis.

At the height of ZZ Top&#x27;s success in the mid-1980s, a digitally remixed version of the recording was released on CD and the original 1973 mix was no longer issued. The remix version created controversy among fans because it significantly changed the sound of the instruments, especially drums. The remix version was used on all early CD copies and was the only version available for over 20 years. A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on February 28, 2006, which contains three bonus live tracks. The 2006 edition is the first CD version to use Manning&#x27;s original 1973 mix. Subsequent releases on digital platforms such as iTunes have used the original mix as well.

In addition to the standard 2-channel stereo version, a four-channel quadraphonic version was also released in 1973 in the Quad 8 8-track tape and Q4 Reel-to-reel tape formats.

The only international single released from the album in most countries was &quot;La Grange&quot; (backed with &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; from the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Rio Grande Mud&quot;), which peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1974. The song &quot;Beer Drinkers &amp; Hell Raisers&quot; was released as a UK only single.

== Reception ==

The album was released to a lukewarm reception by critic Steve Apple, who in a September 1973 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that while the &quot;Southern rock &amp; roll sound&quot; was becoming popular, ZZ Top themselves were &quot;only one of several competent Southern rocking bands&quot;, though they had &quot;an advantage over most white rockers&quot; because they &quot;sound black&quot;. He felt that ZZ Top had &quot;the dynamic rhythms that only the finest of the three-piece bands can cook up. Billy Gibbons plays a tasty Duane Allman lead with Dusty Hill and Frank Beard pounding out the funky bottom&quot;, and were &quot;one of the most inventive of the three-piece rockers&quot; but wondered when &quot;audiences will get tired of hearing the same ... &#x27;Poot yawl hans together&#x27; patter.&quot; The album peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2000, the album was voted number 501 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked number 498 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2012 ranked at number 490 on a revised list. In 2011 &quot;Houston Press&quot; named it the best boogie rock album ever in its list of &quot;Five Essential Boogie-Rock Albums&quot;. In July 2013, 40 years after its release, the album was described by Andrew Dansby in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; as &quot;... full of characters and doings so steeped in caricature – yet presented straight-faced – as to invite skepticism. The album is stuffed with color and flavor, much like its famous gate-fold photo on the inside: a gut-busting couple of plates of food from the much-beloved but now-closed Leo&#x27;s Mexican Restaurant on South Shepherd near Westheimer.&quot; AllMusic commented that &quot;&quot;Tres Hombres&quot; is the record that brought ZZ Top their first top ten record, making them stars in the process. It couldn&#x27;t have happened to a better record&quot;, and rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Andy Beta of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded the album 9.0 out of 10, writing in 2017 that, &quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s 1973 breakthrough was a masterful melding of complementary styles, cramming Southern rock and blues boogie through the band&#x27;s own idiosyncratic filter.&quot;

<doc id="278229" wikidata="Q274488" url="?curid=278229" title="Eastern Wu">
<text>Wu (Chinese: 吳; pinyin: &quot;Wú&quot;; Middle Chinese *&quot;ŋuo&quot; &lt; Eastern Han Chinese: &quot;*ŋuɑ&quot;), known in historiography as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was a dynastic state of China and one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period. It previously existed from 220 to 222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared complete independence in November 222. It was elevated to an empire in May 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan (Emperor Da), declared himself emperor. 

The name &quot;Wu&quot; was derived from the place it was based in—the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as &quot;Wu&quot;. It was called &quot;Dong Wu&quot; (&quot;Eastern Wu&quot;) or &quot;Sun Wu&quot; by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called &quot;Eastern Wu&quot; because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and &quot;Sun Wu&quot; because the family name of its rulers was &quot;Sun&quot;.

During its existence, Wu&#x27;s capital was sometimes at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) and sometimes at Wuchang (; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).

==History==
===Beginnings and founding===
Towards the end of the Han dynasty, Sun Ce, the eldest son of the warlord Sun Jian, and his followers borrowed troops from the warlord Yuan Shu and embarked on a series of military conquests in the Jiangdong and Wu regions between 194 and 199, seizing several territories previously occupied by warlords such as Liu Yao, Yan Baihu and Wang Lang. Sun Ce broke off relations with Yuan Shu around 196–197 after the latter declared himself emperor—an act deemed as treason against Emperor Xian, the figurehead ruler of the Han dynasty. The warlord Cao Cao, who was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government in the Han imperial court, asked Emperor Xian to grant Sun Ce the title of &quot;Marquis of Wu&quot; ().

Sun Ce was assassinated in the summer of 200 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan. Sun Quan, like his elder brother, also paid nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian while maintaining autonomous rule over the Wu territories. In 208, Sun Quan allied with the warlord Liu Bei and they combined forces to defeat Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Sun Quan and Liu Bei maintained their alliance against Cao Cao after the battle for the next ten years or so, despite having some territorial disputes over Jing Province. In 219, Sun Quan severed ties with Liu Bei when he sent his general Lü Meng to invade Liu&#x27;s territories in Jing Province. Guan Yu, who was defending Liu Bei&#x27;s assets in Jing Province, was captured and executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. After that, the boundaries of Sun Quan&#x27;s domain extended from beyond the Jiangdong region to include the southern part of Jing Province, which covered roughly present-day Hunan and parts of Hubei.

In 220, Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor, Cao Pi, ended the Han dynasty by forcing Emperor Xian to abdicate in his favour and established the state of Cao Wei. Sun Quan agreed to submit to Wei and was granted the title of a vassal king, &quot;King of Wu&quot; (), by Cao Pi. A year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han. In 222, Liu Bei launched a military campaign against Sun Quan to take back Jing Province and avenge Guan Yu, leading to the Battle of Xiaoting. However, Liu Bei suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun and was forced to retreat to Baidicheng, where he died a year later.

Liu Bei&#x27;s successor, Liu Shan, and his regent, Zhuge Liang, made peace with Sun Quan later and reaffirmed their previous alliance. Sun Quan declared independence from Wei in 222, but continued to rule as &quot;King of Wu&quot; until 229, when he declared himself &quot;Emperor of Wu&quot;. His legitimacy was recognised by Shu.

To distinguish the state from other historical Chinese states of the same name, historians have added a relevant character to the state&#x27;s original name: the state that called itself &quot;Wu&quot; (吳) is also known as &quot;Eastern Wu&quot; (東吳; Dōng Wú) or &quot;Sun Wu&quot; (孫吳).

===Sun Quan&#x27;s reign===
Sun Quan ruled for over 30 years and his long reign resulted in stability in southern China. During his reign, Wu engaged Wei in numerous wars, including the battles of Ruxu (222–223), Shiting (228), and Hefei (234). However, Wu never managed to gain any territory north of the Yangtze River while Wei also never succeeded in conquering the lands south of the Yangtze.

A succession struggle broke out between Sun Quan&#x27;s sons in the later part of his reign—Sun Quan installed Sun He as the crown prince in 242 after his former heir apparent, Sun Deng, died in 241, but Sun He soon became involved in a rivalry with his younger brother, Sun Ba. The conflict resulted in the emergence of two rivalling factions, each supporting either Sun He or Sun Ba, in Sun Quan&#x27;s imperial court. Sun Quan eventually deposed Sun He and forced Sun Ba to commit suicide, while Lu Xun and many other ministers who took either Sun He&#x27;s or Sun Ba&#x27;s side in the struggle met with unhappy ends. Sun Quan appointed his youngest son, Sun Liang, as the crown prince after the incident.

===Reigns of Sun Liang and Sun Xiu===
Sun Quan died in 252 and was succeeded by Sun Liang, with Zhuge Ke and Sun Jun serving as regents. In 253, Zhuge Ke was assassinated in a coup launched by Sun Jun, and the state power of Wu fell into Sun Jun&#x27;s hands and was passed on to his cousin, Sun Chen, after his death. During Sun Liang&#x27;s reign, two rebellions broke out in the Wei garrison at Shouchun (around present-day Shou County, Anhui) in 255 and 257–258. Sun Jun and Sun Chen led Wu forces to support the rebels in the first and second rebellions respectively in the hope of making some territorial gains in Wei, but both revolts were suppressed and the Wu forces retreated after suffering many losses.

Sun Liang was deposed in 258 by Sun Chen, who installed Sun Xiu, another son of Sun Quan, on the throne. Sun Xiu killed Sun Chen later in a coup with the help of Zhang Bu and Ding Feng.

===Fall of Wu===
Sun Xiu died of illness in 264, a year after Shu was conquered by Wei. At the time, Wu was experiencing internal turmoil because rebellions had broken out in Jiaozhi () in the south. The ministers Puyang Xing, Wan Yu and Zhang Bu decided to install Sun He&#x27;s son, Sun Hao, on the throne.

In the beginning of Sun Hao&#x27;s reign, the emperor reduced taxes, gave relief to the poor, and granted freedom to a large number of palace maids. However, Sun Hao gradually became more cruel and superstitious and started indulging in wine and women instead of finding ways to revive his declining state. Sun Hao&#x27;s tyranny caused widespread anger and hatred towards him in Wu, but it was due to the efforts of officials such as Lu Kai and Lu Kang that Wu was able to remain relatively stable and peaceful.

In February 266, Sima Yan ended the state of Cao Wei by forcing its last ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate in his favour, and then established the Jin dynasty. In 279, Jin forces led by Du Yu, Wang Jun and others attacked Wu from six directions. Sun Hao attempted to put up resistance by sending his armies to fight the Jin invaders, but the Wu forces suffered several consecutive defeats and even the Wu chancellor, Zhang Ti, was killed in action. Seeing that Wu was doomed to fall, Sun Hao surrendered to the Jin dynasty on 31 May 280, marking the end of Wu and the end of the Three Kingdoms period.

==Government and military==
Despite Sun Quan proclaiming himself emperor in 229, its politics reflected its warlord origins. When Wu was initially founded its military was dominated by famed generals who had gained their positions through prowess and pluck. These generals were celebrated for their individualism.

Politics within the court were often influenced by conflicts between powerful families and individuals. Positions within the court were inherited from one generation to the next unlike the Han dynasty&#x27;s bureaucracy. However, over time, the influence ultimately would move away from the central government. Outside of the court, families displayed their own independent authority. Wu, at times, was to a certain extent run for the protection of particular families.

The Eastern Wu era was a formative period in Vietnamese history. The ruler of Jiaozhou (modern Vietnam and Guangzhou), Shi Xie, is primarily remembered today in Vietnam as Sĩ Nhiếp. According to Stephen O&#x27;Harrow, Shi Xie was essentially &quot;the first Vietnamese.&quot; Originally satisfied with Eastern Wu&#x27;s rule, the Vietnamese opposed Shi Hui&#x27;s rebellion against Eastern Wu and attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general Lü Dai betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent Lu Yin to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of Lady Triệu in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi. According to the &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot; (Complete Annals of Đại Việt), Lady Triệu had long breasts that reached her shoulders and rode into battle on an elephant. After several months of warfare she was defeated and committed suicide.

==Language, culture and economy==


The culture of Wu was most solidified under the reign of Sun Quan from 229 to 252. Migrations from the north and the needed settlement from the Shanyue barbarians made it possible for the increase in manpower, agriculture, and settling the lower most parts of Wu. Along with that, river transportation became a huge factor and flourished as the Jiangnan and Zhedong canals were finished with construction. After the Battle of Xiaoting and during the invasions of Wu by Wei in the 220s, Shu was able to reestablish their trade and relationships with Wu. Shu&#x27;s cotton was a great influx for Wu, and the development of shipbuilding, salt, and metal industries was greatly increased.

The fact of inflation and economic problems still were in existence since the Han dynasty. Sun Quan tried to start a currency of large coins manufactured by copper. He also tried to prohibit private minting. This policy was terminated in 246 due to ineffectiveness.

Eastern Wu was able to make close overseas trade with countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia. Wu also traded with India and the Middle East.

The language of Eastern Wu was identified with Old Jiangdong (古江東方言), the speech of the Jiangdong area (Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Southern Anhui, Jiangsu); this dialect, which was already different from northern speech, is described in Shishuo Xinyu 世说新语 by Liu Yiqing (刘义庆, 403-444), which narrates that Wang Dao learned the idiom after fleeing in Jiankang, today&#x27;s Nanjing.

In the end, proto-Wu emerged as the unified proto-language from which every contemporary Wu language is spoken. Wu dialects have striking similarities to Early Middle Chinese as described in the Qieyun phonological system. A reconstruction of proto-Wu was attempted by William Harvey Ballard in 1969.

==Civil matters==
Personages with clerical or scholarly abilities had roles to play within the state, but the policies were more determined by those of military command. Nevertheless, every Wu army was in need of administrative support and, according to Rafe de Crespigny, certain scholars were &quot;recognised as practical counsellors, regardless of their fighting prowess or their ability to command troops in the field.&quot;

Under the reign of Sun Quan, he needed a strong role of advisors and secretaries in order to keep his link of power in a maintained level. Sun Quan&#x27;s prestige in dealing with hostiles and friendly relations called for the establishment of a controlled form of an imperial government for the empire of Wu. Sun Quan also created the opportunity for people residing within Wu to gain prestige and influence throughout the empire and the surrounding establishments with the duty of being an envoy.

Following the death of Cao Pi in 226, Sun Quan strongly promoted his kingdom to focus on agriculture because the threat from Wei was lifted. However, Lu Xun suggested to Sun Quan that military commanders should become involved in the colonization of land. Sun Quan quickly accepted and he, along with his sons would execute the memorial presented by Lu Xun. However, in 240, Sun Quan restrained Lu Xun&#x27;s idea and refocused on agricultural works, because Wu came to suffer a severe famine. In 234, when Zhuge Ke was in control of affairs in the south, he strongly ignored the colonisation order and viciously ordered the agriculture factor, often starving enemies into submission.

==Legacy==

Under the rule of Wu, the Yangtze River Delta region, regarded in early history as a barbaric &quot;jungle&quot;, developed into one of the commercial, cultural, and political centres of China. The achievements of Wu in the south marked the coming of Chinese civilization to the farthest southern reaches of the empire.

In 230, the island of Yizhou was reached by the Chinese during the Three Kingdoms period under the reign of Sun Quan. Contact with the native population and the dispatch of officials to an island named &quot;Yizhou&quot; () by the Wu navy might have been to Taiwan, but the location of Yizhou is open to dispute; some historians believe it was Taiwan, while others believe it was the Ryukyu Islands. Wu merchants also may have reached Southern Vietnam and Cambodia. Failed protection of Gongsun Yuan also was in existence when the latter rebelled against Wei. This was because of the waterway&#x27;s difficulties. Such things cost Wu, and the achievements supposedly gained within Taiwan did not cover this problem and Sun Quan lost his vassal.

Later on in the existence of Wu, the once great military was turned to an unimpressive one. It was most likely an easy task to take Hefei from Wei, but Wu could not do so. Since the 230s, this task was made harder due to the &quot;New City&quot;, a heavily fortified castle built at Hefei by Wei. One of the greatest failures to accomplish something later on in Wu&#x27;s reign was during 255 and during the last few years of the 250s. When Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin rebelled against Wei, Wu promised to help the two in Shouchun (around present-day Shou County, Anhui). However, the Wu forces never made it in time before the rebellion was quashed by Sima Shi and the Wei forces. When Zhuge Dan launched a massive full-scale rebellion, the Wu forces suffered a great defeat as they lent a great quantity of manpower to Zhuge Dan&#x27;s cause. Shouchun was quickly regained by Wei under Sima Zhao&#x27;s command.

During the conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, Wu could not fully lend support to their allies due to a revolt in Vietnam.

The decline of Wu was long in existence since the death of Lu Xun in 245 and the death of Sun Quan in 252. Sun Quan&#x27;s successors could do little for the empire. Zhuge Ke was assassinated by Sun Jun in 253 after a failed invasion of Hefei following the Wu victory over an invading Wei force at Dongxing. Ding Feng also ended up killing Sun Chen under orders from Sun Xiu. Corruption plagued Wu, which led to an easy conquest of Wu by the Jin dynasty in 280.

<text>A quasi-contract (or implied-in-law contract or constructive contract) is a fictional contract recognised by a court. The notion of a quasi-contract can be traced to Roman law and is still a concept used in some modern legal systems. Quasi contract laws have been deduced from the Latin statement &quot;Nemo debet locupletari ex aliena iactura&quot;, which proclaims that no one should grow rich out of another person&#x27;s loss. It was one of the central doctrines of Roman law.

==History==
In common law jurisdictions, the law of quasi-contract can be traced to the medieval form of action known as &quot;indebitatus assumpsit&quot;. In essence, the plaintiff would recover a money sum from the defendant &quot;as if&quot; the defendant had promised to pay it: that is, &quot;as if&quot; there were a contract subsisting between the parties. The defendant&#x27;s promise—their agreement to be bound by the &quot;contract&quot;—was implied by law. The law of quasi-contract was generally used to enforce restitutionary obligations.

The form of action known as &quot;indebitatus assumpsit&quot; came to include various sub-forms known as the common money counts. The most important of these for the later development of the law of quasi-contract included: (i) actions for money had and received to the plaintiff&#x27;s use; (ii) actions for money paid to the defendant&#x27;s use; (iii) &quot;quantum meruit&quot;; and (iv) &quot;quantum valebant&quot;.

Quasi-contractual actions were generally (but not exclusively) used to remedy what would now be called unjust enrichment. In most common law jurisdictions the law of quasi-contract has been superseded by the law of unjust enrichment.

== Quasi-contract and contract ==
A quasi-contract is distinct from a contract implied in fact and may be distinguished from an explicitly agreed contract. 
* &quot;Contract implied in fact.&quot; A person&#x27;s assent to be bound by an agreement can be expressed or implied. In the latter case, assuming the requisite formalities for a valid contract are met, there is a perfectly normal contract. The only distinction between a contract arising by express agreement between two people and a contract implied-in-fact is that the latter was recognized by a court drawing inferences from facts proved at trial. When the plaintiff sued on either sort of contract, he was suing in the law of contract in respect of a consensually assumed obligation and her remedy for the defendant&#x27;s breach was damages. 
* &quot;Quasi-contract&quot;. In contrast, quasi-contract refers to situations in which a defendant is bound &quot;as if&quot; there were a contract. When the plaintiff sued on such a &#x27;contract&#x27; by bringing an action of &quot;indebitatus assumpsit&quot;, he was not enforcing some consensually assumed obligation, but rather an obligation imposed by law.

<text>The Andalusian dialects of Spanish (, , ) are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla, and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties in a number of phonological, morphological and lexical features. Many of these are innovations which, spreading from Andalusia, failed to reach the higher strata of Toledo and Madrid speech and become part of the Peninsular norm of standard Spanish. Andalusian Spanish has historically been stigmatized at a national level, though this appears to have changed in recent decades, and there is evidence that the speech of Seville or the enjoys high prestige within Western Andalusia.

Due to the large population of Andalusia, Andalusian dialects are among the most widely spoken dialects in Spain. Within the Iberian Peninsula, other southern varieties of Spanish share some core elements of Andalusian, mainly in terms of phonetics notably Extremaduran Spanish and Murcian Spanish as well as, to a lesser degree, Manchegan Spanish.

Due to massive emigration from Andalusia to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and elsewhere, all Latin American Spanish dialects share some fundamental characteristics with Western Andalusian Spanish, such as the use of instead of for the second person informal plural, , and a lack of . Much of Latin American Spanish shares some other Andalusian characteristics too, such as , weakening of syllable-final, pronunciation of historical or the sound as a glottal fricative, and merging syllable-final and . Canarian Spanish is also strongly similar to Western Andalusian Spanish due to its settlement history.

== Phonology ==

=== Sibilants ===

Most Spanish dialects in Spain differentiate, at least in pre-vocalic position, between the sounds represented in traditional spelling by and (before and ), pronounced , and that of , pronounced . However, in many areas of Andalusia, the two phonemes are not distinguished and is used for both, which is known as &quot;seseo&quot; . In other areas, the sound manifests as (a sound close, but not identical to ), which is known as (). Unless a specific dialect is transcribed, transcriptions in this article follow the standard pattern found in the syllable onset, so that the orthographic and the soft are transcribed with , whereas the orthographic is transcribed with . Additionally, in most regions of Andalusia which distinguish and , the distinction involves a laminal , as opposed to the apico-alveolar of most of Spain.

The pronunciation of these sounds in Andalusia differs geographically, socially, and among individual speakers, and there has also been some shift in favor of the standard . As testament to the prevalence of intra-speaker variation, found that many Andalusians alternate between a variety of sibilants, with little discernible pattern. Additionally, the idea that areas of rural Andalusia at one time exclusively used has been challenged, and many speakers described as or -using have in fact alternated between use of and with little pattern. While is stigmatized and usually associated with rural areas, it is worth noting that it was historically found in some large cities such as Huelva and Cádiz, although not in the more prestigious cities of Seville and Córdoba.

Above all in eastern Andalusia, but also in locations in western Andalusia such as Huelva, Jerez, and Seville, there is a shift towards . Higher rates of are associated with education, youth, urban areas, and monitored speech. The strong influence of media and school may be driving this shift.

 provides a map showing the different ways of pronouncing these sounds in different parts of Andalusia. The map&#x27;s information almost entirely corresponds to the results from the Linguistic Atlas of the Iberian Peninsula, realized in the early 1930s in Andalusia and also described in . These sources generally highlight the most common pronunciation, in colloquial speech, in a given locality.

According to , the distinction between a laminal and is native to most of Almería, eastern Granada, most of Jaén, and northern Huelva, while the distinction between an apical and , as found in the rest of Peninsular Spanish, is native to the very northeastern regions of Almería, Granada and Jaén, to northern Córdoba, not including the provincial capital, and to a small region of northern Huelva. Also according to and , predominates in much of northwestern Huelva, the city of Seville as well as northern Seville province, most of southern Córdoba, including the capital, and parts of Jaén, far western Granada, very northern Málaga, and the city of Almería. Likewise, is found in southern Huelva, most of Seville, including an area surrounding but not including the capital, all of Cádiz including the capital, most of Málaga, western Granada, and parts of southern Almería.

Outside Andalusia, &quot;seseo&quot; also existed in parts of western Badajoz, including the capital, as of 1933, though it was in decline in many places and associated with the lower class. was likewise found, in 1933, in a southern, coastal area of Murcia around the city of Cartagena, and in parts of southern Alicante such as Torrevieja, near the linguistic border with Valencian. was also found in the Murcian villages of Perín and Torre-Pacheco, also near the coast.

=== Other general features ===
Andalusian Spanish phonology includes a large number of other distinctive features, compared to other dialects. Many of these are innovations, especially lenitions and mergers, and some of Andalusian Spanish&#x27;s most distinct lenitions and mergers occur in the syllable coda. Most broadly, these characteristics include &quot;yeísmo&quot;, the pronunciation of the sound like the English , velarization of word- and phrase-final to , elision of between vowels, and a number of reductions in the syllable coda, which includes occasionally merging the consonants and and leniting or even eliding most syllable-final consonants. A number of these features, so characteristic of Spain&#x27;s south, may have ultimately originated in Astur-leonese speaking areas of north-western Spain, where they can still be found.

The leniting of syllable-final consonants is quite frequent in middle-class speech, and some level of lenition is sociolinguistically unmarked within Andalusia, forming part of the local standard. That said, Andalusian speakers do tend to reduce the rate of syllable-final lenition in formal speech.

&quot;Yeísmo&quot;, or the merging of into , is general in most of Andalusia, and may likely be able to trace its origin to Astur-leonese settlers. That said, pockets of a distinction remain in rural parts of Huelva, Seville, and Cadiz. This merger has since spread to most of Latin American Spanish, and, in recent decades, to most of urban Peninsular Spanish.

 is usually aspirated, or pronounced , except in some eastern Andalusian sub-varieties (i.e. Jaén, Granada, Almería provinces), where the dorsal is retained. This aspirated pronunciation is also heard in most of Extremadura and parts of Cantabria.

Word-final often becomes a velar nasal , including when before another word starting in a vowel, as in for &#x27;they disgust me&#x27;. This features is shared with many other varieties of Spanish, including much of Latin America and the Canary Islands, as well as much of northwestern Spain, the likely origin of this velarization. This syllable-final nasal can even be deleted, leaving behind just a nasal vowel at the end of a word.

Intervocalic is elided in most instances, for example for (&#x27;heavy&#x27;), for (&#x27;often&#x27;). This is especially common in the past participle; e.g. becomes (&#x27;I have finished&#x27;). For the - suffix, this feature is common to all peninsular variants of Spanish, while in other positions it is widespread throughout most of the southern half of Spain. Also, as occurs in most of the Spanish-speaking world, final is usually dropped. This widespread elision of intervocalic throughout the vocabulary is also shared with several Asturian and Cantabrian dialects, pointing to a possible Asturian origin for this feature.

One conservative feature of Andalusian Spanish is the way some people retain an sound in words which had such a sound in medieval Spanish, which originally comes from Latin, i.e. Latin &#x27;stuffed, full&#x27; → (standard Spanish &#x27;fed up&#x27;). This also occurs in the speech of Extremadura and some other western regions, and it was carried to Latin America by Andalusian settlers, where it also enjoys low status. Nowadays, this characteristic is limited to rural areas in Western Andalusia and the flamenco culture. This pronunciation represents resistance to the dropping of that occurred in Early Modern Spanish. This sound is merged with the phoneme, which derives from medieval and . This feature may be connected to northwestern settlers during the reconquista, who came from areas such as eastern Asturias where had, as in Old Castile, become .

 undergoes deaffrication to in Western Andalusia, including cities like Seville and Cádiz, e.g. (&#x27;s/he listens&#x27;).

=== Coda obstruents and liquids ===
A list of Andalusian lenitions and mergers in the syllable coda that affect obstruent and liquid consonants includes:
* Syllable-final , and (where &quot;ceceo&quot; or &quot;distinción&quot; occur) are usually aspirated (pronounced ) or deleted. The simple aspiration of final as occurs in the speech of all social classes within Andalusia, and is the most widespread form of -lenition outside Andalusia. S-aspiration is general in all of the southern half of Spain, and now becoming common in the northern half too.
* Word-final can also be pronounced as , or elided entirely, before a following word that starts with a vowel sound, like for &#x27;the waves&#x27;. This can also occur at morpheme boundaries within a word, as in being pronounced .
* In Eastern Andalusian dialects, as well as Murcian Spanish, the preceding vowel becomes lax when before an underlying elided obstruent. This results in fronting to , while the other vowels are lowered. Thus, in these varieties one distinguishes &quot;casa&quot; (&#x27;house&#x27;) and &quot;casas&quot; (&#x27;houses&#x27;) by vowel quality, whereas northern Spanish speakers would have central vowels in both words and a terminal alveolar in &quot;casas&quot;.
** There is disagreement as to whether or not are affected by this process, although most evidence shows they are lowered to a moderate degree.
** The quality of word-final lax , typically transcribed , differs according to a number of geographic and social factors. It may be lower than a typical word-final , or it may instead simply be fronted. In some towns, in the mid-20th century at least, it overlapped with the quality of, or even merged with, , the lax allophone of .

As a result, these varieties have five vowel phonemes, each with a tense allophone (roughly the same as the normal realization in northern Spanish; , , , , , hereafter transcribed without diacritics) and a lax allophone (, , , , ). In addition to this, a process of vowel harmony may take place where tense vowels that precede a lax vowel may become lax themselves, e.g. &quot;trébol&quot; (&#x27;clover, club&#x27;) vs &quot;tréboles&quot; (&#x27;clovers, clubs&#x27;).

* Liquids () can be aspirated as well. Also, liquids and obstruents () often assimilate to the following consonant, producing gemination; e.g. &quot;perla&quot; (&#x27;pearl&#x27;), &quot;carne&quot; (&#x27;meat&#x27;), &quot;adquirí&quot; (&#x27;I acquired&#x27;), &quot;mismo&quot; (&#x27;same&#x27;), &quot;desde&quot; (&#x27;from&#x27;), &quot;rasgos&quot; (&#x27;traits&#x27;).
* In Andalusian Spanish a voiced obstruent may assimilate the voicelessness of a preceding , while that same may assimilate the place of articulation of the following consonant. As a result, both merge as a single voiceless consonant; Thus, is often assimilated to before (), as in &quot;desbaratar&quot; → *&quot;effaratar&quot; (&#x27;to ruin, to disrupt&#x27;), to before , as in &#x27;the attics&#x27;, and to before , as in &#x27;feature&#x27;. This kind of devoicing is less widespread, geographically and socially, than simple assimilation.
* Final may also become (where or occur) before (), as in &quot;ascensor&quot; (&#x27;lift&#x27;).

* Mainly in Western Andalusia, /s/-aspiration can result in post-aspiration of following voiceless stops, as in pronounced .
** As a likely related change, may be pronounced as an affricate . This change is recent, being led by young women, and is present at least in Seville and Antequera.
* Intervocalic are usually voiced, especially in male speech, and can even become approximants. This means much of the phonetic distinction between intervocalic and is in fact maintained by differences in voicing and post-aspiration.
* may be pronounced as in syllable-final position, as in instead of for &quot;alma&quot; (&#x27;soul&#x27;) or instead of for &quot;el&quot; (&#x27;the&#x27;). The opposite may also happen, i.e. becomes (e.g. &quot;sartén&quot; &#x27;frying pan&#x27;). As briefly mentioned above, aspirated and assimilated realizations ( for ) are also common. Neutralization of final and never occurs before a vowel, even at word boundaries. is always . These consonants may also be dropped in utterance-final position. Merging syllable-final and is associated with rural and uncultured speech, but it has made some headway in urban speech. Because of this variation in final liquid consonants, transcriptions in this article follow the distribution found in Standard Peninsular Spanish.
* In Western Andalusian, an aspirated before can be elided due to the fact that itself is glottal. Thus, &quot;virgen&quot; (&#x27;virgin&#x27;) varies between and , with the latter being degeminated from .

== Morphology and syntax ==

=== Subject pronouns ===
Many Western Andalusian speakers replace the informal second person plural with the formal (without the formal connotation, as happens in other parts of Spain). For example, the standard second person plural verb forms for (&#x27;to go&#x27;) are (informal) and (formal), but in Western Andalusian one often hears for the informal version.

=== Object pronouns ===
Although mass media have generalised the use of &quot;le&quot; as a pronoun for animate, masculine direct objects, a phenomenon known as leísmo, many Andalusians still use the normative &quot;lo&quot;, as in &quot;lo quiero mucho&quot; (instead of &quot;le quiero mucho&quot;), which is also more conservative with regards to the Latin etymology of these pronouns. The Asturleonese dialects of northwestern Spain are similarly conservative, lacking leísmo, and the dominance of this more conservative direct object pronoun system in Andalusia may be due to the presence of Asturleonese settlers in the Reconquista. Subsequent dialect levelling in newly founded Andalusian towns would favor the more simple grammatical system, that is, the one without leísmo.
Laísmo (the substitution of indirect pronoun &quot;le&quot; with &quot;la&quot;, as in the sentence &quot;la pegó una bofetada a ella&quot;) is similarly typical of central Spain and not present in Andalusia, and, though not prescriptively correct according to the RAE, is frequently heard on Radio and TV programmes.

=== Verbs ===
The standard form of the second-person plural imperative with a reflexive pronoun (&quot;os&quot;) is &quot;-aos&quot;, or &quot;-aros&quot; in informal speech, whereas in Andalusian, and other dialects, too, &quot;-se&quot; is used instead, so &quot;¡callaos ya! / ¡callaros ya!&quot; (&#x27;shut up!&#x27;) becomes &quot;¡callarse ya!&quot; and &quot;¡sentaos! / ¡sentaros!&quot; (&#x27;sit down!&#x27;) becomes &quot;¡sentarse!&quot;.

=== Gender ===
The gender of some words may not match that of Standard Spanish, e.g. &quot;la calor&quot; not &quot;el calor&quot; (&#x27;the heat&#x27;), &quot;el chinche&quot; not &quot;la chinche&quot; (&#x27;the bedbug&#x27;).
&quot;La mar&quot; is also more frequently used than &quot;el mar&quot;. &quot;La mar de&quot; and &quot;tela de&quot; are lexicalised expressions to mean &quot;a lot of...&quot;.

== Lexicon ==
Many words of Mozarabic, Romani and Old Spanish origin occur in Andalusian which are not found in other dialects in Spain (but many of these may occur in South American and, especially, in Caribbean Spanish dialects due to the greater influence of Andalusian there). For example: &quot;chispenear&quot; instead of standard &quot;lloviznar&quot; or &quot;chispear&quot; (&#x27;to drizzle&#x27;), &quot;babucha&quot; instead of &quot;zapatilla&quot; (&#x27;slipper&#x27;), &quot;chavea&quot; instead of &quot;chaval&quot; (&#x27;kid&#x27;) or &quot;antié&quot; for &quot;anteayer&quot; (&#x27;the day before yesterday&#x27;).
A few words of Andalusi Arabic origin that have become archaisms or unknown in general Spanish can be found, together with multitude of sayings: e.g. &quot;haciendo morisquetas&quot; (from the word &quot;morisco&quot;, meaning pulling faces and gesticulating, historically associated with Muslim prayers). These can be found in older texts of Andalusi. There are some doublets of Arabic-Latinate synonyms with the Arabic form being more common in Andalusian like Andalusian &quot;alcoba&quot; for standard &quot;habitación&quot; or &quot;dormitorio&quot; (&#x27;bedroom&#x27;) or &quot;alhaja&quot; for standard &quot;joya&quot; (&#x27;jewel&#x27;).

==Influence==
Some words pronounced in the Andalusian dialects have entered general Spanish with a specific meaning. One example is &quot;juerga&quot;, (&quot;debauchery&quot;, or &quot;partying&quot;), the Andalusian pronunciation of &quot;huelga&quot; (originally &quot;period without work&quot;, now &quot;work strike&quot;). The flamenco lexicon incorporates many Andalusisms, for example, &quot;cantaor&quot;, &quot;tocaor&quot;, and &quot;bailaor&quot;, which are examples of the dropped &quot;d&quot;; in standard spelling these would be &quot;cantador&quot;, &quot;tocador&quot;, and &quot;bailador&quot;, while the same terms in more general Spanish may be &quot;cantante&quot;, &quot;músico&quot;, and &quot;bailarín&quot;. Note that, when referring to the flamenco terms, the correct spelling drops the &quot;d&quot;; a flamenco &quot;cantaor&quot; is written this way, not &quot;cantador&quot;. In other cases, the dropped &quot;d&quot; may be used in standard Spanish for terms closely associated with Andalusian culture. For example, &quot;pescaíto frito&quot; (&quot;little fried fish&quot;) is a popular dish in Andalusia, and this spelling is used in many parts of Spain when referring to this dish. For general usage, the spelling would be &quot;pescadito frito&quot;.

Llanito, the vernacular of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, is based on Andalusian Spanish, with British English and other influences.

==Language movement==

In Andalusia, there is a movement promoting the status of Andalusian as a separate language and not as a dialect of Spanish.

<text>Joachim Zachris Duncker (12 November 1774 – 6 July 1809) was a Swedish soldier born in Ristiina in Savonia.

In 1789 Duncker obtained the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in the Savonia ranger regiment. He fought in the 1790 war against Russia and proved his valor at the Battle of Perttimäki 19 May. In 1804 Duncker was promoted to captain.

During the Finnish War of 1808-1809 he distinguished himself as a brave and prominent officer. When Cronstedt&#x27;s army retreated from Mikkeli to Iisalmi and Oulu through Leppävirta (March 1808), Duncker commanded the army&#x27;s rearguard. During the Battle of Pulkkila (2 May 1808) he distinguished himself so well that Johan August Sandels gave him the honorary assignment to bring the news of the victory to the Swedish king. Shortly after, he was promoted to Major. In June 1808 he captured a large transport of supplies to the Russians. During the Battle of Koljonvirta (27 October 1808), Duncker together with Colonel Fahlander and Major Malm and only 600 men helped Sandels to utterly defeated a superior Russian force. In 1809 Duncker fought the Russians in the Swedish province of Västerbotten, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. During the Battle of Hörnefors (5 July 1809) Duncker commanded the Swedish rearguard and received fatal wounds and died in the Russian encampment the day after.

Duncker was buried next to Umeå church by the Russians that gave him a full honour guard. He lies buried together with a Russian cossack chief. In 1897 a memorial was erected on the spot where the grave was assumed to be.

<doc id="278260" wikidata="Q29144" url="?curid=278260" title="NHL All-Star Game">
<text>The National Hockey League All-Star Game () is an exhibition ice hockey tournament that is traditionally held during the regular season of the National Hockey League (NHL), with many of the League&#x27;s star players playing against each other. The games&#x27; proceeds benefit the pension fund of the players, and the winning team is awarded $1,000,000 towards a charity of their choice.

The NHL All-Star Game, held in late January or early February, marks the symbolic halfway point in the regular season, though not the mathematical halfway point which, for most seasons, is usually one or two weeks earlier. Between 2007 and 2020, it was held in late January. It was skipped in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 to 2024 editions were held on the first Saturday of February.

==Formats==
From 1947 to 1968, the All-Star Game primarily saw the previous season&#x27;s Stanley Cup champions take on a team of All-Stars from the other clubs. There were two exceptions during this period: The 1951 and 1952 games instead featured two teams of All-Star players, one consisting of players on American-based teams and the other with players on Canadian-based teams.

Beginning in 1969, the format was geographic with the Wales/Eastern Conference All-Stars playing the Campbell/Western Conference All-Stars, with the &quot;first team&quot;, or starting line, including the starting goaltender, voted in by fans, while the remainder of the teams&#x27; rosters are chosen by the NHL&#x27;s Hockey Operations Department in consultation with the teams&#x27; general managers. Since 1996, the head coaches for the two All-Star teams have been the coaches of the two teams that are leading their respective conferences in point percentage (i.e. fraction of points obtained out of total possible points). Previously, the two head coaches that appeared in the previous year&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals coached the All-Star teams.

The 1998 All-Star Game was held in the same year as the 1998 Winter Olympics, allowing the NHL to show off its players from all over the world. For this event, the NHL had the All-Star teams consist of a team of North Americans playing against a team of stars from the rest of the world. The North America vs. World All-Star format lasted through the 2002 Game, the same year as the 2002 Winter Olympics, before reverting to the Eastern vs. Western Conference format in 2003.

During the 2010–11 season, the NHL announced a change to the way the teams were selected, modeled after drafts in fantasy sports. The conference vs. conference (i.e. East vs. West) approach was replaced by a player draft conducted by the All-Star players themselves to determine the rosters for each team. The captains for each team now select players from a combined pool of both fan balloting and the NHL Hockey Operations Department. The change in format was a joint effort by the League and the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA). This format lasted through the 2015 game.

On November 18, 2015, the NHL announced significant changes to the All-Star Game format, starting with the 2016 game: instead of one game featuring two teams, there are four All-Star teams based on the league&#x27;s four divisions, competing in a single-elimination tournament. The format of all three games in the tournament is three-on-three, with 10-minute halves each. If a tie remains after 20 minutes, then it directly goes to a three-round shootout plus extra rounds as needed to determine the winner; there is no standard overtime. The winners of the two semifinal games then meet in an &quot;All-Star Game Final&quot;. In 2017, the format was slightly changed: the division that wins the NHL All-Star Skills Competition during the previous night then gets to pick which team they will play first in the semifinals.

On November 27, 2023, the NHL announced that it would be combining the four-team, three-on-three format with the fantasy draft used in the previous system. The league selected the captains for each of the four teams from a combined pool of both fan balloting and the NHL Hockey Operations Department, and the players then conducted a draft to determine the rosters for each team.

==Skills Competition==
The All-Star Game is preceded by the &quot;NHL All-Star Skills Competition&quot;, a competition showing the various talents of both the all-stars. Beginning in 2007, the All-Star weekend also featured the &quot;NHL YoungStars Game&quot;, an exhibition game exclusively featuring rookies, playing under slightly modified rules. In 2011 this game was eliminated in favor of having the rookies compete in the skills competition.

==History==

===Benefit games===
The first official All-Star Game was held during the 1947–48 NHL season. Prior to that, there have been several occasions when benefit games and All-Star Games were played.

====Hod Stuart Benefit All-Star Game====

The first All-Star game in ice hockey predates the NHL. It was played on January 2, 1908, before 3,500 fans at the Montreal Arena between the Montreal Wanderers and a team of All-Stars players from the teams the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association. It was held in memory of Wanderers player Hod Stuart, who had drowned three months after the Wanderers won the Stanley Cup in 1907. The proceeds of that game (over $2,000) went to Stuart&#x27;s family.

====Ace Bailey Benefit Game====
On December 12, 1933, Toronto&#x27;s King Clancy tripped Boston&#x27;s Eddie Shore, and in retaliation, Shore hit the Leafs&#x27; Ace Bailey from behind, flipping him over backwards. Bailey hit his head on the ice so hard that a priest in attendance gave him last rites. Bailey lived for almost 60 more years, but his playing career was over. Shore was suspended for 16 games of a 48-game season for the hit.

As a benefit for Bailey and his family, the NHL held its first ever All-Star game on February 14, 1934. The game was held at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, during which Bailey&#x27;s #6 uniform was retired by the Leafs. It was the first number to be retired in the NHL. The game saw the Leafs battle against an All-Star team made of players from the other seven teams, which the Leafs won 7–3. One of the more memorable moments before the game was when Bailey presented Shore with his All-Star jersey, showing to the public that Bailey had clearly forgiven him for his actions. Bailey also presented a trophy to NHL President Frank Calder before the game in the hope that the trophy would go to the winner of an annual All-Star Game for the benefit of injured players.

====Howie Morenz Memorial Game====

Howie Morenz was one of the NHL&#x27;s superstars of the 1930s. However, his career, and eventually life, ended in a game between his Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks on January 28, 1937, at the Montreal Forum. In that game, Morenz was checked by Chicago player Earl Seibert into the boards in what seemed like a normal hit. However, as the boards were made of wood at the time, Morenz&#x27;s leg shattered in five separate locations above the ankle. He was carried off the ice on a stretcher to a hospital, where he would stay for four and a half weeks until his death from a heart attack. At one time, one visitor noted that it was as if a party was being held inside of Morenz&#x27;s hospital room, complete with whiskey and beer. Morenz died on March 8 the same year, from, as teammate Aurele Joliat put it, &quot;a broken heart&quot; (Morenz suffered a heart attack the night before). Morenz&#x27;s #7 sweater, which had been hanging in its usual stall while he was in hospital, was finally retired for good.

While Morenz was in the hospital, plans for a game for Morenz&#x27;s benefit were already under way. However, the game was not as successful as Bailey&#x27;s game, partially because it took place many months after Morenz&#x27;s passing (on November 3 at the Forum) and partially because Morenz had not survived. The game saw two All-Star teams, the first being a team of stars from the Canadiens and the Montreal Maroons, the second being an All-Star team made of players from the other teams, with the latter team winning 6–5.

====Babe Siebert Memorial Game====
On August 25, 1939, Babe Siebert, a Montreal Canadien who had just retired from play and had been named head coach, drowned in Lake Huron. To benefit his family, the Canadiens and Montreal Maroons organized a benefit, held on October 29 at the Montreal Forum. Six thousand fans attended a game between the Canadiens and the &quot;NHL All-Stars&quot;, raising (equivalent to $ in ) for Siebert&#x27;s family. The All-Stars won the game 5–2.

===Official games===
Despite Bailey&#x27;s hopes of an annual All-Star Game, it did not become an annual tradition until the 1947–48 NHL season. In 1966, the All-Star Game was moved from the start of the season to its current position in the middle of the season. In 1979, the Challenge Cup series replaced the game, in 1987, it was replaced with Rendez-vous &#x27;87, and in 2025 it was replaced with the 4 Nations Face-Off. Lockouts disrupted the NHL season in 1995, 2005, and 2013 and resulted in the cancellation of the game in those years. COVID-19 led to the cancelation of the 2021 game. As part of the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that expired in 2012 and was later renewed, the NHL agreed with the NHLPA not to hold an All-Star Game during Winter Olympic years that they participated in, consequently, the contest was cancelled in 2006, 2010 and 2014. In 2018, however, the contest was still played, as NHL players did not participate in that year&#x27;s Winter Olympics, and in 2022, the contest was still played, with players originally going to the 2022 Winter Olympics after, but ultimately did not due to COVID-19 postponing many games.

====1940s====

Both parts of Bailey&#x27;s vision would, however, come true: The first game of the annual tradition, and the first official NHL All-Star Game, would be played in Maple Leaf Gardens, on October 13, 1947. The format of the All-Star Game, which remained the same, with two exceptions, until the 1967–68 NHL season, called for the defending Stanley Cup champions to play against a selection of players from the other five teams. For the first year, the All-Stars were a team composed of the First and Second NHL All-Star teams (not to be confused with the All-Stars that played against the Cup champions), as well as three players from the New York Rangers and one player each from the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Black Hawks.

For the game, the Gardens facilities were upgraded to use glass on the boards (in an era where wire fences were the norm), a point that fans complained about as the sounds of the checks were somewhat muted. In what would be another tradition, the defending Stanley Cup champions were presented before the game with various gifts that included sweater coats, golf balls, cigarette boxes, ties, cufflinks, pocket knives, watches and lifetime passes to Maple Leaf Gardens. All-in-all, the game was a success, with the All-Stars winning 4–3.

Although the All-Star Game called for the defending Cup champion to host it, the game was held in Chicago Stadium in its second year as a consequence of the negotiations that set up the first game. Also as a peculiarity as a result of the scheduling, the game was held not before the season started (as was the case before and would be for almost 20 years following the game), but three weeks into the season. Like the year before, players from the First and Second NHL All-Star teams were automatically awarded spots on the All-Star Game rosters (an exception was Leafs goaltender Turk Broda, having won the Cup, played for the Leafs instead), with the rest of the all-stars being assembled so that each team was represented with at least three players on the All-Stars. As for the game itself, the All-Stars had won 3–1 with all scoring coming in the second period.

====1950s====
The defending Stanley Cup champions would win their first All-Star Game in 1950 by a 7–1 margin, thanks to Detroit&#x27;s Production Line and the fact that five of the First and Second NHL All-Star teams were Red Wings. Because of the one-sidedness of the game, many fans and hockey insiders considered options on how to make the All-Star Game more balanced, including one where the All-Star Game was eliminated altogether in favour of a best-of-nine Stanley Cup Finals with the proceeds of two of the games going to the players&#x27; pension fund, and one which saw a Canadian Teams vs. American Teams format (a somewhat flawed concept in that nearly all NHL players of the era, whether playing for teams representing American or Canadian cities, were Canadians). Ultimately, the 5th NHL All-Star Game saw the First NHL All-Star team battle the Second, with the players filling out the First team being from American teams and the Second team being filled with either Hab or Leaf players. The game ended in a 2–2 tie, leaving many fans upset for the second straight year. The same format of First vs. Second with the First team being augmented by players from American teams and the Second being augmented by Leaf or Hab players continued the next year, but the 6th All-Star Game proved to be 60 minutes of boring hockey as the teams skated to a 1–1 tie.

Criticisms of this new format, as well as the boring hockey, was what made the NHL revert the format of the All-Star Game to its original incarnation. Some of the criticisms included the fact that teammates often opposed each other in the All-Star Game under the new format, and some stated that the early date of the game was detrimental to the exposure of the NHL in the States, being held at the same time as the World Series and the National Football League (NFL) season. In what would be later a reality, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; columnist Red Burnett suggested that the game should be played mid-season and that fans should choose their starting lineup, a system which had long been in use in the States with regard to Major League Baseball (MLB).

====1960s====
The game was moved from the start of the season to mid-season in the 1966–67 season as part of the move to promote the NHL to six new cities who would have their own teams (in October 1967). Because of the move to mid-season, the method of player selection for the All-Stars, largely unchanged for 20 years, was much scrutinized, as playing the All-Star Game mid-season meant that the first and second All-Star teams were decided almost a full year before the game itself, and that by mid-season, the Cup winners were a vastly different team from the team that had won the Cup some eight or nine months before. The mid-season move also meant that rookies with outstanding first years, such as Bobby Orr, would be shut out of the game even if they deserved a spot on the All-Stars.

The 21st All-Star Game one year later was somber compared to the 20 before it, as the days before the game were tragic. On January 14, 1968, two days before the game, Bill Masterton had been checked by two Oakland Seals players and died from his on-ice injuries. The game itself was overshadowed by the debate on whether helmets should be worn in the NHL in the fallout of Masterton&#x27;s untimely death. As in the previous years, the All-Stars were represented by the first and second All-Star teams, as well as enough players so that each team was represented. The East-West format of future All-Star Games was announced in the 21st All-Star Game, with the intention of being able to move the game anywhere, alternating home ice between an East division team and a West division team year after year. The idea, along with the notion that the players chosen for the two All-Star teams should be the best at the time of the game rather than the best of the players from the season before, quickly gained popularity, although the Cup champions reserved the right to host the 22nd All-Star Game. The St. Louis Blues became the first Western host of the All-Star Game the following year. The 26th All-Star Game was the first in which the game MVP received a car as a prize.

====1970s====
With the realignment of the NHL into four divisions for the 1974–75 season, the 1975 All-Star Game was the first to pit the Wales Conference against the Campbell Conference.

In 1978, amidst renewed interest in international hockey, the NHL decided to replace the 1979 All-Star Game with a three-game series where the League&#x27;s top players played against the Soviet Union&#x27;s top players in the Challenge Cup, held at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

The Challenge Cup was being touted as a miniature world championship, and for the first time, fans could vote for certain members of the roster. The NHL would lose the three-game series two games to one, with the third game being lost by an embarrassing 6–0 margin.

Over the next few years, various aspects of the All-Star Game came under scrutiny, including the format of the game. To make things worse, the All-Star Game itself was viewed in some circles as a bad thing, with players opting out of the game in favour of the rest and prospective hosts repeatedly declining to host the event.

====1980s====
With the geographical realignment of the NHL for the 1981–82 season, the 1982 All-Star Game was the first between the Wales and Campbell Conferences that featured players from eastern teams against players from western teams.

The 37th All-Star Game in 1985 marked the first time that honorary captains were selected for each team. The game also brought forth the notion of fan balloting of the starting lineup (already adopted in the National Basketball Association and by this time had returned, following a hiatus brought on by ballot box stuffing, to MLB; the NFL gave the fans the vote in the 1990s), as the game was suffering from having little media coverage. The idea came into fruition the following year.

In 1987, the All-Star Game was pre-empted in favour of Rendez-vous &#x27;87, held at Le Colisée in Quebec City. Like the Challenge Cup before it, Rendez-Vous &#x27;87 was an event where the best the NHL could offer played against a Soviet squad which had an entire year to prepare. To reduce the possibility of the NHL being embarrassed again, Rendez-Vous &#x27;87 was a two-game affair. The series was split between the two teams with a game won by each.

During the series, NHL President John Ziegler stated that Soviet players would never be able to join the NHL because of the way the Soviet hockey programme worked, and that NHLers would never be able to play in the Winter Olympics. Soviet players would be allowed to play in the NHL within three years, and an arrangement that would allow NHL players to play in the Olympics was announced within nine.

====1990s====
The 41st All-Star Game in 1990 was held on a Sunday, after having been held on Tuesdays since 1968. That edition, the NHL All-Star Skills Competition and the Heroes of Hockey game were both introduced. The Heroes of Hockey game featured NHL alumni and was set up much like the main game, with Wales vs. Campbell. Many of these players retired before the introduction of the Wales and Campbell Conferences. Future Heroes of Hockey games would have the hometown alumni play against the &quot;best-of-the-rest&quot;, much like the all-star games of old. The 42nd All-Star Game introduced, as part of the player selection, two players chosen by the commissioner to honour their years to their game.

With the renaming of conferences and divisions on a geographical basis for the 1993–94 season, the 1994 All-Star Game was the first between East and West in name since 1974, although the Wales vs. Campbell format pitted east against west from 1982 to 1993.

The All-Star Game in 1995 was a casualty of the 1994–95 NHL lockout, which shortened that season to just 48 regular season games. San Jose, the originally scheduled venue, was instead awarded the 1997 All-Star Game. In the interim, Boston hosted the 1996 All-Star Game at the newly-opened FleetCenter.

The 1998 All-Star Game featured the first change in format in years in an attempt to promote the first Olympic hockey tournament with participation from NHL players. The &quot;First International Showdown&quot;, as it was billed, resulted in the North American All-Stars winning 8–7.

====2000s====
The 2003 Game&#x27;s format was reverted to its classic East vs. West format. Dany Heatley scored four goals, tying an All-Star Game record, in addition to recording a shootout goal. Heatley also set the record for being the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the All-Star Game, a record previously held by the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; Wayne Gretzky. This shootout, the first of its kind in the NHL in the modern era, received an enthusiastic, frenzied response from the crowd when it was announced, and carried on during the event. This was influential in the later decision to decide regular season games tied after overtime with a shootout, thus eliminating tie games.

The All-Star Game was dealt two serious blows in 2005. Not only was the game canceled along with the rest of the season as a result of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, but the subsequent CBA that ended the lockout stipulated that heretofore the game was to be held only in non-Olympic years. Thus, there was no All-Star Game held during the 2005–06 season either.

After a two-season absence, the 2007 Game was played in Dallas, where the West defeated the East, 12–9. Daniel Briere of the Buffalo Sabres recorded a goal and four assists and was named the game&#x27;s MVP.

The Atlanta Thrashers hosted the 2008 Game, as they had been originally scheduled to host the canceled Game in 2005. The Eastern Conference won the game 8–7 on a late game-winning goal by Marc Savard with 20.9 seconds remaining in the third period, beating St. Louis Blues goaltender Manny Legace. Eric Staal was named the MVP.

In 2009, the Bell Centre, the home of the Montreal Canadiens, hosted the Game, as well as the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. In the game, the Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference 12–11 in a shootout (east 2/3 west 0/2). Approximately 21,000 people attended the game, where then-Canadien Alexei Kovalev was the Eastern Conference captain and was named the game&#x27;s MVP after scoring two goals and one assist, as well as the shootout winner. Montreal fans voted Kovalev into the starting lineup, in addition to teammates Andrei Markov, Carey Price and Mike Komisarek. The Canadiens were picked to host both events because the Montreal Canadiens team celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009. The team was established in 1909 as a founding member of the National Hockey Association (NHA) which became the NHL in 1917.

A small number of All-Star players questioned their potential participation in 2009. Past and current All-Stars must obtain an excused absence (often related to injury or personal circumstances) by the League if they will not participate. If this approved absence is not obtained, a one-game regular season suspension is possible.

====2010s====
There was no All-Star Game in 2010 because of both a change to the CBA and 2010 being an Olympic Games year—the 2010 Winter Olympics marked the first time that the Olympics had been hosted in an NHL market since the league allowed its players to compete in the Olympics.

The 2011 All-Star Game was played in Raleigh, North Carolina, home of the Carolina Hurricanes. Gary Bettman announced at the RBC Center on April 8, 2010, that the game would be held in Raleigh. The Phoenix Coyotes were originally slated to host the game that year in replacement of the 2006 Game, which they had again originally been awarded before the NHL ultimately decided not to hold the game the Olympic year. Amid fears that the Coyotes franchise would not &quot;right its ship&quot; by February 2011, however, the cities of Pittsburgh, Raleigh and Ottawa rose as candidates for the 2011 Game, with Raleigh eventually being chosen, having been promised the game since the Hurricanes reached 12,000 season ticket sales earlier in the decade. The 2011 Game also introduced a new format, replacing the traditional conference teams with a &quot;fantasy draft.&quot; Fans voted for six players, from either conference (three forwards, two defencemen and one goaltender), while the NHL selected another 36 players for a total of 42 players. The chosen players then selected two captains for each All-Star team, who then selected their teammates in a draft. The chosen captains for the 2011 Game were Nicklas Lidstrom of Detroit and Eric Staal of Carolina.

The 2012 Game repeated the fantasy draft format, with Daniel Alfredsson and Zdeno Chara as captains. The game was played in Ottawa to honor the 20th anniversary of the Senators&#x27; joining the NHL.

The 2013 All-Star Game was originally scheduled for January 27, 2013, at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, the home of the Columbus Blue Jackets. The game was postponed to 2015, however, first due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, which delayed the start of the 2012–13 season until January 19, 2013, followed by the inability to play in 2014 due to it falling on an Olympic Games year, where NHL players competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The game was eventually played on January 25, 2015.

The 2016 All-Star Game was played on January 31, 2016, at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, the home of Nashville Predators. The format was changed so that it was no longer a singular all-star game &quot;per se&quot;; instead, four all-star teams, each representing one of the league&#x27;s four divisions, participate in a two-round knockout tournament, with each game being two 10-minute halves in length and played with three skaters on each team. In addition, each division is required to select at least one player from all eight of its teams (prior to 2017, the Central and Pacific Divisions only had seven teams; both added an eighth team as of 2021), unlike in previous years where some teams were not represented in recent All-Star Games. The 2016 game was also notable for the appearance of John Scott, a journeyman enforcer who was voted into the game through the fan vote. Scott, who had been demoted to the American Hockey League after the vote, played as a member of no team and, as captain of the Pacific Division, scored two goals (after scoring none the entire regular season up to that point) and won the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award.

The 2017 All-Star Game was played on January 29, 2017, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, to honour of the Kings&#x27; 50th anniversary. The 2018 All-Star Game was then played on January 28, 2018, at Amalie Arena in Tampa, the second time the Tampa Bay Lightning have hosted the All-Star Game, the first being in 1999, and the third overall in Florida.

The 2019 All-Star Game was hosted by the San Jose Sharks at SAP Center on January 26, 2019, the first time it was held on a Saturday after many years of the game being played on a Sunday.

====2020s====
The 2020 All-Star Game was hosted by the St. Louis Blues at Enterprise Center on January 25. The city last hosted the All-Star Game in February 1988.

Originally, the 2021 All-Star Game would be hosted by the Florida Panthers at BB&amp;T Center on January 30, which would have been its first All-Star Game hosted since February 2003. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the conclusion of the 2019–20 season to September and postponing the start of the following season, the event was canceled, with the possibility of moving the festivities to 2022 at its earliest. The league said that it would consider changing the upcoming All-Star Game&#x27;s format so it would have a &quot;distinct international flavor&quot;, using a model similar to the World Cup of Hockey.

On June 28, 2021, the league announced that the 2022 All-Star Game would be played at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, home of the Vegas Golden Knights, for the first time. The league cited the fact that they had not yet signed a deal with the International Olympic Committee on sending players to the 2022 Winter Olympics, so they decided to schedule an All-Star Game anyway, at an arena in western North America to shorten travel to China if players did go. On September 3, a deal was officially reached to send players to the Olympics, with an opt-out clause should COVID-19 health conditions worsen. However, on December 22, the NHL announced that it would not send its players to the Olympics due to rising COVID-19 cases and increasing number of postponed games. Consequently, the originally scheduled Olympic break following the All-Star Game from February 7 to 22 was used to play 95 postponed games.

On February 4, 2022, the NHL awarded Sunrise, Florida, the 2023 All-Star Game, two years after Sunrise&#x27;s game was cancelled due to the pandemic.

The 2024 All-Star Game took place on February 3, 2024, at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto. The format was changed, combining the four-team, three-on-three format used since 2016 with the &quot;fantasy draft&quot; format used from 2011 to 2015. In addition to player captains Quinn Hughes, Nathan MacKinnon, Auston Matthews, and Connor McDavid, each team featured a celebrity co-captain, with Will Arnett, Justin Bieber, Michael Buble, and Tate McRae serving in the roles.

There was not an All-Star game in 2025, as the NHL instead held a new 4 Nations Face-Off tournament as a preview for the league&#x27;s return to Olympic participation in 2026.

====Future====
The 2026 All-Star Game will be hosted by the New York Islanders at UBS Arena, at an undetermined date prior to the Olympics.

====Yet to host====
As of the completion of the 2024 All-Star Game, a number of current NHL cities, teams or arenas have never hosted the event.

Six current NHL cities have never hosted the All-Star Game: Anaheim, Newark, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and Winnipeg.

Of the NHL home teams in those six cities, four have never hosted the All-Star Game: Anaheim Ducks (started play in 1993), Utah Hockey Club (starting play in 2024), Seattle Kraken (started play in 2021) and Winnipeg Jets (started play, as Jets, in 2011). The teams in the remaining two cities, New Jersey Devils and Washington Capitals, hosted the game while located in a nearby suburb of their current city.

Of the current NHL arenas in the league, accounting for both new arenas and cities that have never hosted, 13 current NHL arenas have never hosted the All-Star Game: Anaheim&#x27;s Honda Center, Buffalo&#x27;s KeyBank Center, Chicago&#x27;s United Center, Detroit&#x27;s Little Caesars Arena, Edmonton&#x27;s Rogers Place, Elmont&#x27;s UBS Arena, Newark&#x27;s Prudential Center, Philadelphia&#x27;s Wells Fargo Center, Pittsburgh&#x27;s PPG Paints Arena, Salt Lake City&#x27;s Delta Center, Seattle&#x27;s Climate Pledge Arena, Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Capital One Arena and Winnipeg&#x27;s Canada Life Centre.

<doc id="278263" wikidata="Q1130390" url="?curid=278263" title="State of nature">
<text>In ethics, political philosophy, social contract theory, religion, and international law, the term state of nature describes the hypothetical way of life that existed before humans organised themselves into societies or civilisations. Philosophers of the state of nature theory propose that there was a historical period before societies existed, and seek answers to the questions: &quot;What was life like before civil society?&quot;, &quot;How did government emerge from such a primitive start?&quot;, and &quot;What are the hypothetical reasons for entering a state of society by establishing a nation-state?&quot;.

In some versions of social contract theory, there are freedoms, but no rights in the state of nature; and, by way of the social contract, people create societal rights and obligations. In other versions of social contract theory, society imposes restrictions (law, custom, tradition, etc.) that limit the natural rights of a person. Societies existing before the political state are investigated and studied as Mesolithic history, as archaeology, and as cultural anthropology, as social anthropology, and as ethnology to determine the particulars of the indigenous society&#x27;s social structures and power structures.

== Noted philosophers ==

=== Mozi ===
The early Warring States philosopher Mozi was one of the first thinkers in recorded history to develop the idea of the state of nature. He developed the idea to defend the need for a single overall ruler. According to Mozi, in the state of nature, each person has their own moral rules (yi, 義). As a result, people were unable to reach agreements and resources were wasted. Since Mozi promoted ways of strengthening and unifying the state (li, 利), such natural dis-organisation was rejected:
In the beginning of human life, when there was yet no law and government, the custom was &quot;everybody according to his rule (yi, 義).&quot; Accordingly each man had his own rule, two men had two different rules and ten men had eleven different rules -- the more people the more different notions. And everybody approved his own moral views and disapproved the views of others, and so arose mutual disapproval among men. As a result, father and son and elder and younger brothers became enemies and were estranged from each other, since they were unable to reach any agreement. Everybody worked for the disadvantage of the others with water, fire, and poison. Surplus energy was not spent for mutual aid; surplus goods were allowed to rot without sharing; excellent teachings (dao, 道) were kept secret and not revealed. The disorder in the (human) world could be compared to that among birds and beasts. —Chapter 3 - 1
His proposal was to unify rules according to a single moral system or standard (fa, 法) that can be used by anyone: calculating benefit of each act. In that way, the ruler of the state and his subjects will have the same moral system; cooperation and joint efforts will be the rule. Later his proposal would be strongly rejected by Confucianism (especially Mencius) because of the preference of benefit over morals.

===Thomas Hobbes===
The pure state of nature, or &quot;the natural condition of mankind&quot;, was described by the 17th century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes in &quot;Leviathan&quot; and his earlier work &quot;De Cive&quot;. Hobbes argued that natural inequalities between humans are not so great as to give anyone clear superiority; and thus all must live in constant fear of loss or violence; so that &quot;during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every man&quot;. In this state, every person has a natural right to do anything one thinks necessary for preserving one&#x27;s own life, and life is &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short&quot; (&quot;Leviathan,&quot; Chapters XIII–XIV). Hobbes described this natural condition with the Latin phrase (bellum omnium contra omnes) meaning &quot;war of all against all&quot;, in &quot;De Cive&quot;.

Within the state of nature, there is neither personal property nor injustice since there is no law, except for certain natural precepts discovered by reason (&quot;laws of nature&quot;): the first of which is &quot;that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;, Ch. XIV); and the second is &quot;that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself&quot; (&quot;loc. cit.&quot;). From here, Hobbes developed the way out of the state of nature into political society and government by mutual contracts.

According to Hobbes, the state of nature exists at all times among independent countries, over whom there is no law except for those same precepts or laws of nature (&quot;Leviathan&quot;, Chapters XIII, XXX end). His view of the state of nature helped to serve as a basis for theories of international law and relations and even some theories about domestic relations.

=== John Locke ===
John Locke considers the state of nature in his &quot;Second Treatise on Civil Government&quot; written around the time of the Exclusion Crisis in England during the 1680s. For Locke, in the state of nature all men are free &quot;to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature.&quot; (2nd Tr., §4). &quot;The state of Nature has a law of Nature to govern it&quot;, and that law is reason. Locke believes that reason teaches that &quot;no one ought to harm another in his life, liberty, and or property&quot; (2nd Tr., §6) ; and that transgressions of this may be punished. Locke describes the state of nature and civil society to be opposites of each other, and the need for civil society comes in part from the perpetual existence of the state of nature. This view of the state of nature is partly deduced from Christian belief (unlike Hobbes, whose philosophy is not dependent upon any prior theology).

Although it may be natural to assume that Locke was responding to Hobbes, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name, and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day, like Robert Filmer. In fact, Locke&#x27;s First Treatise is entirely a response to Filmer&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, and takes a step by step method to refuting Filmer&#x27;s theory set out in &quot;Patriarcha&quot;. The conservative party at the time had rallied behind Filmer&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, whereas the Whigs, scared of another persecution of Protestants, rallied behind the theory set out by Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; as it gave a clear theory as to why the people would be justified in overthrowing a monarchy which abuses the trust they had placed in it.

=== Montesquieu ===
Montesquieu makes use of the concept of the state of nature in his &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, first printed in 1748. Montesquieu states the thought process behind early human beings before the formation of society. He says that human beings would have the faculty of knowing and would first think to preserve their life in the state. Human beings would also at first feel themselves to be impotent and weak. As a result, humans would not be likely to attack each other in this state. Next, humans would seek nourishment and, out of fear and impulse, would eventually unite to create society. Once society was created, a state of war would ensue amongst societies, which would all have been created the same way. The purpose of war is the preservation of the society and the self. The formation of law within society is the reflection and application of reason for Montesquieu.

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
Hobbes&#x27; view was challenged in the eighteenth century by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized people and simply imagining them living outside of the society in which they were raised. He affirmed instead that people were neither good nor bad, but were born as a blank slate, and later society and the environment influence which way we lean. In Rousseau&#x27;s state of nature, people did not know each other enough to come into serious conflict and they did have normal values. The modern society, and the inception of private property, is blamed for the disruption of the state of nature which Rousseau sees as true freedom.

=== David Hume ===
David Hume offers in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1739) that human beings are naturally social: &quot;&#x27;Tis utterly impossible for men to remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes society; but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem&#x27;d social. This, however, hinders not, but that philosophers may, if they please, extend their reasoning to the suppos&#x27;d state of nature; provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction, which never had, and never could have any reality.&quot;

Hume&#x27;s ideas about human nature expressed in the &quot;Treatise&quot; suggest that he would be happy with neither Hobbes&#x27; nor his contemporary Rousseau&#x27;s thought-experiments. He explicitly derides as incredible the hypothetical humanity described in Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Leviathan&quot;. Additionally, he argues in &quot;Of the Origin of Justice and Property&quot; that if mankind were universally benevolent, we would not hold Justice to be a virtue: &quot;’tis only from the selfishness and confin’d generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin.&quot;

===John Calhoun===

John C. Calhoun, in his &quot;A Disquisition on Government&quot; (1851), wrote that a state of nature is merely hypothetical and argues that the concept is self-contradictory and that political states naturally always existed. It is, indeed, difficult to explain how an opinion so destitute of all sound reason, ever could have been so extensively entertained. . . . I refer to the assertion, that all men are equal in the state of nature; meaning, by a state of nature, a state of individuality, supposed to have existed prior to the social and political state; and in which men lived apart and independent of each other. . . . But such a state is purely hypothetical. It never did, nor can exist; as it is inconsistent with the preservation and perpetuation of the race. It is, therefore, a great misnomer to call it &quot;the state of nature&quot;. Instead of being the natural state of man, it is, of all conceivable states, the most opposed to his nature—most repugnant to his feelings, and most incompatible with his wants. His natural state is, the social and political—the one for which his Creator made him, and the only one in which he can preserve and perfect his race. As, then, there never was such a state as the, so-called, state of nature, and never can be, it follows, that men, instead of being born in it, are born in the social and political state; and of course, instead of being born free and equal, are born subject, not only to parental authority, but to the laws and institutions of the country where born, and under whose protection they draw their first breath. 

=== Karl Marx ===
Karl Marx&#x27;s concept of primitive communism—or the economic mode of production before the development of class systems—may be seen as analogous to the state of nature.

=== John Rawls ===
John Rawls used what amounted to an artificial state of nature. To develop his theory of justice, Rawls places everyone in the original position. The original position is a hypothetical state of nature used as a thought experiment. People in the original position have no society and are under a veil of ignorance that prevents them from knowing how they may benefit from society. They lack foreknowledge of their intelligence, wealth, or abilities. Rawls reasons that people in the original position would want a society where they had their basic liberties protected and where they had some economic guarantees as well. If society were to be constructed from scratch through a social agreement between individuals, these principles would be the expected basis of such an agreement. Thus, these principles should form the basis of real, modern societies since everyone should consent to them if society were organized from scratch in fair agreements.

=== Robert Nozick ===
Rawls&#x27; Harvard colleague Robert Nozick countered the liberal &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; with the libertarian &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, also grounded in the state of nature tradition. Nozick argued that a minimalist state of property rights and basic law enforcement would develop out of a state of nature without violating anyone&#x27;s rights or using force. Mutual agreements among individuals rather than social contract would lead to this minimal state.

== Between nations ==
In Hobbes&#x27; view, once a civil government is instituted, the state of nature has disappeared between individuals because of the civil power which exists to enforce contracts and the laws of nature generally. Between nations, however, no such power exists and therefore nations have the same rights to preserve themselves—including making war—as individuals possessed. Such a conclusion led some writers to the idea of an association of nations or worldwide civil society, an example being Immanuel Kant&#x27;s work on perpetual peace.

Rawls also examines the state of nature between nations. In his work the &quot;Law of Peoples&quot;, Rawls applies a modified version of his original position thought experiment to international relationships. Rawls says that peoples, not states, form the basic unit that should be examined. States should be encouraged to follow the principles from Rawls&#x27; earlier &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. Democracy seems like it would be the most logical means of accomplishing these goals, but benign non-democracies should be seen as acceptable at the international stage. Rawls develops eight principles for how a people should act on an international stage.

Within international relations theory, anarchy is the state of affairs wherein nations exist without a higher power to govern them. The three principal schools of international relations theory hold different beliefs about anarchy and how to approach it. Realism approaches global politics as if the world&#x27;s nations were each an individual under a state of nature: it tends to take anarchy for granted, and does not see a solution to it as possible or even necessarily desirable. Liberalism claims that anarchy may be mitigated through the spread of liberal democracy and the use of international organizations, thus creating a global civil society; this approach may be summed up by the words of George H. W. Bush, who sought to create &quot;a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations&quot;. Constructivist theorists, like liberals, also do not see anarchy as a given in international affairs, but are open to other approaches besides those given by realists and liberals.

<doc id="278313" wikidata="Q1182937" url="?curid=278313" title="Degüello">
<text>Degüello ( &quot;&quot;) is the sixth studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top, released in November 1979. It was the first ZZ Top release on Warner Bros. Records and eventually went platinum. It was produced by Bill Ham, recorded and mixed by Terry Manning, and mastered by Bob Ludwig.

Returning from a two-year hiatus, the band began to showcase the influence they had collected during the time away; Gibbons&#x27; time in Europe introduced him to punk music, the influences of which seeped into the creation of the album. The band also consciously tried experimenting with technology: Gibbons saw an episode of &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; where a person&#x27;s identity was protected using silhouette and a pitch shifter; liking the sound, he asked engineer Manning to call the show and find out what the effects unit was. Manning eventually convinced a reluctant show producer to reveal it, and the effect was used for both vocals and guitars on songs like &quot;Manic Mechanic&quot;.
The album marked the first time that ZZ Top featured cover versions on a studio album: &quot;I Thank You&quot; by Isaac Hayes/David Porter and &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, credited on early editions to Elmore James but subsequently credited to Robert Johnson who recorded it in 1936. Elmore James had adapted and popularized the song in 1951.

The song &quot;Hi Fi Mama&quot; was later featured on the episode &quot;The Twist in the Twister&quot; of the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;, where Gibbons also guest starred.

==Meaning of the title==
&quot;Degüello&quot; means &quot;decapitation&quot; (literally, a slashing of the throat) in Spanish or, idiomatically, when something is said to be done &quot;a degüello&quot;, it means &quot;no quarter&quot; in Spanish (as in, &quot;no surrender to be given or accepted—a fight to the death&quot;). It was also the title of a Moorish-origin bugle call used by the Mexican Army at the Battle of the Alamo in 1836.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted that &quot;the extended layoff has taken some of the edge off Gibbons&#x27; lead vocals and the album lacks a killer cut... On the plus side is ZZ Top&#x27;s shuffling guitar-bass-drums attack, which is as hard and funky as ever.&quot;

==Track listing==

<doc id="278357" wikidata="Q769451" url="?curid=278357" title="WNBA All-Star Game">
<text>The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association All-Star Game, commonly referred to as the WNBA All-Star Game, is an annual exhibition basketball game played in the United States between the best players of the Western and Eastern Conference of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA).

==Structure==
Each conference is represented by a team of 12 players who are currently having the best seasons performance-wise around the league. The starters are determined by fans voting through internet ballots. The rest of the players are selected by league personnel including head coaches as well as media personalities. At the end of the game, an all-star game Most Valuable Player (MVP) is named, as decided by a panel of media members.

==History==

In 2004, the game was not played in its usual format due to the WNBA players competing in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. That year, the USA national team defeated a team of WNBA All-Stars 74–58 at Radio City Music Hall. This game is officially considered to be an exhibition rather than an All-Star Game. The league also took a month-long break to accommodate players and coaches who would be participating in the summer games.

The tradition of not playing the WNBA All-Star Game during an Olympic year has continued in 2008, 2012, and 2016 (along with the tradition of taking a month-long break during the regular season). The 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the same reason, the beginning of the 2020 WNBA season has been delayed. The league later announced a revised 22-game schedule, but no all-star game was played. 

No official All-Star Game was held in 2010. Instead, there was an exhibition game matching the USA national team against a WNBA All-Star team, with Team USA winning 99–72 at Mohegan Sun Arena. 

The Western Conference leads the overall series 10–4.

==All-Star Game results==


*&quot;Seven WNBA cities haven&#x27;t been selected to host the All-Star Game yet: Atlanta, Dallas, Indianapolis (In 2025), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Portland.&quot;

== Three-Point Contest ==
The Three-Point Contest, formerly referred to as the Three-Point Shootout, was held during the All-Star Game event from 2006 to 2010, and then again from 2017 to the present.


: 1 All-time record score for a WNBA or NBA Three-Point Contest, surpassing the NBA record of 31 points set by Stephen Curry in Atlanta (2021), which Tyrese Haliburton equaled in Salt Lake City (2023). However, Ionescu used a smaller WNBA regulation ball to set the record.
