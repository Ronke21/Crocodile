<text>Heart is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1973. The band evolved from previous projects led by founding members Roger Fisher (guitar) and Steve Fossen (bass guitar), including The Army (1967–1969), Hocus Pocus (1969–1970), and White Heart (1970–1973). By 1975, original members Fisher, Fossen, and Ann Wilson (lead vocals and flute), along with Nancy Wilson (rhythm guitar, vocals), Michael Derosier (drums), and Howard Leese (guitar, keyboards and backing vocals) formed the lineup for the band&#x27;s initial mid- to late-1970s success period. These core members were included in the band&#x27;s 2013 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Heart rose to fame with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal as well as folk music. The band underwent a major lineup change between the late 1970s and the early 1980s; by 1982 Fisher, Fossen, and Derosier had all left and were replaced by Mark Andes (bass) and Denny Carmassi (drums). Though the band&#x27;s popularity fell off during the initial years with the new lineup, they staged a comeback in the mid-1980s, buoyed by major radio hits that continued into the 1990s. Heart disbanded in 1998, though they have resumed touring and recording multiple times since then, with the Wilson sisters being the only consistent members. Heart&#x27;s US Top 40 singles include &quot;Magic Man&quot; (1975), &quot;Crazy on You&quot; (1976), &quot;Barracuda&quot; (1977), &quot;What About Love&quot; (1985), &quot;Never&quot; (1985), and &quot;All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You&quot; (1990), along with no. 1 hits &quot;These Dreams&quot; (1986) and &quot;Alone&quot; (1987).
Heart has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, and has sold over 50million records worldwide, including approximately 22.5million albums in the United States. They have placed top-ten albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s. Heart was ranked number 57 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and ranked number 49 on Ultimate Classic Rock&#x27;s Top 100 Classic Rock Artists.

==History==
===1967–1972: Early bands and formation===
In 1965, bassist Steve Fossen formed The Army, along with Roger Fisher on guitar, Don Wilhelm on guitar, keyboards and lead vocals, and Ray Schaefer on drums. They played for several years in and around the Bothell, Washington, area, northeast of Seattle. They frequently played Bothell High School, Inglemoor High School, and Shorecrest High School, as well as many taverns and club venues. In 1969, the band went through lineup changes (Gary Ziegelman—former lead singer of Buffalo Clancy—on lead vocals, Fisher on guitar, Fossen on bass, James Cirrello on guitar, Ron Rudge on drums, and Ken Hansen on percussion) and took on a new name, Hocus Pocus. 

The name White Heart came from a discussion Roger Fisher&#x27;s brother Mike Fisher had with Michael Munro, who had come up with the name White Hart (without the &quot;e&quot; – a reference to Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the White Hart&quot;) for a band with Toby Cyr on lead guitar. Fisher asked and received permission to use the name for the Army, added the &quot;e&quot;, and the Army became White Heart. For a brief time in 1970, this lineup shortened its name to Heart. The band subsequently went through more personnel changes. In 1971, White Heart consisted of Steve Fossen, Roger Fisher, David Belzer (keys), and Jeff Johnson (drums). The band eventually stuck to the name Heart, which has been their name since 1973.

Mike Fisher, Roger&#x27;s brother, was set to be drafted into the army. Nancy Wilson has stated that when he did not report for duty, his home was raided, he slipped out a rear window, escaped to Canada, and became a Vietnam War &quot;draft dodger&quot;. One day in 1971 or 1972, Mike crossed the border to visit family, and by chance met Ann at a Hocus Pocus (or White Heart) show. According to Nancy, that meeting was &quot;when she and Michael fell in love&quot; and Ann decided to follow Mike back to Canada. Steve Fossen finished his college education before he also decided to move to Canada in late 1972, and Roger followed in late 1972 or early 1973. Along with Ann, Brian Johnstone (drums), and John Hannah (keyboards), the band Heart was officially formed. Ann&#x27;s sister Nancy Wilson joined in 1974, and soon after became romantically involved with Roger.

===1975–1976: Commercial breakthrough===
The group played numerous shows around their new home in Vancouver, and they recorded a demo tape with the assistance of producer Mike Flicker and session-guitarist and keyboard player, Howard Leese. Hannah and Johnstone had left by this time, and soon after Leese became a full-time member. Flicker produced the band&#x27;s first five albums. This team recorded the debut album, &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot;, at Can-Base Studios in Vancouver, later known as Mushroom Studios. Mike Derosier eventually joined Heart as full-time drummer. Some of the same Canadian investors who had backed the studio also backed a separate company called Mushroom Records, which was managed by Shelly Siegel.

The album was picked up by Siegel and sold 30,000 copies in Canada within the first few months of its release in September 1975. Sales were assisted by the band opening a Rod Stewart concert at the Montreal Forum in October, a gig they were offered a day before the concert when the previously-scheduled opening act canceled. The radio success of &quot;Magic Man&quot; led concert organizers to offer the spot to Heart. The band flew from the West Coast of Canada to Montreal overnight for the performance. Siegel soon released the album in the US. Helped by two hit singles in 1976 (&quot;Crazy on You&quot; and &quot;Magic Man&quot;, which reached numbers 35 and nine, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), it reached number seven in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It eventually sold over one million copies.

===1977–1979: Mainstream success and band split===

In 1977, Mushroom Records ran a full-page advertisement showing the bare-shouldered Wilson sisters (as on the &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; album cover) with the suggestive caption, &quot;It was only our first time!&quot; In a July 1977 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story, the sisters cited this advertisement as a key reason for their decision to leave Mushroom Records. Heart broke its contract with Mushroom and signed a contract with CBS subsidiary Portrait Records, resulting in a prolonged legal battle with Siegel. Mushroom released the partly completed &quot;Magazine&quot; in early 1977, just before Portrait released &quot;Little Queen&quot;. Each company attempted to prevent the other from releasing any Heart music. A Seattle court forced Mushroom Records to recall the album so that Heart could remix tracks and add new vocals, and the album was re-released in 1978. It peaked at number 17 in the US, generating the single &quot;Heartless&quot;, which reached number 24 in the charts. The album eventually achieved platinum status.
&quot;Little Queen&quot; became Heart&#x27;s second million-seller and featured the hit &quot;Barracuda&quot; (number 11). The song&#x27;s lyrics were written by an infuriated Ann Wilson in her hotel room after a reporter had suggested that the sisters were lesbian lovers.

In late 1978, the double-platinum &quot;Dog &amp; Butterfly&quot; peaked at 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and produced hits with its title song (number 34) and &quot;Straight On&quot; (number 15). In 1979, the Wilson-Fisher liaisons ended—Roger Fisher was voted out of the band by the other members, and his brother Mike left the group’s orbit within a month.

===1980–1984: Commercial decline===
Heart released &quot;Bebe le Strange&quot; in 1980. It became the band&#x27;s third top-10 album, peaking at number five, and yielded the top-40 hit &quot;Even It Up&quot;. The band embarked on a 77-city tour to promote the album. By the end of the year, the band scored its highest-charted single at the time, a version of the ballad &quot;Tell It Like It Is&quot;, which peaked at number eight. In November 1980, the double album &quot;Greatest Hits/Live&quot; was released and reached number twelve on the US chart, eventually achieving double-platinum status. The two-disc set featured studio versions of most of Heart&#x27;s singles to date, plus a few new studio tracks and six live tracks, among which were versions of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;.

Heart was the first band of the day to appear at the sold-out concert headlined by Queen at Elland Road on May 29, 1982. Their next album, &quot;Private Audition&quot; (1982), provided the minor hit &quot;This Man Is Mine&quot; (number 33) and was the first not produced by Mike Flicker. Initially, the band turned to Jimmy Iovine, one of the leading producers of the time, who suggested that the material lacked potential hits, and eventually, the Wilson sisters produced the album themselves. The track &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot; foreshadowed the power ballads that would dominate the band&#x27;s mid-1980s sound.

At the end of recording, Derosier and Fossen were fired from the band. They were replaced by Denny Carmassi on drums and Mark Andes on bass for &quot;Passionworks&quot; (1983), while at the record company&#x27;s insistence, the band turned to established producer Keith Olsen. Both &quot;Private Audition&quot; and &quot;Passionworks&quot; had relatively poor sales, failing to reach gold status. Despite the albums&#x27; sales, the single &quot;How Can I Refuse&quot; was a success, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart.

===1985–1990: Comeback===
The band moved to Capitol Records, and their first album for the label was simply titled &quot;Heart&quot; (1985). The move to Capitol coincided with a glam metal makeover that included minimizing the acoustic and folk sounds characteristic of their early work. The album reached number one, sold five million copies, and launched four top-10 hits: &quot;What About Love&quot; (number 10, 1985), &quot;Never&quot; (number four, 1985), the chart-topping &quot;These Dreams&quot; (1986) and &quot;Nothin&#x27; at All&quot; (number 10, 1986). A fifth single, &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot;, also charted, giving the band five hit singles from the same album for the first time.

Heart&#x27;s next album, &quot;Bad Animals&quot; (1987), continued the move away from the band&#x27;s folk and acoustic leanings towards a glossier arena rock sound. The lead single, the power ballad &quot;Alone&quot;, became Heart&#x27;s most successful song, spending three weeks at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while also hitting number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart and number 3 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Alone&quot; placed as the number 2 song for the year on the Hot 100. It also peaked at number 1 in Canada and number 3 in the UK, made the top 10 in Australia and several countries in northern Europe, and the top 20 in Germany. It is often considered to be Heart&#x27;s greatest pop song. 

The other two singles were the up-tempo rocker &quot;Who Will You Run To&quot;, which reached number 7 on the Hot 100 and number 2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and &quot;There&#x27;s the Girl&quot;, with Nancy singing lead, which reached number 12 and 16 on the same charts respectively. They were not as successful in other markets aside from &quot;Who Will You Run To&quot; making the top 20 in Canada and &quot;There&#x27;s the Girl&quot; peaking in the top 15 in Poland. &quot;Bad Animals&quot; was a top 3 hit in the US and Canada, being certified 3x and 4x platinum in those countries, respectively. The album also became Heart&#x27;s first top 10 album on the UK Albums Chart.

The success of UK top-40 singles &quot;Alone&quot; (number 3), &quot;Who Will You Run To&quot; (number 30), &quot;There&#x27;s the Girl&quot; (number 34) and the &quot;Bad Animals&quot; album (number 7) sparked renewed UK interest in the 1985 self-titled album, resulting in the re-release of several singles. When originally released in 1985, the singles &quot;What About Love&quot; and &quot;Never&quot; did not chart, while &quot;These Dreams&quot; and &quot;Nothin&#x27; at All&quot; only charted at 68 and 76 respectively. However, in 1988 after the success of &quot;Bad Animals&quot; a re-released double A-side single of &quot;Never&quot;/&quot;These Dreams&quot; hit number 8, &quot;What About Love&quot; hit number 14, and the re-release of &quot;Nothin&#x27; at All&quot; cracked the UK top 40 at number 38. This success in the UK would continue with future albums and help Heart become a major concert attraction in the United Kingdom.

In 1990, &quot;Brigade&quot; became the band&#x27;s sixth multi-platinum LP and added three more top-25 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits. &quot;Stranded&quot; reached number 13 and &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Want to Need You&quot; peaked at number 23. The lead single, &quot;All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You&quot;, reached number two, and created controversy over whether the song encouraged women to endanger themselves by picking up hitchhikers. Two other album cuts, &quot;Wild Child&quot; (number 3) and &quot;Tall, Dark Handsome Stranger&quot; (number 24), were &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart hits. &quot;Brigade&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the UK, reaching number three.

===1991–2001: The Lovemongers, &quot;Desire Walks On&quot;, and Nancy Wilson hiatus===

Heart released its first complete live album in the autumn of 1991. &quot;Rock the House Live!&quot; largely featured tracks from &quot;Brigade&quot; rather than more familiar hits in an effort to capture the harder rock side of the band. The album&#x27;s single, a version of John Farnham&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot;, received moderate airplay on rock stations and hit number 20 on the Mainstream Rock chart.

The Wilson sisters then put together an informal acoustic group called Lovemongers with longtime Heart songwriting collaborator Sue Ennis and Frank Cox.

Heart returned in 1993 with &quot;Desire Walks On&quot;, on which bass player Andes was replaced with Fernando Saunders. The album peaked at number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually being certified gold. The lead track, &quot;Black on Black II&quot;, was an AOR hit peaking at number four on&quot; Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Mainstream Rock chart, while the single &quot;Will You Be There (In the Morning)&quot; was a moderate pop hit, reaching number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A third single, &quot;The Woman In Me&quot;, hit number 24 on the Adult Contemporary chart, but missed the Hot 100.

&quot;Desire Walks On&quot; marked the first time that Heart&#x27;s singles fared better in other countries than the US. Aside from the metallic hard rock radio cut &quot;Black on Black II&quot; which reached the Top 10 on US Rock / Hard Rock charts, &quot;Will You Be There (In the Morning)&quot; hit number 19 in the UK and number 8 in Canada. (vs. Number 39 in the US) and &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; reached number 13 in Canada after just missing the US Billboard Hot 100.

An interactive CD-ROM, &quot;Heart: 20 Years of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, with five hours of audio footage, was released in 1994. The next album, &quot;The Road Home&quot; (1995), offered live acoustic versions of the group&#x27;s best-known songs and was produced by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Paul Jones.

In 1995, Nancy Wilson decided to take a break from music to concentrate on raising a family.
In 1998, the band maintained its profile by being the subject of an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. The band released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; boxed set covering their early work. A second volume focusing on the later part of their career followed in 2000.

Lovemongers released a live EP of cover songs titled &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; in 1992, a full-length album titled &quot;Whirlygig&quot; in 1997, and a collection of mostly self-penned Christmas songs titled &quot;Here is Christmas&quot; in 1998. In 2001, &quot;Here Is Christmas&quot; was re-released presented by Heart as &quot;Heart Presents a Lovemongers&#x27; Christmas&quot;.

===2002–2006: Resumption===
In 2002, Ann and Nancy returned to the road with a brand-new Heart lineup that included Scott Olson, Ben Smith, Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, and keyboardist Tom Kellock. In 2003, Heart released a DVD of the band&#x27;s last stop in the tour as &quot;Alive in Seattle&quot;. Also in 2003, Gilby Clarke (ex-Guns N&#x27; Roses) and Darian Sahanaja replaced Olson and Kellock for an American tour.

In 2004, with Clarke having been replaced by Craig Bartok, Heart released &quot;Jupiters Darling&quot;, the first studio album since 1993. It featured a variety of songs that included a return to Heart&#x27;s original hard-rock sound, as well as a blend of vintage pop and new textures.

In 2005, the Wilsons appeared on the CMT Music Awards as a special guest of country singer Gretchen Wilson (no relation) and performed the Heart classic &quot;Crazy on You&quot; with her. Heart also performed with Gretchen Wilson on VH-1&#x27;s March 10, 2006, tribute to the band, &quot;Decades Rock Live!&quot;. The special also featured Alice in Chains, Phil Anselmo, Dave Navarro, Rufus Wainwright, and Carrie Underwood. The concert was released on LP, CD, DVD, and Blu-ray on January 25, 2019, with the title &quot;Live in Atlantic City&quot;. Later in the year, bass player Inez left Heart to rejoin the reformed Alice in Chains.

===2007–2009: VH1 Rock Honors to touring with Journey===

Heart was honored at the second annual VH1 Rock Honors (May 24, 2007) and also performed along with Ozzy Osbourne, Genesis, and ZZ Top. Gretchen Wilson and Alice in Chains honored the group by performing &quot;Barracuda&quot;. In September 2007, Ann Wilson released her first solo album, &quot;Hope &amp; Glory&quot;, which featured sister Nancy, Elton John, Alison Krauss, k.d. lang, Wynonna Judd, Gretchen Wilson, Rufus Wainwright, Shawn Colvin, and Deana Carter.

On April 9, 2008, the band appeared on &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; with Stacy &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson, who sang &quot;Barracuda&quot; in harmony with Ann. In mid-2008, Heart undertook a US tour with Journey and Cheap Trick. It was named the &quot;Human 2008&quot; tour. Also in 2008, the band performed in a benefit for music education in public schools, appearing live with Jackson Browne on &quot;Something Fine,&quot; with Venice on &quot;Crazy on You,&quot; and with over 70 members of the Santa Monica High School orchestra and girls&#x27; choir on &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody.&quot; In 2009, the band was featured on an updated and remastered episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music.&quot;

===2010–2012: &quot;Red Velvet Car&quot; to Kennedy Center Honors===

A new studio album, &quot;Red Velvet Car&quot;, was released in 2010. It marked a stylistic return to Heart&#x27;s melodic hard rock and folk sound of their early albums. The album peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the group&#x27;s first top-10 album in 20 years. It also reached number three on &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Albums Chart. &quot;Red Velvet Car&quot; spawned two singles. The folky &quot;Hey You&quot; peaked at number 26 on &quot;Billboard&quot; AC chart, while the hard rocker &quot;WTF&quot; peaked at number 19 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock Songs chart. 

In November 2010, Heart announced it would do its first cross-Canada tour in 30 years, beginning on January 28, 2011, in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. A live DVD and Blu-ray disc, &quot;A Night at Sky Church&quot;, recorded before the tour at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, was released in 2011. Ann and Nancy Wilson played as part of the 2010 &quot;VH1 Divas Support the Troops&quot;, along with acts including Katy Perry and Paramore; they performed &quot;Crazy on You&quot; with Grace Potter and the Nocturnals.

In May 2010, a reunion of former male members of the band, including Roger Fisher and Steve Fossen, performed at the Synergia Northwest concert in Tacoma, Washington.

Heart embarked on a 2011 summer tour co-headlining with Def Leppard. A career-spanning box-set titled &quot;Strange Euphoria&quot; was released in June 2012, containing many of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, unreleased demos and rare live cuts. On September 18, 2012, the Wilson sisters released their autobiography, &quot;Kicking and Dreaming: A Story of Heart, Soul, and Rock and Roll&quot;, which was co-written with Charles R. Cross (&quot;Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain&quot;). On September 25, 2012, Ann and Nancy received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to music.

The band released its 14th studio album, &quot;Fanatic&quot;, on October 2, 2012, which became the group&#x27;s 12th top-25 album (number 24, 2012) and was supported by a tour of the US and Canada. On December 26, 2012, Ann and Nancy performed at the CBS-televised Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to Led Zeppelin. Along with an orchestra, two choirs and Jason Bonham (son of late Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham), they performed a version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s signature song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Their rendition of &quot;Stairway&quot; earned a standing ovation from the crowd and tears of joy from Robert Plant. The video went viral on YouTube, with over four million views in the first five days after the show, and prompted the Kennedy Center to issue a limited-edition iTunes single of the performance. Although the single was available for only two weeks, it immediately went to number one on the iTunes Rock Singles chart and reached number 20 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Rock Songs chart.

===2013–2016: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and &quot;Beautiful Broken&quot;===
At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 18, 2013, the original members of Heart (the Wilson sisters, Howard Leese, Michael Derosier, Steve Fossen, and Roger Fisher) reunited for the first time in 34 years to play &quot;Crazy on You&quot;. The band was inducted by Chris Cornell, who emotionally talked about what heroes and role models Ann and Nancy Wilson had been to him and other musicians in Seattle, saying, &quot;For me, and for countless other men and women, they have earned, at long last, their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&quot; In 2014, the band released another live album, &quot;Fanatic Live from Caesar&#x27;s Colosseum&quot;, which peaked at number 13 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Hard Rock Albums Chart.

Heart released the album &quot;Beautiful Broken&quot; on July 8, 2016. The hard-rocking title cut featuring Metallica″s James Hetfield trading vocals with Ann Wilson was the first single. &quot;Beautiful Broken&quot; reached number 9 on Billboard&#x27;s Rock Album Chart and number 30 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Selling Albums Chart. Immediately following the new album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on the Rock Hall Three for All, a 30-date headlining tour of the US with Joan Jett and Cheap Trick supporting.

=== 2016–present: Hiatus, side projects, and reunion ===
On the morning of August 27, 2016, Ann&#x27;s husband Dean Wetter was arrested and subsequently pleaded guilty to assaulting Nancy&#x27;s 16-year-old twin sons after the boys had left the door to his RV open. The incident took place during a Heart performance at the White River Amphitheater in Auburn, Washington, the previous night. Although the band played the remaining 2016 tour dates that were already booked, the Wilson sisters only spoke to one another through third parties for the remainder of the tour. The pair&#x27;s relationship was strained by the incident; an April 2017 article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that they had not spoken to one another since the 2016 tour ended and only sporadically contacted one another through text messaging. Following the end of the tour in October 2016, the sisters opted to tour with their own side-project bands. In April 2017, both sisters said the band had not permanently disbanded with Ann saying they were simply on hiatus.

In February 2019, Heart announced their hiatus had ended and they would embark on the Love Alive tour in the summer. In March 2019, both sisters reunited on stage for the first time since the band went on hiatus, at the Love Rock NYC benefit concert. Although Ann and Nancy were reuniting, the former Heart members who had joined Nancy&#x27;s solo effort were not invited back, and the new lineup consisted of Ann&#x27;s touring band, replacing Ben Smith on drums, Dan Rothchild on bass, and Chris Joyner on keyboards. In June 2019, the band announced the Love Alive tour had been extended through October 2019.

In 2022, Nancy Wilson announced her own version of Heart, called &quot;Nancy Wilson&#x27;s Heart&quot;. She has been touring under that name, playing a list consisting primarily of Heart songs.

In the last few days of December 2023, Heart played together for the first time in four years, with two concerts in California followed by a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Seattle, and Ann Wilson&#x27;s band Tripsitter as backup musicians. On New Year&#x27;s Day, they performed &quot;Barracuda&quot; and &quot;Magic Man&quot; during the first intermission at the 2024 NHL Winter Classic in Seattle.

On January 29, 2024, Heart announced their 2024 Royal Flush World Tour, where they would be playing several dates with Cheap Trick, Def Leppard, Journey, and Squeeze. The summer 2024 UK and Europe dates were canceled because Ann Wilson had undergone a medical procedure in late May, which was later revealed to be the removal of a cancerous growth.

== Legacy ==
Heart is generally considered a hard rock band, but its diversity has crossed multiple genres from folk to pop to hard rock, and even at times heavy metal. As a result, the band has charted singles on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Mainstream Rock Tracks, Hard Rock Tracks, and Adult Contemporary charts. Their 2016 live recording at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra even charted in the top 10 of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Classical Albums chart and Classical Crossover Albums chart.

Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, had 20 top-forty singles and seven top-ten albums, and earned four Grammy nominations. The band charted singles and top-ten albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2010s: a four-decade span of top-ten albums that is a record for a female-fronted band.

Heart was ranked on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; in 2008, and Ann and Nancy Wilson ranked number 40 (in 1999) on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll&quot;. Ann Wilson was ranked in &quot;Hit Parader&quot; 2006 &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time&quot;. In 2009, the Wilson sisters were awarded ASCAP&#x27;s Founders Award in recognition of their songwriting careers.

In 2011, Heart earned its first nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the 2012 class. After being passed over, the band was nominated again the following year announced as inductees to the 2013 class on December 11, 2012. Their Hall of Fame page describes the Wilson sisters as the first women to front a hard-rock band, and &quot;pioneers ... inspir[ing] women to pick up an electric guitar or start a band&quot;.

In his book &quot;Heart: In the Studio&quot;, Jake Brown described the band as beginning &quot;a revolution for women in music ... breaking genre barriers and garnering critical acclaim&quot;.

&quot;Heart were the first female-fronted band I heard and was influenced by,&quot; recalled Lzzy Hale of Halestorm. &quot;I heard Heart and was like, &#x27;Oh, singing like that as a girl is actually a thing!&#x27;&quot;

The Wilson sisters have been active in the Seattle music scene for decades and influenced many musicians from the region, including bands of the grunge era. Artists that have used their Bad Animals Studio include Neil Young, R.E.M., Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.

<doc id="288139" wikidata="Q1255768" url="?curid=288139" title="Hohokam">
<text>Hohokam was a culture in the North American Southwest in what is now part of south-central Arizona, United States, and Sonora, Mexico. It existed between 300 and 1500 CE, with cultural precursors possibly as early as 300 BCE. Archaeologists disagree about whether communities that practiced the culture were related or politically united. According to local oral tradition, Hohokam societies may be the ancestors of the historic Akimel and Tohono Oʼodham in Southern Arizona.

The origin of the culture is debated. Most archaeologists either argue it emerged locally or in Mesoamerica, but it was also influenced by the Northern Pueblo culture. Hohokam settlements were located on trade routes that extended past the Hohokam area, as far east as the Great Plains and west to the Pacific coast. Hohokam societies received a remarkable amount of immigration. Some communities established significant markets, such as that in Snaketown. The harshness of the Sonoran Desert may have been the most influential factor on the society. Despite cultural exchange at trade centers, self-sufficiency and local resources were emphasized.

In modern-day Phoenix, the Hohokam are recognized for their large-scale irrigation networks. Their canal network in the Phoenix metropolitan area was the most complex in the pre-contact Western Hemisphere. A portion of the ancient canals has been renovated for the Salt River Project and helps to supply the city&#x27;s water. The original canals were dirt ditches and required routine maintenance; those currently in use are lined with concrete. When Hohokam society collapsed, the dirt canals fell into disrepair. European-American settlers later infilled some canals, while others renovated, as with the Mormon pioneers settling the Lehi area of Mesa near Red Mountain.

According to the National Park Service, the word &quot;Hohokam&quot; is borrowed from the O&#x27;odham language, and is used by archaeologists to identify groups of people who lived in the Sonoran Desert. Other archaeologists prefer to identify ancient Arizona as part of the Oasisamerica tradition and instead call Hohokam the Oasisamericans. Nevertheless, Hohokam are one of the four major cultures of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, according to Southwestern archaeology.

There are several official spelling variants for the name, including Hobokam, Huhugam, and Huhukam. The spellings are commonly thought to be interchangeable, but they have different meanings. In the 1930s, archaeologist Harold S. Gladwin differentiated Hohokam culture from others in the region. He applied the existing O&#x27;odham term for the culture, &quot;huhu-kam&quot;, in its common mistranslation as &quot;all used up&quot; or &quot;those who are gone&quot;, to classify the remains that he was excavating in the Lower Gila Valley. Similarly, in the 1970s, archaeologist Hardy translated the O&#x27;odham word &quot;huhugam&quot; to mean &quot;that which has perished.&quot; However, &quot;huhugam&quot; refers to past human life and not to objects such as ruins. Therefore, the archaeological term &quot;Hohokam&quot; should not be confused with &quot;huhugam&quot;, the reverence of ancestors and descendants.

== Overview ==

Hohokam society is primarily associated with the Gila and lower Salt River drainages in the Phoenix basin.

The Phoenix Basin was the Hohokam Core Area, and the Hohokam Periphery were adjacent areas where the Hohokam culture extended. Collectively, the Core and Peripheries formed the greater Hohokam Regional System, which occupied the northern or Upper Sonoran Desert in Arizona. The Hohokam also extended into the Mogollon Rim.

The Hohokam Core was located along rivers, and as such inhabited a prime trade position. Trade occurred between the Patayan, who were situated along the Lower Colorado River and in southern California; the Trincheras of Sonora, Mexico; the Mogollon culture in Eastern Arizona; Southwest New Mexico; Northwest Chihuahua, Mexico; and the Ancestral Puebloans in Northern Arizona. From 900 to 1150 CE, neighboring Chaco society encouraged trade throughout northern Arizona and into southwest Colorado and southern Utah. These trade networks increased hand-to-hand trade throughout the region, with goods traveling throughout the Colorado Plateau, northern Arizona, and the Phoenix area.

Hohokam irrigation systems supported the largest population in the Southwest by 1300 CE. Archaeologists working at a major archaeological dig in the 1990s in the Tucson Basin, along the Santa Cruz River, identified a culture and people that may have been the ancestors of the Hohokam. This prehistoric group may have occupied southern Arizona as early as 2000 BCE, and in the Early Agricultural Period grew corn, lived year-round in sedentary villages, and developed sophisticated irrigation canals.

The Hohokam used the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers to build an assortment of simple canals with weirs for agriculture. From 800 to 1400 CE, their irrigation networks rivaled the complexity of those of ancient Near East, Egypt, and China. They were constructed using relatively simple tools and engineering technology, yet achieved drops of a few feet per mile, balancing erosion and siltation. The Hohokam cultivated varieties of cotton, tobacco, maize, beans, and squash, and harvested a vast variety of wild plants. Late in the Hohokam Chronological Sequence, they also used extensive dry-farming systems, mainly to grow agave for food and fiber. Their agricultural strategies were vital in the inhospitable desert, and allowed the aggregation of rural populations into complex urban centers.

Many features of earlier Hohokam domestic architecture, such as rectangular pithouses, were apparently transplanted relatively intact from the Tucson basin during the early Formative Period. Throughout the Hohokam Chronological Sequence, individual homes were usually excavated approximately below ground level, had plastered or compacted floors of 12 to 35 m2, and had a bowl-shaped, clay-lined hearth near the wall-entry. By 600 CE, a distinct Hohokam architectural tradition emerged that had similarities with Mesoamerica, such as ballcourts that also served as neighborhood gathering and trade spaces. By 1150 CE, pithouses were replaced by above-ground structures in the compound style with central courtyards. By 1200 CE, rectangular platforms mounds were being constructed.

Hohokam burial practices varied over time, but cremation was a defining cultural characteristic of the Hohokam Core. Cremation has been used by archaeologists to suggest cultural interaction through trade or immigration with neighboring communities. An example is the Mogollan, at the Continental site in Tucson. Initially, the main method was flexed inhumation, similar to the southern Mogollon culture neighboring to the east. By the late Formative and Preclassic periods, the Hohokam cremated their dead, very similar to the traditions documented among the historic Patayan culture to the west along the Lower Colorado River. Although the particulars of the practice changed somewhat, cremation remained the main practice in Hohokam until around 1300 CE.

== History ==
Hohokam chronological sequence (HCS) is an archaeological construct that divides Hohokam history into phases of significant cultural changes. It uses two main methods of expression: Gladwinian and Cultural Horizon. The latter is an adaptation of the chronological scheme used in Mesoamerica applied to avoid the interpretive bias inherent in the Gladwinian scheme (i.e. Pioneer, Colonial, Sedentary periods).

The HCS and the methods to establish its calendrical reference are applied only to the Hohokam Core Area, which is the Gila-Salt River basin associated with Phoenix, Arizona, not to regions outside that area, called Hohokam Peripheries. Within these regions, the basic period designations are retained; however, local phases are often used to note significant differences, and, to some extent, represents communities influenced by their Ancestral Puebloan and Mogollon neighbors.

=== Pioneer/Formative period (1–750 CE) ===

As farmers of corn and beans, early Hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle Gila River. The communities were located near arable land, and dry farming was common early in this period. Water wells, usually less than deep, were dug for domestic water supplies. Early Hohokam homes were built of branches that were bent, covered with twigs or reeds and heavily applied mud, and other available materials.

Crop, agricultural skill, and cultural refinements increased between 300 and 500 CE as the Hohokam acquired a new group of cultivated plants, presumably from trade with peoples in the area of modern Mexico. These acquisitions included cotton, tepary bean, sieva and jack beans, cushaw and warty squash, and southwestern pigweed. Agave species had been gathered for food and fiber for thousands of years by southwestern peoples, and around 600, the Hohokam began cultivating agave, particularly &quot;Agave murpheyi&quot; (&quot;Hohokam agave&quot;), on large areas of rocky, dry ground. Agave became a major food source for the Hohokam to augment the food grown in irrigated areas. Engineering improved access to river water and the inhabitants excavated canals for irrigation. Evidence of trade networks include turquoise, shells from the Gulf of California, and parrot bones from central Mexico. Seeds and grains were prepared on stone &quot;manos&quot; and &quot;metates&quot;. Ceramics appeared shortly before 300 CE, with pots of unembellished brown used for storage and cooking, and as containers for cremated remains. Materials produced for ritual use included fired clay human and animal figures and incense burners.

=== Colonial/Preclassic period (750–1050/1150) ===
Growth is the major characteristic of the Colonial period. Villages grew larger, with clusters of houses opening on a common courtyard. Some evidence exists of social stratification in larger homes and more ornate grave goods. Area and canal systems expanded, and tobacco and agave production began. Mexican influence increased. In larger communities, the first Hohokam ball courts were constructed and served as focal points for games and ceremonies. Pottery was embellished by the addition of an iron-stained slip, which produced a distinctive red-on-buff ware.

====Sedentary period/Sacaton phase (950–1050/1150)====
Further population increase brought significant changes. Irrigation canals and structures became larger and required more maintenance. More land came under cultivation, and Southwestern pigweed was grown. House design evolved into post-reinforced pit-houses, covered with caliche adobe. Rancheria-like villages grew up around common courtyards, with evidence of increased communal activity. Large common ovens were used to cook bread and meat.

Crafts were greatly refined. By about 1000 CE, the Hohokam were the first to master acid etching, daubing shells with pitch and bathing them in acid most likely made out of fermented cactus juice. Artisans produced jewelry from shell, stone, and bone, and began to carve stone figures. Cotton textile work flourished. Red-on-buff pottery was widely produced.

This growth brought a need for increased organization, and perhaps authority. The regional culture spread widely, extending from near the Mexican border to the Verde River in the north. There appears to have been an elite class, as well as an increase in social status for craftsman. Platform mounds similar to those in central Mexico appear, and may be associated with an upper class and have some religious function. Trade items from the Mexican heartland included copper bells, mosaics, stone mirrors, and ornate birds such as macaws.

=== Classic period (1050/1150–1450 CE) ===
This period is generally considered as a time of growth and social change. The community of Snaketown, once central to the culture, was suddenly abandoned. Parts of this large village seem to have burned, and it was never reoccupied. This period also saw the construction of large and prestigious structures in the Salt-Gila Basin. These included large, rectangular, adobe-walled compounds with platform mounds and great houses, such as the example found at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. Additionally, evidence of Hohokam influence in a broader context decreased significantly.

====Santan phase (1050–1150 CE)====
This phase was initially proposed as part of the Gladwinian scheme, but recently has fallen out of favor with many Hohokam archaeologists. The primary reason for this view is that the Hohokam buff ware type once classified as Santan red-on-buff is now listed as either a late form of Sacaton or Casa Grande red-on-buffs. The wide range of vessel forms used for decorated pottery was discarded for globular jars with necks. Production and use of Hohokam buff wares decrease significantly. So did the procurement and trade of raw shell from northern Mexico and its manufacture into jewelry. There was a transition from pithouses to pitrooms and an introduction of spherical spindle whorls similar to examples used in northern Mexico. Conceptually, this episode had the relatively sudden and widespread abandonment or relocation of many Hohokam villages and a short-lived population decline. Vast internal changes, the rejection of the Hohokam ballcourt system, and the peripheries&#x27; displaying overt indications of belligerence towards the core area, followed by their cultural realignment, suggests that this was a very important episode.

====Soho phase (1050/1150–1300 CE)====
The diagnostic ceramic type for this phase was Casa Grande red-on-buff. This Hohokam buff ware was characterized exclusively by jars with necks, decorated with a limited variety of geometric and textual designs. This pottery type appears to have been manufactured at several locales in the Gila River basin between Florence and Sacaton, Arizona. There was a major cultural retraction of territory, and two significant episodes of reorganization. The first reorganization occurred around 1150 CE and was typified by a modest increase in population and near-universal adoption of pitroom architecture. These early pitrooms were built of perishable material covered with a thick adobe plaster, and the basal portion of the interior walls was often lined with upright slabs. Similar to the Preclassic period villages, these early Classic period homes were clustered around open courtyards. These courtyard groups were clustered near a large central locus, which often included small platform mounds. These platform mounds were rectangular, faced by post-reinforced adobe walls, and were filled with either sterile soil or refuse from Preclassic trash mounds. In the largest villages, the central locus included small platform mounds. The number of small and medium-sized settlements seem to have declined as the larger communities became increasingly more densely occupied.

====Civano phase (1300–1350/1375 CE)====
Although Casa Grande red-on-buff continued to be produced, the pottery type that characterized this phase was Salado polychrome, primarily Gila polychrome. This ceramic type was either manufactured locally or procured as a trade ware. This phase also had the introduction the &quot;comal&quot;, similar to examples found in northern Mexico, and the production of bird-shaped effigy vessels. Examples of exotic stone and shell artifacts associated with high-status individuals – such as nose plugs, pendants, ear rings, bracelets, necklaces, and sophisticated shell inlays – indicate that the design and manufacture of jewelry reached its zenith during this phase. Other important developments were the significant increased procurement and manufacture of red ware, and the near-universal use of inhumation burial in the area north of the Gila River, both similar to the practices and traditions used by the historic O&#x27;odham.

Immediately after 1300 CE, Hohokam villages were reorganized along the lines experienced in the Lower Verde, Tonto Basin, and Safford Basin, in the 13th century. These compounds were composed of a large, rectangular exterior wall that partially (sometimes completely) enclosed a series of adjacent courtyards and plazas separated by partition walls. In turn, each courtyard may have contained one to four large, rectangular, adobe-walled pitrooms, possibly associated with several utility structures. Overall, these communities were characterized by relatively compact clusters of 5 to 25 adobe-walled compounds, which tended to be grouped around a single very large and well-built compound that often had some form of large community structure, such as a platform mound or great house. Great house structures, as with the one preserved at Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, were built only at the largest communities. These stone or adobe buildings had up to four stories, and were probably used by the managerial or religious elites. They may have also been constructed to align with astronomical observations. Trade with Mexico appears to have declined, but an increased number of trade goods arrived from Pueblo peoples to the north and the east.

Between 1350 and 1375 CE, the Hohokam tradition lost vitality and stability, and many of the largest settlements were abandoned. Climate change apparently greatly affected Hohokam agriculture and so dispersed its large communities. Repeated floods in the mid-14th century greatly deepened the Salt River bed and destroyed canal heads, which required their continuous extension upstream. Soon, additional flooding removed irreplaceable segments of these extensions, which effectively rendered hundreds of miles of canals virtually useless. Because of differences in hydrology and geomorphology, these processes had less impact on Hohokam irrigation systems in the Gila River basin, yet these were abandoned, as well. Hohokam split into smaller groups, and the population declined slightly, at a peak rate 2 per 100 people between 1350 and 1400. This decline was previously greatly overestimated because smaller groups are harder to identify. Evidence that the human population was maintained are the unchanged prey animal populations.

====Polvoron phase (1350/1375–1450 CE)====
This phase is characterized by widespread use and manufacture of Salado polychrome, with both Gila and Tonto polychromes. After 1375 CE, the Hohokam abandoned most villages and canal systems in the lower Salt River basin. The area continued to be occupied, but on a far smaller scale. The few villages that remained were quite small, and were concentrated along the Gila River, with the notable exception of the lower Queen Creek drainage. This period is the aftermath of the Hohokam cultural collapse and a critical stage in the ethnogenesis of modern O&#x27;odham.

== Ceramic tradition ==

The earliest sedentary agricultural settlements in central Arizona date from 1000 to 500 BCE, yet the first ceramics appear just before the Hohokam rise in 300 CE.

Some archaeologists interpret the sudden appearance of pottery as new trade or immigration into the Phoenix area, resulting in the rise of the Hohokam. Other archaeologists classify many of the defining, cultural characteristics as already within the indigenous farming communities by Hohokam rise. Hence, pottery helps to fuel the controversy over Hohokam origins.

It was once thought that Hohokam pottery material varied by location, since communities used local resources. Recently, studies on the temper revealed a variety of origins where pottery was manufactured and traded. Several palettes, from different periods, were found in the Gila Bend Region. This is evidence that the Hohokam stayed in one area for a long time.

Hohokam ceramics are defined by a distinct Plain, Red, and Decorated buffware tradition, and were made using a technique called coiling. A small, fine clay base was connected to a series of coils. These coils were then thinned and shaped using a paddle and anvil. Hohokam Plain and Red wares were primarily tempered with a variety of materials including micaceous, phyllite, or Squaw Peak schist, as well as granite, quartz, quartzite, and arkosic sands. Analytically, based on the type of temper used, these are classified as to the geographic setting of their manufacture, and are referred to as Gila (Gila River basin), Wingfield (Agua Fria basin, the Northern Periphery, or Lower Verde area), Piestewa Peak (Phoenix metro area north of the Salt River), South Mountain (Phoenix metro area south of the Salt River), or Salt (Salt or Verde River basins) Plain and Red wares.

The surfaces of Plain wares were smoothed to some extent and many were polished, or slipped, with other minerals or clays. After the vessels were fired, these sometimes turned a color that ranged from light or dark brown, gray, to orange. Later, the interiors of bowls were slipped with a black carbonous material. Hohokam Red wares were slipped with an iron-based pigment that turned red after the vessel was fired. The manufacture of decorated Hohokam pottery was similar to that of the Plain wares. However, the clays tended to be of a finer quality and were tempered with caliche and limited amounts of very finely ground micaceous schist and small particles of vegetative material.

==Major core area villages and cities==
The true measure of the Hohokam can only be derived from the sum of their material culture. This is best gleaned from a review of their principal population centers, or more appropriately, major villages or giant cities. Although sharing a common cultural expression, each of these major villages has its own unique history of emergence, growth, and eventual abandonment. Including outlines of archaeological exploration, provided below are brief descriptions of the largest and most important prehistoric villages, towns, and cities found within the so-called Hohokam core area.

===Snaketown===
Snaketown was the archetypical Preclassic period settlement and preeminent community centered within the core of the Hohokam culture area. Today, Snaketown is situated within the Hohokam Pima National Monument, located near Santan, Arizona, which was authorized by Congress on October 21, 1972. Excavations conducted in the 1930s and again in the 1960s revealed that the site was inhabited from about 300 BCE to 1050 CE. At its height in the early 11th century, Snaketown was the center of both the Hohokam culture and the production of the distinctive Hohokam buff ware. Following the last excavations conducted by Emil Haury, the site was completely recovered with earth, leaving nothing visible above ground.

Overall, Snaketown boasted two ball courts, numerous trash mounds, a small ceremonial mound, a large central plaza, several large community houses, and hundreds of residential pithouses, and may have been home to at least several thousand people. After Snaketown was abandoned, several minor settlements were founded within the general vicinity and continued to be occupied until the early 14th century CE. The Hohokam Pima National Monument is located on Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) land and is under tribal ownership. It covers nearly (6.9 km²). The GRIC has decided not to open this extremely sensitive prehistoric site to the public.

===Grewe-Casa Grande===

Altogether, the greater Grewe-Casa Grande Site represented the largest Hohokam community located within the middle Gila River valley. Situated between two primary canals (on the north, Canal Casa Grande and to the south Canal Coolidge), over time, this community was recorded as several separate archaeological sites. These include the Casa Grande, Grewe, Vahki Inn Village, and Horvath sites. Occupied in the Preclassic and Classic periods, each of these sites was composed of between two and 20 large residential areas. Overall, the greater Grewe-Casa Grande archaeological site covered about , centered on State Route 87 and immediately north of the modern city of Coolidge, Arizona.

Most observers are attracted to the four-story great house found near the center of the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. Akimel O&#x27;odham oral tradition records that before the appearance of the Coyote People appeared, this massive structure was built by an important chieftain called Sial Teu-utak Sivan, (turqoise Leader) or &quot;Chief Turquoise&quot;. In the ancient hohokam language, the great house and the associated prehistoric ruins found north of Coolidge were collectively referred to as &quot;Sivan Vah&#x27;Ki&quot;, literally meaning the &quot;Abandoned House&quot;, or &quot;Village of the king/chieftain&quot;, respectively. As Frank Russell recorded in the early 20th century, several O&#x27;odham oral traditions note that Sial Teu-utak was an important leader of the Casa Grande community, before the overthrow of the Suwu&#x27;Ki O&#x27;odham, or &quot;Vulture People&quot;. Eusebio Francesco Chini (Father Kino) arrived in the middle Gila River valley in 1694 to find the monumental great house abandoned and already in a state of decay and decomposition. Despite its condition, later Jesuit missionaries and he used the great house to hold Mass, between the late 17th and 18th centuries.

Adolph Bandelier provided one of the first detailed archaeological maps and descriptions of Classic period architecture at the central locus, or Compound A, of the Casa Grande site, in 1884. Jesse Walter Fewkes and Cosmos Mindeleff made further descriptions of this area. Between 1906 and 1912, Fewkes conducted excavations and stabilization of this portion of the site. In 1927, Harold Gladwin excavated stratified tests of several trash mounds at both the Grewe and Casa Grande sites. He also defined and excavated portions of Sacaton 9:6 (GP), an adobe-walled compound situated on the extreme edge of the Casa Grande site, east of State Route 87, near the current entrance to the monument. Relatively large-scale excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1931, by Van Bergen-Los Angeles Museum Expedition under the direction of Arthur Woodward and Irwin Hayden. This project concentrated on a parcel at the Grewe site, and Compound F located within the northeast corner of the Casa Grande National Monument. Overall, including the recovery of 172 burials and hundreds of thousands of artifacts, about 60 pithouses, numerous pits, 27 adobe pitrooms, and a ballcourt were excavated or tested during the course of this project.

Additional excavations were performed in the southeast corner of the monument by the Civil Works Administration directed by Russell Hastings in 1933 and 1934. The excavation of 15 pithouses, three pits, 32 burials, and portions of four trash mounds demonstrated the presence of significantly large late Preclassic and early Classic period components within the area covered by the monument. Yet, by far the largest and most comprehensive archaeological endeavor was conducted by Northland Research Inc., from 1995 to 1997, on a parcel within portions of the Casa Grande, Grewe, and Horvath sites that paralleled State Routes 87 and 287. This project was directed by Douglass Craig, and resulted in the identification and/or excavation of 247 pithouses, 24 pitrooms, 866 pits, 11 canal alignments, a ballcourt, and portions of four adobe-walled compounds, as well as the recovery of 158 burials and over 400,000 artifacts.

Based on the results of these projects, the history of the greater Grewe-Casa Grande site can be reconstructed with at least some degree of precision. The genesis of this important village appears to have been associated with several groups of pithouses organized around a series of relatively small, circular plazas. These appear to date to the sixth century CEand were located along and immediately upslope of the Coolidge Canal system. By the eighth century CE, this dispersed hamlet had expanded nearly a kilometer south and developed into a full-fledged summer home for the priests and chieftain. At this point, the settlement consisted of densely packed yet discrete groups of pithouses clustered around small open courtyards. In turn these structures delineated a large central plaza. Adjoining the plaza was a medium-sized ballcourt, and overall, the village was affiliated with several smaller outlying settlements.

In the 10th century, at least two large secondary villages and about a dozen new hamlets were founded to the west of the main settlement. With the abandonment of Snaketown and the transition from the Preclassic to Classic periods, the greater Grewe-Casa Grande community became one of the largest and most important Hohokam population centers. At its height, the Grewe-Casa Grande village boosted about 100 trash mounds, several hundred residential pithouses, and four or five ballcourts. Regardless of its size, complexity, and significance along the middle Gila River, this settlement never seemed to have attained the status enjoyed by Snaketown, as it pertained to the Hohokam culture, &quot;per se&quot;. As the western portion of this settlement grew, large sections of the eastern half declined and were abandoned. By 1300 CE, the village was composed of about 19 adobe-walled residential compounds, several pitroom clusters, a platform mound, a great house, and numerous trash mounds. With most of the village contained within what is now the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, after the middle of the 14th century, it began a rapid decline. Around 1400 or 1450 CE, the entire settlement was abandoned, except for a low-scale occupation associated with the Polvoron phase.

Today, about 60% of the Grewe-Casa Grande site has been either destroyed due to agricultural and commercial development, excavated, or remains relatively intact buried under fields used to grow cotton. About 40% of this once huge settlement can be found within the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, which was established as the nation&#x27;s first archeological reserve in 1892, and declared a national monument in 1918. Visitors can enjoy an interpretative center, walk among the stabilized ruins of Compound A, and closely view the great house, which has been protected since 1932 from the elements by a distinctively modern-looking roof.

===Pueblo Grande===
Pueblo Grande Museum Archeological Park near central Phoenix contains preserved ruins and artifact exhibits. Archaeological finds have been recorded along the track of the adjacent Valley Metro light-rail construction.
===Mesa Grande===
The Mesa Grande ruin, located in Mesa, Arizona, represents another large Hohokam village that was occupied both in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from around 200 to 1450 CE. Although this settlement appears to have been very important, it has had little archaeological work, other than the mapping and stabilization projects conducted by the Southwest Archaeology Team (SWAT). The SWAT&#x27;s indispensable volunteer work at the Mesa Grande ruin began in the middle 1990s and continues today.

At its peak in the late Preclassic and early Classic periods, this settlement may have consisted of as many as 20 discrete residential areas and covered several hundred acres. Today, due to massive urban development, the surface remains of the village have been reduced to a 6.4-acre parcel situated immediately west of the old Mesa Hospital. Within this plot are the ruins of a large adobe compound and a nine-meters-high, relatively intact, platform mound. This is only one of the last three remaining Hohokam platform mounds in the greater Phoenix metro area. This parcel was transferred into public ownership in the mid-1980s, therefore the compound and mound were not destroyed and a full visitor center exists on the enclosed site that is open October–May annually.

===Las Colinas and Los Hornos===
Located within the modern city of Tempe, Arizona, the Hohokam settlement of Los Hornos (from the Spanish &quot;los hornos&quot;, meaning &#x27;the ovens&#x27;) was initially investigated by Frank Cushing in 1887. With urban expansion, additional excavations were conducted in the 1970s, late 1980s, and throughout the 1990s. The results of these comprehensive archaeological projects have documented both a large Preclassic- and Classic-period village organized much the same as Snaketown and Pueblo Grande, respectively, yet on a somewhat smaller scale. Los Hornos appears to have started around 400 CE, as a small cluster of rectangular pithouses situated on the extreme western edge of the site, west of Priest Dr and south of US 60.

Over time, the Los Hornos settlement expanded along a series of large secondary canals to the east and southeast. At the height of the Preclassic occupation in the Sacaton phase, which was contemporary with the zenith of Snaketown, this settlement had one large ball court, a large central plaza, several formal cremation cemeteries, numerous trash mounds, and several hundred residential pithouses. The detailed excavation of 50 Preclassic period pithouses in the area located immediately south of US 60 and east of Priest Dr, provided invaluable information concerning residential architecture and the functional use of interior space. Additional information concerning the Archaeological Consulting Services Ltd. excavation of a Preclassic occupation at Los Hornos can be found at the following site.

After a short period of population loss and community reorganization in the late 11th and early 12th centuries CE, Los Hornos continued to shift east and south in the Classic period. This large village appears to have recovered somewhat and again became an important settlement late in the Soho or early in the Civano phases, from 1277 to 1325 CE. At this time, Los Hornos, now centered on Hardy Dr south of US 60 and north of Baseline Road, consisted of about 15 residential compounds, a large central plaza, a large rectangular platform mound with an associated compound, several large trash mounds, and numerous borrow pits and inhumation and cremation cemeteries.

Prior to the middle of the 14th century CE, with the rise of Los Muertos located several miles to the southeast, the Los Hornos community appears to have spiraled into a precipitous decline. Although greatly reduced in scale and importance, the city continued to be occupied until it was effectively abandoned between 1400 and 1450 CE, as was much of the Lower Salt River basin. Today, much of the Los Hornos village has been destroyed due to modern transportation, residential, and commercial development, or has been excavated. The only surface vestiges of this once significant Hohokam city are the remains of several low trash mounds found in the Old Guadalupe Village Cemetery.

<text>Maya Angelou ( ; born Marguerite Annie Johnson; April 4, 1928 – May 28, 2014) was an American memoirist, poet, and civil rights activist. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou&#x27;s series of seven autobiographies focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.

She became a poet and writer after a string of odd jobs during her young adulthood. These included fry cook, sex worker, nightclub performer, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; cast member, Southern Christian Leadership Conference coordinator, and correspondent in Egypt and Ghana during the decolonization of Africa. Angelou was also an actress, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. In 1982, she was named the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Angelou was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s, she made approximately 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem &quot;On the Pulse of Morning&quot; (1993) at the first inauguration of Bill Clinton, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961.

With the publication of &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for Black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou&#x27;s most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes that include racism, identity, family, and travel.

==Early life==
Marguerite Annie Johnson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (née Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer. For the first three years of her life, her family lived in her maternal grandparents home. Angelou&#x27;s older brother, Bailey Jr., nicknamed Marguerite &quot;Maya&quot;, derived from &quot;My&quot; or &quot;Mya Sister&quot;. When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents&#x27; &quot;calamitous marriage&quot; ended, and their father sent them to Stamps, Arkansas, alone by train, to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson. In &quot;an astonishing exception&quot; to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou&#x27;s grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II, because the general store she owned sold basic and needed commodities and because &quot;she made wise and honest investments&quot;.

Four years later, when Angelou was seven and her brother eight, the children&#x27;s father &quot;came to Stamps without warning&quot; and returned them to their mother&#x27;s care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother&#x27;s boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou&#x27;s uncles. Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing she was to blame for his death; as she stated: &quot;I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone.&quot; According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.

Shortly after Freeman&#x27;s murder, when Angelou was eight and her brother nine, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother. She attended the Lafayette County Training School, in Stamps, a Rosenwald School. Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again, challenging her by saying: &quot;You do not love poetry, not until you speak it.&quot; Flowers introduced her to Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Georgia Douglas Johnson, and James Weldon Johnson, authors who would affect Angelou&#x27;s life and career, as well as Black female artists such as Frances Harper, Anne Spencer, and Jessie Fauset.

When Angelou was 14 and her brother 15, she and her brother moved in once again with their mother, who had since moved to Oakland, California. During World War II, Angelou attended the California Labor School. At the age of 16, she became the first Black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco. She wanted the job badly, admiring the uniforms of the operators, describing the women in uniform as having “their little money-changing belts and with bibs on their caps and well-fitted uniforms” —so much so that her mother referred to it as her &quot;dream job&quot;. Her mother encouraged her to pursue the position, but warned her that she would need to arrive early and work harder than others. In 2014, Angelou received a lifetime achievement award from the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials as part of a session billed &quot;Women Who Move the Nation&quot;.

Three weeks after completing school, at the age of 17, she gave birth to her son, Clyde (who later changed his name to Guy Johnson).

==Career==
=== Adulthood and early career: 1951–1961 ===
In 1951, Angelou married Tosh Angelos, a Greek electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother. She took modern dance classes during this time and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford. Ailey and Angelou formed a dance team, calling themselves &quot;Al and Rita&quot;, and performed modern dance at fraternal Black organizations throughout San Francisco but never became successful. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus, but they returned to San Francisco a year later.

After Angelou&#x27;s marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub The Purple Onion, where she sang and danced to calypso music. Up to that point, she went by the name of &quot;Marguerite Johnson&quot;, or &quot;Rita&quot;, but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at The Purple Onion, she changed her professional name to &quot;Maya Angelou&quot; (her nickname and former married surname). It was a &quot;distinctive name&quot; that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, &quot;Miss Calypso&quot;, which was reissued as a CD in 1996. She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film &quot;Calypso Heat Wave&quot;, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions.

Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized &quot;the legendary&quot; &quot;Cabaret for Freedom&quot; to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC&#x27;s Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and &quot;eminently effective&quot;. Angelou also began her pro-Castro and anti-apartheid activism during this time, joining the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. She had joined the crowd cheering for Fidel Castro when he first entered the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, New York, during the United Nations 15th General Assembly on September 19, 1960.

=== Africa to &quot;Caged Bird&quot;: 1961–1969 ===
In 1961, Angelou performed in Jean Genet&#x27;s play &quot;The Blacks&quot; (playing the part of the Queen), along with Abbey Lincoln, Roscoe Lee Browne, James Earl Jones, Louis Gossett, Godfrey Cambridge, and Cicely Tyson. Also in 1961, she met South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make; they never officially married. She and her son Guy moved with Make to Cairo, where Angelou worked as an associate editor at the weekly English-language newspaper &quot;The Arab Observer&quot;. In 1962, her relationship with Make ended, and she and Guy moved to Accra, Ghana, so he could attend college, but he was seriously injured in an automobile accident. Angelou remained in Accra for his recovery and ended up staying there until 1965. She became an administrator at the University of Ghana and was active in the African American expatriate community. She was a feature editor for &quot;The African Review&quot;, a freelance writer for the &quot;Ghanaian Times&quot;, wrote and broadcast for Radio Ghana, and worked and performed for Ghana&#x27;s National Theatre. She performed in a revival of &quot;The Blacks&quot; in Geneva and Berlin.In Accra, she became close friends with Malcolm X during his visit in the early 1960s. Angelou returned to the U.S. in 1965 to help him build a new civil rights organization, the Organization of Afro-American Unity; he was assassinated shortly afterward. Devastated and adrift, she joined her brother in Hawaii, where she resumed her singing career. She moved back to Los Angeles to focus on her writing career. Working as a market researcher in Watts, Angelou witnessed the riots in the summer of 1965. She acted in and wrote plays and returned to New York in 1967. She met her lifelong friend Rosa Guy and renewed her friendship with James Baldwin, whom she had met in Paris in the 1950s and called &quot;my brother&quot;, during this time. Her friend Jerry Purcell provided Angelou with a stipend to support her writing.

In 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. asked Angelou to organize a march. She agreed, but postponed again, and in what Gillespie calls &quot;a macabre twist of fate&quot;, he was assassinated on her 40th birthday (April 4). Devastated again, she was encouraged out of her depression by her friend James Baldwin. As Gillespie states, &quot;If 1968 was a year of great pain, loss, and sadness, it was also the year when America first witnessed the breadth and depth of Maya Angelou&#x27;s spirit and creative genius&quot;. Despite having almost no experience, she wrote, produced, and narrated &quot;Blacks, Blues, Black!&quot;, a ten-part series of documentaries about the connection between blues music and Black Americans&#x27; African heritage, and what Angelou called the &quot;Africanisms still current in the U.S.&quot; for National Educational Television, the precursor of PBS. Also in 1968, inspired at a dinner party she attended with Baldwin, cartoonist Jules Feiffer, and his wife Judy, and challenged by Random House editor Robert Loomis, she wrote her first autobiography, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, published in 1969. This brought her international recognition and acclaim.

=== Later career ===
Released in 1972, Angelou&#x27;s &quot;Georgia, Georgia&quot;, produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, was the first produced screenplay by a Black woman. She also wrote the film&#x27;s soundtrack, despite having very little additional input in the filming of the movie. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a Welsh carpenter and ex-husband of writer Germaine Greer, in San Francisco in 1973. Over the next ten years, as Gillespie has stated, &quot;She [Angelou] had accomplished more than many artists hope to achieve in a lifetime.&quot; Angelou worked as a composer, writing for singer Roberta Flack, and composing movie scores. She wrote articles, short stories, TV scripts, documentaries, autobiographies, and poetry. She produced plays and was named a visiting professor at several colleges and universities. She was &quot;a reluctant actor&quot;, and was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for her role in Jerome Kilty&#x27;s play &quot;Look Away&quot;. As a theater director, in 1988 she undertook a revival of Errol John&#x27;s play &quot;Moon on a Rainbow Shawl&quot; at the Almeida Theatre in London.
In 1977, Angelou appeared in a supporting role in the television mini-series &quot;Roots&quot;. She was given a multitude of awards during this period, including more than thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world. In the late 1970s, Angelou met Oprah Winfrey when Winfrey was a TV anchor in Baltimore, Maryland; Angelou would later become Winfrey&#x27;s close friend and mentor. In 1981, Angelou and du Feu divorced.

She returned to the southern United States in 1981 because she felt she had to come to terms with her past there and, despite having no bachelor&#x27;s degree, accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where she was one of a few full-time African American professors. From that point on, she considered herself &quot;a teacher who writes&quot;. Angelou taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including philosophy, ethics, theology, science, theater, and writing. &quot;The Winston-Salem Journal &quot;reported that even though she made many friends on campus, &quot;she never quite lived down all of the criticism from people who thought she was more of a celebrity than an intellect ... [and] an overpaid figurehead&quot;. The last course she taught at Wake Forest was in 2011, but she was planning to teach another course in late 2014. Her final speaking engagement at the university was in late 2013. Beginning in the 1990s, Angelou actively participated in the lecture circuit in a customized tour bus, something she continued into her eighties. She also taught at the University of California, the University of Kansas, and the University of Ghana and was recognized as a Rockefeller Foundation Scholar and a Yale University Fellow.

In 1993, Angelou recited her poem &quot;On the Pulse of Morning&quot; at the presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration in 1961. Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal &quot;across racial, economic, and educational boundaries&quot;. The recording of the poem won a Grammy Award. In June 1995, she delivered what Richard Long called her &quot;second &#x27;public&#x27; poem&quot;, entitled &quot;A Brave and Startling Truth&quot;, which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.

Angelou achieved her goal of directing a feature film in 1996, &quot;Down in the Delta&quot;, which featured actors such as Alfre Woodard and Wesley Snipes. Also in 1996, she collaborated with R&amp;B artists Ashford &amp; Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their album &quot;Been Found&quot;. The album was responsible for three of Angelou&#x27;s only &quot;Billboard&quot; chart appearances. In 2000, she created a successful collection of products for Hallmark, including greeting cards and decorative household items. She responded to critics who charged her with being too commercial by stating that &quot;the enterprise was perfectly in keeping with her role as &#x27;the people&#x27;s poet. More than thirty years after Angelou began writing her life story, she completed her sixth autobiography &quot;A Song Flung Up to Heaven&quot;, in 2002.

Angelou campaigned for the Democratic Party in the 2008 presidential primaries, giving her public support to Hillary Clinton. In the run-up to the January Democratic primary in South Carolina, the Clinton campaign ran ads featuring Angelou&#x27;s endorsement. The ads were part of the campaign&#x27;s efforts to rally support in the Black community; but Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary, finishing 29 points ahead of Clinton and taking 80% of the Black vote. When Clinton&#x27;s campaign ended, Angelou put her support behind Obama, who went on to win the presidential election and become the first African American president of the United States. After Obama&#x27;s inauguration, she stated, &quot;We are growing up beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism.&quot;

In late 2010, Angelou donated her personal papers and career memorabilia to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. They consisted of more than 340 boxes of documents that featured her handwritten notes on yellow legal pads for &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, a 1982 telegram from Coretta Scott King, fan mail, and personal and professional correspondence from colleagues such as her editor Robert Loomis. In 2011, Angelou served as a consultant for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C. She spoke out in opposition to a paraphrase of a quotation by King that appeared on the memorial, saying, &quot;The quote makes Dr. Martin Luther King look like an arrogant twit&quot;, and demanded that it be changed. Eventually, the paraphrase was removed.

In 2013, at the age of 85, Angelou published the seventh volume of autobiography in her series, entitled &quot;Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom&quot;, which focuses on her relationship with her mother.

==Personal life==

Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the Mende people of West Africa. In 2008, a DNA test revealed that among all of her African ancestors, 45 percent were from the Congo-Angola region and 55 percent were from West Africa. A 2008 PBS documentary found that Angelou&#x27;s maternal great-grandmother, Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the Civil War, became pregnant by her white former owner, John Savin. Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child. After Savin was indicted for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite the discovery that Savin was the father, a jury found him not guilty. Lee was sent to the Clinton County poorhouse in Missouri with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou&#x27;s grandmother. Angelou described Lee as &quot;that poor little black girl, physically and mentally bruised.&quot;

The details of Angelou&#x27;s life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tended to be inconsistent. Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently, but informally, and &quot;with no time chart in front of her.&quot; For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified the number of times she had been married, &quot;for fear of sounding frivolous.&quot; According to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951, and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade working as a prostitute and madam for lesbians, and describes so in her second autobiography, &quot;Gather Together in My Name&quot;. In a 1995 interview, Angelou said:

Angelou had one son, Guy, whose birth she described in her first autobiography; one grandson, two great-grandchildren, and, according to Gillespie, a large group of friends and extended family. Angelou&#x27;s mother Vivian Baxter died in 1991 and her brother Bailey Johnson Jr., died in 2000 after a series of strokes; both were important figures in her life and her books. In 1981, the mother of her grandson disappeared with him; finding him took four years.

Angelou did not earn a university degree, but according to Gillespie it was Angelou&#x27;s preference to be called &quot;Dr. Angelou&quot; by people outside of her family and close friends. She owned two homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and a &quot;lordly brownstone&quot; in Harlem, which was purchased in 2004 and was full of her &quot;growing library&quot; of books she collected throughout her life, artwork collected over the span of many decades, and well-stocked kitchens. &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Gary Younge reported that in Angelou&#x27;s Harlem home were several African wall hangings and her collection of paintings, including ones of several jazz trumpeters, a watercolor of Rosa Parks, and a Faith Ringgold work entitled &quot;Maya&#x27;s Quilt Of Life&quot;.

According to Gillespie, she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston-Salem; &quot;her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend—from haute cuisine to down-home comfort food&quot;. &quot;The Winston-Salem Journal&quot; stated: &quot;Securing an invitation to one of Angelou&#x27;s Thanksgiving dinners, Christmas tree decorating parties or birthday parties was among the most coveted invitations in town.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describing Angelou&#x27;s residence history in New York City, stated that she regularly hosted elaborate New Year&#x27;s Day parties. She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book &quot;Hallelujah! The Welcome Table&quot;, which featured 73 recipes, many of which she learned from her grandmother and mother, accompanied by 28 vignettes. She followed up in 2010 with her second cookbook, &quot;Great Food, All Day Long: Cook Splendidly, Eat Smart&quot;, which focused on weight loss and portion control.

Beginning with &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, Angelou used the same &quot;writing ritual&quot; for many years. She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;, and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. She would average 10–12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. She went through this process to &quot;enchant&quot; herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, &quot;relive the agony, the anguish, the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;&quot;. She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences such as her rape in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, to &quot;tell the human truth&quot; about her life. She was quoted as saying: &quot;The way I deal with any pain is to admit it – let it come.&quot; Angelou stated that she played cards to get to that place of enchantment and to access her memories more effectively. She said, &quot;It may take an hour to get into it, but once I&#x27;m in it—ha! It&#x27;s so delicious!&quot; She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in &quot;telling the truth&quot;.

In 2009, the gossip website TMZ erroneously reported that Angelou had been hospitalized in Los Angeles when she was alive and well in St. Louis, which resulted in rumors of her death and, according to Angelou, concern among her friends and family worldwide.

==Death==
Angelou died on the morning of May 28, 2014, at age 86. Although Angelou had been in poor health and had canceled recent scheduled appearances, she was working on another book, an autobiography about her experiences with national and world leaders. During her memorial service at Wake Forest University, her son Guy Johnson stated that despite being in constant pain due to her dancing career and respiratory failure, she wrote four books during the last ten years of her life. He said, &quot;She left this mortal plane with no loss of acuity and no loss in comprehension.&quot;

Tributes to Angelou and condolences were paid by artists, entertainers, and world leaders, including President Obama, whose sister was named after Angelou, and Bill Clinton. Harold Augenbraum, from the National Book Foundation, said that Angelou&#x27;s &quot;legacy is one that all writers and readers across the world can admire and aspire to.&quot; The week after Angelou&#x27;s death, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; rose to number 1 on Amazon.com&#x27;s bestseller list.

On May 29, 2014, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, of which Angelou was a member for 30 years, held a public memorial service to honor her. On June 7, a private memorial service was held at Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. The memorial was shown live on local stations in the Winston-Salem/Triad area and streamed live on the university web site with speeches from her son, Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton. On June 15, a memorial was held at Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, where Angelou was a member for many years. Rev. Cecil Williams, Mayor Ed Lee, and former mayor Willie Brown spoke.

== Works ==
Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies. According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou&#x27;s third autobiography &quot;Singin&#x27; and Swingin&#x27; and Gettin&#x27; Merry Like Christmas&quot; marked the first time a well-known African American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life. Her books &quot;stretch over time and place&quot;, from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S., and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In her fifth autobiography, &quot;All God&#x27;s Children Need Traveling Shoes&quot; (1986), Angelou tells about her return to Ghana searching for the past of her tribe. She published her seventh autobiography &quot;Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom&quot; in 2013, at the age of 85. Critics have tended to judge Angelou&#x27;s subsequent autobiographies in light of the first, with &quot;Caged Bird&quot; receiving the highest praise. Angelou wrote five collections of essays, which writer Hilton Als called her &quot;wisdom books&quot; and &quot;homilies strung together with autobiographical texts&quot;. Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, Robert Loomis, an executive editor at Random House; he retired in 2011 and has been called &quot;one of publishing&#x27;s hall of fame editors.&quot; Angelou said regarding Loomis: &quot;We have a relationship that&#x27;s kind of famous among publishers.&quot;

Angelou&#x27;s long and extensive career also included poetry, plays, screenplays for television and film, directing, acting, and public speaking. She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume &quot;Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water &#x27;fore I Diiie&quot; (1971) was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was chosen by U.S. president Bill Clinton to recite her poem &quot;On the Pulse of Morning&quot; during his inauguration in 1993.

Angelou&#x27;s successful acting career included roles in numerous plays, films, and television programs, among them her appearance in the television mini-series &quot;Roots&quot; in 1977. Her screenplay, &quot;Georgia, Georgia&quot; (1972), was the first original script by a Black woman to be produced, and she was the first African American woman to direct a major motion picture, &quot;Down in the Delta&quot;, in 1998.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Influence ===

When &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives. According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, Black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote. Linguist John McWhorter agreed, seeing Angelou&#x27;s works, which he called &quot;tracts&quot;, as &quot;apologetic writing&quot;. He placed Angelou in the tradition of African American literature as a defense of Black culture, which he called &quot;a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period&quot;. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;a work of art that eludes description&quot;, argued that Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies set a precedent for not only other Black women writers, but also African American autobiography as a whole. Als said that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as he put it, &quot;write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense&quot;. Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. It made her &quot;without a doubt, ... America&#x27;s most visible black woman autobiographer&quot;, and &quot;a major autobiographical voice of the time&quot;. As writer Gary Younge said, &quot;Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou&#x27;s life literally is her work.&quot;

Als said that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; helped increase Black feminist writings in the 1970s, less through its originality than &quot;its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist&quot;, or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Als also claimed that Angelou&#x27;s writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, have freed other female writers to &quot;open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world&quot;. Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton stated that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; was &quot;perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing&quot; autobiography written by an African American woman in its era. Angelou&#x27;s poetry has influenced the modern hip-hop music community, including artists such as Kanye West, Common, Tupac Shakur, and Nicki Minaj.

=== Critical reception ===
Reviewer Elsie B. Washington called Angelou &quot;the black woman&#x27;s poet laureate&quot;. Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300–600% the week after Angelou&#x27;s recitation. Random House, which published the poem later that year, had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand. They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1,200% increase. Angelou famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, &quot;I agree with Balzac and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, &#x27;I write for money&#x27;.&quot; Younge, speaking after the publication of Angelou&#x27;s third book of essays, &quot;Letter to My Daughter&quot; (2008), has said, &quot;For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art—issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry, song and conversation.&quot;

Angelou&#x27;s books, especially &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, have been criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves. According to the National Coalition Against Censorship, some parents and some schools have objected to &quot;Caged Bird&quot;″s depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence. Some have been critical of the book&#x27;s sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent depictions of religion. &quot;Caged Bird&quot; appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 and sixth on the ALA&#x27;s 2000–2009 list.

=== Awards and honors ===
Angelou was honored by universities, literary organizations, government agencies, and special interest groups. Her honors included a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her book of poetry, &quot;Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water &#x27;fore I Diiie,&quot; a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1973 play &quot;Look Away&quot;, and three Grammys for her spoken-word albums. She served on two presidential committees, and was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1994, the National Medal of Arts in 2000, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. Angelou was awarded more than fifty honorary degrees. In 2021, the United States Mint announced that Angelou would be among the first women depicted on the reverse of the quarter as a part of the American Women quarters series. The coins were released in January 2022. She is the first Black woman to be depicted on a quarter.

=== Uses in education ===
Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches in teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has trained teachers how to &quot;talk about race&quot; in their classrooms with &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; and &quot;Gather Together in My Name&quot;. According to Glazier, Angelou&#x27;s use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described. Angelou&#x27;s depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to either explore their feelings about race and their own &quot;privileged status&quot;, or to avoid the discussion as a means of keeping their privilege. Glazier found that critics have focused on the way Angelou fits within the genre of African American autobiography and on her literary techniques, but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with &quot;surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography&quot;.

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book &quot;Stories of Resilience in Childhood&quot;, analyzed the events in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; to illustrate resiliency in children. He argued that Angelou&#x27;s book has provided a &quot;useful framework&quot; for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using &quot;Caged Bird&quot; to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He found &quot;Caged Bird&quot; a &quot;highly effective&quot; tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.

== Poetry ==
Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies, but she was also a prolific and successful poet. She was called &quot;the black woman&#x27;s poet laureate&quot;, and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans. Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;. According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou&#x27;s sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the &quot;liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon&quot;.

Many critics consider Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies more important than her poetry. Although all her books have been bestsellers, her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied. Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them, and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry. Angelou&#x27;s lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou&#x27;s popular success, and to critics&#x27; preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Zofia Burr has countered Angelou&#x27;s critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou&#x27;s larger purposes in her writing: &quot;to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional&quot;.

In the view of Harold Bloom, Professor of Literature (Yale University and New York University) and literary critic:

== Style and genre in autobiographies ==
Angelou&#x27;s use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of autobiographical fiction. Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies conform to the genre&#x27;s standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agrees, stating that Angelou tended to &quot;diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth&quot;, which parallels the conventions of much of African American autobiography written during the abolitionist period of U.S. history, when as both Lupton and African American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection. Scholar Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African American autobiography but claims that Angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.
According to African American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou&#x27;s editor Robert Loomis was able to dare her into writing &quot;Caged Bird&quot; by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered &quot;high art&quot;. Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of &quot;speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning &#x27;we&#x27;&quot;. Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou&#x27;s books &quot;tracts&quot; that defend African American culture and fight negative stereotypes. According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of Black culture. McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies &quot;as a kind of stand-in figure for the Black American in Troubled Times&quot;. McWhorter views Angelou&#x27;s works as dated but recognizes that &quot;she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves&quot;. Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou&#x27;s works to the writings of Frederick Douglass, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe Black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.

According to scholar Sondra O&#x27;Neale, Angelou&#x27;s poetry can be placed within the African American oral tradition, and her prose &quot;follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms&quot;. O&#x27;Neale states that Angelou avoided using a &quot;monolithic Black language&quot;, and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O&#x27;Neale calls a &quot;more expected ghetto expressiveness&quot;. McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience. As McWhorter states, &quot;I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is&quot;. McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou&#x27;s books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is &quot;cleaned up&quot; for her readers. Guy, for example, represents the young Black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou&#x27;s text, is intended to prove that Blacks can use standard English competently.

McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou&#x27;s style was the &quot;apologetic&quot; nature of her writing. When Angelou wrote &quot;Caged Bird&quot; at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was &quot;organic unity&quot;, and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion. The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. Instead, they were placed to emphasize the themes of her books, which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that &quot;Angelou&#x27;s poetry and prose are similar&quot;. They both rely on her &quot;direct voice&quot;, which alternates steady rhythms with syncopated patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird). According to Hagen, Angelou&#x27;s works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African American community. For example, she referenced more than 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry. In addition, she used the elements of blues music, including the act of testimony when speaking of one&#x27;s life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.

<text>Superior (; ) is a city in and the county seat of Douglas County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 26,751 at the 2020 census. Located at the western end of Lake Superior in northwestern Wisconsin, the city lies at the junction of U.S. Route 2 and U.S. Route 53 immediately north of, and adjacent to, both the Village of Superior and the Town of Superior.

Bordered by Saint Louis, Superior, and Allouez bays, the city is framed by two rivers: the Nemadji and the Saint Louis. Superior and the neighboring city across the bay, Duluth, Minnesota, form a single metropolitan area called the Twin Ports. They share a harbor that is one of the most important ports on the Great Lakes. Both cities feature museum ships ( in Duluth and in Superior), devoted to the local maritime heritage. Superior was the final port of call for before her sinking on November 10, 1975. It is an industrial city, with ship harbors along two sides, several large rail yards, an oil refinery, and shipyard.

==History==
The first log cabin in Superior was erected in September 1853 on the banks of the Nemadji River, at the same time that ground was broken for construction of the locks and ship canal at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This was intended to allow ships to bypass the rapids at that site. Superior was incorporated as a city on March 25, 1889. Around the same time Superior became the seat of newly formed Douglas County. Immediately there was eagerness for a railroad from Lake Superior to the Pacific Coast, and investment flowed in, but then the Panic of 1857 hit, investment slowed, and the population of the new city collapsed from 2500 to 500.

25 years later the Northern Pacific Railway and other rail lines finally arrived, fulfilling the dream of a rail and water highway from coast to coast. In 1883 General John H. Hammond formed the Land and River Improvement Company, which developed much of West Superior, including the West Superior Iron and Steel plant. Numerous grain, coal and lumber businesses formed in the same period.

In the Boom Period from 1888 to 1892, Land and River Improvement and others built architect-designed business blocks on Tower Avenue, seeing Superior as the &quot;new Chicago&quot;. Many of the investors were from out East, so the buildings received names like the New Jersey Block and the Maryland Block. By 1892, population was 34,000. Then the Panic of 1893 hit, and development slowed again.


==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Most of Superior is level with a gradual slope toward Lake Superior.

<doc id="288145" wikidata="Q207917" url="?curid=288145" title="Mount Nemrut">
<text>Mount Nemrut or Nemrud (; ; ; Greek: Όρος Νεμρούτ) is a mountain in southeastern Turkey, notable for the summit where a number of large statues are erected around what is assumed to be a royal tomb from the 1st century BC. It is one of the highest peaks in the east of the Taurus Mountains.

It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.

==Location and description==

The mountain lies north of Kahta, near Adıyaman. In 62 BC, King Antiochus I of Commagene built on the mountain top a tomb-sanctuary flanked by huge statues of himself, two lions, two eagles, and various composite Greek and Iranian gods, such as Heracles-Artagnes-Ares, Zeus-Oromasdes, and Apollo-Mithras-Helios-Hermes. When constructing this pantheon, Antiochus drew heavily from Parthian and Armenian traditions in order to reinvigorate the religion of his ancestral dynasty. The statues were once seated, with names of each god inscribed on them. At some point the heads of the statues were removed from their bodies, and they are now scattered throughout the site.

The pattern of damage to the heads (notably to noses) suggests that they were deliberately damaged as a result of iconoclasm. The statues have not been restored to their original places. The site also preserves stone slabs with bas-relief figures that are thought to have formed a large frieze. These slabs, or stelae, depict Antiochus&#x27; Greek and Persian ancestors.

The same statues and ancestors found throughout the site can also be found on the tumulus at the site, which is tall and in diameter. It is possible that the tumulus of loose rock was devised to protect a tomb from robbers, since any excavation would quickly fill in. The statues appear to have Greek-style faces, but Persian clothing and hair-styling.
The western terrace contains a large slab with a lion, showing an arrangement of stars and the planets Jupiter, Mercury, and Mars. The composition was taken to be a chart of the sky on 7 July 62 BCE. This may be an indication of when construction began on this monument. The eastern portion is well preserved, being composed of several layers of rock, and a path following the base of the mountain is evidence of a walled passageway linking the eastern and western terraces. Possible uses for this site are thought to have included religious ceremonies, owing to the astronomical and religious nature of the monument.

The arrangement of such statues is known by the term hierothesion. Similar arrangements have been found at Arsameia on Nymphaios at the hierothesion of Antiochus&#x27; father, Mithridates I Callinicus.

== Ancient history ==

The religious sanctuary established in Mount Nemrut was part of Antiochus&#x27; political program to revive the Persian traditions of Commagene. In order to do so, he merged and adjusted the political and religious traditions of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Armenia.

Following the practice of the Mithridatic rulers of Pontus, Antiochus stressed his descent from the Achaemenids and Seleucids, and also claimed the royal legacy of Armenia. One of the essential parts of this identity was the then newly established Greco-Iranian pantheon, which was worshipped at specific sanctuaries in Commagene.

==Modern history==

The site was excavated in 1881 by , a German engineer assessing transport routes for the Ottomans. After her first visit in 1947, Theresa Goell dedicated her life to the site, starting campaigns in 1954. Subsequent excavations have failed to reveal the tomb of Antiochus. This is nevertheless still believed to be the site of his burial. The statues, all of them &quot;beheaded&quot;, have not been restored to their original condition.

==World Heritage Site==
In 1987, Mount Nemrut was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Tourists typically visit Nemrut during April through October. The nearby town of Adıyaman is a popular place for car and bus trips to the site, and one can also travel from there by helicopter. There are also overnight tours running out of Malatya or Kahta.

<doc id="288150" wikidata="Q689985" url="?curid=288150" title="Lipoma">
<text>A lipoma is a benign tumor made of fat tissue. They are generally soft to the touch, movable, and painless. They usually occur just under the skin, but occasionally may be deeper. Most are less than in size. Common locations include upper back, shoulders, and abdomen. It is possible to have several lipomas.
The cause is generally unclear. Risk factors include family history, obesity, and lack of exercise. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam. Occasionally medical imaging or tissue biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment is typically by observation or surgical removal. Rarely, the condition may recur following removal, but this can generally be managed with repeat surgery. They are not generally associated with a future risk of cancer.
Lipomas have a prevalence of roughly 2 out of every 100 people. Lipomas typically occur in adults between 40 and 60 years of age. Males are more often affected than females. They are the most common noncancerous soft-tissue tumor. The first use of the term &quot;lipoma&quot; to describe these tumors was in 1709.

==Etymology==
&quot;Fatty tumor&quot; (plural &quot;lipomata&quot;), 1830, medical Latin, from Greek &quot;lipos&quot; &quot;fat&quot; (n.), from PIE root &quot;*leip-&quot; &quot;to stick, adhere&quot;, also used to form words for &quot;fat&quot;, + &quot;-oma&quot;.

== Types ==
The many subtypes of lipomas include:
* Adenolipomas are lipomas associated with eccrine sweat glands.
* Angiolipoleiomyomas are acquired, solitary, asymptomatic nodules, characterized histologically by well-circumscribed subcutaneous tumors composed of smooth muscle cells, blood vessels, connective tissue, and fat.
* Angiolipomas are painful subcutaneous nodules having all other features of a typical lipoma.
* Cerebellar pontine angle and internal auditory canal lipomas
* Chondroid lipomas are deep-seated, firm, yellow tumors that characteristically occur on the legs of women.
* Corpus callosum lipoma is a rare congenital brain condition that may or may not present with symptoms. This occurs in the corpus callosum, also known as the calossal commissure, which is a wide, flat bundle of neural fibers beneath the cortex in the human brain.
* Hibernomas are lipomas of brown fat.
* Intradermal spindle cell lipomas are distinct in that they most commonly affect women and have a wide distribution, occurring with relatively equal frequency on the head and neck, trunk, and upper and lower extremities.
* A &quot;fibrolipoma&quot; is a lipoma with focal areas of large amounts of fibrous tissue. A &quot;sclerotic lipoma&quot; is a predominantly fibrous lesion with focal areas of fat.
** Neural fibrolipomas are overgrowths of fibro-fatty tissue along a nerve trunk, which often leads to nerve compression.
* Pleomorphic lipomas, like spindle-cell lipomas, occur for the most part on the backs and necks of elderly men and are characterized by floret giant cells with overlapping nuclei.
* Spindle-cell lipomas are asymptomatic, slow-growing, subcutaneous tumors that have a predilection for the posterior back, neck, and shoulders of older men.
* Superficial subcutaneous lipomas, the most common type of lipoma, lie just below the surface of the skin. Most occur on the trunk, thigh, and forearm, although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.

== Causes ==
The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary, although hereditary conditions such as familial multiple lipomatosis might include lipoma development. Genetic studies in mice have shown a correlation between the &quot;HMG I-C&quot; gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between &quot;HMG I-C&quot; and mesenchymal tumors.

Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called a &quot;post-traumatic lipoma&quot;. However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial.

=== Other conditions ===
Lipomatosis is believed to be a hereditary condition in which multiple lipomas are present on the body.

Adiposis dolorosa (Dercum disease) is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. Early studies mentioned prevalence in obese postmenopausal women. However, current literature demonstrates that Dercum disease is present in more women than men of all body types; the average age for diagnosis is 35 years.

Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, but nonalcoholic males and females can also be affected.

== Diagnosis ==
A physical exam is typically the easiest way to diagnose it. Rarely, a tissue biopsy or imaging may be required. The imaging modality of choice is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because it has superior sensitivity of distinguishing it from liposarcoma as well as mapping the surrounding anatomy.

== Treatment ==
Usually, treatment of lipomas is not necessary, unless they become painful or restrict movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons if they grow very large or for histopathology to verify that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a liposarcoma. This last point can be important, as the characteristics of a tumor are not known until after it is removed and medically examined.

Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. The removal can often be done under local anesthetic and takes less than 30 minutes. This cures the great majority of cases, with about 1–2% of lipomas recurring after excision. Liposuction is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small connective tissue component. Liposuction typically results in less scarring; however, with large lipomas, it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth.

New methods under development are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One is removal by injecting compounds that trigger lipolysis, such as steroids or phosphatidylcholine. Other potential methods based on tissue-targeted heating include cauterization, electrosurgery, and harmonic scalpel.

===Post surgery===
Patients who have a lipoma removed are usually able to return home the same day, without any need for hospitalization. Some patients may have pain, swelling, or bruising where the lipoma was removed. These symptoms usually subside after a few days.


== Prognosis ==
Lipomas are rarely life-threatening, and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous; for example, lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding, ulceration, and painful obstructions (so-called &quot;malignant by location&quot;, despite being a benign growth histologically). Malignant transformation of lipomas into liposarcomas is very rare, and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions. A few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas, but it is possible that these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle malignant characteristics were missed when the tumor was first examined. Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible.

The presence of multiple lipomas, lipomatosis, is more commonly encountered in men. Some superficial lipomas can extend into deep fascia and may complicate excision. Liposarcoma is found in 1% of lipomas and is more likely to occur in lesions of the lower extremities, shoulders, and retroperitoneal areas. Other risk factors for liposarcoma include large size (&gt;5 cm), associated with calcification, rapid growth, and/or invasion into nearby structures or through fascia into muscle tissue.

== Epidemiology ==
Around 2% of the general population has a lipoma. These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease Bannayan-Zonana syndrome.

Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1–3 cm, but in rare cases they can grow over several years into &quot;giant lipomas&quot; that are 10–20 cm across and weigh up to 4–5 kg.

== Other animals ==
Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers, and Miniature Schnauzers. Overweight female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors, and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. They are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, and rarely in cats and pigs. However, a pedunculated lipoma can cause entrapment and torsion of the intestine in horses, causing necrosis, colic, and possibly death. The intestine becomes twisted around the stalk of the lipoma and loses blood supply.

<text>Victor Lemonte Wooten (born September 11, 1964) is an American bassist, songwriter, and record producer. He has been the bassist for Béla Fleck and the Flecktones since the group&#x27;s formation in 1988 and a member of the band SMV with two other bassists, Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller. From 2017 to 2019 he recorded as the bassist for the metal band Nitro.

He owns Vix Records, which releases his albums. He wrote the novel &quot;The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music&quot;. He later released the book&#x27;s sequel, &quot;The Spirit of Music: The Lesson Continues,&quot; on February 2, 2021.

Wooten is the recipient of five Grammy Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;official bio/Wooten&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Bass Player of the Year award from &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine three times and is the first person to win the award more than once. In 2011, he was ranked No. 10 in the Top 10 Bassists of All Time by readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

In 2018–2019 Wooten was diagnosed with a rare neurological condition called focal dystonia in his hands and upper body, which had been limiting his ability to play in previous years, but has since abated somewhat.

==Early life and career==

Born to Dorothy and Elijah Wooten, Victor is the youngest of the five Wooten brothers; Regi, Roy, Rudy, and Joseph Wooten are all musicians. Regi began to teach Victor to play bass when he was two, and by the age of six, he was performing with his brothers in their family band, The Wooten Brothers Band. As a United States Air Force family, they moved often when Wooten was young. The family settled in Newport News, Virginia, in 1972. Wooten graduated from Denbigh High School in 1982. While in high school, he and his brothers played in the country music venue at Busch Gardens theme park in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1987, he traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to visit friends that he made at the theme park. One of them was a studio engineer who introduced him to Béla Fleck, with whom he has often collaborated.

In 2000, Wooten created a music program called Bass/Nature camp that was expanded into Victor Wooten&#x27;s Center for Music and Nature and includes all instruments. His camps are at Wooten Woods, a 147-acre retreat in Only, Tennessee, near Nashville. Wooten co-leads the &quot;Victor Wooten/Berklee Summer Bass Workshop&quot; at Berklee College of Music in Boston. At Berklee and his own camps, he collaborates with Berklee Bass Department chair, Steve Bailey. The two bassists have been teaching together since the early 1990s.

He was featured on the May/June 2014 cover of &quot;Making Music Magazine&quot; to discuss the camps.

==Instruments==

Wooten is most often seen playing Fodera basses, of which he has a signature model. His most famous Fodera, a 1983 Monarch Deluxe he refers to as &quot;number 1,&quot; sports a Kahler Tremolo System model 2400 bridge. Fodera&#x27;s &quot;Yin Yang&quot; basses (co-designed by and created for Wooten) incorporates the Yin Yang symbol—which Wooten uses in various media—as a focal point of the top&#x27;s design and construction. The symbol is created from two pieces of naturally finished wood (Ebony and Holly, for example), fitted together to create the Yin-Yang pattern.

As well as playing electric bass (both fretted and fretless) and the double bass, he played cello in high school. He still plays cello occasionally with the Flecktones as well as in the 2012 Sword and Stone/Words and Tones tour.

<doc id="288152" wikidata="Q737001" url="?curid=288152" title="Great Hymn to the Aten">
<text>The Great Hymn to the Aten is the longest of a number of hymn-poems written to the sun-disk deity Aten. Composed in the middle of the 14th century BC, it is varyingly attributed to the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten or his courtiers, depending on the version, who radically changed traditional forms of Egyptian religion by replacing them with Atenism. The hymn bears a notable resemblance to the biblical Psalm 104.

==Background==
The hymn-poem provides a glimpse of the religious artistry of the Amarna period expressed in multiple forms encompassing literature, new temples, and in the building of a whole new city at the site of present-day Amarna as the capital of Egypt. Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson said that &quot;It has been called &#x27;one of the most significant and splendid pieces of poetry to survive from the pre-Homeric world. Egyptologist John Darnell asserts that the hymn was sung.

Various courtiers&#x27; rock tombs at Amarna (ancient Akhet-Aten, the city Akhenaten founded) have similar prayers or hymns to the deity Aten or to the Aten and Akhenaten jointly. One of these, found in almost identical form in five tombs, is known as &quot;The Short Hymn to the Aten&quot;. The long version discussed in this article was found in the tomb of the courtier (and later Pharaoh) Ay.

The 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten forbade the worship of other gods, a radical departure from the centuries of Egyptian religious practice. Akhenaton&#x27;s religious reforms (later regarded heretical and reversed under his successor Pharaoh Tutankhamun) have been described by some scholars as monotheistic, though others consider them to be henotheistic.

==Excerpts of the hymn-poem to Aten==
These particular excerpts are not attributed to Aten himself; this long version was found in the tomb of the courtier Ay.

From the middle of the text:
From the last part of the text, translated by Miriam Lichtheim:
==Comparison to Psalm 104==
In his 1958 book &quot;Reflections on the Psalms&quot;, C.S. Lewis compared Akhnaten&#x27;s Hymn to the Psalms of the Judaeo-Christian canon. James Henry Breasted noted the similarity to Psalm 104, which he believed was inspired by the Hymn. Arthur Weigall compared the two texts side by side and commented that &quot;In face of this remarkable similarity one can hardly doubt that there is a direct connection between the two compositions; and it becomes necessary to ask whether both Akhnaton&#x27;s hymn and this Hebrew psalm were derived from a common Syrian source, or whether Psalm CIV. is derived from this Pharaoh&#x27;s original poem. Both views are admissible.&quot; Lichtheim, however, said that the resemblances are &quot;more likely to be the result of the generic similarity between Egyptian hymns and biblical psalms. A specific literary interdependence is not probable.&quot; Biblical scholar Mark S. Smith has commented that &quot;Despite enduring support for the comparison of the two texts, enthusiasm for even indirect influence has been tempered in recent decades. In some quarters, the argument for any form of influence is simply rejected outright. Still some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, argue for Egyptian influence on both the Amarna correspondence (especially in EA 147) and on Psalm 104.&quot;

==Analysis==
Analyses of the poem are divided between those considering it as a work of literature, and those considering its political and socio-religious intentions.

James Henry Breasted considered Akhenaten to be the first monotheist and scientist in history. In 1899, Flinders Petrie wrote:
If this were a new religion, invented to satisfy our modern scientific conceptions, we could not find a flaw in the correctness of this view of the energy of the solar system. How much Akhenaten understood, we cannot say, but he certainly bounded forward in his views and symbolism to a position which we cannot logically improve upon at the present day. Not a rag of superstition or of falsity can be found clinging to this new worship evolved out of the old Aton of Heliopolis, the sole Lord of the universe.
Miriam Lichtheim describes the hymn as &quot;a beautiful statement of the doctrine of the One God.&quot;

In 1913, Henry Hall contended that the pharaoh was the &quot;first example of the scientific mind.&quot;

Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat discusses the terminology used to describe these texts, describing them as formal poems or royal eulogies. He views the word &#x27;hymn&#x27; as suggesting &quot;outpourings of emotion&quot; while he sees them as &quot;eulogies, formal and rhetorical statements of praise&quot; honoring Aten and the royal couple. He credits James Henry Breasted with the popularisation of them as hymns saying that Breasted saw them as &quot;a gospel of the beauty and beneficence of the natural order, a recognition of the message of nature to the soul of man&quot; (quote from Breasted).

Montserrat argues that all the versions of the hymns focus on the king and suggests that the specific innovation is to redefine the relationship of god and king in a way that benefited Akhenaten, quoting the statement of Egyptologist John Baines that &quot;Amarna religion was a religion of god and king, or even of king first and then god.&quot;

Donald B. Redford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings for thousands of years before Akhenaten&#x27;s time had claimed the same relationship and priestly role. However Akhenaten&#x27;s case may be different through the emphasis placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as &quot;thy son who came forth from thy limbs&quot;, &quot;thy child&quot;, &quot;the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc&quot;, and &quot;thine only son that came forth from thy body&quot;. The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of &quot;his father&quot;, and in return his father listens to his son&#x27;s prayers. He is his father&#x27;s image on earth and as Akhenaten is king on earth his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Since only he knew his father&#x27;s mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.

Redford concluded:
Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a Christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away one by one as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development—one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh&#x27;s death.

==Adaptations==
* The &quot;Hymn to the Aten&quot; was set to music by Philip Glass in his 1984 opera &quot;Akhnaten&quot;.

The lyrics and meter of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1964 song &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot; are remarkably similar to the first six stanzas of the &quot;Great Hymn to the Aten&quot;.

<doc id="288153" wikidata="Q149552" url="?curid=288153" title="The Stand">
<text>The Stand is a post-apocalyptic dark fantasy novel written by American author Stephen King and first published in 1978 by Doubleday. The plot centers on a deadly pandemic of weaponized influenza and its aftermath, in which some of the few surviving humans gather into factions that are each led by a personification of either good or evil and seem fated to clash with each other. King started writing the story in February 1975, seeking to create an epic in the spirit of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The book was difficult for him to write because of the large number of characters and storylines. The novel marks the first appearance of Randall Flagg, King&#x27;s recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back several times in his later writings.

In 1990, &quot;The Stand&quot; was reprinted as The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition. King restored over 400 pages of text that had been removed from his original manuscript, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel&#x27;s setting 10 years forward from 1980 to 1990, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. &quot;The Complete and Uncut Edition&quot; of &quot;The Stand&quot; is Stephen King&#x27;s longest stand-alone work at 1,152 pages, surpassing &quot;It&quot;, a novel of 1,138 pages. The book became a #1 bestseller and sold 4.5 million copies.

&quot;The Stand&quot; was highly acclaimed by critics and is considered one of King&#x27;s best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, the Modern Library, Amazon and the BBC. A television miniseries of the same name based on the novel was broadcast on ABC in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, Marvel Comics published a series of comics written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and illustrated by Mike Perkins. Another miniseries debuted on CBS All Access in December 2020, and finished airing in February 2021.

==Plot==
An extremely contagious and lethal strain of influenza, resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a biological weapon within a secret Department of Defense installation in the Mojave Desert, and is accidentally released. The book&#x27;s extended edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. All of those involved at the scene -- the gas station owner and his visitors, plus the ambulance attendants -- are exposed to the virus. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a traffic cop, and the virus rapidly spreads from there.

The United States Army attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain – the virus, christened by journalists as the &quot;superflu&quot; or &quot;Captain Trips&quot;, spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global pandemic of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world&#x27;s population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and martial law to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.

Stuart Redman, one of the people present at the gas station when Campion crashes his car, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in specialized centers at Atlanta, Georgia, then Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the virus disables the Stovington center&#x27;s staff, and he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman and his Irish Setter Kojak, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother&#x27;s death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold&#x27;s disappointment and resentment.

The group share a common dream in which they see a centenarian woman living in Hemingford Home, Nebraska. The woman, Abagail Freemantle – better known as &quot;Mother Abagail&quot; – becomes the group&#x27;s spiritual leader. She brings the group to Boulder, Colorado, to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a deaf-mute deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, intellectually disabled man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the &quot;Free Zone&quot;, organize funeral brigades and restore electricity.

Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Randall Flagg, the dark man, possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which undesirables are crucified. Flagg rescues spree killer Lloyd Henreid from prison and makes him his lieutenant. A pyromaniac nicknamed &quot;The Trashcan Man&quot;, after destroying oil tanks in Gary, Indiana and meeting a power-hungry madman named &quot;The Kid&quot;, joins Flagg&#x27;s group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder.

Mother Abagail, believing she has been too prideful watching the Zone grow in size, goes into self-imposed exile. During her absence, the Free Zone&#x27;s leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg&#x27;s territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, including Nick, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail&#x27;s return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abagail reports God&#x27;s will – Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.

As Harold and Nadine flee, Flagg causes Harold&#x27;s motorcycle to crash and he falls over the edge of a cliff, severely breaking his leg. As his leg turns gangrenous, he realizes the harm he has done, writes an apologetic note and commits suicide. Nadine leaves Harold for dead and meets Flagg in the desert, where he rapes and impregnates her while revealing his true demonic form, an experience that leaves her semi-catatonic. The Trashcan Man has a psychotic episode and destroys Flagg&#x27;s air force before Flagg can destroy Boulder. He then leaves Las Vegas to atone by finding a more powerful weapon for Flagg. When Tom&#x27;s fleeting presence in Las Vegas as the sole surviving spy belatedly comes to light, Nadine takes advantage of Flagg&#x27;s unsettled state to goad him into killing her and her unborn child.

Stuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. Leaving Kojak with Stu, the remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg&#x27;s army. Lloyd kills Glen for refusing to grovel before Flagg, who gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a nuclear warhead. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand — &quot;the Hand of God&quot; — which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg&#x27;s followers, along with Larry and Ralph.

Tom finds Stu near death, but a verbal apparition of Nick leading to a supply of antibiotics saves his life. After nursing him back to health and helping his leg heal, the two travel back to Boulder, where Frannie has given birth to her son after a caesarean section. The baby, named Peter after Frannie&#x27;s late father, manages to fight off the superflu. Four months later, Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to Ogunquit as society is slowly reestablished. The extended edition includes an epilogue in which Flagg wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength and calling himself Russell Faraday, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.

==Characters==
== Background ==
In &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, King writes about the origins of &quot;The Stand&quot; at some length. One source was Patty Hearst&#x27;s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because &quot;it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions&quot;. The author also mentions George R. Stewart&#x27;s novel &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:
With my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, by George R. Stewart.

(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote—just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.
&quot;The Stand&quot; was also planned by King as an epic story akin to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in a contemporary American setting:

For a long time—ten years, at least—I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, only with an American setting. I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that killed a bunch of sheep (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, &#x27;If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was Salt Lake City.&#x27; This incident later served as the basis of a movie called &quot;Rage&quot;, starring George C. Scott, but before it was released, I was deep into &quot;The Stand&quot;, finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named Randall Flagg. The land of Mordor (&#x27;where the shadows lie,&#x27; according to Tolkien) was played by Las Vegas.

While writing &quot;The Stand&quot;, King nearly stopped because of writer&#x27;s block. Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing out of dissatisfaction with the heroes&#x27; focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this. According to King, Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s 1976 song &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; also served as a source of inspiration for the novel.

== Publication history ==

The novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985.
In 1990, an unabridged edition of &quot;The Stand&quot; was published, billed as &quot;The Complete and Uncut Edition&quot;. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book&#x27;s size would make it too expensive for the market to bear. 

As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deletions (as selected by King) and updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King and illustrations by Bernie Wrightson, which were later released as a portfolio. Doubleday published a deluxe edition of &quot;The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition&quot;, limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies. This edition, known as the &quot;Coffin Box&quot; edition due to the book being housed in a wooden case, was signed by King and Wrightson.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Stand&quot; received critical acclaim: it was nominated for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1979, and was adapted into both a television miniseries for ABC and a graphic novel published by Marvel Comics. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 53 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll.

==Adaptations==

=== Television ===
A film adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot; was in development hell for over 10 years. During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with George A. Romero directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. In the 1990 Complete and Uncut edition of the book, King admitted he had in mind a few fan castings for his characters, those being Robert Duvall as Randall Flagg and Marshall Crenshaw as Larry Underwood. Writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel&#x27;s length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not &quot;want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.&quot; Eventually King allowed screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg, who was a fan of &quot;The Stand&quot;, to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg&#x27;s script was for an approximately three hour film which King felt was true to the novel. After the script was written, Warner Bros. backed out of the project. ABC eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make &quot;The Stand&quot; into an eight-hour miniseries. King wrote a new screenplay, omitting some parts for television broadcast. The miniseries, directed by Mick Garris, was broadcast in 1994.

Between 2011 and 2016, Warner Bros. Pictures and CBS Films were developing a feature-length film adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;. In August 2011, director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves, known for their collaboration on the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, were hired to write and direct a multi-movie version of &quot;The Stand&quot;, but left the project in October 2011, as Yates felt it would work better as a miniseries. Both Ben Affleck and Scott Cooper dropped out over creative differences with the studio. On February 25, 2014, Josh Boone was hired to write and direct the adaptation. He later revealed that he wanted Christian Bale to play Randall Flagg and Matthew McConaughey for the role of Stu Redman. 

By September 10, 2014, the script had been completed and pre-production was underway. In November, Boone planned to split his adaptation into four full-length feature films in an effort to remain true to the breadth of King&#x27;s sprawling novel. In June 2015, Warner Bros. proposed an eight-part Showtime miniseries to set up the story, which would culminate in Josh Boone&#x27;s film. In February 2016, &quot;The Stand&quot; project was put on hold and the rights reverted to CBS Films.

In September 2017, King talked of doing an extended TV series on Showtime or CBS All Access. In January 2019, a 10-hour limited series was ordered by CBS Television Studios to be broadcast on CBS All Access. Alexander Skarsgard, James Marsden, Amber Heard, Whoopi Goldberg, Greg Kinnear, Odessa Young, and Henry Zaga were all in consideration for the roles of Randall Flagg, Stu Redman, Nadine Cross, Mother Abagail, Glen Bateman, Frannie Goldsmith, and Nick Andros, respectively. The production was filmed in and near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from September 2019 to March 2020; filming was completed a few days before it would have been shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The production features Stephen King&#x27;s son Owen King as a producer and writer, and a new ending written by Stephen King. The miniseries was first broadcast in December 2020, to mixed reviews.

===Comics===

Marvel Comics adapted &quot;The Stand&quot; into a series of six five-issue comic book miniseries. The series was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and illustrated by Mike Perkins. Colorist Laura Martin, letterer Chris Eliopoulos, and cover artist Lee Bermejo were also on the staff. The first issue of &quot;The Stand: Captain Trips&quot; was released on September 10, 2008.

===Music===
The novel is cited as an inspiration for Abba&#x27;s song &quot;The Piper&quot; on their 1980 album &quot;Super Trouper&quot;. 

Metallica derived the title for their second album, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, from a quote in &quot;The Stand&quot;. in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric chair.

The Alarm had a song on the 1984 album &quot;Declaration&quot; entitled &quot;The Stand (Prophecy)&quot; as an homage to the book. The song contained lyrics directly related to the book, such as &quot;I met the walking dude, religious, with his worn out cowboy boots&quot;, and &quot;Hey Trashcan, where you going boy?&quot; The main chorus of the song was &quot;Come on down and meet your maker, come on down and make the stand.&quot; 

In 1987, Anthrax released their third studio album, &quot;Among the Living&quot;, which is based on the novel. Lyrics which include &quot;I&#x27;m the walking dude&quot;, are reference to novel antagonist Randall Flagg.

<text>A Deadhead or Dead head is a fan of the American rock band the Grateful Dead. The Deadhead subculture originated in the 1970s, when a number of fans began traveling to see the Grateful Dead in as many shows or festival venues as they could. As more people began attending live performances and festivals, a community developed. The Deadhead community has since gone on to create slang and idioms unique to them.

Unlike other popular acts in music, the Grateful Dead are well known for the use of improvisation in their performances making each show unique. This, coupled with the band&#x27;s permissive attitude on taping performances, has created a plethora of historical material. Such recordings of previous performances are shared widely among the Deadhead community.

Much Deadhead-related historical material received or collected by the band over the years is housed in the Grateful Dead Archive of University of California, Santa Cruz. Archive founding curator Nicholas Meriwether, who has also written extensively about the culture and its impact on society, predicted, &quot;The Grateful Dead archive is going to end up being a critical way for us to approach and understand the 1960s and the counterculture of the era... It&#x27;s also going to tell us a lot about the growth and development of modern rock theater, and it&#x27;s helping us understand fan culture.&quot; Over the course of their thirty-year career, the Grateful Dead performed over 2,200 live shows.

==Overview==
The eclectic musical styling of the Grateful Dead was heavily inspired by the Beatnik movement of the 1950s and later the psychedelic counterculture of the 1960s. One group at the forefront of the psychedelic sound was the Merry Pranksters. On the first historic bus trip, on the bus Furthur, a pattern was set for the Deadhead touring lifestyle to come. By the late 1970s, some Deadheads began to sell tie-dye T-shirts, veggie burritos, or other items at Grateful Dead concerts. In the 1980s, the area where Grateful Dead merchandise was sold became popularly referred to as &quot;Shakedown Street&quot;, named after the 1978 song. Income from these shops allowed Deadheads a way to follow the band on its tours. During the early 1980s, the number of Deadheads taping shows increased, and the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show. These tapes are still shared and circulated today via websites such as the Live Music Archive and bt.etree.org. In the earlier days of the Grateful Dead, there were questions as to whether or not it was in the best interest of the band for fans to tape concerts. In 1982, Garcia himself was asked what he thought about it, and he replied, &quot;When we are done with it [the concerts], they can have it.&quot; The practice of taping has evolved and expanded in the digital age. The rise of the Internet and peer to peer file sharing networks has made it extremely easy for Deadheads to share concerts through unofficial and official channels. Bob Dylan, who toured with the Grateful Dead during their 1987 summer tour, observed &quot;With most bands the audience participates like in a spectator sport. They just stand there and watch. They keep a distance. With the Dead, the audience is part of the band-they might as well be on stage.&quot;

==Origins==
The term &quot;Deadhead&quot; first appeared in print at the suggestion of Hank Harrison, author of &quot;The Dead Trilogy&quot;, on the sleeve of &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; (also known as &quot;Skull &amp; Roses&quot;), the band&#x27;s second live album, released in 1971. It read:
This phenomenon was first touched on in print by &quot;Village Voice&quot; music critic Robert Christgau at a Felt Forum show in 1971, noting &quot;how many &#x27;regulars&#x27; seemed to be in attendance, and how, from the way they compared notes, they&#x27;d obviously made a determined effort to see as many shows as possible.&quot;

Eileen Law, a long time friend of the band, was put in charge of the mailing list and maintained the &quot;Dead Heads&quot; newsletter. It is estimated that by the end of 1971, the band had received about 350 letters, but this number swelled greatly over the next few years to as many as 40,000. In total, 25 mailings/newsletters reached Deadheads between October 1971 and February 1980. After this time, the Grateful Dead Almanac would succeed it, with this eventually being abandoned for Dead.net. Those who did receive the newsletter in the 1970s often found pleasant surprises sent along. One example is from May 1974 when Heads received a sample EP of Robert Hunter&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Tales of the Great Rum Runners&quot; as well as selections from Jerry Garcia&#x27;s second album, &quot;Compliments of Garcia&quot;, and some cuts that were from bandmembers Keith and Donna Godchaux&#x27;s eponymous solo album, &quot;Keith &amp; Donna&quot;, both on Round Records. This sample was titled &quot;Anton Round&quot;, which was an alias used by Ron Rakow.

==Impact on shows==

The Grateful Dead&#x27;s appeal to fans was supported by the way the band structured their concerts and the use of the jam band format.
* From the early 1970s on, the Grateful Dead performed few shows with a predetermined setlist.
* At the behest of the band, a section of the audience was walled off to be used exclusively by fans recording the concert. 
* From the 1980s on, the second set usually contained a prolonged percussion interlude, called &quot;Drums&quot; (and eventually incorporating electronic elements), by Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann (also known as the &quot;Rhythm Devils&quot;) followed by an extended improvisational jam, known as &quot;Space&quot;, played by the rest of the band (as featured on the album &quot;Infrared Roses&quot;).

The band&#x27;s extensive song catalog enabled them to create a varied &quot;rotation&quot; of setlists, which were never exactly the same for each performance (&quot;show&quot;) throughout a tour. The use of these unique set rotations created two phenomena: The first had to do with Deadheads wanting to go to more shows in order to get a chance to hear their favorite song(s) – the same song was rarely played the same way twice during any given tour. Also, a great show often inspired many fans to begin following the band for the rest of the tour, as well subsequent tours. The second was that having a large number of traveling fans had empowered the band to perform multiple shows at each venue, since they were assured that their performances would mostly sell out (almost all shows sold out from the mid-1980s and on). At this point, it became apparent that Deadheads were a major driving force that encouraged the band to keep going. Along with the large number of people attending several shows, a traveling community developed amongst fans in response to the familiarity of seeing the same people from previous strings of shows. As generations turned from the Acid Tests to the 1970s (and onward), tours became a time to revel with friends at concerts, old and new, who never knew the psychedelic age that spawned the band they loved. As with any large community, Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang.

==&quot;The Vibe&quot;==
Some Deadheads use the term &quot;X Factor&quot; to describe the intangible element that elevates mere performance into something higher. Publicist and Jerry Garcia biographer Blair Jackson stated that &quot;shows were the sacrament ... rich and full of blissful, transcendent musical moments that moved the body and enriched the soul.&quot; Phil Lesh himself comments on this phenomenon in his autobiography by saying, &quot;The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.&quot;

Jackson takes this further, citing drummer Mickey Hart as saying, &quot;The Grateful Dead weren&#x27;t in the music business, they were in the &quot;transportation&quot; business.&quot; Jackson relates this to the Deadhead phenomenon directly by saying, &quot;for many Deadheads, the band was a medium that facilitated experiencing other planes of consciousness and tapping into deep, spiritual wells that were usually the province of organized religion ... [they] got people high whether those people were on drugs or not.&quot;

Rock producer Bill Graham summarized much of the band&#x27;s effect when he created a sign for the Grateful Dead when the group played the closing of the Winterland Ballroom on December 31, 1978. The sign read:
==Through the years==
* 1960s – Before the term was invented, The Grateful Dead became one of the first cult acts in music. Although not as mainstream as other psychedelic bands, they were the leaders of the Haight-Ashbury music scene and had an intense following that started in San Francisco and eventually spread. Fans gathered at their jam concerts throughout the sixties.
* 1970s – essentially known as the &quot;second generation of Deadheads&quot;, the new Deadheads of this time can either be traced to &quot;an older sibling who had turned them on by spinning &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; or &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot;&quot; or through college and university dorm rooms.
* 1980s – The early 1980s brought about what would later become known as &quot;Shakedown Street&quot; (in reference to the Grateful Dead album of the same name). Starting during the New Year&#x27;s Eve shows at the Oakland Auditorium in California from 1979 to 1982, Deadheads began to realize they could sell their wares (anything from tie-dye T-shirts to veggie burritos) in order to follow the band around more. Also during the early 1980s, Deadhead tapers grew exponentially, resulting in the band designating a taping section in October 1984. With the success of their album &quot;In the Dark&quot; (and the single &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;), 1988 started the &quot;Mega-Dead&quot; period.
** In the Darkers – also known as &quot;Touchheads&quot; (a reference of the album for the former and the single for the latter), these fans &quot;dissed the fragile ecosystem&quot; of a Grateful Dead show, in the words of Jackson. This led to &quot;wiser&quot; Deadheads, with the backing of the band, to mail SOSs and hand out show flyers telling people to &quot;cool out&quot;.
** Minglewood Town Council – this group was a direct result of the Touchheads and were a &quot;tribal council&quot; consisting of Deadheads and the Hog Farmers Calico and Goose. They handed out garbage bags at shows for people to pick up trash afterwards and tried to keep the masses mellow. The iconic lot leader, &quot;Trash Captain&quot; aka Douglas Seaton, was a well known member of this group.
* 1990s – The Deadheads of this time &quot;tended to be young, white, male, and from middle-class backgrounds – in short, they were drawn from much the same demographic base as most rock fans.&quot; The band also tended to attract a large percentage of fans from high-income families. The main draw for these Deadheads to travel to shows seemed to be the sense of community and adventure. During the mid-1990s there were a series of small &quot;Deadhead Riots&quot; peaking with a large scale riot at the Deer Creek Music Center near Indianapolis in July 1995. The riot was triggered by several gate crashing incidents, and resulted in the fence at the venue being torn down by rioting Deadheads and the subsequent cancellation of the next day&#x27;s show. The riot received national attention and is immortalized by Keller Williams in his song &quot;Gatecrashers Suck&quot;, in which he calls the rioters &quot;cock-sucking motherfuckers&quot;. Concert promoter Peter Shapiro filmed the iconic and influential Deadhead documentary, &quot;Tie-Died, Rock and Roll&#x27;s Most Deadicated Fans&quot; about life on Grateful Dead Tour 1994. The film was released through Sony Tri Star in September 1995 in major motion picture theaters across America, shortly after Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death. At the premiere party of the film&#x27;s release, Deadheads at the after-party at the Fillmore West met with Jerry Garcia&#x27;s close friend and musician, David Nelson, to formulate a strategy for continuing Deadhead culture. Thus, the David Nelson Band was formed. Other Dead related jam bands also did their part to continue the culture.
* 21st century – Many Deadheads of all ages, including fans who were generally too young to have seen the Grateful Dead, continue to passionately follow the many current Grateful Dead cover bands and spin-off bands such as Dead &amp; Company, The David Nelson Band, the Donna Jean Godchaux Band, RatDog, Phil Lesh and Friends, 7 Walkers, The Rhythm Devils, The Dead, Furthur, Dark Star Orchestra, and Joe Russo&#x27;s Almost Dead.
* The Spinners – also known as &quot;The Family&quot; or Church of Unlimited Devotion. These people &quot;used the band&#x27;s music in worship services and were a constant presence at shows&quot;. They were called &quot;spinners&quot; because of their twirling dance style. John Perry Barlow stated at the &#x27;So Many Roads Conference&#x27; that the Dead family hadn&#x27;t realized at the time that the Spinners were a cult. Observers have reported seeing them spinning only to Jerry songs and sitting down at the songs Bobby performed. Allegations of abuse have circulated widely in Deadhead groups.
* Wharf Rats – Deadheads who helped each other remain drug and alcohol free while staying in the Dead scene. The Wharf Rats were named from the song of same title. They were allowed to set up a table at every concert to support Deadheads who believed in enjoying the Grateful Dead sober or needed more efforts to remain straight.

==Recordings of shows==
At almost every Grateful Dead show, it was common to see fans openly recording the music for later enjoyment. The tradition can be traced to 1966 with the number of tapers increasing yearly. In 1971, Les Kippel, from Brooklyn, New York, started the First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange with the purpose of preserving the heritage of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s concert history by exchanging copies of recorded tapes made from audience members. This started a new era in recording, collecting, and trading Grateful Dead tapes.

The &quot;Tape Exchange&quot; evolved into &quot;Dead Relix&quot; magazine, co-founded by Kippel and its first editor, Jerry Moore (1953–2009), a native of The Bronx, New York. First fliers were handed out at concerts in 1973, followed by a first issue in 1974. In 1974, &quot;Dead Relix&quot; evolved into &quot;Relix&quot; magazine and kept the Grateful Dead in the news while they took a year off in 1975. In 1980, Toni Brown became owner and publisher of &quot;Relix&quot;. In 2000, it was sold to Steve Bernstein. In 2009, Peter Shapiro bought &quot;Relix&quot; and still maintains ownership.

There were other Deadhead magazines that came about in the 1970s, notably, &quot;Dead in Words&quot; and &quot;In Concert&quot;. The 1980s saw the production of &quot;Terrapin Flyer&quot;, &quot;Dupree&#x27;s Diamond News&quot;, &quot;Golden Road&quot;, and &quot;Acid&quot;. &quot;Dupree&#x27;s Diamond News&quot; was distributed as an in-concert newsletter at several hundred Grateful Dead concerts, where it averaged 10,000 copies per run. &quot;Dupree&#x27;s Diamond News&quot; was also distributed on a quarterly basis as a full-color, 72-page magazine to approximately 35,000 international subscriptions.

In 1998, Grateful Dead scholar Johnny Dwork, the founder of &quot;Terrapin Flyer&quot; and &quot;Dupree&#x27;s Diamond News&quot;, published the award-winning, three-volume &quot;The Deadhead&#x27;s Taping Compendium: A Guide to the Music of the Grateful Dead on Tape&quot;.

Fans were also known to record the many FM radio broadcast shows. Garcia looked kindly on tapers (he himself had been on several cross-country treks to record bluegrass music prior to the Grateful Dead), stating: &quot;There&#x27;s something to be said for being able to record an experience you&#x27;ve liked, or being to obtain a recording of it ... my responsibility to the notes is over after I&#x27;ve played them.&quot; In this respect, the Dead are considered by many to be the first &quot;taper-friendly&quot; band.

It is a matter of strict custom among Deadheads that these recordings are freely shared and circulated, with no money ever changing hands. Some bootleg recordings from unscrupulous bootleggers have turned up on the black market, but a general &quot;code of honor specifically prohibited the buying and selling of Dead tapes&quot;. These recordings, sometimes called &quot;liberated bootlegs&quot;, are still frowned upon by the community and that feeling &quot;has spread into non–Grateful Dead taping circles&quot;.

Many Deadheads now freely distribute digital recordings of the band&#x27;s live shows through the Internet Archive.

==Archives==
Much Deadhead-related historical material received or collected by the band over the years is housed in the Grateful Dead Archive of UC-Santa Cruz. Archive curator Nicholas Meriwether, who has also written extensively about the culture and its impact on society, states &quot;The Grateful Dead archive is going to end up being a critical way for us to approach and understand the 1960s and the counterculture of the era... It&#x27;s also going to tell us a lot about the growth and development of modern rock theater, and it&#x27;s helping us understand fan culture.&quot;

In addition to the band&#x27;s collection, many longtime fans have also accrued a large collection of Grateful Dead memorabilia and recorded live performances.

<text>Lancelot Addison (1632 – 20 April 1703) was an English writer and Church of England clergyman. He was born at Crosby Ravensworth in Westmorland. He was educated at the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Addison worked at Tangier as a chaplain for seven years and upon his return he wrote &quot;&quot;West Barbary, or a Short Narrative of the Revolutions of the Kingdoms of Fez and Morocco&quot;,&quot; (1671).

In 1670 he was appointed royal chaplain or Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, shortly thereafter Rector of Milston, Wilts (from 1670 to 1681), and Prebendary in the Cathedral of Salisbury. In 1681 Milston Rectory burnt down. In 1683 he became Dean of Lichfield, and in 1684 Archdeacon of Coventry.

Among his other works was &quot;The Present State of the Jews&quot; (1675), a detailed study of the Jewish population of the Barbary Coast in the seventeenth century, their customs, and their religious behaviour. Scholars have pointed out that part of Addison&#x27;s book simply repeats material found in the English translation of Johannes Buxtorf&#x27;s work &quot;Synagoga Judaica: The Jewish Synagogue, or an Historical Narration of the State of the Jewes&quot; (London, 1657).

He died in 1703 leaving three sons, the essayist Joseph Addison (1672–1719, eldest child), Gulston Addison, who became Governor of Madras, and the scholar Lancelot Addison (1680–1710), and two daughters: Dorothy Addison (1674–1750) and Anne Addison (1676-Unknown).

Addison was buried in Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire.

<doc id="288162" wikidata="Q2276016" url="?curid=288162" title="Seán Doherty (Roscommon politician)">
<text>Seán Doherty (29 June 1944 – 7 June 2005) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann from 1989 to 1992, Minister for Justice from March 1982 to December 1982 and Minister of State for Justice from 1980 to 1981. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1977 to 1989 and 1992 to 2002. He was a Senator for the Administrative Panel from 1989 to 1992.

==Background==
Born and raised in Cootehall near Boyle, County Roscommon, he was educated at national level in County Leitrim and then at University College Dublin and King&#x27;s Inns.

In 1965, Doherty became a member of the Garda Síochána and served as a Detective in Sligo before joining the Special Branch in Dublin in the early 1970s.

Doherty came from a family which had a long tradition of public service and political involvement in County Roscommon. In 1973, Doherty took a seat on Roscommon County Council, which was vacant after the death of his father.

Doherty married Maura Nangle, who is the sister of Irish musician Carmel Gunning. Together they had four daughters, Rachel Doherty was a councillor on Roscommon County Council.

==Political career==
After serving for four years as a local representative on Roscommon County Council, Doherty was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Roscommon–Leitrim constituency at the 1977 general election.

===Support of Charles Haughey===
At the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership election, Doherty was a key member of the &quot;gang of five&quot; which supported Charles Haughey&#x27;s campaign. The other members were Albert Reynolds, Mark Killilea Jnr, Tom McEllistrim and Jackie Fahey. Haughey was successful in the contest and Doherty served as Minister of State at the Department of Justice from 1979 to 1981. In the short-lived 1982 Fianna Fáil government, Doherty entered cabinet as Minister for Justice.

===Dowra affair===
The brother of Seán Doherty&#x27;s wife Maura, Garda Thomas Nangle, was charged with assaulting James McGovern, a native of County Fermanagh, in a public house in December 1981. On 27 September 1982, hours before the case was due to be heard in the District Court in Dowra, a small village in northwest County Cavan, McGovern was arrested by the Special Branch of the RUC on the basis of entirely false Garda intelligence that he was involved in terrorism. The case against Nangle was dismissed because the principal witness, McGovern, failed to appear in court. The solicitor representing Nangle was Kevin Doherty, Seán Doherty&#x27;s brother. This use of Garda/RUC Special Branch liaison, set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, prevented meetings between the Garda Commissioner and the RUC chief constable for almost three years.

===Phone tapping===
After Doherty left office it was revealed in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that he had ordered the tapping of three journalists&#x27; home telephones. The newspaper also disclosed that he had been interfering in the workings of the Gardaí and the administration of justice for both political and personal reasons. In February 1983, he resigned from the parliamentary party. He was readmitted in December 1984. He was re-elected at the 1987 general election.

===Seanad Éireann===
At the 1989 general election, he was defeated by the independent candidate Tom Foxe. He also unsuccessfully contested the 1989 European Parliament election held on the same day as the general election. Later in 1989, he was elected to Seanad Éireann on the Administrative Panel. He was elected as Cathaoirleach of the 19th Seanad.

===Resignations of Doherty and Haughey===

Doherty declared in an interview on &quot;Nighthawks&quot; that he had shown transcripts of the tapped phone conversations to Charles Haughey while Haughey was Taoiseach in 1982. Doherty had previously denied this. On 22 January 1992, resigned as Cathaoirleach &quot;to preserve the integrity of the House from any impact resulting from last night&#x27;s disclosures&quot;. Haughey continued to deny the claim, but was forced to resign as leader of Fianna Fáil and as Taoiseach.

Doherty was elected for Longford–Roscommon at the 1992 general election and held his seat until his retirement at the 2002 general election.

==Death==
Seán Doherty died at Letterkenny General Hospital as a result of a brain haemorrhage on 7 June 2005 while on a family holiday in County Donegal.

<doc id="288164" wikidata="Q2303939" url="?curid=288164" title="Gideon Welles">
<text>Gideon Welles (July 1, 1802 – February 11, 1878), nicknamed &quot;Father Neptune&quot;, was the United States Secretary of the Navy from 1861 to 1869, a cabinet post he was awarded after supporting Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 election. Although opposed to the Union blockade of Southern ports, he duly carried out his part of the Anaconda Plan, largely sealing off the Confederate coastline and preventing the exchange of cotton for war supplies. This is viewed as a major cause of Union victory in the Civil War, and his achievement in expanding the Navy almost tenfold was widely praised. Welles was also instrumental in the Navy&#x27;s creation of the Medal of Honor.

==Early political career==
Gideon Welles, the son of Samuel Welles and Ann Hale, was born on July 1, 1802, in Glastonbury, Connecticut.
His father was a shipping merchant and fervent Jeffersonian; he was a member of the Convention, which formed the first state Connecticut Constitution in 1818 that abolished the colonial charter and officially severed the pre-American Revolution political ties to England. In contrast to the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the successor constitution of 1818 provided for freedom of religion. He was a member of the seventh generation of his family in America. His original immigrant ancestor was Thomas Welles, who arrived in 1635 and was the only man in Connecticut&#x27;s history to hold all four top offices: governor, deputy governor, treasurer, and secretary. He was also the transcriber of the Fundamental Orders. Welles was the second great-grandson of Capt. Samuel Welles and Ruth (Rice) Welles, the daughter of Edmund Rice, a 1638 immigrant to Sudbury and founder of Marlborough, Massachusetts.

He married on June 16, 1835, at Lewiston, Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Mary Jane Hale, who was born on June 18, 1817, in Glastonbury, Connecticut, the daughter of Elias White Hale and Jane Mullhallan. Her father, Elias, graduated from Yale College in 1794 and practiced law in Mifflin and Centre Counties, Pennsylvania. She died on February 28, 1886, in Hartford, Connecticut, and was buried next to her husband in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Gideon and Mary Jane were the parents of six children.

He was educated at the Episcopal Academy at Cheshire, Connecticut, and earned a degree at the American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Norwich, Vt. (later Norwich University). He became a lawyer through the then-common practice of reading the law, but soon shifted to journalism and became the founder and editor of the &quot;Hartford Times&quot; in 1826. After successfully gaining admission, from 1827 to 1835, he participated in the Connecticut House of Representatives as a Democrat. Following his service in the Connecticut General Assembly, he served in various posts, including State Controller of Public Accounts in 1835, Postmaster of Hartford (1836–41), and Chief of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing for the Navy (1846–49).

Welles was a Jacksonian Democrat who worked very closely with Martin Van Buren and John Milton Niles. His chief rival in the Connecticut Democratic Party was Isaac Toucey, whom Welles would later replace at the Navy Department. While Welles dutifully supported James K. Polk in the 1844 election, he would abandon the Democrats in 1848 to support Van Buren&#x27;s Free Soil campaign.

Mainly because of his strong anti-slavery views, Welles shifted allegiance in 1854 to the newly established Republican Party and founded a newspaper in 1856 (the &quot;Hartford Evening Press&quot;) that would espouse Republican ideals for decades thereafter. He was the Republican nominee for governor in the 1856 Connecticut gubernatorial election, coming in third behind William T. Minor and Samuel Ingham.

==Secretary of the Navy==
Welles&#x27; strong support of Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election made him the logical candidate from New England for Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet. In March 1861, Lincoln named Welles his Secretary of the Navy.

Welles found the Naval Department in disarray, with Southern officers resigning en masse. His first major action was to dispatch the Navy&#x27;s most powerful warship, the USS &quot;Powhatan&quot;, to relieve Fort Sumter on Lincoln&#x27;s instructions. Unfortunately, Secretary of State Seward had just ordered the &quot;Powhatan&quot; to Fort Pickens, Florida on his own authority, ruining whatever chance Major Robert Anderson had of withstanding the assault. Several weeks later, when Seward argued for a blockade of Southern ports, Welles argued vociferously against the action but was eventually overruled by Lincoln. Despite his misgivings, Welles&#x27; efforts to rebuild the Navy and implement the blockade proved extraordinarily effective. From 76 ships and 7,600 sailors in 1861, the Navy expanded almost tenfold by 1865. His implementation of the Naval portion of the Anaconda Plan strongly weakened the Confederacy&#x27;s ability to finance the war by limiting the cotton trade, and while never completely effective in sealing off all 3,500 miles of Southern coastline, it was a major contribution towards Northern victory. Lincoln nicknamed Welles his &quot;Neptune.&quot;

After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Welles was retained by President Andrew Johnson as Secretary of the Navy. In 1866, Welles, along with Seward, was instrumental in launching the National Union Party as a third party alternative supportive of Johnson&#x27;s reconciliation policies. Welles also played a prominent part in Johnson&#x27;s ill-fated &quot;Swing Around the Circle&quot; campaign that autumn. Although Welles admitted in his diary that he was dismayed by Johnson&#x27;s behavior on the trip, particularly the president&#x27;s penchant for invective and engaging directly with hecklers, Welles remained loyal to Johnson, and supported him during his impeachment. On April 17 and 18, 1868, Welles testified in the impeachment trial of Johnson, having been called as a witness by Johnson&#x27;s defense team. His son Edgar also testified that day.

==Later life and death ==

After leaving politics, Welles returned to Connecticut and to writing, editing his journals, and authoring several books before his death, including a biography, &quot;Lincoln and Seward&quot;, published in 1874.

He was a Third Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. While the Loyal Legion did consist predominantly of Union officers who had served in the American Civil War the Order&#x27;s constitution provided for honorary members (i.e. Third Class Companions) who were civilians who had made significant contributions to the war effort. Welles was also instrumental in the Navy&#x27;s creation of the Medal of Honor.

Towards the end of 1877, his health began to wane. Welles died from a streptococcal throat infection, at the age of seventy-five, on February 11, 1878. His body was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

==Legacy==
Two ships have been named USS &quot;Welles&quot; in his honor. The Dining Commons at Cheshire Academy and the Gideon Welles School in Glastonbury, Connecticut, are also named after him. In the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago, Welles Park was dedicated in his honor in 1910, and an adjacent restaurant, opened in 2014, was also named after Gideon Welles.

He was not an ancestor of Orson Welles as the actor had claimed on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;.

<doc id="288166" wikidata="Q1886368" url="?curid=288166" title="The Tea Party (band)">
<text>The Tea Party is a Canadian rock band. Active throughout the 1990s and up until 2005, the band re-formed in 2011. The Tea Party released eight albums on EMI Music Canada, selling over three million records worldwide, including four double-platinum awards, one platinum and four gold albums in Canada. Between 1996 and 2016, The Tea Party was the 35th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada.

The Tea Party toured Canada on 21 occasions and Australia on twelve. In November 2002, the band toured Canada with symphony orchestras reinterpreting a decade&#x27;s worth of shared songwriting. Breaking up in 2005 due to creative differences, the band members eventually re-united in 2011 to play several Canadian tour dates during the summer. The band decided to continue after the tour and has now re-formed.

The band has since released a double live album, recorded on their 2012 tour of Australia. Video shot during this tour was released as a Live DVD/Blu-ray, &quot;The Tea Party: Live from Australia&quot; in 2013. In September 2014, The Tea Party released their album, &quot;The Ocean at the End&quot;, and the following year a deluxe version of their album, &quot;The Edges of Twilight&quot;. In 2019&quot;,&quot; they released their EP &quot;Black River EP&quot;.

==History==
===Early years (1990–1995)===
The Tea Party was formed in 1990 by Jeff Martin, Stuart Chatwood and Jeff Burrows after a marathon jam session at the Cherry Beach Rehearsal Studios in Toronto. Each member had previously played together during their teenage years in a number of different bands in Windsor, Ontario, where they were originally from. They had decided to name their new group The Tea Party after the infamous hash sessions of famous Beat generation poets Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs.

The Tea Party released their eponymous debut album in 1991, distributing it through their own label Eternal Discs. The album drew influences from psychedelic rock and blues, and was produced by Martin; album production was something Martin would continue with for all of The Tea Party&#x27;s albums, as a way of giving the band complete artistic control. In 1993 The Tea Party signed to EMI Music Canada and released their first major label recording, &quot;Splendor Solis&quot;. The band employed open tunings and goblet drums (Dumbek) to create Indian-style sounds, something they continued to employ throughout their career, while continuing in a blues influenced style. In 1994 the album released in Australia, with the single &quot;Save Me&quot; launching the band&#x27;s career in the country. The band gained the support of national radio station Triple J, enabling the band&#x27;s first tour, with &quot;Save Me&quot; becoming a staple of their setlists.

===Success (1995–2000)===
Further developing The Tea Party&#x27;s sound in 1995, &quot;The Edges of Twilight&quot; was recorded with an array of Indian and Middle-eastern instrumentation. &quot;Sister Awake&quot;, the third single from the album, defines what the band set out to do, combining three-piece rock compositions with music from the world. &quot;Sister Awake&quot; is an acoustically based arrangement on 12-string guitar, sitar, sarod, harmonium and goblet drums. &quot;The Edges of Twilight&quot; is The Tea Party&#x27;s most commercially successful album; with sales exceeding 270,000 units, the album is certified double platinum in Canada and platinum in Australia.

In 1996, The Tea Party became the first Canadian band to play the main stage at Lollapalooza. Upon returning from successful tours in Canada, Europe and Australia in 1996, The Tea Party recorded &quot;Alhambra&quot;, an enhanced CD which features acoustic re-recordings of songs from &quot;The Edges of Twilight&quot;, and followed its release with a brief tour of Canada called &quot;Alhambra Acoustic and Eclectic&quot;. English folk musician Roy Harper appeared on &quot;The Edges of Twilight&quot; reciting a poem and on &quot;Alhambra&quot; providing vocals for the song &quot;Time&quot;.

&quot;Transmission&quot; released in 1997 saw The Tea Party&#x27;s first foray into electronica with a sampled world music foundation and thrust. &quot;Transmission&quot; is a collection of aggressive songs influenced by upheavals around the band; the firing of their management and the feeling of a lack of support from their record company. Epitomising the feelings were the first single &quot;Temptation&quot; and the album&#x27;s title song.

&quot;Triptych&quot; followed in 1999, the first single &quot;Heaven Coming Down&quot; rose to No. 1 on Canadian radio. The Tea Party&#x27;s music took on a more orchestral sound, maturing from the blues base. &quot;Live at the Enmore Theatre&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live album was released through Australian radio station Triple J during the band&#x27;s tour for &quot;Triptych&quot;. In the fall The Tea Party toured in western Canada with Edwin.

===Later years (2000–2005)===
The band released a singles compilation called &quot;&quot; in 2000; that year the band was nominated for a Juno award for best musical group. They released a DVD compilation of music videos (which Martin remixed in surround sound) called &quot;Illuminations&quot; in 2001. It was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. The Tea Party released &quot;The Interzone Mantras&quot; later in 2001, and in November 2002 joined symphony orchestras across Canada in adapting their live show. The Interzone Mantras was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario.

&quot;Seven Circles&quot; was released in 2004. Both &quot;The Interzone Mantras&quot; and &quot;Seven Circles&quot; saw the band return to their earlier sound with maturity. 

In October 2005, The Tea Party disbanded due to creative differences, with Martin abruptly announcing he was beginning a solo career. Afterward Chatwood stated on the band&#x27;s forum &quot;that Jeff Burrows and myself are sincerely sorry for the way this was handled. As far as Jeff Burrows and myself were concerned, the band was taking an extended break.&quot;

===Post-breakup (2006–2011)===
In 2006 Chatwood continued to compose the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; video game soundtracks for Ubisoft Montreal.

Burrows joined Rush&#x27;s Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, and other Canadian musicians as drummer in the one-off project the Big Dirty Band as well as presenting the midday shift on The Rock, a radio station in Windsor. In 2008 Burrows announced that he, Edwin, Mike Turner and Amir Epstein would form the band Crash Karma, recording their debut album in early 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper, K 2009, Edwin/Tea Party/OLP Band Is For Real, Chartattack.&quot;&gt;Harper, K 2009, Edwin/Tea Party/OLP Band Is For Real, Chartattack. Accessed 8 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin moved to Ireland and recorded his debut solo album &quot;Exile and the Kingdom&quot;, which was released in Canada and Australia in 2006. He has toured parts of Europe, Canada and Australia, and released two live albums, &quot;Live in Brisbane 2006&quot; and &quot;Live in Dublin&quot;, in November 2006 and May 2007, respectively. In August 2008, Martin announced the formation of his new band, The Armada. In 2010, The Armada broke up. Jeff Martin founded a new band called Jeff Martin 777 with Jay Cortez on bass and Malcolm Clark on drums. Their debut album &quot;The Ground Cries Out&quot; was released on 1 March in Canada and made it to No. 51 in the Canadian Albums Chart.

===Reunion===
On 12 April 2011, an official Facebook page was launched with a biography section that closed with &quot;The band is scheduled to play a select number of dates in 2011. No other info was available at this time.&quot; The following day, the local radio station K106.3 announced the Sarnia Bayfest lineup including The Tea Party, which was later confirmed by drummer Jeff Burrows on his radio show on 13 April. Burrows further stated that a Canadian summer tour was in the works. The band played several shows in Canada over that summer.

On 6 August 2011, during a show in Lévis, the band had implied that they were going to be back together permanently. Martin said &quot;We are the Tea Party and we&#x27;re here to stay. And we&#x27;re never going away again.&quot; In December of that year, during a show at the Métropolis in Montreal, the band announced that they would hopefully record a new album in 2012 and that there would be no more break up; Martin confirmed earlier implications by stating that &quot;The Tea Party is back for good&quot;.

On 22 February 2013, The Tea Party announced on its website that &quot;The band have convened in Australia to write and record the next chapter in the Tea Party saga. Stay tuned for more updates.&quot; On 19 March 2014, The Tea Party announced via its Facebook page that the title of their forthcoming album will be &quot;The Ocean at the End&quot;. It was officially released in Canada on 8 September 2014.

In October 2016, the band announced they would be going on a 30 date anniversary tour for their 4th studio album &quot;Transmission&quot; that was released 20 years ago. The tour began 3 February. They performed the album in its entirety along with some of their greatest hits.

The Tea Party promoted their &quot;Black River EP&quot; with two singles, releasing title track &quot;Black River&quot; in November 2018, followed by &quot;Way Way Down&quot; in June 2019. The EP released on 29 November 2019, contains both songs along with three new tracks and a Led Zeppelin cover.

On 26 April 2020, The Tea Party published a newly recorded cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Isolation&quot; to their YouTube account. It coincided with COVID-19 pandemic isolation orders that much of the world was under to stop the spread of the virus. 6 July 2020 it was made available for digital download on the band&#x27;s web site. It was followed by a second cover, Everyday Is Like Sunday by Morrissey, made available on streaming music services 29 May 2020.

The Tea Party scheduled a cross-country &quot;Saints and Sinners Tour 2020&quot; for June and July, featuring Canadian co-headliners Sloan, Headstones and Moist. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing live venues to temporarily close, the tour was rescheduled for November 2021. The tour was later cancelled, and the announcement was made via the band&#x27;s Twitter account.

==Website==
In September 2011, Yahoo! reported that political groups associated with the Tea Party movement were trying to purchase the band&#x27;s domain name. Stuart Chatwood stated &quot;So much damage has been done to our name by the political movement that we&#x27;re considering selling (The domain)&quot; It is estimated the band could sell the domain for over $1M U.S. The band purchased the domain in 1993, and has since added the phrase &quot;No politics... Just Rock and Roll&quot; to their site in order to distance themselves from the political movement. On 15 October 2011, Sedo announced that they will be exclusively listing the domain for sale on their online marketplace. In February 2012, however, a post appeared on the website&#x27;s news section that said: &quot;The band has not sold teaparty.com.&quot;

== Musical style ==

Regarded as a progressive rock band, The Tea Party&#x27;s style fuses &quot;blues, industrial rock, and psych-blasted progressive rock with Middle Eastern influences.&quot; The band has described their style as &quot;Moroccan-roll&quot;. &quot;Tuonela&quot; magazine described the band&#x27;s style as &quot;a very emotive style of alternative rock, with hints of grunge and even some touches of oriental music&quot;.

<doc id="288169" wikidata="Q2073804" url="?curid=288169" title="Peter Barry (politician)">
<text>Peter Barry (10 August 1928 – 26 August 2016) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Tánaiste from January 1987 to March 1987, Deputy leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987 and 1991 to 1993, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1982 to 1987, Minister for the Environment from 1981 to 1982, Minister for Education from 1976 to 1977, Minister for Transport and Power from 1973 to 1976 and Lord Mayor of Cork from 1970 to 1971. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1969 to 1997.

==Early life and education==
Barry was born in Blackrock, Cork, in 1928. He was the son of Anthony Barry, a Fine Gael TD and a well-known businessman. He was educated at Christian Brothers College, Cork and then became the major shareholder in the family company, Barry&#x27;s Tea.

==Political career==
He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Cork City South-East constituency at the 1969 general election. He would go on to win a Dáil seat at eight successive further general elections, changing constituency to Cork City in 1977 and Cork South-Central in 1981. When Fine Gael came to power following the 1973 general election, he was appointed Minister for Transport and Power. In 1976, he became Minister for Education. In 1979, after Garret FitzGerald had become leader of Fine Gael, Barry was elected deputy leader. From June 1981 to March 1982, he served as Minister for the Environment.

From December 1982 to 1987, he was Minister for Foreign Affairs. In this capacity, he was heavily involved in the negotiations which resulted in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. He also became the first joint chairman of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference, established under the Agreement by the Irish and British governments. Following the Labour Party&#x27;s withdrawal from the coalition government in 1987, Barry became Tánaiste, for a brief period. He was the first member of Fine Gael to hold the office of Tánaiste.

When FitzGerald resigned as Fine Gael leader after the 1987 general election, Barry was one of three candidates (along with Alan Dukes and John Bruton) who contested the party leadership. Dukes was the eventual victor.

He retired at the 1997 general election, at which his seat was held for Fine Gael by his daughter Deirdre Clune. She later served as a Senator representing the Cultural and Educational Panel, but resigned in 2014, on being elected as a Member of the European Parliament for Ireland South.

===1986 Northern Ireland by-elections===

In 1986, the fifteen Unionist members of the House of Commons in Westminster resigned in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement, causing by-elections. To ensure contests in each constituency, Wesley Robert Williamson changed his name by deed poll to Peter Barry, deliberately taking the name of the Irish Minister held responsible for the negotiations, and stood in the four constituencies, North Antrim, South Antrim, East Londonderry and Strangford, under the label &quot;For the Anglo-Irish Agreement&quot;. Despite not campaigning, he won over 6,000 votes.

==Personal life==
His sister, Terry Kelly, served as Mayor of Limerick from 1983 to 1984.

<text>A temazcal is a type of sweat lodge, which originated with indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. The term &quot;temazcal&quot; comes from the Nahuatl language, either from the words (to bathe) and (house), or from the word (house of heat).

==Overview==

In ancient Mesoamerica it was used as part of a curative ceremony thought to purify the body after exertion such as after a battle or a ceremonial ball game. It was also used for healing the sick, improving health, and for women to give birth. It continues to be used today in Indigenous cultures of Mexico and Central America that were part of the ancient Mesoamerican region for spiritual healing and health enrichment reasons.

The temazcal is usually a permanent structure, unlike sweat lodges of other regions. It has various construction styles differing by region; from volcanic rock and cement adobe mud bricks even wood mud and cloth can be utilized. It may be a circular dome made to represent the uterus, although rectangular ones have been found at certain archeological sites and this shape is also used. To produce steam, water is poured over heated volcanic stones, which will not crack and explode like other rocks in confined high temperature areas. The stones may be heated with fire from an outside port or placed in a pit located in the center or near a wall of the temazcal.

<text>James Edward Kelly (born February 14, 1960) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons with the Buffalo Bills. He also spent two seasons with the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League (USFL). Kelly played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, earning offensive MVP honors in the 1981 Peach Bowl.

One of the six quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 1983 NFL draft, Kelly was selected 14th overall by the Bills. He chose to sign with the Gamblers instead and did not play for the Bills until the USFL folded in 1986. Employing the &quot;K-Gun&quot; offense, known for its no-huddle shotgun formations, Kelly led one of the greatest NFL scoring juggernauts. From 1990 to 1993, he helped guide the Bills to a record four consecutive Super Bowls, although the team lost each game. Kelly was also named to five Pro Bowls and received first-team All-Pro honors in 1991.

Along with teammates Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith, Kelly is one of only three players to have his number retired by the Bills. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Early life==
Kelly was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on February 14, 1960. He grew up in East Brady, Pennsylvania.

Kelly was a standout at East Brady High School, winning all-state Pennsylvania honors after passing for 3,915 yards, 44 touchdowns, and one interception in his high school career. After his senior year, Kelly played in the Big 33 Football Classic. Kelly also played basketball in high school, scoring over 1,000 points with six 30-plus-point games. As a senior, he led East Brady to the Pennsylvania Class &#x27;A&#x27; basketball state quarterfinals, and averaged 23 points and 20 rebounds.

==College career==
Kelly was offered a scholarship to play college football at Penn State University under coach Joe Paterno, but Paterno wanted Kelly at linebacker, not quarterback. Miami Hurricanes head coach Lou Saban promised Kelly he would be playing quarterback, which lured Kelly to attend the University of Miami, though Kelly never played for Saban, who left prior to the beginning of the 1979 season. Saban was replaced by Howard Schnellenberger, and Kelly became an important piece in Schnellenberger&#x27;s effort to build the program into one of the nation&#x27;s best. Kelly finished his career at the University of Miami with 376 completions in 676 attempts for 5,228 yards and 33 touchdowns. He was inducted into the university&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Professional career==
===1983 NFL draft===
Because of fellow quarterback John Elway&#x27;s well-publicized reluctance to play for the Baltimore Colts, who chose him in the 1983 NFL draft, Kelly&#x27;s agent asked whether there were any teams he would not play for. Kelly, who disliked cold weather, listed the Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers, and Buffalo Bills. He was pleased to see while watching the 1983 draft on television that the Bills did not select him as the 12th pick in the first round, but learned from his agent that the team had another first-round pick; the Bills chose Kelly as the 14th pick. Although Kelly at the time stated that he had expected the Bills to choose him, he later said, &quot;You have to say those things ... I cried. (Laughs) I didn&#x27;t really literally cry. I just had tears. I&#x27;m like, &#x27;You got to be kidding me.&#x27;&quot;

Although he believed that team owner Ralph Wilson would not bring in the right players to build a championship team, Kelly was initially resigned to playing for the Bills, but while meeting with the team to negotiate his contract three days after the draft, a Bills secretary mistakenly let Bruce Allen, general manager of the rival United States Football League&#x27;s Chicago Blitz, reach Kelly on the telephone; Allen persuaded Kelly to leave the meeting. Then in the first week of May, the Montreal Concordes made a counter-offer on the basis that Kelly&#x27;s girlfriend lived in Montreal. Kelly&#x27;s agent, Greg Lustig, would insist on negotiating with the Blitz and the Concordes before doing so with the Bills. By the last week of May, Lustig said he was pleased with the Bills’ proposal and Kelly expected to sign with the Bills, but in the end he would sign with a different USFL team after Ken Weinberger made negotiations during the first week of June.

===Houston Gamblers===
Kelly later claimed that the USFL offered him his choice of teams because of the league&#x27;s interest in signing quarterbacks. He signed with the Houston Gamblers, who played in the climate-controlled Houston Astrodome, and said, &quot;Would you rather be in Houston or Buffalo?&quot;

In two seasons in Houston, leading offensive coach Mouse Davis&#x27;s run-and-shoot offense, Kelly threw for 9,842 yards, 83 touchdowns, and 45 interceptions with a 63% completion percentage for an average of 8.53 yards per attempt. He was the USFL MVP in 1984, when he set a league record with 5,219 yards passing and 44 touchdown passes. Kelly&#x27;s USFL records eclipsed those of fellow league quarterbacks Doug Williams and Steve Young. Despite Kelly&#x27;s success during the regular season, he saw no success during the Gamblers&#x27; two playoff appearances. The team was defeated in the first rounds in 1984 and 1985. Kelly threw for a combined 620 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions.

When the Houston Gamblers folded, Kelly went to the New Jersey Generals and was slated as their starting quarterback. Kelly appeared on a cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; while holding a Generals&#x27; helmet, but the league collapsed before he ever fielded a snap with the Generals.

====&quot;The Greatest Game No One Saw&quot;====
Led by Kelly, the Houston Gamblers took on the Los Angeles Express and quarterback Steve Young, on February 24, 1985. The game was supposed to be televised by ABC, but they opted to cover Doug Flutie&#x27;s debut with the New Jersey Generals instead. Only cameramen that worked for both teams were on hand to record the game. Houston raced out to an early lead, but the Express mounted a comeback that led to their being ahead, 33–14 with just under ten minutes left in the game. Kelly led the Gamblers on a comeback that would see them pull off a 34–33 win, and in the end, Kelly threw for a pro football record 574 yards breaking the mark of 554 yards set by Norm Van Brocklin in 1951.

Kelly threw three touchdown passes in the last Gambler drives of the game, including what turned out to be the game winner, a 39-yard strike to receiver Ricky Sanders. The Express thought they had the game won, especially after safety Troy West picked off a Kelly pass and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Gamblers got the ball back and it just took two plays for them to score, as Kelly tossed a pass to Richard Johnson that ended up being a 52-yard score. The drive took less than a minute. The Gamblers defense forced a punt, and the offense scored again, this time Kelly found receiver Vince Courville for a 20-yard strike. The drive was aided by a poor punt from Express punter Jeff Partridge that only netted 16 yards and allowed the Gamblers to take over at the Express 43 yard line.

Kelly found Sanders for the go-ahead score, Sanders beating Troy West on the play. West had picked off two Kelly passes that day, but Kelly ended up with the last laugh. The Express were driving to get in range for their placekicker, Tony Zendejas to kick what had the potential to be the game winner. That was not to be as Young was picked off by Gamblers linebacker Mike Hawkins.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described the day as &quot;the greatest game no one saw.&quot;

===Buffalo Bills===

After the USFL folded, Kelly finally joined the Bills, who had retained his NFL rights, in 1986. He helped lead the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances (Super Bowl XXV–Super Bowl XXVIII) and six divisional championships from 1988 to 1995. The Bills are both the only franchise to reach the Super Bowl four years in a row and lose the Super Bowl four years in a row. Buffalo made the playoffs in eight of Kelly&#x27;s 11 seasons as their starting quarterback. Kelly&#x27;s primary &#x27;go-to&#x27; wide receiver with the Bills, Andre Reed, ranks among the NFL&#x27;s all-time leaders in several receiving categories. Kelly and Reed connected for 65 touchdowns during their career together trailing only the tandems of Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison (112), Philip Rivers and Antonio Gates (87), Steve Young and Jerry Rice (85), Dan Marino and Mark Clayton (79), Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne (69), and Drew Brees and Marques Colston (68) for touchdowns by an NFL quarterback and receiver tandem. Kelly, along with Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, Thurman Thomas, and Scott Norwood, was the subject of the &quot;30 for 30&quot; film—&quot;Four Falls of Buffalo&quot;.

Kelly retired after the 1996 NFL season due to injuries. After sitting out the 1997 season, in 1998 Kelly seriously considered an offer to sign with the Baltimore Ravens who were coached by his former offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda. Kelly declined the offer due to family reasons and stayed retired; the Ravens instead opted to trade with the Indianapolis Colts for Jim Harbaugh as the latter team prepared for the Peyton Manning era.

====&quot;No-huddle offense&quot;====
Kelly ran the Bills&#x27; &quot;K-Gun&quot; no-huddle offense, which was a fast-paced offense named after tight end Keith McKeller, that denied opposing defenses the opportunity to make timely substitutions (the NFL later changed the rules in response to this to allow opposing defenses time to change formations under no-huddle situations, but this applied only if the offense made personnel substitutions). This offensive scheme called for multiple formation calls in a huddle, so that after each play was completed, the Bills would eschew a following huddle, instead lining up for the next play where Kelly would read the defense and audible the play. This led to mismatches and defensive communication breakdowns and, in the 1990s, established the Bills as one of the NFL&#x27;s most successful and dangerous offenses, instrumental in leading Buffalo to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances.

==Records and accomplishments==
Kelly holds the 2nd all-time NFL record for most yards gained per completion in a single game (44), established on September 10, 1995, in the Bills&#x27; game against the expansion Carolina Panthers. He recorded an NFL-best 101.2 passer rating in 1990, led the league with 33 touchdown passes in 1991, (which remained a Bills record until 2020 when it was broken by Josh Allen) and made the Pro Bowl five times (1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1992).

In his four Super Bowls, Kelly completed 81 of 145 passes for 829 yards and two touchdowns, with seven interceptions. His 81 completions are the fifth most in Super Bowl history behind Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, and Joe Montana. In Super Bowl XXVI, he set a record with 58 pass attempts, and in Super Bowl XXVIII he set a record with 31 completions (this was later surpassed).

Kelly finished his 11 NFL seasons with 2,874 completions in 4,779 attempts for 35,467 yards, 237 touchdowns, and 175 interceptions, all of which are Buffalo records excluding the interceptions. He also rushed for 1,049 yards and seven touchdowns.

Including his time in the NFL and USFL, he finished with over 45,000 passing yards and 320 touchdowns. In 2001, the Buffalo Bills retired his number 12 jersey.

On August 3, 2002, Kelly was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was enshrined during his first year of eligibility and headlined a class that also featured John Stallworth, Dan Hampton, Dave Casper, and George Allen. Fellow Hall of Fame member and former head coach Marv Levy was Kelly&#x27;s presenter at the ceremony.

Up until the 2024 NFL season, Kelly was the most recent starting quarterback to lose his Super Bowl debut and return to start a subsequent Super Bowl, with Jalen Hurts being the most recent to achieve this.

==Personal life==
Kelly resides in East Aurora, New York with his wife Jill and their daughters, Erin and Camryn.

Kelly devoted much of his post-football life to his son, Hunter James Kelly, who was diagnosed with globoid-cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) shortly after his birth on February 14, 1997, which was Kelly&#x27;s 37th birthday. Hunter died as a result of this disease on August 5, 2005, at the age of 8. To honor his son, Kelly established Hunter&#x27;s Hope, a non-profit organization, in 1997. Kelly&#x27;s advocacy on behalf of Krabbe patients has increased national awareness of the disease. He and his wife Jill founded the annual Hunter&#x27;s Day of Hope, which is held on February 14, the birthdays of both Jim and Hunter Kelly. The Hunter James Kelly Research Institute was founded at the University at Buffalo in 2004, where neuroscientists and clinicians are studying myelin and its diseases. When Kelly was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002, he dedicated his speech to Hunter. &quot;It&#x27;s been written that the trademark of my career was toughness,&quot; he said as he choked back tears. &quot;The toughest person I ever met in my life was my hero, my soldier, my son, Hunter. I love you, buddy.&quot;

Two of Kelly&#x27;s nephews, both the sons of his younger brother Kevin, have also played quarterback. Chad Kelly played college football at the NCAA Division I level for the Clemson Tigers and the Ole Miss Rebels and took part in the 2017 NFL draft, in which he was selected last overall in the seventh round by the Denver Broncos, earning the title of &quot;Mr. Irrelevant.&quot; He now plays for the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL and won the Grey Cup with them in 2022. Casey Kelly, Chad&#x27;s younger brother, played quarterback for Mallard Creek High School, and graduated in 2019. Casey Kelly also enrolled at Ole Miss, but chose to convert to tight end and play for the team as a walk-on. Casey Kelly then entered the transfer portal in 2023 to play for Oregon, then invoked a graduate transfer to play for East Carolina in 2024.

Kelly&#x27;s father, Joe Kelly, died on August 21, 2017; his mother died in 1996.

Kelly is a devout Christian, and has several business ventures, including Hall of Fame Life Promotions, a promotional company that is committed to donating a percentage of all of its proceeds to the Hunter&#x27;s Hope Foundation. In 2011, Kelly founded Jim Kelly Inc. a company which produces the MyFanClip line of all-purpose clips which bear sports team logos and other insignia. MyFanClip has licensing agreements with the NFL, MLB, NHL and NASCAR. Proceeds also benefit the Hunter&#x27;s Hope Foundation, his charity.

Kelly has hosted the annual Jim Kelly Celebrity Golf Classic golf tournament since 1987 to benefit his Kelly for Kids Foundation. A public charity function called StarGaze was held from 1992 to 1995 to complement the golf tournament.

Since 1988, Kelly has run a football camp for youths between the ages of eight and 18 at the Buffalo Bills facilities. It started with 325 campers in its first year, growing to over 500 campers a year. This camp provides teaching from experienced coaches and previous players from all over the country. Kelly also participates in various drills with the participants.

Kelly owned and operated Sport City Grill restaurant with the attached Network nightclub on the ground floor of Main Place Tower in Buffalo from 1993 to 1996.

On June 3, 2013, Kelly announced that he had been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, a form of cancer, in his upper jaw. He underwent surgery at a Buffalo hospital on June 7. Kelly reported to news outlets shortly after his surgery that the procedure was successful and he was now cancer-free. On March 14, 2014, after a follow-up test at the Erie County Medical Center, it was announced that Kelly&#x27;s cancer had recurred, and that he would begin radiation and chemotherapy treatment. It was announced on August 20, 2014, that doctors could no longer find evidence of cancer.

On November 1, 2014, Kelly announced he had contracted MRSA within his bones, three months after being declared cancer-free. A few weeks after the announcement, Kelly said he was MRSA-free.

Kelly announced in March 2018 that the cancer had returned. He underwent surgery that month to remove the cancer and reconstruct his upper jaw. In June 2018, it was announced that Kelly would receive the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the 2018 ESPYs. In late June 2018, Kelly returned to a New York City hospital for additional surgery.

On January 18, 2019, Jill Kelly announced on Instagram that he was cancer free.

<text>Mount Bachelor, formerly named Bachelor Butte, is a dormant stratovolcano atop a shield volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range of central Oregon, United States. Named Mount Bachelor because it stands apart from the nearby Three Sisters, it lies in the eastern segment of the central portion of the High Cascades, the eastern segment of the Cascade Range. The volcano lies at the northern end of the long Mount Bachelor Volcanic Chain, which underwent four major eruptive episodes during the Pleistocene and the Holocene. The United States Geological Survey considers Mount Bachelor a moderate threat, but Bachelor poses little threat of becoming an active volcano in the near future. It remains unclear whether the volcano is extinct or just inactive.

The Mount Bachelor ski area has operated on the mountain since 1958, and the volcano&#x27;s summit hosts the Mount Bachelor Observatory. A center of winter recreation, the area offers snowshoeing, snow skiing, snow tubing, and dog sledding, among other activities. The summit can be reached by a climbing trail that travels over lava from the volcano.

== Geography ==
Mount Bachelor lies in the Cascade Range, within Deschutes County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is located south of the Three Sisters complex volcano, and reaches an elevation of . It rises above its base, with a proximal relief of . The volcano has a volume of . Mount Bachelor stands southeast of the Tumalo Mountain volcano and to the southwest of the city of Bend, in the Deschutes National Forest.

Weather varies greatly in the area due to the rain shadow caused by the Cascade Range. Air from the Pacific Ocean rises over the western slopes, which causes it to cool and dump its moisture as rain (or snow in the winter). Precipitation increases with elevation. Once the moisture is wrung from the air, it descends on the eastern side of the crest, which causes the air to be warmer and drier. On the western slopes, precipitation ranges from annually, while precipitation over the eastern slopes varies from in the east. Temperature extremes reach in summers and during the winters.

== Geology ==
Mount Bachelor joins several other volcanoes in the eastern segment of the Cascade Range known as the High Cascades, which trends north–south. Constructed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north–south faulting in the surrounding region. Bachelor lies in the eastern segment of the central portion of the High Cascades.

Mount Bachelor is the youngest prominent volcano in the Three Sisters area of Oregon, a group of closely grouped volcanic peaks, in contrast to the typical spacing between volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascades. Among the most active volcanic areas in the Cascades and one of the most densely populated volcanic centers in the world, the Three Sisters region includes peaks such as Belknap Crater, Mount Washington, Black Butte, and Three Fingered Jack to the north, and Broken Top and Mount Bachelor to the south. Most of the surrounding volcanoes consist of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) lavas; only South and Middle Sister have an abundance of silicic rocks such as andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. Mafic magma is less viscous; it produces lava flows and is less prone to explosive eruptions than silicic magma.

The Mount Bachelor volcanic chain, southeast of South Sister, consists of Mount Bachelor, which is the largest and northernmost volcano of the group, and a series of cinder cones, lava flows, and three shield volcanoes. The chain runs for and encompasses an area of about , trending from north to south. Its volcanoes show significant variation in size and shape, ranging from steep cones produced by mild explosive activity to the gently sloping profiles of shield volcanoes. Volcanic vents within the locale show north–northwest–north–northeast-trending trends, which correspond to normal faults (where one side of the fault moves downward relative to the other) in the region, including one at the Bachelor chain&#x27;s southern end. The Bachelor chain shows that much of the Quaternary Cascades in Oregon were produced in short bursts of eruptive activity and that mafic shield volcanoes can erupt at equal rates to stratovolcanoes. The volcanoes within the field are fed by shallow, compartmentalized magma chambers.

A stratovolcano (atop a shield volcano with a symmetrical shape), Mount Bachelor formed between 18,000 and 8,000 years ago. Bachelor is composed of basalt and basaltic andesite, and though its upper volcanic cone formed after its base shield, the two edifices show similar eruptive composition. The mountain has withstood very little alteration as a result of glacial erosion besides a small cirque (an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion) on the northern side of the volcano. Despite the small scale of this erosion, it has extensively altered the northern face of Mount Bachelor, breaking down its lava into fine powder, particularly at the glacier terminus, where the terminal moraine resembles dust. However, the volcano&#x27;s glacier has shrunk in recent decades and may vanish as a result of the warming climate. The volcano&#x27;s summit has a number of clustered, northwest–southeast-trending vents, which erupted block lava flows made of basalt and andesite and only exhibited minor explosive eruptions, as little tephra can be found near the vents at the summit; there is also little pyroclastic rock. There is no summit crater.

Lava flows from Mount Bachelor&#x27;s summit feature phenocrysts including clinopyroxene, olivine (more rare), and plagioclase, with two phases for the clinopyroxene featuring augite and pigeonite. Textures for these eruptive products vary from intersectal to intergranular, seriate to glomeroporphyritic to subophitic, and trachytic to non-aligned.

Bachelor last erupted between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, and is entirely covered with Mazama Ash from the catastrophic eruption of Mount Mazama about 6,845 years ago. There is no geothermal activity at present, though some areas popularly thought to be fumaroles are caused by air movement through the porous structure. Several are near the top of the Pine Marten chairlift and occasionally present a hazard to skiers and snowboarders where the snow is undermined.

=== Subfeatures ===
Mount Bachelor is associated with a number of pyroclastic cones and shield volcanoes. Nearby cones include Dry Butte, Egan Cone, Katsuk Butte, Kwolh Butte, Lolah Butte, Lumrum Butte, Red Crater, Sheridan Mountain, Siah Butte, Talapus Butte, Three Trappers, and Tot Mountain. Shield volcanoes within the vicinity of Bachelor include Sheridan Mountain, Lookout Mountain, and Kwohl Butte.

== Eruptive history ==

The Mount Bachelor Chain has shown activity during the Pleistocene and the Holocene, mostly consisting of effusive eruptions with a small number of explosive eruptions yielding agglutinate spatter cones, volcanic bombs, and scoria. Within the Bachelor chain, mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) eruptive activity consisting mostly of lava flows and tephra fall took place over four discrete periods, beginning approximately 18,000 to 15,000 years ago as a Pleistocene glacier in the area began to retreat. During this first eruptive episode, the majority of activity occurred in the center of the chain, forming the Sheridan Mountain shield volcano. The first vents to erupt, subglacial volcanoes beneath an ice sheet west of Sparks Lake in the northwestern segment of the chain, interacted with water to produce violent explosive eruptions that ejected pyroclastic rock, which was deposited into the lakebed. Hyaloclastite deposits and thick lava flows with ice also formed in this area, along with the Talapus and Katsuk Buttes from scoria produced by later, milder Strombolian eruptions (which eject incandescent cinder, lapilli, and volcanic bombs).

The second eruptive period consisted of explosive eruptions, which constructed scoria cones and lava flows to the south of Sheridan Mountain, known as the Siah Butte vents. These extend to the south end of the chain. The third period produced the shield volcano beneath Mount Bachelor out of basaltic andesite, later constructing its summit, in addition to a shield volcano that is topped by the Kwohl Butte. ʻAʻā lava erupted from Mount Bachelor during this third period coursed down its northern and northwestern sides. By 12,000 years ago, Mount Bachelor was close to its current size, as the oldest moraines from glaciers on the mountain (which are covered by lava flows from this third eruptive episode) can be dated to this time period. The current edifice at Mount Bachelor had been finished by about 10,000 years ago, followed by a gap in eruptive activity that lasted for 2,000 years. The latest eruptive activity within the chain yielded scoria cones and lava flows, including the Egan cone, which can be observed on Mount Bachelor&#x27;s lower northern flank. Due to the presence of Mazama Ash on the northern side of the volcano, no eruptive activity is likely to have happened since 7,700 years ago.

In total, the Mount Bachelor chain has produced of eruptive material, including Mount Bachelor&#x27;s volume at . Stratigraphic and paleomagnetic studies suggest that Bachelor&#x27;s volume was produced in as little as 1,500 years.

=== Potential hazards ===
Listed at a &quot;moderate&quot; threat level by the United States Geological Survey, Mount Bachelor poses little threat of becoming an active volcano in the near future. It may be part of a monogenetic volcanic field, meaning that the volcano only underwent one long series of eruptions before stopping activity altogether, but it may just be inactive, and it could erupt in the future. It remains unclear whether Mount Bachelor is merely dormant or completely extinct.

The Bachelor volcanic chain lies within a lava flow hazard zone that exists in central Oregon, and eruptions from this field of mafic volcanoes may produce eruptions of tephra and lava flows extending for from their source vents. Within areas of the vents, tephra may form deposits with thicknesses of up to , though they only reach thicknesses of at further distances beyond . Because lava flows move slowly, they can be outmaneuvered by animals and humans, though they do pose a threat to streams and rivers, which they may dam or divert, leading to potential flood risks. If Mount Bachelor were to erupt, it would significantly affect the ski industry on the volcano, endangering visitors. An eruption from Mount Bachelor, the Three Sisters to the north, or another nearby vent in the Mount Bachelor Chain may be unlikely, but any would pose threats to the ski area.

== Human history ==

Mount Bachelor is so called because it &quot;stands apart&quot; from the Three Sisters, a group of three volcanic mountains that are northwest of Mount Bachelor. In early days Bachelor Butte was frequently called &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;, or &quot;Mount Brother&quot;, but both eventually fell out of use.

Around the time of World War II, 90,000 soldiers were stationed to train at Camp Abbot near Bend. During the war, Bend&#x27;s community depended on sawmills and agriculture, with a small ski area opening at Mount Bachelor in 1941. In 1950, the Shevlin-Hixon mill closed, leaving hundreds unemployed before it was re-expanded several years later. By 1958, the ski hill had grown into a ski resort, after the fundraising of start-up costs by the Bend Skyliners Mountaineering Club, with the installation of the first chair lift in 1962 and the attainment of a 30-year special use permit from the United States Forest Service. Expansion continued into the 1970s, with the ski area receiving 257,000 visitors between 1974 and 1975, and more than 500,000 between 1982 and 1983.

The resort developers were concerned that skiing on a butte might be perceived by consumers as &quot;small-time&quot; and so named their resort Mount Bachelor. Over time the popularity of the ski area led to the name Mount Bachelor coming into popular usage, and in a divided decision, the Oregon Geographic Names Board voted to change the name from Bachelor Butte to Mount Bachelor.

In the 1980s, struggles of the homebuilding and lumber industries meant that Deschutes County saw a 15 percent unemployment rate, but construction of a local mall, a chair to the top of Mount Bachelor, and the High Desert Museum helped the economy improve with time. In 2013, the United States Forest Service approved a new master plan for further development of the resort, including a mountain bike park, more chair lifts, more trails, a zip line, and improved lodge amenities.

The volcano&#x27;s summit hosts the Mount Bachelor Observatory, located at an elevation of above sea level, and maintained by a research group at the University of Washington Bothell and the ski resort. Research at the observatory investigates long-range transport of pollution from the Asian continent, measuring chemical features of plumes that reach the Pacific Northwest.

== Recreation ==

Mount Bachelor ski area operates a chairlift during the summer as well as during the ski season (weather permitting), making it the only major Cascade volcano with a chairlift to the summit. Nationally known, the resort is one of the largest in the Pacific Northwest with a skiable area of and a vertical drop of , in addition to six terrain parks. The resort represents a center of winter recreational activities within Deschutes County, operating within the Deschutes National Forest and partnering with the United States Forest Service to offer activities while preserving the Oregon Cascades and the forest area. The resort offers interpretive tours with a naturalist on local flora and fauna, in addition to snowshoeing, snowboarding, snow tubing, dog sledding, and department stores. During the summer, fishing is a popular activity in the local lakes and streams, as is hiking and camping.

Climbing to the top of Mount Bachelor follows a trail that begins at an elevation of and gains to reach the summit. A single-track trail, it traverses over lava from the volcano, which appears in jagged formations. The volcano&#x27;s summit offers views of the rest of the Mount Bachelor chain to the south, in addition to Lookout Mountain, the Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood, and Mount Adams in Washington state.

<doc id="288187" wikidata="Q1568875" url="?curid=288187" title="1986 World Series">
<text>The 1986 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1986 season. The 83rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion New York Mets and the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox. The Mets won the series in seven games, claiming their second World Series title and first since 1969.

The series is best remembered for its Game 6, which saw the Mets rally from a two-run deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning, despite having two outs and no one on base. The Red Sox, who held a 3–2 series lead, were twice one strike away from securing the championship, but failed to close out the inning as the Mets won off an error by Boston first baseman Bill Buckner. Due to the Mets claiming the series in Game 7, the Game 6 collapse entered baseball lore as part of the Curse of the Bambino superstition used to explain the Red Sox&#x27;s championship drought between 1918 and 2004.

The 1986 World Series marked the second time, after the previous year&#x27;s series, in which the winning team lost the first two games of the series at home. It was also the first World Series to use the designated hitter only in games played at the American League representative&#x27;s stadium, a policy that was maintained until the National League&#x27;s adoption of the DH in 2022.

==Background==
===New York Mets===
The New York Mets finished the regular season with a franchise-best record of 108–54, winning the National League East division by games over the division rival Philadelphia Phillies. They then won a tightly contested 1986 National League Championship Series against the Houston Astros, 4 games to 2, clinching the series with a 7–6, 16-inning win in Game 6. On July 19, Mets&#x27; infielder Tim Teufel and pitchers Rick Aguilera, Bobby Ojeda, and Ron Darling were arrested after fighting with policemen outside a bar in Houston. Just three days later, the Mets played a game in Cincinnati that saw Ray Knight, Darryl Strawberry, and Kevin Mitchell get ejected, forcing starting catcher Gary Carter to play third base and the Mets to play a pitcher in the outfield, with lefty Jesse Orosco and right-hander Roger McDowell alternating between the pitcher&#x27;s mound and the outfield as needed. Despite the adversity, the Mets won the game, 6–3 in 14 innings, on a three-run homer by Howard Johnson.

===Boston Red Sox===
Boston went 95–66 during the season, winning the American League East division by games over their biggest nemesis, the New York Yankees, marking the first time since that the Red Sox and the Yankees finished first and second in the standings.

The gritty play of eventual ALCS MVP Marty Barrett and Rich Gedman; clutch hitting from veterans Jim Rice, Wade Boggs, Don Baylor, Dwight Evans and Dave Henderson; and quality starting pitching, especially from 1986 American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, Bruce Hurst and Oil Can Boyd, pushed the Red Sox to the World Series. The team&#x27;s defining moment occurred in Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels. With the Angels leading three games to one in the best-of-seven series and their top reliever Donnie Moore on the mound, the Sox needed a last-out miracle home run from Henderson to survive Game 5; they later loaded the bases and got the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly from Henderson off Moore in the 11th. The Angels never recovered from this blow, and with Boston capitalizing on some defensive miscues by the Angels, and clutch performances by some of their big name players (namely Rice and Clemens in the deciding game), the Red Sox clinched the pennant with a seven-game series win.

==Summary==

: Postponed from October 26 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Just as they did against Houston in the National League Championship Series, the Mets opened the World Series by taking a 1–0 defeat. Boston&#x27;s Bruce Hurst dominated the Mets with his forkball and looping curve, allowing only four hits over eight innings to get the win. In the bottom of the sixth, Hurst got Ray Knight to ground into an inning-ending double play and thwart a scoring opportunity for the Mets.

New York&#x27;s Ron Darling was equally effective, yielding only one unearned run in the seventh inning when second baseman Tim Teufel committed an error by letting a ground ball from Rich Gedman go through his legs, allowing Jim Rice to score from second. Red Sox closer Calvin Schiraldi, acquired from the Mets in the previous offseason, walked Darryl Strawberry to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning. However, Schiraldi got Knight to force out Strawberry at second base and then got Wally Backman to fly out to left field. With two outs, Danny Heep pinch hit for Rafael Santana. Schiraldi worked Heep to a 2–2 count and then struck him out swinging to solidify the victory.

Mets&#x27; legend Tom Seaver, now a member of the Red Sox, received a standing ovation from the Shea Stadium fans during the Game 1 introductions. Seaver did not pitch in the series because of a knee injury.

===Game 2===


Game 2 figured to be a classic pitching matchup, between the Mets&#x27; young phenom Dwight Gooden and Boston&#x27;s own young pitching sensation Roger Clemens, but neither pitcher went beyond five innings. The Red Sox scored first in the top of the third inning, following a leadoff walk to Spike Owen, when Keith Hernandez fielded a Clemens bunt, but threw it away trying to catch Owen at second base. Wade Boggs then drove in Owen with a double, Marty Barrett drove in Clemens with a single, and Bill Buckner drove in Boggs with a single to give the Sox a 3–0 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Mets had men on second and third base for Wally Backman, who grounded up the middle, plating Rafael Santana. Hernandez then grounded out, allowing Gooden to score and bring the Mets within one run.

In the top of the fourth inning, Dave Henderson, the hero of the ALCS, drove the second pitch from Gooden to left-center field for a home run. Dwight Evans followed with a two-run home run in the top of the fifth inning, bringing the score to 6–2. Although Clemens had a comfortable lead going into the bottom of the fifth, he was pulled in favor of Steve Crawford after facing three batters, leaving runners on first and third. Crawford promptly gave up a single to Gary Carter that scored Backman, cutting the deficit to three runs. Crawford struck out Darryl Strawberry and got Danny Heep to ground out, but this left Clemens with a no decision.

Gooden was relieved by Rick Aguilera in the sixth inning. Aguilera loaded the bases in the seventh, and after consecutive RBI singles by Henderson and Owen, was pulled in favor of Jesse Orosco, who shut down the Red Sox over the next two innings.

The Red Sox were not done, however. Facing Sid Fernandez, pitching in relief with runners on first and second base in the ninth inning, Boggs drove in Henderson with a double to make the score 9–3. The Mets were unable to recover from this deficit, and took the loss, giving Boston a 2–0 advantage heading to Fenway Park.

===Game 3===


The Mets started well when Lenny Dykstra led off the game with a home run. After two singles, Gary Carter followed with an RBI double, and Danny Heep drove in two runners with a single to give the Mets a 4–0 lead in the first inning. After the rocky start, Red Sox starter Oil Can Boyd settled down, but Bob Ojeda pitched well and Boston was unable to overcome their early deficit. In his first at bat of the World Series, Boston&#x27;s Don Baylor almost homered in the second inning but hit the Green Monster, resulting in a double.

Ojeda gave up an RBI single to Marty Barrett in the bottom of the third inning, but this would be the only Boston run of the game. Carter drove in two runners with a bases-loaded single in the seventh inning, and Ray Knight drove in Darryl Strawberry, who had singled and moved to third on two wild pitches, with a double in the eighth inning off of Joe Sambito. Roger McDowell pitched the final two frames to seal a 7–1 Mets victory.

===Game 4===


Ron Darling faced off against Boston&#x27;s Al Nipper, as the Mets looked to tie the Series. Neither starter allowed a run until the top of the fourth inning, when Gary Carter ripped a two-run home run over the Green Monster and Ray Knight drove in Darryl Strawberry, who had doubled after the home run, with a single. In the top of the seventh inning, Boston right fielder Dwight Evans almost robbed Lenny Dykstra of a two-run home run only for the ball to bounce out of his glove and over the wall. TV replay showed Evans taking off his hat and leaning against the wall in disappointment and frustration. Carter hit a solo shot in the top of the eighth inning, both Dykstra&#x27;s and Carter&#x27;s second home run came off of Steve Crawford.

In the eighth inning, the Red Sox scored two runs on an Evans single and a Dave Henderson sacrifice fly off of Roger McDowell, but it was not enough, and the Mets evened the series at two games apiece to ensure a return to New York.

===Game 5===


The Red Sox struck first in the second when Dave Henderson tripled with one out off of Dwight Gooden and scored on Spike Owen&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Dwight Evans&#x27;s RBI single next inning with two on made it 2–0 Red Sox. In the fifth, Jim Rice hit a leadoff triple and scored on Don Baylor&#x27;s single. After Evans singled, Sid Fernandez relieved Gooden and allowed an RBI double to Henderson. Bruce Hurst pitched shutout innings before Tim Teufel&#x27;s home run in the eighth put the Mets on the board. In the ninth, Mookie Wilson doubled with two outs and scored on Rafael Santana&#x27;s single before Hurst struck out Lenny Dykstra to end the game as the Red Sox&#x27;s 4–2 gave them a 3–2 series lead heading back to New York.

===Game 6===

The series returned to Shea Stadium for Game 6, with the Mets facing elimination. Bob Ojeda, the winner of Game 3, returned to the mound for New York. The Red Sox countered with their ace Roger Clemens, who despite the team&#x27;s victory in his Game 2 start did not factor into the decision as he was pulled from the game in the fifth inning.

In the first two innings, Boston took a quick 2–0 lead on RBI base hits from Dwight Evans and Marty Barrett. Those would be the only runs Ojeda allowed in six innings The Mets tied the score in the fifth inning on a single from Ray Knight and a run-scoring double play by Danny Heep, in his last at-bat as a Met. The game was briefly paused in the top of the first, as actor and Mets fan Michael Sergio parachuted onto the field wearing a flag proclaiming &quot;Go Mets&quot;. He was immediately arrested by security after landing.

After the Mets left the go-ahead run on base in the sixth, the Red Sox came to bat in the top of the seventh against New York reliever Roger McDowell. Barrett started off the inning by drawing a walk, then advanced to second on a groundout by Bill Buckner. Jim Rice then hit a ground ball to third that Knight misplayed, putting runners on the corners with one out. McDowell then got Evans to ground out to the left side, but since Boston had called for a hit-and-run, the Mets were unable to convert a double play and get out of the inning; Barrett scored on the groundout to give the Red Sox the lead. The Mets avoided further damage, though, as Rice was thrown out at home after trying to score from second on a single by Rich Gedman for the third out.

In the top of the eighth, McDowell walked Dave Henderson to start the inning. After Spike Owen laid down a sacrifice bunt, advancing Henderson to second, the pitcher&#x27;s spot was due next. Although Clemens had struck out eight Mets batters and had only allowed one earned run to this point in the game, manager John McNamara decided to call for a pinch hitter. Despite having power hitting veteran Don Baylor on his bench, McNamara chose to send up rookie Mike Greenwell as he felt the matchup against McDowell favored him. Greenwell responded by striking out on three pitches. After intentionally walking Wade Boggs next, McDowell walked Barrett to load the bases. Jesse Orosco came in to face Buckner, inducing a first-pitch fly out to end the inning.

It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to Bob Costas on an MLB Network program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens &quot;begged out&quot; of the game. Regardless of who was really telling the truth, the Red Sox had been warming up closer Calvin Schiraldi in the prior innings and, with him ready, McNamara
brought him in to pitch the eighth.


Pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli, batting for Orosco, led off the inning with a single. Lenny Dykstra then reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. Wally Backman followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked Keith Hernandez to load the bases for Gary Carter. Schiraldi ran up a 3–0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, Darryl Strawberry stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run, but flied out to end the inning.

After the Red Sox failed to score against Rick Aguilera in the top of the ninth, the Mets came up with a chance to win the game. Knight started the inning by drawing a walk off Schiraldi. Mookie Wilson was then asked to lay down a bunt to try to move the runner up to second. The bunt landed directly in front of home plate and catcher Gedman saw he had a play at second and threw there to try and get the lead runner. His throw was high, however, and pulled shortstop Owen off the base long enough for Knight to slide in safely. Owen, Barrett, and McNamara argued that second base umpire Jim Evans made the wrong call, with McNamara saying he could not have seen Owen&#x27;s foot land back on the bag, but television replays showed that Knight&#x27;s hand touched just before Owen got his foot back down.

With a runner now in scoring position and still nobody out, Howard Johnson came on to pinch hit. Mets manager Davey Johnson had been expected by the Red Sox to call for a bunt in order to move Knight to third base, where he could score on a deep fly ball, but the play was not called and Johnson struck out. Schiraldi then got Mazzilli out on a fly ball to left, failing to advance Knight to third, and followed that up with another fly out off the bat of Dykstra to end the inning and move the game to extra innings.

In the visiting tenth, Henderson hit Aguilera&#x27;s second pitch of the inning out of the park for a 4–3 Boston lead. After getting Owen to strike out, the first of two opportunities for McNamara to utilize his bench, where he had several pinch-hitting options including Baylor still available, came up with the pitcher&#x27;s spot now due. McNamara, however, sent Schiraldi to the plate despite having both Joe Sambito and Bob Stanley, the latter having not recorded a single earned run in the postseason to that point, in the bullpen ready to go. Aguilera retired Schiraldi on a strikeout for the second out.

Boggs then followed with a double, and Barrett drove him in with a single to give the Red Sox an insurance run and a 5–3 lead. The second chance for McNamara to use his bench followed. The veteran first baseman Buckner was the next batter, and in many cases where Boston would be leading late in games McNamara would take Buckner out and replace him with Dave Stapleton at first base, as he had done in all three previous Red Sox victories in this series. This time, he did not, even after Aguilera drilled the veteran first baseman in the hip with a pitch. Rice, the next batter, ended the inning with a flyout to Mazzilli.

When asked later about his decision to leave Buckner in the game, McNamara initially said that he felt that he deserved to stay on the field for the potential final out to preserve the victory and the championship. Buckner, after all, was the third-oldest Red Sox player behind Baylor and Tom Seaver, (who was not on the postseason roster), and was an 18-year veteran who had only seen action in one prior World Series, which came when he was a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1974 World Series. Years later, McNamara changed his story and said that the reason why had nothing to do with sentimentality and instead said that Stapleton, who said McNamara&#x27;s decision cost the Red Sox the series, was not a reliable defender and that his teammates had taken to calling him &quot;Shaky&quot; as a result; in spite of McNamara&#x27;s assertion, Stapleton had only committed one error at first base since Buckner joined the Red Sox in 1984 and, in his last two full seasons at first base, had recorded fielding percentages of .991 and .992 respectively.

Needing to rally for the second time in three innings, and now having to overcome a two-run deficit, the Mets&#x27; first two batters in the tenth went quietly against Schiraldi. Backman flew out to left, and Hernandez flew out to center. With Carter now New York&#x27;s last hope, the words &quot;Congratulations Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions&quot; briefly and accidentally flashed on the scoreboard.

The celebration, however, was put on hold as Carter singled to bring the tying run to the plate. Had he not come out in the ninth inning, Strawberry would have been the next batter. However, Mazzilli had taken his place in the field when Aguilera was brought in to pitch the ninth inning; as a result of the double switch, the pitcher&#x27;s spot was now due and Johnson called for utility man Kevin Mitchell to pinch hit for Aguilera, who stood to lose the game as the pitcher of record unless the Mets somehow rallied to at least tie the game.

An anecdotal story about the sequence of events that followed, which has been relayed several times over the years and denied by Mitchell in the years following, says that Mitchell had left the dugout and gone back to the Mets&#x27; clubhouse after Hernandez flew out in order to book a flight home after the game and had taken his uniform off. Hernandez, who had himself gone to the clubhouse after recording the second out, later said on a 2023 episode of &quot;The Rich Eisen Show&quot; that the story was half true; Mitchell was in the clubhouse with him, but was still in uniform when he was called to pinch hit. Despite the rush, the rookie utility man came through with a single of his own, advancing Carter to second and putting the tying runs on base with Knight, now the potential winning run, coming up.

Schiraldi got two quick strikes on the Mets&#x27; third baseman, who had already driven in one run so far. However, with his team within one strike of that elusive championship, he could not finish the job as Knight singled to left-center. Carter scored from second standing up and the speedy Mitchell advanced to third. Finally, McNamara decided his closer had seen enough and called for the veteran Stanley to try to close out the game. Some later speculated as to why Stanley, who had been warmed up by the time the tenth inning began, had not been called upon earlier instead of McNamara asking for a third inning out of Schiraldi, who had already blown the save in the eighth.

The Mets&#x27; next batter was Wilson, who had recorded one hit and reached on a fielder&#x27;s choice after the bad throw by Gedman in the ninth. Six pitches into the at-bat, with the count even at two balls and two strikes, Stanley threw a breaking ball that broke sharply inside and bounced in front of Wilson, who fell down trying to avoid it. Gedman tried to field the ball but could not, and it rolled to the backstop. From his knees, Wilson signaled to Mitchell to come down from third and he scored easily, tying the score at five.

Knight advanced to second on the wild pitch. Several times during the ensuing series of pitches, second baseman Barrett realized that Knight was straying too far from the base and that if he could get Stanley to turn and throw to him, he would have an easy pickoff play and the inning could have ended there. Despite his best attempts, Barrett never was able to get Stanley to hear him as the sellout crowd at Shea Stadium was drowning him out, and Stanley instead chose to focus on getting Wilson out.

On the tenth pitch of the at-bat, Stanley finally got Wilson to put the ball in play, forcing a ground ball to first base. Buckner had been playing near the foul line to give himself a better chance to get the speedy Wilson out on a ground ball, but when he went to field the ball it went under his glove and through his legs into right field. Knight scored from second, completing the rally and giving the Mets a 6-5 victory to tie the series and force a seventh game. 

In the 2011 ESPN Films documentary &quot;Catching Hell&quot;, Buckner explained how, years after the event, he realized from watching a television replay how he had missed the ball. He said, when he played in the field, he liked to wear a very loose glove – i.e. one that was floppy. When he moved to his left to try to field Wilson&#x27;s grounder and then stopped, the momentum of the leftward-moving loose glove caused the glove to close. The ball then went just past the right side of the glove. In his 2023 appearance with Rich Eisen, Hernandez remarked that, because Buckner had spent a significant part of his career playing in the National League, he was more than familiar with Wilson and his baserunning speed. As such he took his normal position near the line to give himself the best chance to get the out at first; Hernandez said that if it was any other hitter in the Mets lineup but Wilson, Buckner would have been able to get the out. 

After the top of the tenth, NBC began setting up in the visiting clubhouse for what they believed was the inevitable postgame victory celebration. The Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along with several bottles of champagne, team co-owner/president Jean Yawkey and pitcher Bruce Hurst (who had already been named the series MVP by the sportswriters) with Bob Costas ready to preside over the presentation. However, after Stanley&#x27;s wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the Red Sox returned. Costas later recalled the removal of all the equipment for the postgame celebration as being &quot;like a scene change in a Broadway musical. In, out, gone, not a trace.&quot;

In 2011, MLB Network ranked this as the third greatest game of the preceding 50 years.
It was the last World Series game to end on an error until Game 4 of the 2020 World Series.

In the years that have followed, many fans regardless of team allegiance consider Game 6 of the 1986 World Series to be one of the greatest games ever played in the history of professional baseball.

===Game 7===
In the hours that followed the end of Game 6, a rainstorm passed over the New York metropolitan area. The field at Shea Stadium was rendered unplayable and Game 7 was postponed one night, moving to Monday, October 27. 

The pitching matchup was originally supposed to feature Ron Darling, the starter for Games 1 and 4 who had yet to allow an earned run in the World Series, going up against Oil Can Boyd, who started and lost Game 3 by giving up six runs. The rainout offered a chance for both managers to adjust their pitching strategies if they desired. Mets
manager Davey Johnson, who had employed a three man rotation for the series consisting of Darling, Dwight Gooden, and Bob Ojeda, chose to stick with Darling, who would be pitching on his normal four days rest. Red Sox manager John McNamara, however, decided to change his plans. The rainout enabled Bruce Hurst, who had only allowed two runs against the Mets in his wins in Games 1 and 5, to get a third day of rest before the series ended; since he was now available to use as a starter again, McNamara opted to start him ahead of Boyd. 

After Boyd received word he was not starting the final game of the series, he went down into the visitors&#x27; clubhouse and remained in there alone for some time. McNamara dispatched pitching coach Bill Fischer to find Boyd, and Fischer discovered that the Oil Can had consumed a great deal of alcohol and was in no condition to function, much less play. Fischer moved Boyd into the manager&#x27;s office where he locked the door and left him for the entire game.

In the 500th game played in World Series history, Boston got to Darling early, recording three runs in the second inning. Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman hit back to back home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave Henderson with a single for a 3–0 Red Sox lead.

Gedman&#x27;s home run was noteworthy for several reasons: It occurred on the first pitch after a delay of just over three minutes during which portable stands down the first base line had to be restored after several fans reaching for a foul ball had caused them to collapse. The subsequent pitch by Darling, which came on a two-strike count (1–2), led to Gedman&#x27;s home run. However, the ball was almost caught by Darryl Strawberry, who was reaching over the right-field wall. Fortunately for the Red Sox, the ball fell out of Strawberry&#x27;s glove and cleared the fence for a 2–0 Boston lead. If Strawberry had recorded the out, the inning may have ended with only one Boston run instead of three, as three batters later, Red Sox pitcher Bruce Hurst would have stepped to the plate to bat with two outs instead of in a sacrifice situation, which he successfully converted to set up Boggs&#x27; run-scoring hit.

The Mets, meanwhile, could not muster much against Hurst and through three innings had only recorded one hit.

In the fourth Henderson reached after Darling hit him with a pitch. After Spike Owen flew out, Hurst laid down a bunt that moved Henderson into scoring position. Johnson then lifted Darling from the game and brought in Sid Fernandez to face Boggs and the leading hitter of the series, Marty Barrett. Boggs managed to draw a walk, but Fernandez retired Barrett on a fly ball to right field to end the inning.

The Mets still did not have an answer for Hurst through the fourth and fifth innings, going down in order in both frames. The Red Sox, conversely, went down in order against Fernandez in the fifth and sixth, which kept the deficit at three. In the bottom of the inning, the Mets were finally able to break through against their series nemesis and turn the tide in their favor.

After Hurst got the first out when Rafael Santana grounded out, Lee Mazzilli came up to pinch-hit for Fernandez and singled. Mookie Wilson followed with a single of his own, and second baseman Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez then drove the lead runners in with a single, and Wally Backman came in to run for Teufel representing the tying run.

Gary Carter was the next batter and he lifted a fly ball to Evans in right. The veteran outfielder had to dive in order to catch it, and was unable to come up with the catch. Right field umpire Dale Ford did not immediately rule that there was no catch, which crossed up Hernandez on the basepath; since the ball was ruled to be in play, he had to attempt to advance to second base. Since there was a delay in the ruling, Evans was able to throw back into the infield and force out Hernandez at second. Backman managed to score on the play to tie the game, but the Mets lost the opportunity to have Darryl Strawberry come up with a chance to drive in the go ahead run; instead, Hurst got him to fly out and escaped further damage. Hurst was lifted for a pinch hitter after this inning.
Roger McDowell entered the game for the Mets in the seventh and retired pinch-hitter Tony Armas, Boggs, and Barrett in order. McNamara called upon Game 6 loser Calvin Schiraldi to pitch the home half of the inning, despite his struggles in the extended outing he had two nights earlier. The day of rest did not help, as he immediately surrendered a home run to Ray Knight (playing in what would be his final game as a Met) leading off, giving the Mets their first lead of the game. Lenny Dykstra came up as a pinch-hitter and singled, then advanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Santana. After McDowell successfully moved Santana into scoring position, McNamara decided to take the ball from Schiraldi and brought in Joe Sambito. After putting Wilson on intentionally, Sambito walked Backman to load the bases and Hernandez followed with a sacrifice fly to score Santana and give the Mets a three-run advantage. Bob Stanley recorded the final out by getting Carter to ground out to Owen at shortstop.

Down to their last six outs, Boston had not had a runner reach base since Boggs&#x27; walk in the fourth inning. Jim Rice had recorded the last Red Sox hit, a single in the third, but had been thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. They tried to rally against McDowell in the eighth and Bill Buckner led the inning off with a single. Rice followed with another single, and Evans doubled after that to make the score 6–5 and bring Gedman to the plate with the potential go-ahead run. Needing to stop the rally, Johnson pulled McDowell in favor of his closer Jesse Orosco to face the Red Sox catcher. After inducing a line drive to second that Backman caught for the first out, Orosco struck out Henderson for the second out and then got Don Baylor, batting for Owen, to ground out and end the Boston rally.

In the bottom of the eighth, the Mets finally were able to put the game away at the expense of Game 4 loser Al Nipper. Strawberry led the inning off with a solo home run, and Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher&#x27;s spot, but Orosco not only came to bat but also managed to drive Knight in as he swung away on a fake bunt attempt to extend the lead back to three. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.

Staked to an 8–5 lead, Orosco faced Ed Romero, who took over at shortstop for Owen in the eighth, to start the top of the ninth and retired him on a foul pop. Boggs then grounded out to Backman at second, leaving Barrett as the last hope for the Red Sox. Orosco worked a 2–2 count before getting Barrett to swing and miss, then tossed his glove high into the air and dropped to his knees as the Mets all converged on the mound to celebrate their world championship victory.

McDowell was awarded the victory, with Orosco garnering his second save of the series. Schiraldi was saddled with the loss for the second consecutive game, having been charged with all three runs the Mets scored in the seventh in one-third of an inning. He gave up seven runs in his final two outings of the series.

Due to the rainout, this game coincided with another sporting event taking place in the New York metropolitan area that night. The New York Giants were taking on the Washington Redskins at Giants Stadium on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, with the kickoff happening approximately thirty minutes after Game 7 started. Many of the fans at the football game, which sold out, were following along with the baseball game and cheering loudly during high points of the game. When Orosco recorded the final out, the Giants were driving late in the third quarter and a collective roar went up from the crowd as the stadium scoreboard operator flashed “METS WIN” on the board to inform the fans of the result. The Giants would later win Super Bowl XXI, following in the Mets lead in winning their championship.

==Awards and statistical summary==
The World Series MVP was awarded to Ray Knight, who led the Mets&#x27; regulars with nine hits and a .393 average in the series. He also recorded five runs batted in, second to Gary Carter&#x27;s nine.

Marty Barrett, in a losing effort, recorded 13 hits — tying the single World Series record — and a .433 average. Dave Henderson recorded ten hits and a .400 average, while Jim Rice and Wade Boggs each had nine hits.

Despite the struggles both pitchers faced in Game 7, both Bruce Hurst and Ron Darling were the best starting pitchers on their respective staffs during the World Series. Both finished with 2–0 records and sub-2.00 ERAs, with Darling&#x27;s 1.35 ERA topping Hurst&#x27;s 1.96 although Hurst issued fewer walks and struck out more batters. Hurst had been voted MVP prior to the Mets&#x27; Game 6 comeback, but that comeback, and the Mets&#x27; Game 7 victory, kept Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees as the only World Series MVP from a losing team.

The only other starter to win a decision was Bob Ojeda. Steve Crawford won Game 2 for the Red Sox while Rick Aguilera and Roger McDowell won Games 6 and 7 for the Mets. In fact, the record for the starting pitchers for both teams outside of Darling and Hurst was 1–4, with two of those losses recorded by Mets ace Dwight Gooden. His counterpart on the Red Sox, eventual Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, did not record a decision in either of his starts.

==Postscript==
Both the Mets and Red Sox would go without reaching the World Series for some time. The Red Sox would not return until 2004, where they would finally break through and win their first title since 1918. They have gone on to win three additional world championships, most recently in 2018. As of 2024, this remains the most recent time the Red Sox have lost a World Series title.

The Mets have returned to the World Series twice since 1986. In 2000, the first time since 1956 that two teams from the same city faced each other in the World Series, the Mets lost to the New York Yankees. The Mets returned in 2015, only to lose again to the Kansas City Royals.

Neither Davey Johnson nor John McNamara would manage in another World Series. Johnson stayed on with the Mets until 1990, leading them to another postseason berth in 1988 that ended with a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series. He was fired early in the 1990 season. Johnson would later lead the Cincinnati Reds to the playoffs in 1995, then followed that with two more playoff runs with the Baltimore Orioles in 1996 and 1997. He finished his managerial career in 2013 with the Washington Nationals.

McNamara returned for 1987 with the Red Sox, but the team regressed significantly, finishing with only 78 wins. He would be fired the next year with the Red Sox barely above .500 at the All-Star break, and his successor Joe Morgan led the team to a comeback and division title. He would take over the Cleveland Indians in 1990, but was fired midway through 1991 with the team at 25–52. He would only manage once more after that, an interim position with the California Angels in 1996, before retiring. He died in July 2020 at the age of 88.

Bill Buckner never did win that elusive World Series ring. He would be released by the Red Sox during the 1987 season, then spend the rest of the year with the California Angels. In 1988, he signed with the Kansas City Royals and played more of a reserve role for the last three years of his career, which ended in 1990 after a second stint with the Red Sox. Buckner&#x27;s error made him a scapegoat in Red Sox fans&#x27; eyes for some time afterward, but following their world championship victory in 2004 the fanbase began to embrace him again. In his later years, Buckner developed Lewy body dementia, and he died from complications at the age of 69 in May 2019.

Hedge fund manager and current Mets owner, Steven A. Cohen, revealed in an interview that he currently owns the Buckner ball from Game 6. He has stated that he would donate the ball to the Mets Museum at Citi Field.

In 2020, ESPN named the 1986 World Series the fourth greatest of all time.

On September 14 and 15, 2021, ESPN premiered &quot;Once Upon a Time in Queens&quot;, its four-part &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary about the 1986 World Series, the Mets&#x27; seasons leading up to it and the aftermath. The film is directed by Nick Davis.

Because of the involvement of both of the Yankees&#x27; rivals (both their traditional one and their cross-city counterparts), this World Series was called &quot;(George) Steinbrenner&#x27;s nightmare&quot;. As a result, then-Yankee owner George Steinbrenner wrote articles in the &quot;New York Post&quot; during this Series.

After seven years, this would be the final World Series to use the logo introduced in the 1980 series. Beginning the next year, a new logo in the style of a baseball diamond was introduced. The logo itself would receive minor updates throughout the years. In 1992, gold lettering was added which would remain for the rest of its tenure until it was retired altogether after the 1997 series.

==Composite line score==
1986 World Series (4–3): New York Mets (N.L.) beat Boston Red Sox (A.L.)
==Broadcast==
NBC&#x27;s broadcast of Game 6 did not end until 12:32 a.m. Eastern, causing the first cancellation of an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the show&#x27;s history. The episode, hosted by Rosanna Arquette and scheduled to air live at 11:30 p.m. Eastern, was instead recorded for the studio audience beginning at 1:30 a.m., and aired November 8 with a comedic apology from Ron Darling. (NBC generally no longer schedules first-run &quot;SNL&quot; episodes on the same night as sports coverage.)

NBC&#x27;s broadcast of Game 7 (which went up against a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants held at nearby Giants Stadium on ABC) garnered a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and a 55 share, making it the highest-rated single World Series game to date.

==In popular culture==
In the 1998 film &quot;Rounders&quot;, Matt Damon&#x27;s character (Mike McDermott) references Game 6 while returning into Teddy KGB&#x27;s place in the final scene. &quot;I feel like Buckner walking back into Shea.&quot;

In the 2005 film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, the main character played by Jimmy Fallon, a die hard Red Sox fan, watches a tape of the ending to Game 6 to get over what looks to be his break up with his girlfriend.

The collapse of the Boston Red Sox in Game 6 and Game 7 prompted a series of articles by George Vecsey of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he mentions a &quot;Babe Ruth Curse.&quot; Although it had long been noted that the selling of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees had marked the beginning of a down period in the Red Sox&#x27;s fortunes, this was one of the first instances, if not the first, in which mention of a &quot;curse&quot; was made. The term &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot; was not in common use by the press during the 1920s, nor can it be found through the 1970s, as a search of historical newspapers will illustrate. In fact, even though Vecsey&#x27;s articles mention a &quot;Babe Ruth Curse&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; did not use the phrase &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot; until 1990, the year that Dan Shaughnessy&#x27;s book of the same name and a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article about it were published. Shaughnessy&#x27;s book &quot;The Curse of the Bambino&quot; helped that phrase become a key part of the Red Sox lore in the media thereafter.

The dramatic sixth game was the subject of &quot;Game 6&quot;, a 2005 independent film starring Michael Keaton, based on a 1991 screenplay by novelist Don DeLillo.

&quot;Village Voice&quot; film critic J. Hoberman included Game 6 in his list of the top ten films of 1986.

In his song &quot;Faith and Fear in Flushing Meadows&quot;, twee/folk artist Harry Breitner makes mention of Ray Knight and Mookie Wilson.

The game, or more specifically an infamous jeer that was issued in the game against Darryl Strawberry, was referenced in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; where Bart and Lisa jeer Strawberry the exact same way due to being sore over his forcing Homer to remain on the bench.

NBC&#x27;s telecast of the Series ended with the song &quot;Limelight&quot; from &quot;Stereotomy&quot;, a penultimate album of The Alan Parsons Project.

The Series, and especially Game 6, were referenced in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, which also guest starred former Mets player Keith Hernandez. Hernandez being referred to Game 6 in the episode suggested that he was part of the winning rally, even though he was the 2nd (and final) out of the inning, though Hernandez was a big part of the prior round&#x27;s Game 6 rally in the 9th inning.

In a 1999 episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (&quot;Rayny Day&quot;), Doug Heffernan promises Richie Ianucci that they will watch the Series that is being rerun on TV, only to abandon him for Ray Barone, who invites him to play golf (with Arthur Spooner tagging along) until a rainstorm ends their plans. In another episode from the same year (&quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot;), Doug and his cousin Danny bring up the Series while revisiting their high school years.

In the &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; episode &quot;Mister Softee&quot;, Bill Buckner appears as a guest star and mocks his famous 1986 mishap by missing a crucial catch of a Mookie Wilson-signed baseball. As the episode concludes, he redeems himself by catching a baby thrown from a burning building.

In 2001, playwright David Kruh had his play &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot; premiere at the Boston Lyric Stage. After the 2004 World Series it was rewritten with a happier ending.

In Ron Darling&#x27;s book, &quot;108 Stitches&quot;, he claims that during Game 3. Lenny Dykstra used racial epithets toward Oil Can Boyd. Dykstra sued Darling over this. The case was later dismissed.

In the 2005 film &quot;Bewitched&quot; starring Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman, there&#x27;s a scene in which Jack (Ferrell) asks Isabel (Kidman) if her parents were in the witch business, Isabel answered that both her parents are and that her mother fixed the 1986 World Series.

In the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; episode &quot;Career Day&quot; Cory is embarrassed by his dad Allen&#x27;s presentation of his career as a grocer in front of the class. When he talks to Shawn about this in the lunchroom, he references the Bill Buckner play. &quot;Do you remember that uh, that World Series game where the first baseman let that EASY ground ball go under his legs and his team lost and he was humiliated in front of the entire world? (Shawn replies &quot;Yeah?&quot;) I envy his son.&quot; Later in the episode, Allen uses the same analogy while talking to his wife at home. &quot;Do you remember the World Series where that first baseman let that grounder dribble through his uh, legs? (Yeah?) I envy him.&quot;

<text>The  (, literally &quot;Federal Defence&quot;) is the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Germany. The is divided into a military part (armed forces or &quot;Streitkräfte&quot;) and a civil part, the military part consisting of the German Army, German Navy, German Air Force, Joint Support Service, Joint Medical Service, and Cyber and Information Domain Service.

, the had a strength of 180,215 active-duty military personnel and 80,761 civilians, placing it among the 30 largest military forces in the world, and making it the second largest in the European Union behind France. In addition, the has approximately 34,600 reserve personnel (2024). With German military expenditures at $66.8 billion (2023), the is the seventh highest-funded military in the world, though military expenditures have until recently remained low at an average at 1.5% of national GDP, well below the non-binding NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany fulfilled NATO obligations of spending 2% of its GDP on its armed forces. Germany is aiming to expand the to around 203,000 soldiers by 2025 to better cope with increasing responsibilities.

Following concerns from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany announced a major shift in policy, pledging a €100 billion special fund for the Bundeswehrto remedy years of underinvestmentalong with raising the budget to above 2% GDP.

== History ==
=== Founding principles ===
The name was first proposed by former &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; general and Liberal politician Hasso von Manteuffel. The Iron Cross &quot;(Eisernes Kreuz)&quot;, a symbol that has a long association with the military of Germany, is its official emblem. The &quot;Schwarzes Kreuz&quot; is derived from the black cross insignia of the medieval Teutonic knights; since 1813 the symbol has been used to denote a military decoration for all ranks.

When the was established in 1955, its founding principles were based on developing a completely new military force for the defence of West Germany. In this respect the did not consider itself to be a successor to either the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (1921–1935) of the Weimar Republic or Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (1935–1945), and did not adhere to the traditions of any former German military organization. Its official ethos is based on three major themes:
* the aims of the military reformers at the beginning of the 19th century such as Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Clausewitz
* the conduct displayed by members of the military resistance against Adolf Hitler, especially the attempt of Claus von Stauffenberg and Henning von Tresckow to assassinate him.
* its own tradition since 1955.

One of the most visible traditions of the modern is the &quot;Großer Zapfenstreich&quot;. This is a form of military tattoo that has its origins in the &quot;landsknecht&quot; era. The FRG reinstated this formal military ceremony in 1952, three years before the foundation of the . Today it is performed by a military band with 4 fanfare trumpeters and timpani, a corps of drums, up to two escort companies of the &#x27;s &quot;Wachbataillon&quot; (or another deputized unit) and Torchbearers. The &quot;Zapfenstreich&quot; is only performed during national celebrations or solemn public commemorations. It can honour distinguished persons present such as the German federal president, or provide the conclusion to large military exercises.

Another important tradition in the modern German armed forces is the &quot;Gelöbnis&quot;: the solemn oath made by serving professional soldiers, and recruits (and formerly conscripts) during basic training. There are two kinds of oath: a pledge for recruits, and a solemn vow for full-time personnel.

The pledge is made annually on 20 July, the date on which a group of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944. Recruits from the &#x27;s &quot;Wachbataillon&quot; make their vow (&quot;Gelöbnis&quot;) at the Bendlerblock in Berlin. This was the headquarters of the resistance and also where the officers were summarily executed following the failure of the attempt. National commemorations are held nearby within the grounds of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. Similar events also take place across the German Republic. Since 2011, when conscription was suspended, the wording of the ceremonial vow for full-time recruits and volunteer personnel is:

::&quot;&quot;Ich gelobe, der Bundesrepublik Deutschland treu zu dienen und das Recht und die Freiheit des deutschen Volkes tapfer zu verteidigen.&quot;
Serving personnel replace &quot;Ich gelobe&quot;, ...&quot; with &quot;&quot;Ich schwöre&quot;, ...&quot; (&quot;I swear...&quot;).

=== Cold War: 1955–1990 ===

After World War II the responsibility for the security of Germany as a whole rested with the four occupying Allied Powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. Germany had been without armed forces since the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was dissolved following World War II. When the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, it was without a military. Germany remained completely demilitarized and any plans for a German military were forbidden by Allied regulations.

Some naval mine-sweeping units such as the German Mine Sweeping Administration (&quot;Deutscher Minenräumdienst&quot;) continued to exist, but they remained unarmed and under Allied control and did not serve as a national defence force. The Federal Border Protection (&quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;), a mobile, lightly armed police force of 10,000 men, was formed on 14 March 1951 and expanded to 20,000 men on 19 June 1953. A proposal to integrate West German troops with soldiers of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy in a European Defence Community was proposed but never implemented.

There was a discussion among the United States, the United Kingdom and France over the issue of a revived (West) German military. In particular, France was reluctant to allow Germany to rearm in light of recent history (Germany had invaded France twice in living memory, in World War I and World War II, and also defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71). However, after the project for a European Defence Community failed in the French National Assembly in 1954, France agreed to West German accession to NATO and rearmament.

With growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the West, especially after the Korean War, this policy was to be revised. While the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was already secretly rearming, the seeds of a new West German force started in 1950 when former high-ranking German officers were tasked by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to discuss the options for West German rearmament. The results of a meeting in the monastery of Himmerod formed the conceptual base to build the new armed forces in West Germany.

The &quot;Amt Blank&quot; (Blank Agency, named after its director Theodor Blank), the predecessor of the later Federal Ministry of Defence, was formed the same year to prepare the establishment of the future forces. Hasso von Manteuffel, a former general of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and Free Democratic Party politician, submitted the name for the new forces. This name was later confirmed by the West German &quot;Bundestag&quot;.

The was officially established on the 200th birthday of Scharnhorst on 12 November 1955. In personnel and education terms, the most important initial feature of the new German armed forces was to be their orientation as citizen defenders of a democratic state, fully subordinate to the political leadership of the country. A personnel screening committee was created to make sure that the future colonels and generals of the armed forces were those whose political attitude and experience would be acceptable to the new democratic state. There were a few key reformers, such as General Ulrich de Maiziere, General Graf von Kielmansegg, and Graf von Baudissin, who reemphasised some of the more democratic parts of Germany&#x27;s armed forces history in order to establish a solid civil-military basis to build upon.
After an amendment of the Basic Law in 1955, West Germany became a member of NATO. The first public military review took place at Andernach, in January 1956. In 1956, conscription for all men between the ages of 18 and 45 was reintroduced, later augmented by a civil alternative with longer duration (see Conscription in Germany). In response, East Germany formed its own military force, the &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot; (NVA), in 1956, with conscription being established only in 1962. The &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot; was eventually dissolved with the reunification of Germany in 1990. Compulsory conscription was suspendedbut not completely abolished as an alternativein January 2011.

During the Cold War the was the backbone of NATO&#x27;s conventional defence in Central Europe. It had a strength of 495,000 military and 170,000 civilian personnel. Although Germany had smaller armed forces than France and the United States, Cold War historian John Lewis Gaddis assesses the as &quot;perhaps (the) world&#x27;s best army&quot;. The Army consisted of three corps with 12 divisions, most of them heavily armed with tanks and APCs. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; owned significant numbers of tactical combat aircraft and took part in NATO&#x27;s integrated air defence (NATINAD). The Navy was tasked and equipped to defend the Baltic Approaches, to provide escort reinforcement and resupply shipping in the North Sea and to contain the Soviet Baltic Fleet.
During the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, German special forces of the Bundeswehr were deployed as part of a covert operation. During this time, Operation Summer Rain played a significant role. The German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) conducted this secret mission, where special forces were infiltrated from West Germany to Pakistan and then into Afghanistan.

The primary task of these special units was to clandestinely acquire Soviet weapon technology, including armor for combat helicopters, vehicles, landmines, modern ammunition such as uranium rounds, rocket warheads, night vision devices, and navigation technology. Collaboration with the insurgent Mujahideen was central to this covert operation.

During this time the did not take part in combat operations. However, there were a number of large-scale training exercises resulting in operational casualties. The first such incident was in June 1957, when 15 paratroop recruits drowned in the Iller river, Bavaria.

=== German Reunification 1990 ===

At the time of reunification, the German military boasted a manpower of some 585,000 soldiers. As part of the German reunification process, under the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (Two-Plus Four Treaty), which paved the way for reunification, the was to be reduced to 370,000 personnel, of whom no more than 345,000 were to be in the Army and Air Force. This would be Germany&#x27;s contribution to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, and the restrictions would enter into force at the time the CFE treaty would. As a result, the was significantly reduced, and the former East German &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot; (NVA) was disbanded, with a portion of its personnel and materiel being absorbed into the .
About 50,000 &quot;Volksarmee&quot; personnel were integrated into the on 2 October 1990. This figure was rapidly reduced as conscripts and short-term volunteers completed their service. A number of senior officers (but no generals or admirals) received limited contracts for up to two years to continue daily operations. Personnel remaining in the were awarded new contracts and new ranks, dependent on their individual qualification and experience. Many were granted and accepted a lower rank than previously held in the &quot;Volksarmee&quot;.

In general, the unification process of the two militariesunder the slogan &quot;Armee der Einheit&quot; (or &quot;Army of Unity&quot;)has been seen publicly as a major success and an example for other parts of the society.

With the reduction, a large amount of the military hardware of the , as well as of the &quot;Volksarmee&quot;, had to be disposed of. Most of the armoured vehicles and fighter jet aircraft (the &quot;Bundesluftwaffe&quot;due to reunificationwas the only air force in the world that flew both Phantoms and MIGs) were dismantled under international disarmament procedures. Many ships were scrapped or sold, often to the Baltic states or Indonesia (the latter received 39 former &quot;Volksmarine&quot; vessels of various types).

With reunification, all restrictions on the manufacture and possession of conventional arms that had been imposed on the as a condition for West German rearmament were lifted.

Since 1996, Germany also has its own special forces, the &quot;Kommando Spezialkräfte&quot; (Special Forces Command). It was formed after German citizens had to be rescued from the Rwandan genocide by Belgian Para-Commandos as the Special Commands of the Federal Police were not capable of operating in a war zone.

=== Reorientation ===

A major event for the German military was a series of defense spending cuts and the suspension of the compulsory conscription for men in 2011. These were introduced by Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble as part of austerity measures in response to the Great Recession and the European debt crisis. In 2011/12, a major reform of the was announced under Thomas de Maizière, further limiting the number of military bases and soldiers. The land forces of the Bundeswehr would have three large units at divisional level. There are currently five. The number of brigades decreased from eleven to eight.

German military expenditures are lower than comparable countries such as the United Kingdom, or countries of the European Union such as France, especially when taking into account Germany&#x27;s larger population and economy. This discrepancy is often criticized by Germany&#x27;s NATO allies, as far back as Obama-era US Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates.

As one result of the 2014 NATO Wales summit which was attended by both Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen in September 2014, the acknowledged in October chronic equipment problems that rendered its armed forces &quot;unable to deliver its defensive NATO promises&quot;. Among the problems cited were dysfunctional weapons systems, armored vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels unfit for immediate service due to a neglect of maintenance, and serious equipment and spare parts shortages. The situation was so dire in 2016 that it was acknowledged that most of Germany&#x27;s fighter aircraft and combat helicopters were not in deployable condition, although the Air Force had almost 38,000 soldiers, and von der Leyen&#x27;s daycare system to boot.

In 2015, as a result of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Germany announced what was termed &quot;a major increase&quot; in defense spending. In May 2015, the German government approved an increase in defense spending, at the time 1.3% of GDP, by 6.2% over the following five years, allowing the Ministry of Defense to fully modernize the army. The 2015 reform set a required strength of 185,000 soldiers. Plans were also announced to significantly expand the tank fleet to a potential number of 328, order 131 more Boxer armored personnel carriers, increase the submarine fleet, and to develop a new fighter jet to replace the Panavia Tornado. Germany considered increasing the size of the army, and in May 2016 it announced it would spend €130 billion on new equipment by 2030 and add nearly 7,000 soldiers by 2023 in the first German military expansion since the end of the Cold War. In February 2017, the German government announced another expansion, which would increase the number of its professional soldiers by 20,000 by 2024.

=== Coordination with European Partners ===
As a consequence of improved Dutch-German cooperation, since 2014 two of the three Royal Netherlands Army Brigades are under German Command. In 2014, the 11th Airmobile Brigade was integrated into the German Division of fast forces (DSK). The Dutch 43rd Mechanized Brigade will be assigned to the 1st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division of the German army, with the integration starting at the beginning of 2016, and the unit becoming operational at the end of 2019. In February 2016 it was announced that the &quot;Seebatallion&quot; of the German Navy would start to operate under Royal Dutch Navy command. The Dutch-German military cooperation was seen in 2016 by von der Leyen and Dutch Minister of Defence Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert as an example for setting up a European defense union.

According to a policy dictated by von der Leyen in February 2017, the is to play a greater role as &quot;anchor army&quot; for smaller NATO states, by improving coordination between its divisions and smaller members&#x27; Brigades.

A further proposal by Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen, to allow non-German EU nationals to join the , was met in July 2016 by strong opposition, even from her own party.

It was announced in February 2017 that the Czech Republic&#x27;s 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade and Romania&#x27;s 81st Mechanized Brigade would be integrated into Germany&#x27;s 10 Armoured Division and Rapid Response Forces Division.

===Consequences of 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
, the number of active military personnel in the was 183,051. Military expenditure in Germany was at $52.8 billion in 2020.

At the end of February 2022, in light of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a plan to increase the power of the German military, pledging €100 billion ($112.7 billion) of the 2022 budget for the armed forces and repeating his promise to reach the 2% of gross domestic product spending on defense in line with (as editorialized by &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;) NATO &quot;demands&quot;.

According to information from defense politicians of the federal German parliament, representatives of the armaments industry and other experts, in October 2022 the Bundeswehr only had enough ammunition in stock for one or two days during wartime.

A report made by the Ministry of Defence revealed problems in the such as limited preparedness and lack of equipment. In the letter accompanying the report which was sent to the federal German parliament, the Minister of Defence noted that the situation would improve but &quot;closing the gaps takes time&quot;.

== Organisation ==
=== History of organisation ===
With the growing number of missions abroad it was recognized that the required a new command structure. A reform commission under the chairmanship of the former President Richard von Weizsäcker presented its recommendations in spring 2000.

In October 2000 the Joint Support Service, the &quot;Streitkräftebasis&quot;, was established to concentrate logistics and other supporting functions such as military police, supply and communications under one command. Medical support was reorganised with the establishment of the Joint Medical Service. In 2016, the created its youngest branch the Cyber and Information Space Command.

=== Senior leadership ===
The Minister of Defence is supported by the Chief of Defense (CHOD, &quot;Generalinspekteur&quot;) and the service chiefs (&quot;Inspekteure&quot;: Inspector of the Army, Inspector of the Air Force, Inspector of the Navy) and their respective staffs in his or her function as commander-in-chief. The CHOD and the service chiefs form the Military Command Council (&quot;Militärischer Führungsrat&quot;) with functions similar to those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States. Subordinate to the CHOD is the Armed Forces Operational Command (&quot;Einsatzführungskommando&quot;). For smaller missions one of the service HQs (e.g. the Fleet Command) may exercise command and control of forces in missions abroad. The &quot;Bundestag&quot; must approve any foreign deployment by a simple majority. This has led to some discontent with Germany&#x27;s allies about troop deployments e.g. in Afghanistan since parliamentary consent over such issues is relatively hard to achieve in Germany.

=== Combat forces ===
The combat forces of the Army are organised into three combat divisions and participate in multi-national command structures at the corps level. The Air Force maintains three divisions and the Navy is structured into two flotillas. The Joint Support Service and the Joint Medical Service are both organized in four regional commands of identical structure. All of these services also have general commands for training, procurement, and other general issues.

=== Operational Command ===
The Armed Forces Operational Command (&quot;Einsatzführungskommando der Bundeswehr&quot;) is the only joint military command of the Bundeswehr. It controls all missions abroad. The command is located at Henning von Tresckow Kaserne (Schwielowsee) near Potsdam and is headed by a Generalleutnant (3-star general).

=== Mission ===
The role of the is described in the Constitution of Germany (Art. 87a) as absolutely defensive only. Its only active role before 1990 was the &quot;Katastropheneinsatz&quot; (disaster control). Within the , it helped after natural disasters both in Germany and abroad. After 1990, the international situation changed from east–west confrontation to one of general uncertainty and instability.

After a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term &quot;defence&quot; has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. According to the definition given by Defence Minister Peter Struck (2002 to 2005), it may be necessary to defend Germany even at the Hindu Kush. This requires the to take part in operations outside of the borders of Germany, as part of NATO or the European Union and mandated by the UN.

== Operations ==
Since the early 1990s the has become more and more engaged in international operations in and around the former Yugoslavia, and also in other parts of the world like Cambodia or Somalia. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, German forces were employed in most related theaters except Iraq.

Currently (1 April 2024) there are 1,084 soldiers deployed in:
** KFOR
*** 100 personnel
** UNMISS
*** 14 personnel
** UNIFIL
*** 226 personnel
* Mediterranean Sea
** Operation Sea Guardian
*** 42 personnel
* Mediterranean Sea
** Operation Irini
*** 16 personnel
** Operation Counter Daesh
*** 293 personnel
* Western Sahara
** MINURSO
*** 3 personnel

In addition to the numbers above, 51 soldiers are on permanent stand-by for medical evacuation operations around the world in assistance of ongoing German or coalition operations (STRATAIRMEDEVAC).

In support of Allied stabilization efforts in Iraq, the is also training the new Iraqi security forces in locations outside Iraq, such as the United Arab Emirates and Germany.

Since 1994, the has lost about 100 troops in foreign deployments, including in Afghanistan.

=== Equipment ===
According to the new threat scenario facing Germany and its NATO allies, the is currently reorganising itself. To realise growth in mobility and the enlargement of the air force&#x27;s capabilities, the is going to buy 53 Airbus A400M transports as well as additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighters, F-35 fighters and also several unmanned aerial vehicle models. NH90 helicopters (49 of them in the naval version) are being delivered while 60 Boeing CH-47F Chinook heavy transport helicopters will be delivered in 2027.

For the ground forces it plans to procure 579 Puma infantry fighting vehicles, at least 503 Boxer MRAV, started to introduce a novel land soldier system and a new generation of transportation vehicles and light vehicles, such as the Fennek, and Mowag Eagle. Further, the German Navy is going to build 6 new F126 class frigates, new spy ships, support vessels and additional Type 212 submarines in an enlarged version.

== Appearance ==
=== Uniforms ===

The service uniform is theoretically the standard type of uniform for general duty and off-post activity, but is most associated with ceremonial occasions. The army&#x27;s service uniform consists of a light grey, single-breasted coat and darker grey trousers, worn with a light blue shirt, black tie, and black shoes. The peaked, visored cap has been replaced by the beret as the most common form of headgear. Dress uniforms featuring dinner jackets or double-breasted coats are worn by officers for various social occasions.

The battle and work uniform consists of &quot;Flecktarn&quot; camouflage fatigues, which are also worn on field duty. In practice, they are also used for general duty and off-post at least at barracks where there is also field duty even by others, and for the way home or to the post, and generally regarded as the &quot;Heer&quot; uniform. In all three services, light sand-coloured uniforms are available for duty in warmer climates. In 2016 a new &quot;Multitarn&quot; pattern was launched, similar to the MultiCam uniforms of the British Army or US Army.

A different, traditional variety of the service uniform is worn by the &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (mountain infantry), consisting of ski jacket, stretch trousers, and ski boots. Instead of the beret, they wear the grey &quot;mountain cap&quot;. The field uniform is the same, except for the (optional) metal &quot;Edelweiss&quot; worn on the forage cap.

The traditional arm-of-service colours appear as lapel facings and as piping on shoulder straps. Generals wear an inner piping of gold braid; other officers wear silver piping. Lapel facings and piping are maroon for general staff, green for infantry, red for artillery, pink for armour, black for engineers, yellow for communications, dark yellow for reconnaissance and various other colors for the remaining branches. Combat troops wear green (infantry), black (armour), or maroon (airborne) berets. Logistics troops and combat support troops, such as artillery or engineers, wear red berets. A gold or silver badge on the beret denotes the individual branch of service.

The naval forces wear the traditional navy blue, double-breasted coat and trousers; enlisted personnel wear either a white shirt or a navy blue shirt with the traditional navy collar. White uniforms provide an alternative for summer. The officer&#x27;s dress cap is mounted with a gold anchor surrounded by a wreath. The visor of the admiral&#x27;s cap bears a double row of oak leaves. U-boat captains wear the traditional white hat.

The air force service uniform consists of a blue jacket and trousers with a light blue shirt, dark blue tie, and black shoes. Olive battle dress similar to the army fatigue uniform is worn in basic training and during other field duty. Flying personnel wear wings on their right breast. Other air force personnel wear a modified wing device with a symbol in its centre denoting service specialisation. These &quot;Tätigkeitsabzeichen&quot; come in bronze, silver, or gold, depending on one&#x27;s length of service in the specialty. Wings, superimposed over a wreath, in gold, silver, or bronze, depending on rank, are also worn on the service or field cap.

=== Ranks ===
In general, officer ranks are those used in the Prussian and pre-1945 German armies. Officer rank insignia are worn on shoulder straps or shoulder boards. Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) and air force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) junior officers&#x27; insignia are four pointed silver stars while field grade officers wear silver (black or white on camouflage uniforms) stars and an oak wreath around the lowest star. The stars and wreath are gold for general officers. In the case of naval (&quot;Marine&quot;) officers, rank is indicated by gold stripes on the lower sleeve of the blue service jacket and on shoulder boards of the white uniform.

Soldier and NCO ranks are similar to those of the Prussian and pre-1945 German armies. In the army and air force, a &quot;Gefreiter&quot; corresponds to the NATO rank OR-2 and &quot;Obergefreiter&quot; as well as &quot;Hauptgefreiter&quot; to OR-3, while OR-4 stands for &quot;Stabsgefreiter&quot; and &quot;Oberstabsgefreiter&quot;. An &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; is the lowest-ranking sergeant (OR-5), followed by &quot;Stabsunteroffizier&quot; (also OR-5), &quot;Feldwebel&quot; and &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; (OR-6), &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot; (OR-7/8), &quot;Stabsfeldwebel&quot; (OR-8) and &quot;Oberstabsfeldwebel&quot; (OR-9). Ranks of army and air force enlisted personnel are designated by stripes, chevrons, and &quot;sword knots&quot; worn on rank slides.

Naval enlisted rank designations are worn on the upper (OR 1–5) or lower (OR-6 and above) sleeve along with a symbol based on an anchor for the service specialization (rating). Army and air force officer candidates hold the separate ranks of &quot;Fahnenjunker&quot; (OR-5), &quot;Fähnrich&quot; (OR-6) and &quot;Oberfähnrich&quot; (OR-7/8), and wear the appropriate rank insignia plus a silver cord bound around it. Officers candidates in the navy &quot;Seekadett&quot; (sea cadet; equivalent to OR-5) and &quot;Fähnrich zur See&quot; (midshipman second class; OR-6) wear the rank insignia of the respective enlisted ranks but with a gold star instead of the rating symbol, while an &quot;Oberfähnrich zur See&quot; (midshipman first class; OR-7/8) wears an officer type thin rank stripe.

Medical personnel of all three services wear a version of the traditional caduceus (staff with entwined serpents) on their shoulder straps or sleeve. The officers&#x27; ranks have own designations differing from the line officers, the rank insignias however are basically the same.

=== Women ===

Women have served in the medical service since 1975. From 1993 they were also allowed to serve as enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers in the medical service and the army bands. In 2000, in a lawsuit brought up by Tanja Kreil, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling allowing women to serve in more roles than previously allowed. Since 2001 they can serve in all functions of service without restriction, but they are not subject to conscription. There are presently around 23,066 women on active duty and a number of female reservists who take part in all duties including peacekeeping missions and other operations. In 1994, Verena von Weymarn became &quot;Generalarzt der Luftwaffe&quot; (Surgeon General of the Air Force), the first woman ever to reach the rank of general in the armed forces of Germany.

For women, lower physical performance requirements are required in the basic fitness test, which must be completed at the time of recruitment and later on annually.

=== Rank structure ===
;Officers
;NCOs and enlisted
== Recruitment ==
With the suspension of compulsory military service in 2011 and the reorientation of the Bundeswehr, the military district recruiting offices were dissolved effective 30 November 2012. Their tasks were taken over by the newly created career centers of the Bundeswehr.
The career centers of the Bundeswehr are the armed forces main way of presenting itself as a nationwide employer for both military and civilian careers.

In the structure of the Bundeswehr&#x27;s personnel recruitment organization adopted in 2019, there are five large career centers in Hanover, Mainz, Düsseldorf, Munich and Berlin with assessment centers. There are 16 smaller, regional career centers, of which only those in Wilhelmshaven, Stuttgart and Erfurt have an assessment center. The 110 career counseling offices belonging to the career centers are combined with 86 location teams of the career development service to form 113 counseling offices.
The Bundeswehr offers numerous career paths:
* Voluntary military service (FWD) in Germany is an employment relationship for soldiers in a career of the lower rank Bundeswehr personnel. It lasts at least 7 and at most 23 months. Its legal status is similar to that of conscripts.
* A temporary soldier (abbreviated SaZ, colloquially called Zeitsoldat) is a soldier who voluntarily agrees to perform military service for a limited time. A SaZ can enter all three categories (enlisted, non-commissioned officers and officers). SaZ recruited as NCOs and officers undergo general military, career and specialty training. The regular commitment period is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 25 years, but may not extend beyond the age of 62.
* Professional soldiers for life (&quot;Berufssoldat&quot;) are selected from the group of temporary soldiers. In contrast to temporary soldiers, professional soldiers don&#x27;t have contractual commitment periods but serve until retirement. The age of retirement varies with rank. It is possible for a professional soldier to ask for early discharge or to revert to temporal service.
* Career in the Reserve: There are multiple career paths in the reserve of the armed forces for officers, NCOs, and enlisted personnel, as well as for civilians who have no prior military training.

== Awards ==

* Badge of Honour of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;
* Combat Action Medal of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;
* German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship
* German Armed Forces Badge for Military Proficiency
* German Armed Forces Service Medal
* German Flood Service Medal (2002)

<text>Julie Taymor (born December 15, 1952) is an American director and writer of theater, opera, and film. Her stage adaptation of &quot;The Lion King&quot; debuted in 1997 and received eleven Tony Award nominations, with Taymor receiving Tony Awards for her direction and costume design. Her 2002 film &quot;Frida&quot;, about Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, was nominated for five Academy Awards, including a Best Original Song nomination for Taymor&#x27;s composition &quot;Burn It Blue&quot;. She also directed the 2007 jukebox musical film &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, based on the music of the Beatles.

==Early life==

Taymor was born in Newton, Massachusetts, the daughter of Elizabeth (née Bernstein), a political science professor and Democratic activist, and Melvin Lester Taymor, a gynecologist and prominent fertility researcher later at Harvard Medical School. Taymor&#x27;s interest in theatre took root early in her life. By age ten, she had joined the Boston Children&#x27;s Theatre and starred in a number of productions. Being the youngest member of theatre groups became common. By 13, she was taking trips to Boston by herself every weekend, where she discovered Julie Portman&#x27;s Theatre Workshop. At the age of 15, her parents sent her to both Sri Lanka and India with the Experiment in International Living. After graduating High School at 16, Taymor went to Paris to study with L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq. Her studies there exposed her to mime, which helped develop her physical sensibilities. While in Paris, Taymor worked with masks for the first time and immersed herself in film, especially the work of Fellini and Kurosawa.

In 1970 Taymor was enrolled in Oberlin College in Ohio. During her second year, she interned with Joseph Chaikin&#x27;s Open Theatre and other companies in New York City. Hearing that director Herbert Blau was moving to Oberlin, she returned there and auditioned successfully, becoming, once again, the youngest member of a troupe. In 1973, Taymor attended a summer program of the American Society for Eastern Arts in Seattle. The instructors were masters of Indonesian topeng masked dance-drama and wayang kulit shadow puppetry. This would prove to have a great effect on Taymor in later years. Taymor graduated from Oberlin College with a major in mythology and folklore and with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1974. She spent a summer with Bread and Puppet Theater.

As a college senior, Taymor won a year long Thomas J. Watson Fellowship that began after graduation. The Watson allowed her to travel to Japan and Indonesia which she continued independently from 1975 until 1979. In Indonesia, she developed a mask/dance company, Teatr Loh, consisting of Japanese, Balinese, Sundanese, French, German and American actors, musicians, dancers and puppeteers. The company toured throughout Indonesia with two original productions, &quot;Way of Snow&quot; and &quot;Tirai&quot;, which were subsequently performed in the United States. She met her long-time collaborator, Elliot Goldenthal, in 1980.

Taymor was the 2010 commencement speaker for her alma mater, Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Back in New York from Indonesia, Taymor remounted &quot;Tirai&quot; at La MaMa in 1980. Her next project, &quot;The Haggadah&quot;, came from the desire of The Public Theater director Joseph Papp to create an annual Passover pageant that would be culturally inclusive. In 1984, Taymor worked in collaboration with Theatre for a New Audience on a 60-minute version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; presented at The Public Theater. Two years later, she directed her first Shakespeare play, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, for Theatre for a New Audience. She went on to direct three other productions at that theatre, including &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and &quot;The Green Bird&quot; by Carlo Gozzi. She later adapted &quot;Tempest&quot; and &quot;Titus&quot; into major motion pictures.

Taymor is known for a distinct visual style, with extensive use of puppets and masks, developed largely from her time in Indonesia working with Teatr Loh.

Taymor is most widely recognized for her production of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which opened on Broadway in 1997. &quot;The Lion King&quot;″s worldwide gross exceeds that of any entertainment title in box office history, and has been presented in over 100 cities in over 20 countries, having been seen by more than 100 million people worldwide.

Taymor has the distinction of being the first woman to receive the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical, which she won for &quot;The Lion King&quot;. She also received a Tony Award for her original costume designs for the production. Taymor co-designed the masks and puppets, and wrote additional lyrics for the show. In 2007, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was performed in Johannesburg, and had its first French language production in Paris. In 2008, &quot;Le Roi Lion&quot; was awarded Best Costume Design, Best Lighting Design, and Best Musical at the Molière Awards, the national theatre awards of France.

In 2000, Taymor directed Carlo Gozzi&#x27;s &quot;The Green Bird&quot; on Broadway. The work was first produced in 1996 by Theatre for a New Audience at the New Victory Theater and presented at the La Jolla Playhouse. Taymor&#x27;s stage production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was produced off-Broadway by Theatre for a New Audience in 1994. Other directing credits include &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;The Transposed Heads&quot;, based on the novella by Thomas Mann, co-produced by the American Musical Theater Festival and the Lincoln Center; and &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Taken&quot;, an original musical co-created with David Suehsdorf and Elliot Goldenthal.

Her original music-theatre work, &quot;Juan Darién: A Carnival Mass&quot;, presented at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater in 1996, received five Tony Award nominations including Best Director. Originally produced by Music Theater Group in 1988, &quot;Juan Darién: A Carnival Mass&quot; was directed by Taymor, and co-written with Elliot Goldenthal. The recipient of two Obies and numerous other awards, the piece was performed at The Edinburgh International Festival, as well as festivals in France, Jerusalem and Montreal, and had an extended run in San Francisco.
In April 2007, it was announced that a musical adaptation of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was being prepared for Broadway. Taymor was selected to direct the show and write the book with Glen Berger. The production features music and lyrics by Bono and The Edge. The musical, &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, was scheduled to begin previews on November 28, 2010, at the Foxwoods Theatre. The play was delayed for several months due to numerous injuries, and Taymor was fired and replaced by Philip William McKinley. The play officially opened on June 14, 2011, having set the record for the longest preview period in the history of Broadway at 182 performances. The production also set the record for most expensive Broadway production at an estimated $75 million. In November 2011, Taymor sued the show&#x27;s producers, Michael Cohl and Jeremiah J. Harris, claiming that they were profiting from her creative contributions without compensating her. Taymor and the producers reached a settlement in August 2012.

Taymor was a 2015 inductee into the American Theater Hall of Fame for Lifetime Achievement.

Taymor directed a Broadway revival of David Henry Hwang&#x27;s &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, starring Clive Owen, which opened on October 26, 2017, at the Cort Theatre, with previews beginning on October 7. David Henry Hwang made changes to the original text for the revival, mostly centering on the issue of intersectional identities.

===Film===

Taymor&#x27;s first film, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Fire&quot;, which she co-directed and adapted from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story, Hop-Frog, was produced by American Playhouse. The hour-long film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and aired on PBS in March 1992. In the film, all characters except the titular character Hop-Frog are either elaborate puppets or masks, not unlike Taymor&#x27;s stage work. The film won the Best Drama award at the Tokyo International Electronic Cinema Festival.

Taymor also directed a film adaptation of opera &quot;Oedipus rex&quot; after directing a stage production of the same opera. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Jury Award at the Montreal Festival of Film on Art. Broadcast internationally in 1993, the film garnered an Emmy Award and the 1994 International Classical Music Award for Best Opera Production.

Taymor&#x27;s feature film debut, &quot;Titus&quot; (1999), starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, was an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. Taymor adapted the screenplay and produced the film, which received an Academy Award nomination for costume design.

Taymor received critical acclaim for her direction of Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina in &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), a biographical film about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. &quot;Frida&quot; garnered six Academy Award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Hayek, and won two Academy Awards for make-up and original score. &quot;Frida&quot; was honored with four BAFTA nominations and one win, including nominations for Hayek and Molina, as well as two Golden Globe nominations, winning the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. In addition, the film received two Screen Actors Guild nominations. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival where it won the festival&#x27;s Mimmo Rotella Foundation Award.

Her next film was the jukebox musical &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (2008), which received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Musical/Comedy as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Costume Design. With a collection of 33 Beatles songs, the film stars Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess in a 1960s love story set to the music of The Beatles, and featured performances by Bono, Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek. Taymor both directed and co-wrote the story for the film.

In November 2008, Taymor directed a film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, released in December 2010 starring Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Djimon Hounsou and Ben Whishaw. Working behind the camera with Taymor on &quot;The Tempest&quot; were the Academy Award winners Elliot Goldenthal for music, Sandy Powell for costumes, and Françoise Bonnot. Taymor produced the feature and adapted the screenplay based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

She also completed a cinematic version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, starring David Harewood, Max Casella and Kathryn Hunter, and filmed during her critically acclaimed, sold-out stage production that ran at Theatre for a New Audience&#x27;s new home in Downtown Brooklyn. The film was shown at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as part of the Mavericks in Film Programme.

Taymor directed and co-wrote &quot;The Glorias&quot;, a biopic of feminist icon Gloria Steinem, based on her novel &quot;My Life on the Road&quot;, starring Julianne Moore, Alicia Vikander, Bette Midler, and Janelle Monae. The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was released by Amazon Prime on September 30, 2020.

===Opera===

Taymor&#x27;s first opera direction was of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, for the Saito Kinen Orchestra in Japan, under the baton of Seiji Ozawa in 1992. The opera featured Philip Langridge as Oedipus and Jessye Norman as Jocasta. Taymor went on to direct the film adaptation of the opera Oedipus Rex.

She went on to direct Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; for the Los Angeles Opera in a co-production with the Houston Grand Opera.

She directed Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Salome&quot; for the Kirov Opera in Russia, Germany, and Israel, conducted by Valery Gergiev. Taymor&#x27;s first direction of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (), was for the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, with Zubin Mehta conducting in 1993. Over a decade later, Taymor premiered &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004. The show is now in repertoire there. A newly translated and abridged English version of the opera premiered at the Met in December 2006, and inaugurated a new series on PBS in 2010 entitled, &quot;Great Performances at the Met&quot; as well as launched the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD series of movie-theater transmissions.

In June 2006, Taymor directed the premiere of Elliot Goldenthal&#x27;s opera &quot;Grendel&quot; for the Los Angeles Opera, starring Eric Owens, which was also presented as part of the Summer 2006 Lincoln Center Festival in New York City. A darkly comic retelling of the Beowulf tale based on the novel by John Gardner, the opera was co-commissioned by the Los Angeles Opera and the Lincoln Center Festival. The opera was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2007.

For the Metropolitan Opera 2005/06 season, Taymor directed a successful production of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. It was revised for the 2006/07 season and, in addition to full-length performances, was adapted for a 100-minute version over the holiday season to appeal to children. That version of the opera was the first of a series of NCM Fathom Live on the Big Screen presentations of MET operas downloaded via satellite to movie theaters across North America and parts of Europe for the 2006/07 season. In 2012, Opera Australia produced this version with locally built scenery and props at the Sydney Opera House, the Arts Centre Melbourne, and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane.

<doc id="288191" wikidata="Q1035067" url="?curid=288191" title="Heisman Trophy">
<text>The Heisman Memorial Trophy ( ; also known simply as the Heisman) is awarded annually since 1935 to the top player in college football. It is considered the most prestigious award in the sport and is presented by the Heisman Trophy Trust following the regular season in December. The most recent winner is Colorado Buffaloes cornerback and wide receiver Travis Hunter.

The award was created by the Downtown Athletic Club to recognize &quot;the most valuable college football player east of the Mississippi&quot; and was first awarded to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger. The award was given its name in 1936 after the death of the club&#x27;s athletic director John Heisman and broadened to include players west of the Mississippi.

==Winners==

USC has the most Heisman trophies won with eight; Ohio State, Oklahoma, and Notre Dame each have seven; Ohio State has had six different players win the award. The closest margin of votes was in 2009 between winner Mark Ingram II of Alabama and Toby Gerhart of Stanford. Ten Heisman Trophy winners are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and four winners have also been named Most Valuable Player in a Super Bowl. Some winners have gone on to play in other professional sports, including Bo Jackson in baseball and Charlie Ward in basketball. Pete Dawkins and Dick Kazmaier are the only winners not to pursue a professional sports career: Dawkins had a career with the United States Army, where he achieved the rank of Brigadier General, while Kazmaier attended Harvard Business School, founded a consulting company specializing in sports marketing, and chaired the President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition in 1988–89.

===Trophy===

The trophy itself, designed by sculptor Frank Eliscu, is modeled after Ed Smith, a leading player in 1934 for the now-defunct New York University football team. The trophy is made out of cast bronze, is tall, long, in width and weighs . Eliscu had asked Smith, his former George Washington High School classmate, to pose for a commissioned sculpture of a football player. Smith did not realize until 1982 that the sculpture had become the Heisman Trophy. The Downtown Athletic Club presented Smith with a Heisman Trophy of his own in 1985.

From its inception in 1935, the statue was cast by Dieges &amp; Clust in New York (and later Providence, Rhode Island) until 1980, when Dieges and Clust was sold to Herff Jones. For a time until at least 2008, the statues were cast by Roman Bronze Works in New York. Since 2005 the trophy has been made by MTM Recognition in Del City, Oklahoma.

==Selection process==
Originally only players east of the Mississippi were eligible, but since 1936 all football players playing in all divisions of college football nationwide are eligible for the award, though winners usually represent Division I Football Bowl Subdivision schools.

There are three categories of eligible voters for the award winner:
* Sports journalists: Heisman.com states that sports journalists are to be the determinants of the award since they are &quot;informed, competent, and impartial.&quot; There are 870 media voters: 145 voters from each of six regions.
* Previous Heisman winners (and in cases where an underclassman wins the award and remains in school to play, a prior winner may also be a current candidate). According to Heisman.com there are currently 57 prior winners eligible to vote and, thus, 57 potential votes (a prior winner is not required to vote and does not lose his voting privileges by not voting).
* Fans: Trophy sponsor Nissan USA holds an ESPN-conduced fan survey through its Heisman/college football advertising campaign website. This constitutes one Heisman vote.

Except for the one vote based on the fan voting, the balloting is based on positional voting, whereby each voter identifies three selections, ranking them in order. Each first-place selection is awarded three points, each second-place selection is awarded two points, and each third-place selection is awarded one point. Voters must make three selections and cannot duplicate a selection, else the ballot is invalid and none of the selections count. The accounting firm Deloitte is responsible for the tabulation of votes, which has moved almost exclusively to online voting since 2007.

===Position===
The Heisman has usually been awarded either to a running back or a quarterback; very few players have won the trophy playing a position other than those two. Four wide receivers have been named winner: Tim Brown (1987), Desmond Howard (1991), DeVonta Smith (2020), and Travis Hunter (2024). Two tight ends have also won the trophy, Larry Kelley (1936) and Leon Hart (1949). Charles Woodson (1997) and Hunter are the only primarily defensive players to win the award, both doing so as 
defensive backs.

The highest finish ever for any individual who played exclusively on defense is second, by defensive end Hugh Green of Pittsburgh in 1980, linebacker Manti Te&#x27;o of Notre Dame in 2012, and by defensive end Aidan Hutchinson of Michigan in 2021. Although John Heisman himself was an interior lineman, no interior lineman on either side of the ball has ever won the award. Legendary linebacker Dick Butkus placed sixth in 1963 and third in 1964 and could qualify as an interior lineman, as he played center on offense during his era when two-way players were still common. Offensive guard Tom Brown of Minnesota and the offensive tackle John Hicks of Ohio State placed second in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Rich Glover, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, finished 3rd in the 1972 vote—which was won by his Cornhusker teammate Johnny Rodgers. Washington&#x27;s DT Steve Emtman finished 4th in voting in 1991. Ndamukong Suh of Nebraska finished fourth in 2009 as a defensive tackle. Also, Kurt Burris, a center for the Oklahoma team, was a runner-up for the award in 1954 and Orlando Pace finished fourth in 1996 as an offensive tackle for Ohio State.

===Class and age===
For most of its history, most winners of the Heisman have been seniors. Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel was the first freshman to win the Heisman in 2012. The following year, freshman Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston also won the Heisman. Both, however, were in their second year of college, having been redshirted during their first year of attendance, meaning that no &quot;true&quot; freshman has yet won the award. No sophomore won the Heisman in its first 72 years, at which point there were three consecutive sophomore winners—Tim Tebow in 2007, followed by Sam Bradford and Mark Ingram II—with Lamar Jackson, who also surpassed Winston&#x27;s record as the youngest Heisman winner, becoming the fourth in 2016. Of the four sophomores to have won the award, only Bradford had been redshirted; the others all won during their second year of college attendance. Only a few juniors have won the award, starting with the eleventh winner in 1945, Doc Blanchard.

Five players have finished in the top three of the Heisman voting as freshmen or sophomores before later winning the award: Angelo Bertelli, Glenn Davis, Doc Blanchard, Doak Walker, and Herschel Walker. Eight players have finished in the top three as freshmen or sophomores but never won a Heisman: Clint Castleberry, Marshall Faulk, Michael Vick, Rex Grossman, Larry Fitzgerald, Adrian Peterson, Deshaun Watson, and Christian McCaffrey. Four players have specifically finished second in consecutive years: Glenn Davis (second in 1944 and 1945, winner in 1946), Charlie Justice (second 1948 and 1949), Darren McFadden (second 2006 and 2007), and Andrew Luck (second 2010 and 2011).

The oldest and youngest Heisman winners ever both played for Atlantic Coast Conference schools. The oldest, Chris Weinke, was 28 years old when he won in 2000; he spent six years in minor league baseball before enrolling at Florida State. The youngest winner is 2016 recipient Lamar Jackson of Louisville at the age of , four days younger than Jameis Winston was when he won in 2013.

==History==
The award was first presented in 1935 by the Downtown Athletic Club (DAC) in New York City, a privately owned recreation facility located on the lower west side near the later World Trade Center site. It was first known simply as the DAC Trophy. The first winner, Jay Berwanger, was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles but declined to sign for them. He never played professional football for any team. In 1936, John Heisman died and the trophy was renamed in his honor. Larry Kelley, the second winner of the award, was the first man to win it as the &quot;Heisman Trophy&quot;.

The first African American player to win the Heisman was Syracuse&#x27;s Ernie Davis, who never played a snap in the NFL. He was diagnosed with leukemia shortly after winning the award and died in 1963. In 1966, former Florida Gators quarterback Steve Spurrier gave his Heisman trophy to the university president, Dr. J. Wayne Reitz, so that the award could be shared by Florida students and faculty. The gesture caused Florida&#x27;s student government to raise funds to purchase a replacement trophy for Spurrier. Since then, the Downtown Athletic Club has issued two trophies to winners, one to the individual and a replica to his college.

Several Heisman trophies have been sold over the years; although there is a ban on the sale of all trophies awarded since 1999, trophies awarded in previous years can be sold. O. J. Simpson&#x27;s 1968 trophy was sold in February 1999 for $230,000 as part of the settlement of the civil trial following the acquittal in his murder case. Yale end Larry Kelley sold his 1936 Heisman in December 1999 for $328,110 to settle his estate and to provide a bequest for his family. Charles White&#x27;s 1979 trophy first sold for $184,000 and then for nearly $300,000 in December 2006 to help pay back federal income taxes. The current record price for a Heisman belongs to the trophy won by Minnesota halfback Bruce Smith in 1941 at $395,240. Paul Hornung sold his Heisman for $250,000 to endow scholarships for University of Notre Dame students from his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Eliscu&#x27;s original plaster cast sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $228,000 in December 2005.

===Venues===
Due to the neighborhood housing the Downtown Athletic Club&#x27;s facilities becoming blockaded after the attacks on 9/11, the 2001 award ceremony was moved to the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square. After the DAC filed for bankruptcy in 2002, the Yale Club hosted the presentation at its facility in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony moved to the Hilton New York for 2004, and was presented annually at Palladium Times Square (then Nokia Theatre Times Square) from 2005 until its closure in 2019 (except in 2017, when the presentation was moved back to the Marquis because of a scheduling conflict).

The 2008 Heisman press conference was held at the Sports Museum of America at 26 Broadway near the old Downtown Club building. There was an entire gallery with the museum-attraction dedicated to the Trophy, including the making of the Trophy, the history of the DAC, and information on John Heisman and all the Trophy&#x27;s winners. There was also a dedicated area celebrating the most recent winner, and the opportunity for visitors to cast their vote for the next winner (with the top vote-winner receiving 1 official vote on their behalf). The Sports Museum of America closed permanently in February 2009.

After Palladium Times Square (then PlayStation Theater) closed in December 2019, the Heisman Trust began searching for a new location to conduct the trophy presentation. The 2020 ceremony would ultimately be held at the studios of ESPN in Bristol, Connecticut due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the ceremony was a virtual event with all participants appearing via remote interviews. The 2021 ceremony returned to an in-person event, with the presentation held at The Appel Room at Jazz at Lincoln Center.

===Television coverage===
WOR-TV broadcast the 1949 ceremonies. Before 1977, the presentation of the award was not televised as a stand-alone special, but rather as a quick in-game feature. The ceremony usually aired on ABC as a feature at halftime of the last major national telecast (generally a rivalry game) of the college football season. ABC essentially showed highlights since the award was handed out as part of an annual weeknight dinner at the DAC. At the time, the event had usually been scheduled for the week following the Army–Navy Game. The most watched Heisman ceremony ever was in 2009 when Mark Ingram won over Toby Gerhart and Colt McCoy.

Broadcasters include:
* CBS (1977–1980, 1986–1990)
* ABC (1981–1984) – owned-and-operated stations only
* Syndication (1981–1985)
* NBC (1985) – owned-and-operated stations only
* NBC (1991–1993)
* ESPN (1994–present)

==Controversies and politics==

===Regional bias controversy===
A number of critics have expressed concern about the unwritten rules regarding player position and age, as noted above.

Over the years, there has been substantial criticism of a regional bias, suggesting that the Heisman balloting process has ignored West Coast players. Before the breakup of the Pac-12 Conference (formerly Pac-10 and Pac-8) represented 12 of the 65 teams in the Power Five conferences. The Heisman can be, and has been, presented to players from other conferences, but a random sample over a long period of time might suggest that Pac-10/12 players might win somewhere close to 18% of the Heisman awards. In the 20 seasons between 1981 (Marcus Allen) and 2002 (Carson Palmer), not a single Pacific-10 Conference or other West Coast player won the Heisman Trophy. Four Southern California (USC) players have won the Trophy in the early years of the 21st century and three won it subsequent to Palmer. Although Terry Baker, quarterback from Oregon State, won the trophy in 1962, and Gary Beban from UCLA won in 1967, no non-USC player from the West Coast had won between Stanford&#x27;s Jim Plunkett in 1970 and Oregon&#x27;s Marcus Mariota in 2014. Other than Mariota&#x27;s win, the closest since Plunkett&#x27;s win have been Chuck Muncie, John Elway, Toby Gerhart, Andrew Luck, Christian McCaffrey, and Bryce Love. Muncie was a running back for the California Golden Bears who finished second in the Heisman balloting in 1975. The other five were Stanford players who finished second in the Heisman balloting in 1982, and each year from 2009 to 2011, 2015, and 2017.

The West Coast bias discussion usually centers on the idea that East Coast voters see few West Coast games, because of television coverage contracts, time zone differences, or cultural interest. At Heisman-projection website StiffArmTrophy.com, commentator Kari Chisholm claims that the Heisman balloting process itself is inherently biased:

For Heisman voting purposes, the nation is divided into six regions—each of which get 145 votes. Put another way, each region gets exactly 16.67 percent of the votes. However, each region does not constitute an even one-sixth of the population. Three regions (Far West, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic) have larger populations than 16.67% of the national population; and three have less (Northeast, South, and Southwest). In fact, the Far West has the greatest population at 21.2% of the country and the Northeast has the least at 11.9%.

===Nullification of 2005 award and reinstatement===

In 2010 University of Southern California athletic director Pat Haden announced the university would return its replica of the 2005 Heisman Trophy due to NCAA sanctions requiring the university to dissociate itself from Reggie Bush. The NCAA found that Bush had received gifts from an agent while at USC. On September 14, 2010, Bush voluntarily forfeited his title as a Heisman winner. The next day, the Heisman Trust announced the 2005 award would remain vacated and removed all mention of the 2005 award from its official website. Bush eventually returned the trophy itself to the Heisman Trust in 2012.

Critical responses from the national media were strident and varied. &quot;CBSSports.com&quot; producer J. Darin Darst opined that Bush &quot;should never have been pressured to return the award.&quot; Kalani Simpson of Fox Sports wrote, &quot;Nice try Heisman Trust...It&#x27;s a slick move to try to wipe the slate clean.&quot; Former Football Writers Association of America president Dennis Dodd, on the other hand, decided to fictitiously award Bush&#x27;s vacated 2005 award to Vince Young, the original runner-up that year. He wrote, &quot;Since the Heisman folks won&#x27;t re-vote, we did. Vince Young is the &quot;new&quot; winner of the 2005 Heisman.&quot; A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; piece argued that Bush&#x27;s Heisman was &quot;tainted,&quot; but lamented that the decision came five years after Bush was awarded the trophy and, therefore, four years after the expiration of Bush&#x27;s term as current holder of the Heisman title.

On April 24, 2024, the Heisman Trust announced the formal reinstatement of Reggie Bush&#x27;s trophy amid what it called &quot;enormous changes in the college football landscape&quot;. The Trust cited &quot;fundamental changes in college athletics&quot; in which rules that have allowed student athlete compensation to become an accepted practice and the 2021 United States Supreme Court decision against the NCAA in the &quot;Alston&quot; case, which the Trust said &quot;questioned the legality of the NCAA&#x27;s amateurism model and opened the door to student athlete compensation&quot;. This decision did not affect USC&#x27;s vacated titles and records from their 2004 and 2005 season which was also caused by the scandal; and they still had their 2004 championship vacated with an official record of 11-0 and also have all their results vacated for the 2005 season and have an official record of 0-0.

<doc id="288193" wikidata="Q645904" url="?curid=288193" title="Story of Sinuhe">
<text>The Story of Sinuhe (also referred to as Sanehat or Sanhath) is a work of ancient Egyptian literature. It was likely composed in the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty after the death of Amenemhat I (also referred to as Senwosret I). The tale describes an Egyptian man who flees his kingdom, and lives as a foreigner before returning to Egypt shortly before his death. It explores universal themes such as divine providence and mercy. The oldest known copy of the text dates to the reign of Amenemhat III, around 1800 BCE. The work was so popular within Egypt that newer copies have been found ranging up to 750 years after the original.

==Summary==
&quot;The Story of Sinuhe&quot; is written in verse and opens with a wording similarly stylized like other autobiographical coffin texts that are common in Middle Kingdom Egyptian tombs. Theoretically, the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; would have been inscribed on his supposed tomb. The opening stanzas list Sinuhe’s accomplishments, titles, and ways he was of service to the royal family. Sinuhe claims to be, “...the True Acquaintance of the King, whom he loves, the follower, Sinuhe says, I was a follower who followed his lord, a servant of the royal chambers&quot;. Then it breaks away from this styling and transitions to Sinuhe receiving the news of the sudden death of the old king while he is on an expedition in Libya with the king’s oldest son. Upon hearing the news, Sinuhe is highly upset and enters a panicked state, “my heart staggered, my arms spread out; trembling fell on every limb. I removed myself, leaping, to look for a hiding place”. Sinuhe flees away from Egypt, sneaks past guards, crosses the Lake Maaty and sets out for foreign lands. He travels beyond Egypt and eventually collapses due to dehydration, having a close brush with death. In the next scene he is rescued by a Syrian leader who recognized Sinuhe, “a leader of theirs, who had once been in Egypt, recognized me. Then he gave me water, he boiled milk for me”. Sinuhe is nursed back to health and eventually, after more travelling, meets Amunenshi, the ruler of upper Retjenu. He begins his new life and attempts to establish an identity amongst a culture he is unfamiliar with. Amunenshi entrusts him to command his armies, and it is through this command that Sinuhe becomes engaged in conflict with a challenger. Although Sinuhe is victorious in this conflict, it onsets a desperation for his homeland. At one point Sinuhe exclaims, “whatever god fated the flight—be gracious, and bring me home! Surely you will let me see the place where my heart still stays! What matters more than my being buried in the land where I was born?”. Luckily the new king, Senusret I, sends for Sinuhe to return to Egypt. Sinuhe is delighted and thus begins a lengthy correspondence between the King and Sinuhe. Sinuhe eventually writes to Senusret I, “Whether I am at home, whether I am in this place—it is you who veils this horizon of mine”. Eventually the King offers to allow Sinuhe to be buried in Egypt. Sinuhe returns to Egypt and also the royal court. There he is cleansed and restored in his Egyptian identity. The story closes with Sinuhe addressing the visitors of his tomb, and the tale returns to its original funerary text stylization.

==Sources ==
One of the oldest versions of this text was found by James Edward Quibell in an expedition to western Thebes in 1896. The excavation took place in several Middle Kingdom tombs found in the back of the Ramesseum. Here, Quibell found various fragments of papyri, later named the Ramesseum papyri. Many of these were of a medicinal subject matter, but literary texts have also been found, including the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot;. These fragments date back to the late 13th dynasty. Additionally, Quibell and his team also found a small chest, reed pens and several other items of interest. In a discussion about this archaeological expedition, author Alan Gardiner made note of the fragility and poor condition that the papyrus was found in; “if a fragment of the material were pressed slightly between the finger and thumb it disappeared in a mere dust&quot;. This copy of the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; is written in hieratic. Gardiner used information from Quibell’s findings as well as a later ostracon to work on an English translation of the text. As the early ostracon and combined fragments from the Quibelll expedition allowed for a more complete version of the tale. He published his work in translating the tale in 1916. Other authors have been able to build on his work and adjust their own translations as needed, one notable example being Alyward M. Blackman who published his own notes in 1936 based on Gardiner’s work.

Many other versions of the text have been found. Including some fragments from a New Kingdom Ostracon, and a duplicate of the text discovered in the Museum of Natural History of Buenos Aires, as well as many more papyrus. Most scholars on Egyptian literature agree that the large prevalence of sources indicate a widescale popularity of the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; and that it had been copied in multitudes.  

==Interpretations==
The tale is notable for its age, as well as the popularity of the story in ancient history. It explores themes and morals that were a part of Egyptian ideals, such as order and chaos, or identity and the soul. Sinuhe also demonstrates the value that Egyptians placed on their homeland—as Sinuhe only finds peace through being allowed to be buried in Egypt. Most authors agree in their discussion on Sinuhe that he represents a dichotomy between a loyal Egyptian and a deserter. While the story mostly takes place in Sinuhe’s time outside of Egypt, this retelling of Sinuhe’s life outside of Egyptian lands serves to encourage “reflection on the nature of Egyptian life, particularly on an individual’s relationship to the king”.

The funerary autobiographical nature of the opening and closing of the tale is also significant. The traditional beginning in which the text is stylized as though it is written on Sinuhe’s tomb, listing his accomplishments and service to the royal family, is broken upon his fearful fleeing when the King Amenehmat I dies. The remaining stanzas of the story do not fit more traditional Egyptian narrative styles, at least until Sinuhe is able to return and be laid to rest in Egypt. This is a key narrative choice showing how Sinuhe is disconnected from traditional Egyptian culture once he departs from the safety and security of his homeland. Additionally, it is only when Sinuhe is sending his letters to the new king of Egypt, that examples of more traditional Egyptian stylization can be seen. Sinuhe praises the sender of the decree, King Senusret I, stating, “it is your spirit, Perfected God, Lord of the two lands, which is loved by the Sungod, and favored by Montu Lord of Thebes” he then goes on to list several gods in his praise. This form of writing is common in Middle Kingdom letters, and is another indication of Sinuhe only being able to experience Egyptian culture in direct connection to Egypt. In a similar vein, the name “Sinuhe” does not appear after the opening stanzas until after Sinuhe begins correspondence with the king again. Again showing Sinuhe’s disconnect from his heritage and identity upon his departure from Egypt. Another way of analyzing the narrative is that unlike most &#x27;autobiographies&#x27; are written in some timeless fashion, however there is the underlying idea that Sinuhe desires to die within Egypt. Even if Sinuhe is alive at the end of the story, there&#x27;s the underlying theme of wanting to reconnect with his culture directly, including dying within Egypt and receiving proper burial rites. As stated earlier, this is different from most autobiographies, most being written while they are alive, whereas with the Tale of Sinuhe, there is the implication of him passing on, perhaps most directly being stated within the Tale&#x27;s final line: &#x27;I was in the favours of the king&#x27;s giving, until the day of landing came&#x27;(B 310 of Tale of Sinuhe) 

Some interpretations have also been made about the name Sinuhe. Sinuhe is derived from the Egyptian phrase &quot;sA-nht&quot; or “Son of the Sycamore Tree”. In Egyptian myth the Sycamore or, Tree of Life, is associated with Hathor, a fertility goddess. Hathor being a goddess of fertility, there is possible interpretations for Sinuhe representing rebirth. Many homophones and etymologically related words to the term “sycomore”, &quot;nht&quot;, have to do with death, escape, and protection. Which are all common themes throughout the tale. Essentially, Sinuhe’s name serves as etymological foreshadowing for the ideals and events that take place throughout the story. Additionally upon his fleeing Sinuhe crosses a body of water, associated with Maat, while in the vicinity of a Sycamore tree. Further emphasizing their connection and perhaps illustrating Sinuhe’s fleeing of his own identity.

There have also been some different opinions on Sinuhe’s reasoning for fleeing after the death of the king. Some state that many of Sinuhe’s fearful traits indicate that he is somehow involved in the king’s death. This would mean that he flees out of a need for self-preservation, making a rash decision that lands him outside of Egypt for the majority of his remaining life. The more common school of thought, the “impulsive school” as titled by author Meltzer, simply reads that Sinuhe’s decision to flee was merely an impulse of fear due to the impending disorder upon the king’s demise. As the king’s death seems to shock Sinuhe, it is commonly inferred that he was murdered or assassinated. This seems likely considering that the king Amenemhat, who is likely the king in the story, was assassinated. Another interpretation of his departure is that it was an attempt to escape the rule and power of the monarchy. And that during all of the commotion of the king’s death, Sinuhe saw his chance to escape and fled. 

Of course there is more interpretations of Sinuhe&#x27;s flight from Egypt aside from just interpretation. Egyptologist John Baines notes there is a couple ways to interpret that. One of them being in line with the general theme of homeland and connection to it, that being after the initial flight from Egypt, Sinuhe would be overcome by guilt in his abandonment of his people and homeland motivating him to move into exile for the majority rest of the story. It&#x27;s further evident of how guilty Sinuhe felt when remembering how ancient Egyptian society is structured in such a way where order is extremely important, and as such, Sinuhe is willing turning away from a culture that is not only intrinsically connected to him, but also potentially greatly chaotic relative to what he&#x27;s used to. A second way to interpret the flight from Libya away from the prince, is less about guilt and covers instead the concepts of grappling with internal morality. This meaning as opposed to Sinuhe discovering greater private morality or self fulfillment but rather instead Sinuhe was able to find salvation by re-identifying with the social role of that of an Egyptian. Connecting this back to his flight, perhaps the social role within Egyptian society became shaken when the old king died. With pharaohs in Egypt being considered semi divine beings, it can be no surprise that Sinuhe was both panicked and grieving upon learning the news of his king&#x27;s death.

== Parallels ==
Parallels have been made between the biblical narrative of Joseph and the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot;. In what is seen as divine providence, Sinuhe the Egyptian flees to Syro-Canaan and becomes a member of the ruling elite, acquires a wife and family, before being reunited with his Egyptian family. Similarly, the Syro-Canaanite Joseph is taken to Egypt where he becomes part of the ruling elite, acquires a wife and family, before being reunited with his Syro-Canaanite family. Parallels have also been drawn from other biblical texts: the Hebrew prophet Jonah&#x27;s frustrated flight from the orbit of God&#x27;s power is likened to Sinuhe&#x27;s similar flight from the King. The battle between David and Goliath is compared to Sinuhe&#x27;s fight with a mighty challenger, whom he slays with a single blow, and the parable of the Prodigal Son is likened to Sinuhe&#x27;s return home.

Additionally, the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; inspired the modern novel &quot;Sinuhe the Egyptian&quot; (1945) by Mika Waltari and a film based on the novel.

<doc id="288195" wikidata="Q720020" url="?curid=288195" title="Soft-tissue sarcoma">
<text>A soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a malignant tumor, a type of cancer, that develops in soft tissue. A soft-tissue sarcoma is often a painless mass that grows slowly over months or years. They may be superficial or deep-seated. Any such unexplained mass must be diagnosed by biopsy. Treatment may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy. Bone sarcomas are the other class of sarcomas.

There are many different types, many of which are rarely found. The World Health Organization lists more than fifty subtypes.

==Types==
&quot;An earlier version of this article was taken from the US National Cancer Center&#x27;s Cancer Information Service. The names of several sarcomas have changed over time.&quot;

== Signs and symptoms ==
In their early stages, soft-tissue sarcomas usually do not cause symptoms. Because soft tissue is relatively elastic, tumors can grow rather large, pushing aside normal tissue, before they are felt or cause any problems. The first noticeable symptom is usually a painless lump or swelling. As the tumor grows, it may cause other symptoms, such as pain or soreness, as it presses against nearby nerves and muscles. If in the abdomen it can cause abdominal pains commonly mistaken for menstrual cramps, indigestion, or cause constipation.

== Risk factors ==
Most soft-tissue sarcomas are not associated with any known risk factors or identifiable cause. There are some exceptions:

*Studies suggest that workers who are exposed to chlorophenols in wood preservatives and phenoxy herbicides may have a somewhat increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas, although other data sets refute this association. A small number of patients with a rare blood vessel tumor, angiosarcoma of the liver, had been exposed to vinyl chloride in their work. This substance is used in the manufacture of certain plastics, notably PVC.
*In the early 1900s, when scientists were just discovering the potential uses of radiation to treat disease, little was known about safe dosage levels and precise methods of delivery. At that time, radiation was used to treat a variety of noncancerous medical problems, including enlargement of the tonsils, adenoids, and thymus gland. Later, researchers found that high doses of radiation caused soft-tissue sarcomas in some patients. Because of this risk, radiation treatment for cancer is now planned to ensure that the maximum dosage of radiation is delivered to diseased tissue while surrounding healthy tissue is protected as much as possible.
*Kaposi sarcoma, a rare cancer of the cells that line blood vessels in the skin and mucous membranes, is caused by human herpesvirus 8. Kaposi sarcoma often occurs in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Kaposi sarcoma, however, has different characteristics from typical soft-tissue sarcomas and is treated differently.
*In a very small fraction of cases, sarcoma may be related to a rare inherited genetic alteration of the &quot;TP53&quot; gene and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Certain other inherited diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas. For example, people with neurofibromatosis type I (also called von Recklinghausen disease, associated with alterations in the &quot;NF1 &quot;gene) are at an increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas known as malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors. Patients with inherited retinoblastoma have alterations in the &quot;RB1 &quot;gene, a tumor-suppressor gene, and are likely to develop soft-tissue sarcomas as they mature into adulthood.

== Diagnosis ==
The only reliable way to determine whether a soft-tissue tumor is benign or malignant is through a biopsy. The two methods for acquisition of tumor tissue for cytopathological analysis are:
*Needle aspiration biopsy, via needle 
*Surgically, via an incision made into the tumor
A pathologist examines the tissue under a microscope. The pathologist may be the most important person in the treatment of sacomas, because they are responsible for making the proper diagnosis. Pathologists at expert sarcoma centers are invaluable in identifying the type of sarcoma responsible for a patient&#x27;s symptoms. If cancer is present, the pathologist can usually determine the type of cancer and its grade. Here, &quot;grade&quot; refers to a scale used to represent concisely the predicted growth rate of the tumor and its tendency to spread, and this is determined by the degree to which the cancer cells appear abnormal when examined under a microscope. Low-grade sarcomas, although cancerous, are defined as those that are less likely to metastasise. High-grade sarcomas are defined as those more likely to spread to other parts of the body. For soft-tissue sarcoma, the two histological grading systems are the National Cancer Institute system and the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group system.

Soft-tissue sarcomas commonly originate in the upper body, in the shoulder or upper chest. Some symptoms are uneven posture, pain in the trapezius muscle, and cervical inflexibility [difficulty in turning the head]. The most common site to which soft-tissue sarcoma spreads is the lungs.

== Treatment ==
In general, treatment for soft-tissue sarcomas depends on the stage of the cancer. The stage of the sarcoma is based on the size and grade of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body (metastasized). Treatment options for soft-tissue sarcomas include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy.

* Surgery is the most common treatment for soft-tissue sarcomas, and usually the only way to achieve a cure. The tumor is removed leaving a safe margin of surrounding healthy tissue to decrease the chances of its recurrence.
* Radiation therapy may be used as a neoadjuvant before surgery to shrink tumors, or as an adjuvant after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may have been left behind. In some cases, it can be used to treat tumor that cannot be surgically removed.
* Chemotherapy may be used with radiation therapy either before or after surgery to try to shrink the tumor or kill any remaining cancer cells. There is evidence to suggest that doxorubicin chemotherapy as an adjuvant can reduce recurrence at the original site or elsewhere in the body. Evidence also suggests chemotherapy can increase the length of time patients live, but this is less certain evidence. The use of chemotherapy to prevent the spread of soft-tissue sarcomas has not been proven to be effective. If the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, chemotherapy may be used to shrink tumors and reduce the pain and discomfort they cause, but is unlikely to eradicate the disease. A combination of docetaxel and gemcitabine could be an effective chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.
* Outcomes are better for patients who are seen (and ideally treated) at expert sarcoma centers. In the United States, these are generally found in NCI-designated cancer centers.

==Research==
Soft-tissue sarcoma research requires significant effort due to its rarity; successful research requires substantial collaboration. Year by year, the medical field is learning that the various types cannot be lumped together and each sarcoma needs to be considered a different type of cancer.

As a novel form of treatment used in other cancers, immunotherapy may have a role in treating soft-tissue sarcomas like alveolar soft part sarcoma and pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma. However, as of 2023, only alveolar soft part sarcoma has a regulatory approval for such an agent, in this case atezolizumab.

=== Example of sarcoma immunology research: the Immunological Constant of Rejection ===
When the immunological constant of rejection signature (ICR) was retrospectively applied ICR to 1455 non-metastatic STS and searched for correlations between ICR classes and clinicopathological and biological variables; thirty-four per cent of tumors were classified as ICR1, 27% ICR2, 24% ICR3, and 15% ICR4. These classes were associated with patients’ age, pathological type, and tumor depth, and an enrichment from ICR1 to ICR4 of quantitative/qualitative scores of immune response. ICR1 class was associated with a 59% increased risk of metastatic relapse when compared with ICR2-4 class. In multivariate analysis, ICR classification remained associated with metastasis-free survival, as well as pathological type and Complexity Index in Sarcomas (CINSARC) classification, suggesting independent prognostic value.

ICR signature is independently associated with postoperative MFS in early-stage STS, independently from other prognostic features, including CINSARC. A robust prognostic clinicogenomic model integrating ICR, CINSARC, and pathological type, and suggested differential vulnerability of each prognostic group to different systemic therapies.

== Epidemiology ==
Soft-tissue sarcomas are very uncommon cancers. They account for less than 1% of all new cancer cases each year.

In 2023, about 14,300 new cases were diagnosed in the United States. Soft-tissue sarcomas are more commonly found in older patients (&gt;50 years old), although in children and adolescents under age 20, certain histologies are common (rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma).

Around 3,300 people were diagnosed with soft-tissue sarcoma in the UK in 2011.

== Notable cases ==
* Actor Robert Urich died from synovial sarcoma.
* Folksinger Kate McGarrigle died from clear-cell sarcoma.
* Actress Michelle Thomas died from desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor, a rare abdominal soft-tissue sarcoma.
* &quot;It Is Written&quot; evangelist Henry Feyerabend died from sarcoma in his leg.
* Video game concept artist Adam Adamowicz died from complications of a rare muscle sarcoma on February 9, 2012, at age 42.
* Professional wrestler Jake Roberts revealed he has muscle cancer.
* Professional wrestler Zack Ryder revealed he had synovial sarcoma as a teenager.
* India&#x27;s ex-finance minister Arun Jaitley died from sarcoma on August 24, 2019.

<text>A sarcoma is a malignant tumor, a type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal (connective tissue) origin. Connective tissue is a broad term that includes bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, vascular, or other structural tissues, and sarcomas can arise in any of these types of tissues. As a result, there are many subtypes of sarcoma, which are classified based on the specific tissue and type of cell from which the tumor originates. 

Sarcomas are &quot;primary&quot; connective tissue tumors, meaning that they arise in connective tissues. This is in contrast to &quot;secondary&quot; (or &quot;metastatic&quot;) connective tissue tumors, which occur when a cancer from elsewhere in the body (such as the lungs, breast tissue or prostate) spreads to the connective tissue. Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. The word &quot;sarcoma&quot; is derived from the Greek &#x27;fleshy excrescence or substance&#x27;, itself from meaning &#x27;flesh&#x27;.

== Classification ==
Sarcomas are typically divided into two major groups: bone sarcomas and soft-tissue sarcomas, each of which has multiple subtypes. In the United States, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) publishes guidelines that classify the subtypes of sarcoma. These subtypes are as follows:

===Subtypes of bone sarcoma===
* Osteosarcoma
* Chondrosarcoma
* Poorly differentiated round/spindle cell tumors (includes Ewing sarcoma)
* Hemangioendothelioma
* Angiosarcoma
* Fibrosarcoma/myofibrosarcoma
* Chordoma
* Adamantinoma
* Other:
** Liposarcoma
** Leiomyosarcoma
** Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
** Rhabdomyosarcoma
** Synovial sarcoma
** Malignant solitary fibrous tumor.

===Subtypes of soft-tissue sarcoma===
* Liposarcoma (includes the following varieties: atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid sarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, and myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma
* Atypical lipomatous tumor
* Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (includes pigmented varieties)
* Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, fibrosarcomatous
* Giant cell fibroblastoma
* Malignant solitary fibrous tumor
* Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor
* Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma
* Fibrosarcoma (includes adult and sclerosing epithelioid varieties)
* Myxofibrosarcoma (formerly myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma)
* Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma
* Giant cell tumor of soft tissues
* Leiomyosarcoma
* Malignant glomus tumor
* Rhabdomyosarcoma (includes the following varieties: embryonal, alveolar, pleomorphic, and spindle cell/sclerosing)
* Hemangioendothelioma (includes the following varieties: retiform, pseudomyogenic, and epithelioid)
* Angiosarcoma of soft tissue
* Extraskeletal osteosarcoma
* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, malignant (GIST)
* Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (includes epithelioid variety)
* Malignant Triton tumor
* Malignant granular cell tumor
* Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor
* Stromal sarcoma not otherwise specified
* Myoepithelial carcinoma
* Malignant phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor
*Skin sarcomas
* Synovial sarcoma (includes the following varieties: spindle cell, biphasic, and not otherwise specified)
* Epithelioid sarcoma
* Alveolar soft part sarcoma
* Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue
* Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma
* Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma
* Interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma
* Desmoplastic small round cell tumor
* Extrarenal rhabdoid tumor
* Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor, not otherwise specified
* Intimal sarcoma
* Undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma
* Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
* Undifferentiated round cell sarcoma
* Undifferentiated epithelioid sarcoma
* Undifferentiated sarcoma, not otherwise specified.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of bone sarcomas typically include bone pain, especially at night, and swelling around the site of the tumor.

Symptoms of soft-tissue sarcomas vary, but they often present as firm, oftentimes painless lumps or nodules. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST, a subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma) often are asymptomatic, but can be associated with vague complaints of abdominal pain, bleeding into the intestines, a feeling of fullness, or other signs of intestinal obstruction.

==Cause==
=== Causes and risk factors ===
The cause of most bone sarcomas is not known, but several factors are associated with an increased risk of developing bone sarcoma. Previous exposure to ionizing radiation (such as prior radiation therapy) is one such risk factor. Therapeutic radiation is associated with sarcoma after 10 to 20 years. Exposure to alkylating agents, such as those found in certain cancer chemotherapeutic medicines, also increases the risk of bone sarcoma. Certain inherited genetic syndromes, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, inherited &quot;RB1&quot; gene mutations, and Paget&#x27;s disease of bone are associated with an increased risk of developing bone sarcomas.

Most soft-tissue sarcomas arise from what doctors call &quot;sporadic&quot; (or random) genetic mutations within an affected person&#x27;s cells. Nevertheless, there are certain risk factors associated with an increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcoma. Previous exposure to ionizing radiation is one such risk factor. Exposure to vinyl chloride (e.g., such as the fumes encountered in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)), arsenic and Thorotrast all are associated with an increased risk of angiosarcoma. Lymphedema, such as that resulting from certain types of breast cancer treatment, also is a risk factor for development of angiosarcoma. As with bone sarcomas, certain inherited genetic syndromes also are associated with an increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcoma, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, neurofibromatosis type 1, and heritable &quot;RB1&quot; gene mutations. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8).

== Mechanisms ==
The mechanisms by which healthy cells transform into cancer cells are described in detail elsewhere (see Cancer main page; Carcinogenesis main page). The precise molecular changes that result in sarcoma are not always known, but certain types of sarcomas are associated with particular genetic mutations. Examples include:
* Most cases of Ewing sarcoma are associated with a chromosomal translocation in which part of chromosome 11 fuses with part of chromosome 22. This results in the &quot;EWSR1&quot; gene becoming fused to other genes, including the &quot;FLI1&quot; gene in 90% of Ewing cases and &quot;ERG&quot; gene in 5-10% of cases. These fusions result in the production of abnormal proteins, although how these abnormal proteins result in cancer is not fully known.
* Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans often is associated with a chromosomal translocation in which the &quot;COL1A1&quot; gene becomes fused to the &quot;PDGFRB&quot; gene. This results in over-active PDGF signaling, which is thought to promote cell division and ultimately lead to tumor development.
* Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor often is associated with rearrangements of the &quot;ALK&quot; gene, and occasionally with rearrangements of the &quot;HMGA2&quot; gene.
* Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (not a sarcoma, but a non-metastasizing and locally aggressive soft tissue tumor) frequently is associated with a chromosomal translocation between chromosome 1 and chromosome 2, in which the &quot;CSF1&quot; gene becomes fused with the &quot;COL6A3&quot; gene. This results in increased CSF1 protein production, which is thought to play a role in cancer development.
* Many liposarcomas are associated with amplification of part of chromosome 12, which results in extra copies of known cancer-promoting genes (&quot;oncogenes&quot;) such as the &quot;CDK4&quot; gene, the &quot;MDM2&quot; gene and the &quot;HMGA2&quot; gene.

==Diagnosis==
===Bone sarcomas===

Diagnosis of bone sarcomas begins with a thorough history and physical examination which may reveal characteristic signs and symptoms (see Signs and Symptoms above). Laboratory studies are not particularly useful in diagnosis, although some bone sarcomas (such as osteosarcoma) may be associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, while others (such as Ewing sarcoma) can be associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Importantly, however, none of these laboratory findings are specific to bone sarcomas, meaning that elevations in these lab values are associated with many other conditions as well as sarcoma, and thus cannot be relied upon to conclusively diagnose sarcoma. 

Imaging studies are critically important in diagnosis, and most clinicians will order a plain radiograph (X-ray) initially. Other imaging studies commonly used in diagnosis include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and radioisotope bone scans. A CT scan is typically not used in diagnosis of most types of bone sarcoma, although it is an important tool for staging (see below). Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the tumor and careful review of the biopsy specimen by an experienced pathologist.

===Soft-tissue sarcomas===

Diagnosis of soft-tissue sarcomas also begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Imaging studies can include either CT or MRI, although CT tends to be preferred for soft-tissue sarcomas located in the thorax, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. Positron emission tomography (PET) also may be useful in diagnosis, although its most common use is for staging (see below). As with bone sarcomas, definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the tumor with evaluation of histology by a trained pathologist.

=== Staging ===
In general, cancer staging refers to how advanced a cancer is, and usually it is based upon factors such as tumor size and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Staging is important because the stage affects the prognosis (likely outcome), as well as the types of treatments that are likely to be effective against the cancer. With sarcomas, staging requires a determination of whether the tumor has grown into surrounding tissues (&quot;local invasion&quot;), as well as imaging to determine whether it has spread (a process known as &quot;metastasis&quot;) to lymph nodes (forming &quot;nodal metastases&quot;) or to other tissues or organs in the body (forming &quot;distant metastases&quot;).

The most common imaging tools used for staging bone sarcomas are MRI or CT to evaluate the primary tumor, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest to evaluate whether the cancer has spread (i.e., metastasized) to the lungs, and radioisotope bone scan to evaluate whether the cancer has spread to other bones. Staging for soft-tissue sarcomas typically includes imaging of the primary tumor by MRI or CT to determine tumor size, as well as contrast-enhanced CT of the chest to evaluate for metastatic tumors in the lungs.

===Grade===
Like some other cancers, sarcomas are assigned a grade (low, intermediate, or high) based on the appearance of the tumor cells under a microscope. In general, grade refers to how aggressive the cancer is and how likely it is to spread to other parts of the body (&quot;metastasize&quot;). Low-grade sarcomas have a better prognosis than higher-grade sarcomas, and are usually treated surgically, although sometimes radiation therapy or chemotherapy are used. Intermediate- and high-grade sarcomas are more frequently treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Since high-grade tumors are more likely to undergo metastasis (invasion and spread to locoregional and distant sites), they are treated more aggressively. The recognition that many sarcomas are sensitive to chemotherapy has dramatically improved the survival of patients. For example, in the era before chemotherapy, long-term survival for pediatric patients with localized osteosarcoma was only about 20%, but now has risen to 60–70%.

== Screening ==
In the US, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) publishes guidelines recommending preventive screening for certain types of common cancers and other diseases. , the USPSTF does not recommend screening for sarcoma, possibly because it is a very rare type of cancer (see Epidemiology below).

The American Cancer Society (ACS) also publishes guidelines recommending preventive screening for certain types of common cancers. Like the USPSTF, ACS does not recommend preventive screening for sarcoma.

However, patients with some inherited conditions, such as neurofibromatosis, may benefit from screening for development of cancers from pre-existing benign tumors called neurofibromas. 

== Treatment ==
Surgery is the most common form of the treatment for most sarcomas that have not spread to other parts of the body, and for most sarcomas, surgery is the only curative treatment. Limb-sparing surgery, as opposed to amputation, can now be used to save the limbs of patients in at least 90% of extremity (arm or leg) sarcoma cases. Additional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy (also called &quot;radiotherapy&quot;), which includes proton therapy, may be administered &quot;before surgery&quot; (called &quot;neoadjuvant&quot; chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or &quot;after surgery&quot; (called &quot;adjuvant&quot; chemotherapy or radiotherapy). The use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly improves the prognosis for many sarcoma patients. Treatment can be a long and arduous process, lasting about a year for many patients.
* Liposarcoma treatment usually consists of surgical resection, with chemotherapy considered depending on the aggressiveness of the sarcoma. Radiotherapy may also be used before or after surgical excision for liposarcoma.
* Pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma is usually treated with chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma patients have a 50–85% long term survival rate.
* Osteosarcoma is a cancer of the bone that is treated with surgical resection of as much of the cancer as possible, often along with chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is a second alternative to surgery, although not as successful.

It was believed that higher doses of chemotherapy might improve survival. However, high doses of chemotherapy stop the production of blood cells in the bone marrow and can be harmful. Stem cells collected from people before high‐dose chemotherapy can be transplanted back to the person if the blood cell count gets too low; this is called autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or high dose therapy with stem cell rescue. Research to investigate if using high‐dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was more favourable than standard‐dose chemotherapy found only one RCT and this did not favour either of the two treatment arms with respect to overall survival. As a result, high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is generally considered appropriate only in the research setting.

== Prognosis ==

=== Factors that affect prognosis ===
The AJCC has identified several factors that affect prognosis of bone sarcomas:
* Size of the tumor: larger tumors tend to have a worse prognosis compared to smaller tumors.
* Spread of tumor to surrounding tissues: tumors that have spread locally to surrounding tissues tend to have a worse prognosis compared to tumors that have not spread beyond their place of origin.
* Stage and presence of metastases: tumors that have spread (&quot;metastasized&quot;) to the lymph nodes (which is rare for bone sarcomas) or other organs or tissues (for example, to the lungs) have a worse prognosis compared to tumors that have not metastasized.
* Tumor grade: higher grade tumors (grades 2 and 3) tend to have a worse prognosis compared to low grade (grade 1) tumors.
* Skeletal location: tumors originating in the spine or pelvic bones tend to have a worse prognosis compared to tumors originating in arm or leg bones.

For soft-tissue sarcomas other than GISTs, factors that affect prognosis include:
* Stage: as with bone sarcomas, tumors that have metastasized have a worse prognosis compared to tumors that have not metastasized.
* Grade: the AJCC recommends using a grading system called the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group (FNCLCC) Grade for soft-tissue sarcomas, with high-grade tumors having a worse prognosis compared to low-grade tumors.

For GISTs, the key factor that affects prognosis is:
* Mitotic rate: mitotic rate refers to the fraction of cells that are actively dividing within the tumor; GISTs that have a high mitotic rate have a worse prognosis compared to GISTs that have a low mitotic rate.

=== Outcome data ===
According to data published by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), the overall 5-year survival for bone sarcomas is 66.9%. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 2,140 people in the US will die in 2023 from bone sarcomas, accounting for 0.3% of all cancer deaths. The median age at death is 61 years old, although death can occur in any age group. Thus, 12.3% of bone sarcoma deaths occur in people under 20 years old, 13.8% occur in people 20–34 years old, 5.5% occur in people 35–44 years old, 9.3% occur in people 45–54 years old, 13.5% occur in people 55–64 years old, 16.2% occur in people 65–74 years old, 16.4% occur in people 75–84 years old, and 13.1% occur in people 85 years or older.

For soft-tissue sarcomas, the overall 5-year survival (irrespective of stage) is 64.5%, but survival is affected by many factors, including stage. Thus, the 5-year survival is 80.8% for soft-tissue sarcomas that have not spread beyond the primary tumor (&quot;localized&quot; tumors), 58.0% for soft-tissue sarcomas that have spread only to nearby lymph nodes, and 16.4% for soft-tissue sarcomas that have spread to distant organs. The ACS estimates that 5,140 people will die from soft-tissue sarcoma in 2023, accounting for 0.9% of all cancer deaths.

==Epidemiology==
Sarcomas are rare cancers. The risk of a previously healthy person receiving a new diagnosis of bone cancer is less than 0.001%, while the risk of receiving a new diagnosis of soft-tissue sarcoma is between 0.0014 and 0.005%. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States there will be 3,970 new cases of bone sarcoma in 2023, and 13,400 new cases of soft-tissue sarcoma. Considering that the total estimated number of new cancer diagnoses (all types of cancer) is 1,958,310, this means bone sarcomas represent only 0.2% of all new cancer diagnoses (making them the 30th most common type of cancer) and soft-tissue sarcomas represent only 0.7% (making them the 22nd most common type of cancer) of all new cancer diagnoses in the US in 2023. These estimates are similar to previously reported data.

Sarcomas affect people of all ages. Around 50% of bone sarcomas and 20% of soft-tissue sarcomas are diagnosed in people under the age of 35. Some sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), are more common in adults than in children. Most high-grade bone sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, are much more common in children and young adults.

== In fossils ==
In 2016, scientists reported the discovery of an osteosarcoma tumor in a 1.6–1.8 million-year-old fossil from the skeleton of the now-extinct hominin species &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;, making it the earliest-known case of human cancer.

== Research ==
Treatment of sarcoma, especially when the sarcoma has spread, or &quot;metastasized&quot;, often requires chemotherapy but existing chemotherapeutic medicines are associated with significant toxicities and are not highly effective in killing cancer cells. Therefore, research to identify new medications to treat sarcoma is being conducted . One new type of therapy still under investigation is the use of cancer immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, and anti-CTLA4 agents) to treat sarcomas. These drugs are not yet FDA- or other regulator-approved treatment, except PDL1 inhibitor atezolizumab for the ultra-rate diagnosis of alveolar soft part sarcoma. Other strategies, such as small-molecule targeted therapy, biologic agents (e.g., small interfering RNA molecules), and nanoparticle-directed therapy, also are under active investigated.

Research to understand the specific genetic and molecular factors that cause sarcoma to develop is underway. This could allow for the design of new targeted therapies and allow physicians to more accurately predict a patient&#x27;s prognosis.

==Awareness==
In the US, July is widely recognized as Sarcoma Awareness Month. The UK has a Sarcoma Awareness Week in July led by Sarcoma UK, the bone and soft-tissue cancer charity.

American YouTuber Technoblade was diagnosed with sarcoma in August 2021, and died from his illness in June 2022 after the sarcoma metastasized. He had raised over $500,000 in a charity stream. Many YouTubers have raised awareness and donated to charities such as the Sarcoma Foundation of America after Technoblade&#x27;s diagnosis and passing. To date, Technoblade&#x27;s fans have raised over $1,000,000 for sarcoma research.

TikTok has provided a voice for many creators to chronicle their experiences with sarcoma. &quot;Dance You Outta My Head&quot;, by American singer Cat Janice went viral on TikTok in early 2024 before the singer died of sarcoma, prompting awareness of this rare disease.

Kimberley Nix, a Canadian physician, chronicled her journey with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, from her diagnosis to eventual death, on TikTok under the username @cancerpatientmd. Nix died on 8 May 2024 at the age of 31, and her death was announced in a video uploaded posthumously to her TikTok page. In many of her videos, she links viewers to her Own.Cancer fundraiser, which has raised almost $118,000 CAD as of 17 May 2024.

<text>Kapildev Ramlal Nikhanj (pronunciation: born 6 January 1959) is an Indian former cricket team captain. He is regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of cricket, he was a fast-medium bowler and a hard-hitting middle-order batsman. Dev is the only player in the history of cricket to have taken more than 400 wickets (434 wickets) and scored more than 5,000 runs in Test cricket.

Dev captained the Indian cricket team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, becoming the first Indian captain to win the Cricket World Cup. He is still the youngest captain (at the age of 24) to win the World Cup for any team. He retired in 1994, as the first player to take 200 ODI wickets, and holding the world record for the highest number of wickets taken in Test cricket, a record subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh in 2000. Kapil Dev held the record for the highest individual score (175*) scored by a batsman batting at number 5 or lower in ODIs until 2023, when it was superseded by Glenn Maxwell. He was also a part of the Indian squad which won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket.

After retiring, he coached the Indian national team between September 1999 and September 2000.

In 1982, Dev was awarded the Padma Shri, and in 1991 the Padma Bhushan. In 2002, he was named by &quot;Wisden&quot; as the Indian Cricketer of the Century. On 11 March 2010, Dev was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. In 2013, he received the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honour conferred by BCCI on a former player.

== Early life ==
Kapil Dev Nikhanj was born in Chandigarh, on 6 January 1959, into a Punjabi Hindu family of Ram Lal Nikhanj, a teak merchant and his wife, Rajkumari. His family moved to Fazilka after the partition before eventually moving to Chandigarh. His paternal family is from Montgomery (now known as Sahiwal) and his mother was born in Pakpattan but raised in Okara, both now in Punjab, Pakistan. Dev was a student at D. A. V. College.

== Domestic career ==
Dev made an impressive debut for Haryana in November 1975 against Punjab with a 6-wicket haul, restricting Punjab to just 63 runs and helping Haryana to victory. He finished the season with 121 wickets in 30 matches.

In the 1976–77 season opener against Jammu &amp; Kashmir, he had a match haul of 8/36 in the win. While his contribution for the rest of that season was ordinary, Haryana qualified for the pre-quarterfinals. Dev achieved his then best innings haul of 8/20 in just 9 overs in the second innings to skittle Bengal for 58 runs in under 19 overs. Haryana lost to Bombay in the quarter-finals.

He began his 1977–78 season claiming 8/38 in the first innings against Services. With 3 wickets in the second innings, he took his maiden 10-wicket haul in first-class cricket, a feat he would later achieve twice in Test cricket. With 23 wickets in 4 matches, he was selected for the Irani Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Wills Trophy matches.

In the 1978–79 season, Haryana had a repeat encounter with Bengal in the pre-quarterfinal match after a lackluster season from Dev (12 wickets from 4 matches). He scored 2 half-centuries in the group stage matches. In the pre-quarterfinal match, he took a 5-wicket haul in the first innings. Poor batting by Haryana in the second innings let Bengal avenge their loss from 2 seasons back by scoring the required 161 runs for the loss of just 4 wickets. Dev stood out in the Irani Trophy match, scoring 62 runs and coming in at number 8. He took 5 catches in the game where Karnataka was defeated by the Rest of India XI. Dev arrived in the national spotlight with a standout performance in the finals of the Duleep Trophy, taking a first-innings haul of 7/65 in 24 overs. He was included in the North Zone squad for Deodhar Trophy and Wills Trophy for the first time. He played his first Test match in the season against Pakistan.

In the 1979–80 season, Dev showed his batting talent with a maiden century against Delhi when he scored his career-best 193. In the pre-quarterfinal match, where he captained Haryana for the first time against Uttar Pradesh, he took a five-wicket haul in the second innings to advance to quarterfinals, where they lost to Karnataka. With Dev cementing his place in the Indian national squad, his appearances in domestic matches dwindled.

=== 1990–91 Ranji Champions ===
In the 1990–91 Ranji season, Haryana rode into the semi-finals on the back of the bowling performance of Chetan Sharma and the batting performance of Amarjit Kaypee. Dev took center stage in the semi-final against Bengal, where he led his team to a Mammoth score of 605 runs by scoring 141 as well as taking 5 wickets.

The finals of the 1991 season will be remembered for the number of international cricketers who participated, including Dev, Chetan Sharma, Ajay Jadeja and Vijay Yadav turning up for Haryana and Bombay cricket team represented by Sanjay Manjrekar, Vinod Kambli, Sachin Tendulkar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Chandrakant Pandit, Salil Ankola and Abey Kuruvilla. Deepak Sharma (199), Ajay Jadeja (94), and Chetan Sharma (98) helped Haryana to a score of 522 while Yogendra Bhandari (5 wickets) and Dev (3 wickets) restricted Bombay to 410 runs in the first innings. A crucial 41 from Dev and top scorer Banerjee (60) took Haryana to 242 runs, setting Bombay a target of 355 runs. After the initial wickets, Vengsarkar (139) and Tendulkar (96) fought back for the Bombay team. After Tendulkar&#x27;s dismissal, Haryana took the final 6 wickets for 102 runs and Vengsarkar and Bombay were stranded 3 runs short of the target. Dev won his maiden and only Ranji Trophy championship.

=== County Cricket ===
Dev played county cricket in England Northamptonshire between 1981 and 1983 and for Worcestershire during the 1984 and 1985 seasons. He played a total of 40 first-class matches in his county stint, and made 2,312 runs across 64 innings with four centuries and 14 half-centuries. Out of his 835 overall first-class wickets, 103 of those wickets came in county cricket.

== International career ==
=== Early years (1978–1982) ===
Dev made his Test cricket debut in Faisalabad, Pakistan on 16 October 1978. Although his match figures were unimpressive, the numbers did not convey any measure of his contribution. He startled the Pakistani batsmen with his pace and bouncers that struck their helmets on more than one occasion. Dev captured his maiden wicket of Sadiq Mohammad with his trademark outswinger. He showcased his all-rounder talent when he scored India&#x27;s fastest Test half-century off 33 balls and 2 sixes in each of the innings during the 3rd Test match at National Stadium, Karachi, although India lost the match and the series 2–0. In the ensuing series against a visiting West Indies team, he scored his maiden Test century (126) at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi in just 124 balls and had a steady bowling performance (17 wickets at 33.00). Ominous signs of Dev&#x27;s liking for England showed up in the ensuring series, his first outside the sub-continent. He picked up his first 5-wicket haul and all of England&#x27;s wickets, although it came at a huge cost (48 overs and 146 runs conceded) as England scored a mammoth 633 and won the match comfortably. Dev finished the series with 16 wickets though his batting haul of 45 runs (Average: 7.5) was unimpressive. His debut in ODI Cricket happened in the earlier tour of Pakistan where his individual performance was ordinary and it stayed the same as both Dev and India had a poor campaign at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.

Dev established himself as India&#x27;s premier fast bowler when he took two 5-wicket hauls and ended the home series against Australia with 28 wickets (Average: 22.32) and also 212 runs that included a half-century. He gained fame in the 6-Test home series against Pakistan in the 1979–80 season when he led India to 2 victories against the visitors – once with the bat (69) at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay and the second time with bat and ball (10-wicket haul in match – 4/90 in the first innings and 7/56 in the second innings, 84 in 98 balls with his bat) at Chepauk, Madras (Now Chennai). Dev rates his all-round performance in this match as his career best and his second innings figure of 7/56 was his best to-date. During the series, he also became the youngest Test player to achieve the all-round double of 100 Wickets and 1000 Runs and in 25 matches (although Ian Botham took just 21 matches to achieve the same feat) and finished the series with 32 wickets (Ave: 17.68) and 278 runs that included 2 fifties.
India&#x27;s tour of Australia in 1980–81 had the looks of the familiar Indian series as India were 1–0 down and were defending a meagre 143 runs and Dev virtually ruled out with a groin injury. When Australia finished the fourth day at 18/3, Dev willed himself to play the final day with pain-killing injections and removed the dangerous Australia middle order. Dev won the match for India with the innings bowling performance of 16.4–4–28–5, a bowling performance that figures in his five best bowling performance. During the Australian tour, he scored his first fifty in ODIs against New Zealand at Brisbane. Somehow India&#x27;s Test cricket sensation was unable to adjust to ODI cricket and had a career start of 278 runs (Average: 17.38) and 17 wickets after 16 ODI matches.

A dismal New Zealand tour later, Dev was ready for the 1981–82 home series against England where his five-wicket haul won the first test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay. He scored 318 runs (Average: 53, 1 century, 1 fifty) and took 22 wickets (2 5-wicket hauls) and walked away with the Man of the Series honours. England saw more of Dev in the ensuing series at home against the Indian cricket team in the 1982 season when he opened with a 5-wicket haul and 130 runs in a losing cause at Lord&#x27;s. He finished the 3-match series with 292 runs (Ave: 73, 3 fifties) and 10 Wickets and bagged the Man of the Series again.

Facing Sri Lanka for the first time, Dev helped himself to a five-wicket haul to kick start the 1982–83 season. In the following tour to Pakistan, Dev and Mohinder Amarnath were the only bright spots in a series dominated by rival all-rounder Imran Khan (40 wickets and 1 century). Dev took a 5/102 haul in the second Test at National Stadium, Karachi, 7/220 in the third Test at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad and 8/85 at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore while he received little support from other team members. After this disastrous tour, Dev was made the captain of the Indian cricket team in place of Sunil Gavaskar.

=== Captain: 1983 World Cup Champions (1982–1984) ===
Dev debuted as India&#x27;s captain in the 1982–83 season against Sri Lanka (before the Pakistan tour) when Gavaskar was rested. His first assignment as regular captain was the tour of West Indies, where the biggest accomplishment was a lone ODI victory. Dev (72) and Gavaskar (90) led India to a huge score – 282/5 in 47 overs and Dev&#x27;s 2 wickets aided India to restrict West Indies for 255 and a victory that Indian cricketers claim gave them the confidence to face the West Indies team in 1983 Cricket World Cup. Overall, Dev had a good series in West Indies as he scored a century to save the second test match as well as picking up 17 wickets (Average: 24.94).

==== 1983 World Cup performance ====
Dev entered the World Cup with an ordinary individual record – 32 Matches, 608 Runs (Average: 21), 34 wickets. India&#x27;s solitary victory in the previous two World Cups was against East Africa in 1975. Riding on Yashpal Sharma (89 Runs), Roger Binny and Ravi Shastri (3 wickets each), India inflicted the West Indies&#x27; first-ever defeat in the World Cup. Following a victory against Zimbabwe, India lost the next two matches – Australia (despite Dev&#x27;s best career figures of 5/43) and West Indies. India now needed victories against Australia and Zimbabwe to advance to the semifinals.

India faced Zimbabwe at Nevill Ground, Royal Tunbridge Wells on 18 June 1983. After falling behind, Dev, batting with the lower order batsmen, stabilised the side with help from Roger Binny (22 runs) and Madan Lal. Kapil&#x27;s half-century came off in 72 balls. After the lunch break, he raised the tempo, racing to his hundred off an even 100 balls. His final 38 balls raised 75. Together with Kirmani (24 runs), Dev put on an unbeaten 126 runs for the 9th wicket – a world record that stood unbroken for 27 years (10,000 days), and finished not out with 175 runs off 138 balls, an innings that included 16 boundaries and 6 sixes. The innings figures in the Top 10 ODI Batting Performances at No. 4. India won the match by 31 runs.
India faced the English cricket team in the semifinals. Dev helped curtail the lower order after England lost regular wickets to Binny and Amarnath. He took 3 wickets as India limited England to 213 and the middle order of Amarnath (46 runs), Yashpal Sharma (61) and Sandeep Patil (51*) ensured victory and entry into the finals to take on the West Indies cricket team who were looking for a hat-trick of World Cup titles. West Indies restricted India for 183 runs, with only Krishnamachari Srikkanth (38 runs) providing some scoring relief. Despite losing Gordon Greenidge, West Indies steadied their innings to 57/2 on the back of quick scoring by Viv Richards. Richards played one too many aggressive shots when he skied a pull shot from Madan Lal that Dev caught at deep square leg after running backward for over 20 yards. The catch is attributed as the turning point in the 1983 WC Final and is regarded as one of the finest in ODI Cricket. West Indies collapsed from 50/1 to 76/6 and finally were bowled out for 140 with Dev picking up the wicket of Andy Roberts and Mohinder Amarnath picking up the final wicket of Michael Holding. The win was India&#x27;s maiden World Cup and he led with 303 runs (Average: 60.6), 12 wickets (Average: 20.41) and 7 catches in 8 matches. This moment inspired several cricketers all over India, including Sachin Tendulkar

=== Post-World Cup ===
After the World Cup, India hosted the West Indies cricket team and lost the Test series 3–0 and the ODI Series 5–0. Dev achieved his best test bowling performance in a loss at Motera Stadium, Ahmedabad with a return of 9/83. His bowling performance in the test and ODI series was let down by his poor batting performance. The selectors ended Dev&#x27;s reign by reappointing Gavaskar as captain in early 1984.

=== Return to captaincy (1985–87) ===
Dev returned to captaincy in 1985 after Gavaskar was sacked following series losses in both ODI and Tests when England toured India. Under Dev&#x27;s leadership India won the Benson &amp; Hedges World Championship of Cricket after beating arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. This success was followed another big victory as India beat Australia in the finals of Rothmans Four-Nations Cup. The following year he guided India on a Test series win over England in England in 1986 as his side won 2–0. This period saw one of his most famous matches, the second Tied Test, in which he was named joint-man of the match with Australian batsman Dean Jones.

He was retained as captain for the 1987 Cricket World Cup. In their first match, Australia scored 268 against India. However, after the close of innings, Dev agreed with the umpires that the score should be increased to 270 as one boundary during the innings had been mistakenly signalled as a four and not a six. In their reply, India scored 269 falling short of Australia&#x27;s score by one run. In the Wisden Cricketer&#x27;s Almanack, it was reported that &quot;Kapil Dev&#x27;s sportsmanship proved the deciding factor in a close-run match&quot;. India went on to reach the semi-final of the 1987 World Cup, where they lost to England. Dev faced the blame for India&#x27;s defeat as he holed out to deep mid-wicket triggering a collapse that led to the unexpected loss. He did not captain India again, although he was the Vice-captain for India&#x27;s tour to Pakistan in 1989.

The captaincy period was on the whole a difficult one for him as it was mired with reports of differences with Gavaskar, as well as his own inconsistent form as a bowler. However, both men later insisted that these reports were exaggerated. Dev&#x27;s performance as Captain was better than as a player.

=== Skills ===
Dev was a right-arm pace bowler noted for his graceful action and potent outswinger, and was India&#x27;s main strike bowler for most of his career. He developed a fine inswinging yorker during the 1980s, which he used very effectively against tail-enders. As a batsman, he was a natural striker of the ball who could hook and drive effectively. A naturally aggressive player, he often helped India in difficult situations by taking the attack to the opposition. Nicknamed &quot;The Haryana Hurricane&quot;, he represented the Haryana cricket team in domestic cricket.

=== Bowling style ===
Dev was a fast bowler. However, a fluent run-up and a gather that was perfectly side-on at the time of delivery meant that the outswinger came naturally to him. Usually bowled at a length and direction that always troubled right-handers, his delivery was the bane of most of his victims as he sought to beat the bat on the outside edge, either caught on the off-side cordon or indeed LBW and bowled in case the ball missed the edge. The side-on action meant that, for the first few years, this was the only delivery he could bowl. The deliveries that held their lines or came into the right-hander came through natural variations off the pitch. However, as he gained maturity, the action became less side-on and he developed an inswinger too. He noted in the mid-1980s that the only delivery he could not bowl at will was the leg-cutter.

By the end of 1983, Dev already had about 250 Test wickets in just five years and looked well on his way to becoming one of the most prolific wicket-takers ever. However, his bowling declined following knee surgery in 1984, as he lost some of his jump at the crease. Despite this setback, he never missed playing a single test or one-day game on fitness grounds. Though he lost some of his bite, he remained an effective bowler for another ten years and became the second bowler ever to take 400 wickets in Test cricket in 1991–92 when he took Mark Taylor&#x27;s wicket in a series versus Australia in Australia. In that Australian tour he took 25 wickets.

=== Final years ===
Dev continued as India&#x27;s lead pace bowler under a succession of captains in the early 1990s. He was involved in a notable incident during the Lord&#x27;s Test Match of 1990, when he hit off-spinner Eddie Hemmings for four sixes in succession to take India past the follow-on target. This match featured the highest test score by an Englishman against India, 333 by Graham Gooch. Dev was cited by umpire Dickie Bird as being one of the greatest all-rounders of all time.

He became a valuable batsman in the ODI version of the game, as a pinch-hitter used to accelerate the run-scoring rate, usually in the final ten overs, and was relied upon to stabilise the innings in the event of a collapse. He played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup, his last, under the captaincy of Mohammad Azharuddin and topped the batting strike rate with 125.80 runs per 100 balls. He led the bowling attack with younger talents like Javagal Srinath and Manoj Prabhakar, who would eventually succeed him as India&#x27;s leading pace bowlers. He retired in 1994, after breaking Richard Hadlee&#x27;s then standing record for the most Test wickets taken.

=== List of centuries by opponent ===
==Coaching career==
Dev was appointed the Indian national cricket coach in September 1999 following the appointment of Sachin Tendulkar as captain of the Indian team in August 1999. The team saw success in his first series at home against New Zealand but saw whitewash in the subsequent test series against host tour of Australia and visitors South Africa, India&#x27;s first home series loss in 12 years. India&#x27;s 3–2 win in the subsequent ODI series under new captain Sourav Ganguly is remembered for the claims of match-fixing against South Africa&#x27;s captain Hansie Cronje.

As the match-fixing scandal took centrestage, former player Manoj Prabhakar accused Kapil Dev of trying to bribe him in 1994 during a tournament in Sri Lanka. Under severe pressure from politicians and fans, Kapil Dev resigned as coach in September 2000, after having spent less than one year as the team coach. The reports of CBI (India&#x27;s premier investigating agency) and K. Madhavan (appointed by BCCI to investigate match-fixing allegations) in November 2000 exonerated Kapil Dev of any involvement in match-fixing. India&#x27;s performance in the coaching stint of Kapil Dev was below-par, winning just one Test match (out of 8 played) and 9 ODIs (out of 25 played).

===India&#x27;s performance under Kapil&#x27;s Coaching===
====New Zealand tour of India ====
Kapil Dev was appointed coach of the Indian national cricket team in 1999 succeeding Anshuman Gaekwad. His appointment coincided with the second term of captaincy for Tendulkar. Kapil&#x27;s first international competition as India&#x27;s coach started badly with the team bowled out for 83 all out against the visiting New Zealand team in Mohali. Due to an inspired bowling display by Javagal Srinath, the lead was restricted to 132 runs after New Zealand were dismissed for 215. India&#x27;s batsmen bounced back in the second innings with a total of 505 with all the top five batsmen passing fifty and Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar scoring centuries. Anil Kumble&#x27;s ten-wicket match haul at Kanpur enabled India to win the second Test match. The Third Test ended in a draw, with Tendulkar recording his first double-century in Test Cricket. In the ensuing ODI Series, India won 3–2 and the highlight for Indian team was a world record ODI partnership of 331 runs between Dravid and Tendulkar in the 2nd match at Hyderabad. The series against New Zealand would be Kapil&#x27;s most successful series as national coach.

====Indian tour of Australia====
India followed the NZ tour with a trip to Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was heavy in each of these matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India&#x27;s ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defence of his team.

====South Africa tour of India====
India had not lost a home test series since 1987 (against Pakistan) and when South Africa toured India in February – March 2000, that streak was ended as India lost the home series 2–0. However events outside the field overshadowed the cricket: Before start of the series, Tendulkar announced his decision to relinquish the captaincy after the Test matches, Azharuddin and Mongia were recalled to the team, controversy arose over Azharuddin&#x27;s injury leading to his exclusion from the First Test. Ganguly was made the captain of the Indian team for the one-day series. Talks in the media about no way but &#x27;UP&#x27; were not unfounded when India took a 2–0 lead in the ODI Series and finishing the series at 3–2, after South Africa won the last two matches. It was learnt later that South Africa&#x27;s captain Cronje was involved in betting and there were attempts to buy-off South African players by Cronje and bookmakers. At the end of the series, the media felt that Ganguly&#x27;s attitude and captaincy was heartening. In March 2000, India participated in a triangular series with South Africa and Pakistan. India won only one of their four matches and missed the finals.

=== Legacy of Kapil&#x27;s coaching ===
Kapil&#x27;s term as Indian cricket team&#x27;s national coach was not considered a success due to poor on-field performances. During Kapil&#x27;s reign as National Coach, India performed badly in away matches and managed just 3 victories in 15 games (20%) in ODI Tournaments. In Test cricket, India lost its first home series in 13 years and managed just 1 victory in 3 Test series.

==Match fixing allegation and resignation==
===Background===
As the 1999/00 cricket season was winding down, the Delhi Police shocked the cricket world when they announced that Cronje was involved in a &quot;Cricket Match-fixing and Betting Racket&quot;. The UCBSA released terse statements denying the allegations triggering a diplomatic row. When Delhi Police began mounting evidence, Cronje admitted to accepting money for throwing away games in a phone call with UCBSA&#x27;s chief Ali Bacher. Cronje was sacked and replaced by Shaun Pollock.

===Manoj Prabhakar&#x27;s allegations===
Allegations against Dev were based on the testimony of former Indian cricketer Manoj Prabhakar who claimed that Dev wanted him to throw a match against Pakistan in the 1994 Singer Cup in Colombo. Prabhakar had previously alleged that he was offered money to throw this game to the &quot;Outlook&quot; in 1997, however he did not mention who made him this offer. Based on these allegations, BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one-man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Dev asked him to throw away the match. Amidst these inquiries, Kapil Dev appeared for an interview on BBC&#x27;s Hard Talk with Karan Thapar, where while defending himself against these allegations, he broke down in tears.

===Kapil&#x27;s resignation===
Kapil initially did not resign or take a leave of absence, from his coaching responsibilities. As the weeks progressed and as public discontent mounting on inaction in the match-fixing scandal and in no small measure the pressure from the then Union Sport Minister Shukdev Singh Dhindsa, Kapil Dev resigned from his position of Indian Cricket Coach on 12 September 2000 vowing farewell to the game of cricket.

===Clearing of match-fixing charges===

After extensive investigation and interviews, the CBI submitted its report to Union Sports Minister on 1 November 2000. The report found that there was 
&quot;no credible evidence&quot; against Kapil. The BCCI&#x27;s anti-corruption officer K Madhavan (former Joint Director of CBI) submitted his report on 28 November 2000 in which he elaborated on players who were found to have links with the match-fixing syndicate. Madhavan concluded that Kapil did not attempt to bribe Prabhakar and none of the players corroborated with Prabhakar&#x27;s version of the events.

== Post retirement as player and coach ==
=== Return ===
After a period of silence away from the public eye, Dev returned to cricket when &quot;Wisden&quot; announced him as one of the sixteen finalists for the &quot;Wisden&quot; Indian Cricketer of the Century award in July 2002. Dev pipped longtime teammate Gavaskar and crowd favourite Tendulkar to win the award and claimed the moment as &quot;my finest hour&quot;.

Dev slowly returned to cricket as a bowling consultant and was the bowling coach in the preparatory camp prior to India&#x27;s tour of Pakistan in March 2004. In October 2006, he was nominated as the chairman of National Cricket Academy for a two-year period.

In 2005, he acted in a brief role in the cult film &quot;Iqbal&quot; written by Vipul K. Rawal where he played himself. Initially the director was not keen on approaching him; however, writer Rawal insisted as the role was written with him in mind.
In May 2007, Dev joined the upstart Indian Cricket League (ICL) floated by Zee TV as the chairman of executive board, defending his decision as complimenting BCCI&#x27;s structure rather than opposing it – &quot;We are not looking to create a rival team but helping the Indian board to find more talent&quot;. In June 2007, BCCI responded by revoking the pension for all players who had joined ICL, including Dev. On 21 August 2007, Dev was removed from the chairmanship of the National Cricket Academy, a day after he addressed a formal press conference of the new Indian Cricket League.

On 25 July 2012 Dev resigned from ICL and continued to support BCCI, thereby paving way to get back into the BCCI fold.

=== Chancellor of Haryana&#x27;s Sports University ===
He was appointed as first chancellor of the Sports University of Haryana in 2019. The university is situated in India&#x27;s Haryana state which he represented in domestic cricket.

== Personal life ==
Dev married Romi Bhatia in 1980 with whom he has a daughter, Amiya Dev, born on 16 January 1996.

In 1993, Dev took up golf. Dev was the only Asian founding member of Laureus Foundation in 2000. Ian Botham and Viv Richards were the other two cricketers on the founding member council of 40. Steve Waugh was added to the academy members in 2006 when it was expanded from 40 to 42. Dev pledged his organs during an event organised by Delhi Urological Society on 31 January 2014 at the Airport Authority of India, Officers Club, New Delhi.

On 23 October 2020, Dev suffered a heart attack and was hospitalised. He underwent an emergency coronary angioplasty at a hospital in Delhi.

== Books ==
He has written four books – three autobiographical and one book on Sikhism. Autobiographical works include — &quot;By God&#x27;s Decree&quot; which came out in 1985, &quot;Cricket My Style&quot; in 1987, and &quot;Straight from the Heart&quot; in 2004. His latest book titled &quot;We, The Sikhs&quot; was released in 2019.

<text>Tangier ( ; , , ) is a city in northwestern Morocco, on the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The city is the capital of the Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, as well as the Tangier-Assilah Prefecture of Morocco.

Many civilisations and cultures have influenced the history of Tangier, starting from before the 10th centuryBCE. Starting as a strategic Phoenician town and trading centre, Tangier has been a nexus for many cultures. In 1923, it became an international zone managed by colonial powers and became a destination for many European and American diplomats, spies, bohemians, writers and businessmen. That status came to an end with Moroccan independence, in phases between 1956 and 1960.

By the early 21st century, Tangier was undergoing rapid development and modernisation. Projects include tourism projects along the bay, a modern business district called Tangier City Centre, an airport terminal, and a football stadium. Tangier&#x27;s economy is set to benefit greatly from the Tanger-Med port.

==Names==
The Carthaginian name of the city is variously recorded as (), (), (), and (); these appear in Greek and Roman sources as Tenga, Tinga, Titga, &amp;c. The old Berber name was &quot;Tingi&quot; (), which Ruiz connects to Berber &quot;tingis&quot;, meaning &quot;marsh&quot;. The Greeks later claimed that &quot;Tingís&quot; () had been named for Tinjis, a daughter of the Titan Atlas, who was supposed to support the vault of heaven nearby. Latin Tingis then developed into Portuguese , Spanish , and French , which entered English as &quot;Tangier&quot; and &quot;Tangiers&quot;. The Arabic and modern Berber name of the town is &quot;Ṭanjah&quot; (, ).

Moroccan historian Ahmed Toufiq considers that the name &quot;Tingi&quot; has the same etymology as &quot;Tinghir&quot;, and is composed of &quot;Tin&quot;, which is a feminine particle that could be translated as &quot;owner&quot; or &quot;she who has&quot;, and &quot;gi&quot; which may have originally been &quot;ig&quot;, meaning &quot;high location&quot;. This corresponds to the popular Moroccan phrase &quot;Tanja l-ɛalya&quot; (Tangier the High), which may be a remnant echo of the original meaning, as well as a reference to the high location of Tangier. A similar construction can be found in the name of &quot;Tinmel&quot;, the first capital of the Almohads, which is composed of &quot;Tin&quot;, and &quot;Amlel&quot; meaning &quot;at foot of the mountain&quot; or &quot;at a low location&quot;.

Tangier was formally known as (&quot;The Julian Colony of Tingis&quot;) following its elevation to colony status during the Roman Empire. The nicknames &quot;Bride of the North&quot; and &quot;Door of Africa&quot; reference its position in far northwestern Africa near the Strait of Gibraltar.

==History==
===Ancient===


Tangier was founded as a Phoenician colony, possibly as early as the 10th centuryBCE and almost certainly by the 8th centuryBCE. The majority of Berber tombs around Tangier had Punic jewelry by the 6th centuryBCE, speaking to abundant trade by that time. The Carthaginians developed it as an important port of their empire by the 5th centuryBCE. It was probably involved with the expeditions of Hanno the Navigator along the West African coast. The city long preserved its Phoenician traditions, issuing bronze coins under the Mauretanian kings with Punic script. Under the Romans other coins were issued, bearing Augustus and Agrippa&#x27;s heads and Latin script obverse but an image of the Canaanite god Baal reverse. Some editions of Procopius place his Punic stelae in Tingis rather than Tigisis; in either case, however, their existence is highly dubious.

The Greeks knew this town as Tingis and, with some modification, record the Berber legends of its founding. Supposedly Tinjis, daughter of Atlas and widow of Antaeus, slept with Hercules and bore him the son Syphax. After Tinjis&#x27; death, Syphax then founded the port and named it in her honour. The gigantic skeleton and tomb of Antaeus were tourist attractions for ancient visitors. The Caves of Hercules, where he supposedly rested on Cape Spartel during his labors, remain one today.

Tingis came under the control of the Roman ally Mauretania during the Punic Wars. Q. Sertorius, in his war against Sulla&#x27;s regime in Rome, took and held Tingis for several years in the 70sBCE. It was subsequently returned to the Mauretanians but established as a republican free city during the reign of BocchusIII in 38BCE.

Tingis received certain municipal privileges under Augustus and became a Roman colony under Claudius, who made it the provincial capital of Mauretania Tingitana. Under Diocletian&#x27;s 291 reforms, it became the seat of a count (&#x27;) and Tingitana&#x27;s governor (&#x27;). At the same time, the province itself shrank to little more than the ports along the coast and, owing to the Great Persecution, Tingis was also the scene of the martyrdoms by beheading of SaintsMarcellus and Cassian in 298. Tingis remained the largest settlement in its province in the 4th century and was greatly developed.

===Medieval===

Probably invited by Count Boniface, who feared war with the empress dowager, tens of thousands of Vandals under Gaiseric crossed into North Africa in 429 CE and occupied Tingis and Mauretania as far east as Calama. When Boniface learned that he and the empress had been manipulated against each other by Aetius, he attempted to compel the Vandals to return to Spain but was instead defeated at Calama in 431. The Vandals lost control of Tingis and the rest of Mauretania in various Berber uprisings.

Tingis was reconquered by Belisarius, the general of the Byzantine emperor JustinianI, in 533 as part of the Vandalic War. The new provincial administration was moved, however, to the more defensible base at Septem (present-day Ceuta). Byzantine control probably yielded to pressure from Visigoth Spain around 618.

Count Julian of Ceuta supposedly led the last defences of Tangier against the Muslim invasion of North Africa. Medieval romance made his betrayal of Christendom a personal vendetta against the Visigoth king Roderic over the honour of his daughter, but Tangier at last fell to a siege by the forces of Musa bin Nusayr sometime between 707 and 711. While he moved south through central Morocco, he had his deputy at Tangier Tariq ibn Zayid, Musa&#x27;s &quot;mawla&quot; launch the beginning of the Muslim invasion of Spain. Uqba ibn Nafi was frequently but erroneously credited with Tangier&#x27;s conquest by medieval historians, but only owing to Musa&#x27;s later commission at the hands of Al-Walid I.

Under the Umayyads, Tangier served as the capital of the Moroccan district (&quot;Maghreb al-Aqsa&quot; or &quot;al-Udwa&quot;) of the province of Africa (&quot;Ifriqiya&quot;). The conquest of the Maghreb and Spain had, however, been undertaken principally as raids for slaves and plunder and the caliphate&#x27;s leadership continued to treat all Berbers as pagans or slaves for tax purposes, even after their wholesale conversion to Islam. In the area around Tangier, these hateful taxes were mostly paid in female slaves or in tender lambskins obtained by beating the ewes to induce premature birth. Governor Yazid was murdered by Berber guards whom he had tattooed as slaves in , and in the 730s, similar treatment from Governor Ubayd Allah and al-Muradi, his deputy at Tangier, provoked the Berber Revolt. Inspired by the egalitarian Kharijite heresy, Barghawata and others under Maysara al-Matghari seized Tangier in the summer of 740. In the Battle of the Nobles on the city&#x27;s outskirts a few months later, Maysara&#x27;s replacement Khalid ibn Hamid massacred the cream of Arab nobility in North Africa. An enraged Caliph Hisham ordered an attack from a second army &quot;whose beginning is where they are and whose end is where I am,&quot; but this army was defeated at Bagdoura the next year. The Barghawata were concentrated further south on the Atlantic coast, and area around Tangier fell into chaos until 785.

The Shia Arab refugee Idris arrived at Tangier before moving further south, marrying into local tribes around Moulay Idriss and assembling an army that, among its other conquests, took Tangier . During the division of the sultanate that occurred on the death of IdrisII, Tangier fell to his son Qasim in 829. It was soon taken by Qasim&#x27;s brother Umar, who ruled it until his death in 835. Umar&#x27;s son Ali became sultan (r.874–883), as did Qasim&#x27;s son Yahya after him (r.880–904), but they governed from Fez.

The Fatimid caliph Abdullah al-Madhi began interfering in Morocco in the early 10th century, prompting the Umayyad emir of Cordova to proclaim himself caliph and to begin supporting proxies against his rivals. He helped the Maghrawa Berbers overrun Melilla in 927, Ceuta in 931, and Tangier in 949. Tangier&#x27;s governor was subsequently named chief over Cordova&#x27;s Moroccan possessions and allies. Ali ibn Hammud, named Cordova&#x27;s governor for Ceuta in 1013, took advantage of the realm&#x27;s civil wars to conquer Tangier and Málaga before overrunning Cordova itself and proclaiming himself caliph in 1016. His Barghawata ally Rizḳ Allāh was then permitted to rule from Tangier with general autonomy.

Yusuf ibn Tashfin captured Tangier for the Almoravids in 1077. It fell to Abd al-Mumin&#x27;s Almohads in the 1147, and then flourished under his dynasty, with its port highly active.

Like Ceuta, Tangier did not initially acknowledge the Marinids after the fall of the Almohads. Instead, the local chief Yusuf ibn Muhammad pledged himself to the Hafsids in Tunisia and then to the Abbasids in the east before being killed in 665 (late 1266 or early 1267). Abu Yusuf Yaqub compelled Tangier&#x27;s allegiance with a three months&#x27; siege in 1274.

The next century was an obscure time of rebellions and difficulties for the city. During this time, the traveler Ibn Battuta was born in Tangier in 1304, leaving home at 20 for the hajj. Piracy from Tangier and Salé began to harass shipping in the strait and North Atlantic in the late 14thcentury. A partial plan of the late medieval kasbah was found in a Portuguese document now held by the Military Archives of Sweden in Stockholm.

=== Early modern ===
When the Portuguese started their colonial expansion by taking Ceuta in retribution for its piracy in 1415, Tangier was always a major goal. They failed to capture it in 1437, 1458, and 1464, but occupied it unopposed on 28 August 1471 after its garrison fled upon learning of the conquest of Asilah. As in Ceuta, they converted its chief mosque into the town&#x27;s cathedral church; it was further embellished by several restorations during the town&#x27;s occupation. In addition to the cathedral, the Portuguese raised European-style houses and Franciscan and Dominican chapels and monasteries. The Wattasids assaulted Tangier in 1508, 1511, and 1515 but without success. In the 17th century, it passed with the rest of Portugal&#x27;s domains into Spanish control as part of the personal union of the crowns but maintained its Portuguese garrison and administration.
Iberian rule lasted until 1661, when it was given to England&#x27;s King CharlesII as part of the dowry of the Portuguese infanta Catherine of Braganza. A squadron under the admiral and ambassador Edward Montagu arrived in November. English Tangier, fully occupied in January 1662, was praised by Charles as &quot;a jewell of immense value in the royal diadem&quot; despite the departing Portuguese taking away everything they could, evenaccording to the official report&quot;the very fflowers, the Windowes and the Dores&quot;. Tangier received a garrison and a charter which made it equal to other English towns, but the religious orders were expropriated, the Portuguese residents nearly entirely left, and the town&#x27;s Jews were driven out owing to fears concerning their loyalty. Meanwhile, the Tangier Regiment were almost constantly under attack by locals who considered themselves &quot;mujahideen&quot; fighting a holy war. Their principal leader was Khadir Ghaïlan (known to the English as &quot;Gayland&quot; or &quot;Guyland&quot;) of the Banu Gurfat, whom the Earl of Peterborough attempted to buy off. Ultimately, the truce lasted only for part of 1663 and 1664; on May 4 of the latter year, the Earl of Teviot and around 470 members of the garrison were killed in an ambush beside Jew&#x27;s Hill. Lord Belasyse happened to secure a longer-lasting treaty in 1666: Khadir Ghaïlan hoped to support a pretender against the new Alawid sultan Al-Rashid and things subsequently went so badly for him that he was obliged to abide by its terms until his death in 1673.

The English took advantage of the respite to improve greatly the Portuguese defences. They also planned to improve the harbour by building a mole, which would have allowed it to play the same role that Gibraltar later played in British naval strategy. Incompetence, waste and outright fraud and embezzlement caused costs to swell; among those enriched was Samuel Pepys. The mole cost £340,000 and reached long before its destruction. Although funding was found for the fortifications, the garrison&#x27;s pay was delayed until in December 1677 it was 2 years in arrears; Governor Fairborne dealt with the ensuing mutiny by seizing one of the soldier&#x27;s muskets and killing him with it on the spot.

A determined siege by Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco between 1678 and 1680 was unsuccessful, but longstanding exasperation with the colony&#x27;s finances and the difficulties caused by the siege pushed Parliament to write off the effort in 1680. At the time, Tangier&#x27;s population consisted of only about 700 apart from the thousand-man garrison; Governor Kirke estimated 400 of them had suffered gonorrhea from the same &quot;mighty pretty&quot; sex worker. Forces under Lord Dartmouth (including Samuel Pepys) methodically destroyed the town and its port facilities for five months prior to Morocco&#x27;s occupation of the city on 7 February 1684.

Ali ibn Abdallah and his son Ahmed ibn Ali served in turn as the town&#x27;s governors until 1743, repopulating it with populace from the surrounding countryside. They were powerful enough to oppose Sultan Abdallah through his various reigns, giving support and asylum to his various rivals within and without the royal family.

The city was attacked by Spain in 1790.

=== Internationalisation ===


From the 18th century, Tangier served as Morocco&#x27;s diplomatic headquarters. The United States dedicated its first consulate in Tangier during the George Washington&#x27;s tenure as president. In 1821, the Legation Building in Tangier became the first piece of property acquired abroad by the U.S. government—a gift to the U.S. from Sultan Moulay Suliman.

In 1828, Great Britain blockaded the port in retaliation for piracy. As part of its ongoing conquest of neighbouring Algeria, France declared war over Moroccan tolerance of Abd el-Kader; Tangier was bombarded by a French fleet under the Prince of Joinville on 6 August 1844. What little of its fortifications were damaged were later repaired by English engineers, but French victory at Isly near the disputed border ended the conflict on French terms.

Italian revolutionary hero Giuseppe Garibaldi lived in exile at Tangier in late 1849 and the first half of 1850, following the fall of the revolutionary Roman Republic.

Tangier&#x27;s geographic location made it a centre of European diplomatic and commercial rivalry in Morocco in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By the 1870s, it was the site of every foreign embassy and consul in Morocco but only held about 400 foreign residents out of a total population of around 20,000. The city increasingly came under French influence, and it was here in 1905 that Kaiser WilhelmII triggered an international crisis that almost led to war between his country and France by pronouncing himself in favour of Morocco&#x27;s continued independence, with an eye to its future acquisition by the German Empire. The Algeciras Conference which ended the standoff left Tangier&#x27;s police training and customs collections in international hands but Britain&#x27;s strong support of its &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; with France ended German hopes concerning Morocco.

Improved harbour facilities were completed in 1907, with an inner and outer mole. In 1905 the first Moroccan newspaper, &quot;Lisan al-Maghrib&quot; (&quot;The Voice of Morocco&quot;), was established in Tangiers on the order of Sultan Abdelaziz, partly with the aim of counteracting the views expressed by &quot;al-Sa&#x27;adah&quot;, an Arabic newspaper established in 1904 or 1905 by the French embassy in the city. The newspaper was founded and managed on behalf of the government by two Lebanese journalists, Faraj and Artur Numur. It later became more notorious for publishing reformist ideas and views critical of the sultan. In the years leading up to the First World War, Tangier had a population of about 40,000, about half Muslim, a quarter Jewish, and a quarter European Christians. Of the Europeans, about three-quarters were Spanish artisans and labourers.

In 1912, the Treaty of Fes established the French protectorate over most of Morocco and Spanish rule in the country&#x27;s far south and north, but left Tangier&#x27;s status for further determination. Hubert Lyautey persuaded the last Sultan of independent Morocco, Abdelhafid, to abdicate in exchange for the receipt of a massive pension. Abdelhafid planned to live in Tangier where he used part of his pension to build an opulent mansion west of the old city, the Abdelhafid Palace, completed in 1914. The complex was later purchased by Italian interests and is now also known as the &quot;Palace of Italian Institutions&quot; (). The standard-gauge Franco-Spanish Tangier–Fez Railway () was constructed from 1919 to 1927.

The Tangier International Zone was created under the joint administration of France, Spain and the United Kingdom by an international convention signed in Paris on 18 December 1923. Ratifications were exchanged in Paris on 14 May 1924, and the convention was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 13 September 1924. It was amended by a protocol of July 1928 to elevate the status of Italy, an idea put forth by Sir Austen Chamberlain of Great Britain. The European powers&#x27; creation of the statute of Tangier promoted the formation of a cosmopolitan society where Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived together with reciprocal respect and tolerance. A town where men and women, with many different political and ideological tendencies, found refuge, including Spaniards from the right or from the left, Jews fleeing Nazi Germany and Moroccan dissidents. With very liberal economic and fiscal laws, Tangier became - in an international environment full of restrictions, prohibitions and monopolies - a tax haven with absolute freedom of trade. The International Zone of Tangier had a area and, by the mid-1930s, a population of about 50,000 inhabitants: 30,000 Muslims; 12,000 Jews; and 8,000-odd Europeans, with a decreasing proportion of working-class Spaniards. At its peak in the 1940s, there were 22,000 Jews in Tangier. 

Spanish troops occupied Tangier on 14 June 1940, the same day Paris fell to the Germans. Despite calls by Spanish nationalists to annex &quot;&quot;, the Franco regime publicly considered the occupation a temporary wartime measure. A diplomatic dispute between Britain and Spain over the latter&#x27;s abolition of the city&#x27;s international institutions in November 1940 led to a further guarantee of British rights and a Spanish promise not to fortify the area. The territory was restored to its pre-war status on October 11, 1945.

=== Moroccan independence ===

The Tangier International Zone played an important role in the campaign for Moroccan independence. Because of its legal status as an international zone, activists were able to meet in Tangier, relatively protected from the French and Spanish authorities. In 1951, the National Front was created in Tangier, a pact between Morocco&#x27;s four nationalist parties to coordinate their campaign to achieve Moroccan independence.

In July 1952 the protecting powers met at Rabat to discuss the International Zone&#x27;s future, agreeing to abolish it. Tangier joined with the rest of Morocco following the restoration of full sovereignty in 1956. At the time of the handover, Tangier had a population of around 40,000 Muslims; 31,000 Christians; and 15,000 Jews.

==Geography==
Central Tangier lies about east of Cape Spartel, the southern half of the Strait of Gibraltar. It nestles between two hills at the northwest end of the Bay of Tangier, which historically formed the best natural harbour anywhere on the Moroccan coast before the increasing size of ships required anchorage to be made further and further from shore. The shape of the gradually-rising underlying terrain creates the effect of the city as an amphitheatre, with the commercial district in the middle. The western hill () is the site of the city&#x27;s citadel or kasbah. The eastern hill forms Cape Malabata, sometimes proposed as the point for a strait crossing. (Years of studies have, however, made no real progress thus far.)

The Marshan is a plateau about long spreading west of downtown along the sea.

===Climate===
Tangier has a mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;) with heavier rainfall than most parts of North Africa and nearby areas on the Iberian Peninsula owing to its exposed location. The prevailing winds blow from the sea and have kept the site generally healthy even in earlier times with much poorer sanitation. The summers are relatively hot and sunny and the winters are wet and mild. Frost is rare, although a new low of was recorded in January 2005.

==Subdivisions==

The current prefecture is divided administratively into the following:

==Economy==

Tangier is Morocco&#x27;s second most important industrial centre after Casablanca. The industrial sectors are diversified: textile, chemical, , metallurgical and naval. Currently, the city has four industrial parks of which two have the status of free economic zone (see Tangier Free Zone).

Tangier&#x27;s economy relies heavily on tourism. In the 1960s and &#x27;70s, Tangier formed part of the hippie trail. It became less popular and tourist attractions became run-down as cheap flights made central Moroccan cities like Marrakesh more accessible to European tourists; crime rose and a somewhat dangerous reputation drove more tourists away. Since 2010, however, King MohammedVI has made a point of restoring the city&#x27;s shipping and tourist facilities and improving its industrial base. Among other improvements, the beach was cleaned and lined with new cafes and clubs; the new commercial port means cruise ships no longer unload beside cargo containers.

Seaside resorts have been increasing with projects funded by foreign investments. Real estate and construction companies have been investing heavily in tourist infrastructures. A bay delimiting the city centre extends for more than . The years 2007 and 2008 were particularly important for the city because of the completion of large construction projects; these include the Tangier-Mediterranean port (&quot;Tanger-Med&quot;) and its industrial parks, a 45,000-seat sports stadium, an expanded business district, and renovated tourist infrastructure.

Tanger-Med, a new port outside Tangier proper, began construction in 2004 and became functional in 2007. Its site plays a key role in connecting maritime regions, as it is in a very critical position on the Strait of Gibraltar, which passes between Europe and Africa. The makeup of the new port is 85% transhipment 15% for domestic import and export activities. The port is distinguished by its size, infrastructure, and efficiency in managing the flow of ships. Tanger-Med has linked Morocco to Europe&#x27;s freight industry. It has also helped connect Morocco to countries in the Mediterranean, Africa, and America. The port has allowed Tangier to become a more globalised city with new international opportunities that will help facilitate economic growth. The construction and operation of the port aimed to create 120,000 new jobs, 20,000 at the port and 100,000 resulting from growing economic activity.

Agriculture in the area of Tangier is tertiary and mainly cereal. The city is chiefly famed for tangerines, a kind of mandarin orange hybrid first grown in the orchards then once south of the medina, but it was never commonly exported. As early as 1900, local consumption had already outstripped supply and required imports from Tetuan and elsewhere. Mass farming of tangerines instead began in Florida in the United States, where the first tree was introduced at Palatka by a Major Atway sometime before 1843.

Artisanal trade in the medina (&quot;Old City&quot;) specialises mainly in leather working, handicrafts made from wood and silver, traditional clothing, and Moroccan-style shoes.

The city has grown quickly due to rural exodus from other smaller cities and villages. The 2014 population is more than three-times larger than 32 years ago (850.000 inhabitants in 2014 vs. 250,000 in 1982). This phenomenon has resulted in the appearance of peripheral suburban districts, mainly inhabited by poor people, that often lack sufficient infrastructure.

In 2023 Tangier hosted the Connect route development forum.

==Notable landmarks==


The old town is still surrounded by the remains of what was once more than of stone rampart. Most of it dates to the town&#x27;s Portuguese occupation, with restoration work later undertaken at different times. Three major bastions were the Irish Tower (&quot;Bordj al-Naʿam&quot;), York Castle (&quot;Bordj dar al-Barud&quot;), and the &quot;Bordj al-Salam&quot;.

==Transport==

Railway lines connect Tanger-Ville railway station with Rabat, Casablanca and Marrakesh in the south, and with Fes and Oujda in the east. The service is operated by ONCF. In November 2018 Africa&#x27;s first high-speed train, the Kenitra–Tangier high-speed rail line, was inaugurated, linking Tangier to Casablanca in 2 hours, 10 minutes. By 2020 improvements between Casablanca and Kenitra are planned to further reduce the journey to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

The Rabat–Tangier expressway connects Tangier to Fes via Rabat , and Settat via Casablanca and Tanger-Med port. The Ibn Batouta International Airport (formerly known as Tangier-Boukhalef) is south-west of the city centre.

The new Tanger-Med port is managed by the Danish firm A. P. Moller–Maersk Group and will free up the old port for tourist and recreational development. Several ferries per day connect Tangier-Ville Ferry Terminal to Tarifa, and Tangier-Med to Algeciras. Two departures per week connect Tangier-Med directly to Gibraltar.

Tangier&#x27;s Ibn Batouta International Airport and the rail tunnel will serve as the gateway to the Moroccan Riviera, the littoral area between Tangier and Oujda. Traditionally, the northern coast was a rural stronghold, with some of the best beaches on the Mediterranean. It is slated for rapid urban development. The Ibn Batouta International Airport has been modernised to accommodate more flights. The biggest airline at the airport is Royal Air Maroc.

==Education==
Tangier offers four types of education systems: Arabic, French, Spanish and English. Each offers classes starting from pre-Kindergarten up to the 12th grade, as for German in the three last years of high school. The &quot;Baccalauréat&quot;, or high school diploma are the diplomas offered after clearing the 12 grades.

Many universities are inside and outside the city. Universities like the Institut Supérieur International de Tourisme (ISIT), which grants diplomas, offer courses ranging from business administration to hotel management. The institute is one of the most prestigious tourism schools in the country. Other colleges such as the École Nationale de Commerce et de Gestion (ENCG-T) is among the biggest business schools in the country as well as École Nationale des Sciences appliquées (ENSA-T), a rising engineering school for applied sciences. University known as Abdelmaled Essaadi holding many what they mainly known as faculties; Law, Economics and Social sciences (FSJEST) and the FST of Technical Sciences. and the most attended Institut of ISTA of the OFPPT.

===Primary education===

==Culture==



When Count de Mornay traveled to Morocco in 1832 to establish a treaty supportive of the recent French annexation of Algeria, he took along the Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix. Delacroix not only reveled in the orientalism of the place; he also took it as a new and living model for his works on classical antiquity: &quot;The Greeks and Romans are here at my door, in the Arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like Cato or Brutus...&quot; He sketched and painted watercolours continuously, writing at the time &quot;I am like a man in a dream, seeing things he fears will vanish from him.&quot; He returned to his sketches and memories of North Africa for the rest of his career, with 80 oil paintings like &quot;The Fanatics of Tangier&quot; and &quot;Women of Algiers&quot; becoming legendary and influential on artists such as Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Picasso. They were particularly struck by the quality of the light: to Cézanne, &quot;All this luminous colour... seems... that it enters the eye like a glass of wine running into your gullet and it makes you drunk straight away&quot;. Tangier subsequently became an obligatory stop for artists seeking to experience the colours and light he spoke of for themselves—with varying results. Matisse made several sojourns in Tangier, always staying at the Grand Hotel Villa de France. &quot;I have found landscapes in Morocco,&quot; he claimed, &quot;exactly as they are described in Delacroix&#x27;s paintings.&quot; His students in turn had their own; the Californian artist Richard Diebenkorn was directly influenced by the haunting colours and rhythmic patterns of Matisse&#x27;s Morocco paintings.

The multicultural placement of Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities and the foreign immigrants attracted writer George Orwell, writer and composer Paul Bowles, playwright Tennessee Williams, the beat writers William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, the painter Brion Gysin and the music group the Rolling Stones, who all lived in or visited Tangier during different periods of the 20th century.

In the 1940s and until 1956 when the city was an International Zone, the city served as a playground for eccentric millionaires, a meeting place for secret agents and a variety of crooks and a mecca for speculators and gamblers, an Eldorado for the fun-loving &quot;Haute Volée&quot;. During the Second World War the Office of Strategic Services operated out of Tangier for various operations in North Africa.

Around the same time, a circle of writers emerged which was to have a profound and lasting literary influence. This included Paul Bowles, who lived and wrote for over half a century in the city, Tennessee Williams and Jean Genet as well as Mohamed Choukri (one of North Africa&#x27;s most controversial and widely read authors), Abdeslam Boulaich, Larbi Layachi, Mohammed Mrabet and Ahmed Yacoubi. Among the best known works from this period is Choukri&#x27;s &quot;For Bread Alone&quot;. Originally written in Classical Arabic, the English edition was the result of close collaboration with Bowles (who worked with Choukri to provide the translation and supplied the introduction). Tennessee Williams described it as &quot;a true document of human desperation, shattering in its impact.&quot; Independently, William S. Burroughs lived in Tangier for four years and wrote &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, whose locale of Interzone is an allusion to the city.

After several years of gradual disentanglement from Spanish and French colonial control, Morocco reintegrated the city of Tangier at the signing of the Tangier Protocol on 29 October 1956. Tangier remains a very popular tourist destination for cruise ships and day visitors from Spain and Gibraltar.

===Language===

Most of the inhabitants of Tangier speak a very distinctive variety of Moroccan Arabic which differs from other Darija counterparts. The difference resides in pronunciation, tempo, grammar and a unique vocabulary. Arabic is used in government documentation and on road signs together with French. French is taught in primary schools and high schools and used in universities and large businesses. Spanish is well understood and spoken fluently, mainly exclusively by Tangierian locals. English, on the other hand, has been and still is used in tourist sectors.

The autochthonous population of Tangier has been declining drastically since the mid-2000s, as many locals, especially those from the younger generations, have moved to nearby Spain. While the industrial sector is expanding constantly, the internal immigration from the south to north is increasing rapidly. As a consequence, the Tangierian dialect is losing its distinctiveness or is being altered (in a recent study, social media has been depicted as one of these factors).

Nowadays, the Tangierian dialect is less prominent in public places, with the southern Darija dialect being more common in the area, to the extent that some observers question if Tangier retains its identity as it was before.

===Religion===

Due to its Christian past before the Muslim conquest, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. Originally, the city was part of the larger Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, which included much of North Africa. Later the area was subdivided, with the eastern part keeping the former name and the newer part receiving the name of Mauretania Tingitana. It is not known exactly at what period there may have been an episcopal see at Tangier in ancient times, but in the Middle Ages Tangier was used as a titular see (i.e., an honorific fiction for the appointment of curial and auxiliary bishops), placing it in Mauretania Tingitana. For the historical reasons given above, one official list of the Roman Curia places the see in Mauretania Caesarea.

Towards the end of the 3rd century, Tangier was the scene of the martyrdoms of St.Marcellus, mentioned in the Roman Martyrology on 30 October, and of St.Cassian, mentioned on 3 December.

Under the Portuguese, the diocese of Tangier was a suffragan of Lisbon but, in 1570, it was united with the diocese of Ceuta. Six Bishops of Tangier from this period are known, the firstwho did not reside in his seein 1468. During the era of the French and Spanish protectorates over Morocco, Tangier was the residence of the Prefect Apostolic of Morocco, the mission having been founded on 28 November 1630 and entrusted to the Friars Minor. At the time, it had a Catholic church, several chapels, schools and a hospital. The Prefecture Apostolic was raised to the status of Vicariate Apostolic of Morocco on 14 April 1908. On 14 November 1956, it became the Archdiocese of Tangier.

The city also has the Anglican church of Saint Andrew. Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially. In the years leading up to the First World War, European Christians formed almost a quarter the population of Tangier. The city also is still home to a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign Roman Catholic and Protestant residents.

Jews have a long history in Tangier. In the years leading up to the First World War, Jews formed almost a quarter the population of Tangier. According to the World Jewish Congress there were only 150 Moroccan Jews remaining in Tangier.

===Sport===
Tangierians regard football as the primary entertainment when it comes to sport-material. There are several football fields around the city. Tangier would have been one of the host cities for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations football tournament, which would be played at the new Ibn Batouta Stadium and in other cities across Morocco, until Morocco was banned from participating the Africa Cup of Nations due to their denial. Instead Tangier will host matches for the 2025 edition after Guinea withdraw from hosting. It could also host matches for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.

Basketball comes the second most practised sport in Tangier. The city is known for their local teams IRT, Ajax Tanger, Juventus Tangier and so on.

National Cricket Stadium is the only top-class cricket stadium in Morocco. Stadium hosted its first International Tournament from 12 to 21 August 2002. Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka competed in a 50-overs one day triangular series. The International Cricket Council has granted international status to the Tangier Cricket Stadium, official approval that will allow it to become North Africa&#x27;s first international cricket venue.

=== Museums ===
The Museum of the American Legation, whose building was granted to the United States in 1821 by the Sultan Moulay Suliman served as a consulate of the United States and a later legation, as well as a high traffic post for the intelligence agents of the Second World War and a Peace Corps training facility. Today, its courtyards and narrow corridors serve as an elaborate museum that demonstrates relations between the United States and Morocco and the Moroccan heritage, including a wing dedicated to Paul Bowles, where you can see the documents and photographs of the writer donated to the museum by the gallerist and friend of the writer Gloria Kirby in 2010.

Fondation Lorin (Musée de la Fondation Lorin) opened in 1930 in a former synagogue. In addition to art, there are newspapers, photographs and posters on display.

===In popular culture===
====Espionage====

Tangier has been reputed as a safe house for international spying activities. Its position during the Cold War and during other spying periods of the 19th and 20th centuries is legendary.

Tangier acquired the reputation of a spying and smuggling centre and attracted foreign capital due to political neutrality and commercial liberty at that time. It was via a British bank in Tangier that the Bank of England in 1943 for the first time obtained samples of the high-quality forged British currency produced by the Nazis in &quot;Operation Bernhard&quot;.

The city has also been a subject for many spy fiction books and films.

<text>The angular is a large bone in the lower jaw (mandible) of amphibians and reptiles (birds included), which is connected to all other lower jaw bones: the dentary (which is the entire lower jaw in mammals), the splenial, the suprangular, and the articular. It is homologous to the tympanic bone in mammals, due to the incorporation of several jaw bones into the mammalian middle ear early in mammal evolution.

In therapsids (mammal ancestors and their kin), the lower jaw is made up of the dentary (the mandible in mammals) and a group of smaller &quot;postdentary&quot; bones near the jaw joint. As the dentary increased in size over million of years, two of these postdentary bones, the articular and angular, became increasingly reduced and the dentary eventually made direct contact with the upper jaw. These postdentary bones, even before their articular function was lost, probably transmitted sound vibrations to the stapes and, in some therapsids, a bent plate that might have supported a membrane capable of detecting vibrations developed on the angular. Eventually, it developed into the ectotympanic ring which supports the tympanic membrane in the ears of modern mammals.

<text>Soft tissue connects and surrounds or supports internal organs and bones, and includes muscle, tendons, ligaments, fat, fibrous tissue, lymph and blood vessels, fasciae, and synovial membranes. Soft tissue is tissue in the body that is not hardened by the processes of ossification or calcification such as bones and teeth.

It is sometimes defined by what it is not – such as &quot;nonepithelial, extraskeletal mesenchyme exclusive of the reticuloendothelial system and glia&quot;.

== Composition ==
The characteristic substances inside the extracellular matrix of soft tissue are the collagen, elastin and ground substance. Normally the soft tissue is very hydrated because of the ground substance. The fibroblasts are the most common cell responsible for the production of soft tissues&#x27; fibers and ground substance. Variations of fibroblasts, like chondroblasts, may also produce these substances.

== Mechanical characteristics ==
At small strains, elastin confers stiffness to the tissue and stores most of the strain energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched in the direction of deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues, the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.

Human soft tissue is highly deformable, and its mechanical properties vary significantly from one person to another. Impact testing results showed that the stiffness and the damping resistance of a test subject&#x27;s tissue are correlated with the mass, velocity, and size of the striking object. Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When a solid object impacts a human soft tissue, the energy of the impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reduce the effect of the impact or the pain level; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.
Soft tissues have the potential to undergo large deformations and still return to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. they are hyperelastic materials, and their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.

=== Pseudoelasticity ===
Even though soft tissues have viscoelastic properties, i.e. stress as function of strain rate, it can be approximated by a hyperelastic model after precondition to a load pattern. After some cycles of loading and unloading the material, the mechanical response becomes independent of strain rate.
:formula_1

Despite the independence of strain rate, preconditioned soft tissues still present hysteresis, so the mechanical response can be modeled as hyperelastic with different material constants at loading and unloading. By this method the elasticity theory is used to model an inelastic material. Fung has called this model as pseudoelastic to point out that the material is not truly elastic.

=== Residual stress ===
In physiological state soft tissues usually present residual stress that may be released when the tissue is excised. Physiologists and histologists must be aware of this fact to avoid mistakes when analyzing excised tissues. This retraction usually causes a visual artifact.

=== Fung-elastic material ===
Fung developed a constitutive equation for preconditioned soft tissues which is 
:formula_2
with
:formula_3
quadratic forms of Green-Lagrange strains formula_4 and formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7 material constants. formula_8 is the strain energy function per volume unit, which is the mechanical strain energy for a given temperature.

==== Isotropic simplification ====
The Fung-model, simplified with isotropic hypothesis (same mechanical properties in all directions). This written in respect of the principal stretches (formula_9):
:formula_10 , 
where a, b and c are constants.

==== Simplification for small and big stretches ====
For small strains, the exponential term is very small, thus negligible.
:formula_11

On the other hand, the linear term is negligible when the analysis rely only on big strains.
:formula_12

=== Gent-elastic material ===

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the shear modulus for infinitesimal strains and formula_15 is a stiffening parameter, associated with limiting chain extensibility. This constitutive model cannot be stretched in uni-axial tension beyond a maximal stretch formula_16, which is the positive root of

:formula_17

== Remodeling and growth ==
Soft tissues have the potential to grow and remodel reacting to chemical and mechanical long term changes. The rate the fibroblasts produce tropocollagen is proportional to these stimuli. Diseases, injuries and changes in the level of mechanical load may induce remodeling. An example of this phenomenon is the thickening of farmer&#x27;s hands. The remodeling of connective tissues is well known in bones by the Wolff&#x27;s law (bone remodeling). Mechanobiology is the science that study the relation between stress and growth at cellular level.

Growth and remodeling have a major role in the cause of some common soft tissue diseases, like arterial stenosis and aneurisms and any soft tissue fibrosis. Other instance of tissue remodeling is the thickening of the cardiac muscle in response to the growth of blood pressure detected by the arterial wall.

== Imaging techniques ==
There are certain issues that have to be kept in mind when choosing an imaging technique for visualizing soft tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The accuracy of the image analysis relies on the properties and the quality of the raw data and, therefore, the choice of the imaging technique must be based upon issues such as:
# Having an optimal resolution for the components of interest;
# Achieving high contrast of those components; 
# Keeping the artifact count low;
# Having the option of volume data acquisition;
# Keeping the data volume low;
# Establishing an easy and reproducible setup for tissue analysis.

The collagen fibers are approximately 1-2 μm thick. Thus, the resolution of the imaging technique needs to be approximately 0.5 μm. Some techniques allow the direct acquisition of volume data while other need the slicing of the specimen. In both cases, the volume that is extracted must be able to follow the fiber bundles across the volume. High contrast makes segmentation easier, especially when color information is available. In addition, the need for fixation must also be addressed. It has been shown that soft tissue fixation in formalin causes shrinkage, altering the structure of the original tissue. Some typical values of contraction for different fixation are: formalin (5% - 10%), alcohol (10%), bouin (&lt;5%).

Imaging methods used in ECM visualization and their properties.

==Clinical significance==
Soft tissue disorders are medical conditions affecting soft tissue. Soft tissue injuries are some of the most chronically painful and difficult conditions to treat because it is very difficult to see what is going on under the skin with the soft connective tissues, fascia, joints, muscles and tendons.

Musculoskeletal specialists, manual therapists, neuromuscular physiologists and neurologists specialize in treating injuries and ailments in the soft tissue areas of the body. These specialized clinicians often develop innovative ways to manipulate the soft tissue to speed natural healing and relieve the mysterious pain that often accompanies soft tissue injuries. This area of expertise has become known as soft tissue therapy and is rapidly expanding as technology continues to improve the ability of these specialists to identify problem areas.

A promising new method of treating wounds and soft tissue injuries is via platelet-derived growth factor.

There is a close overlap between the term &quot;soft tissue disorder&quot; and rheumatism. Sometimes the term &quot;soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot; is used to describe these conditions.

Soft tissue sarcomas are many types of cancer that can develop in the soft tissues.

<text>Gary Leon Ridgway (born February 18, 1949) is an American serial killer known as the Green River Killer. He was initially convicted of 48 separate murders committed between the early 1980s and late 1990s. As part of his plea bargain, another conviction was added, bringing the total number of convictions to 49, making him the second-most prolific serial killer in United States history according to confirmed murders.

Most of Ridgway&#x27;s victims were alleged to be sex workers and other women in vulnerable circumstances, including underage runaways. Before his identity was known, the media gave him his nickname after the first five victims were found in the Green River. He strangled his victims, usually by hand but sometimes using ligatures. After strangling them, he would dump their bodies in forested and overgrown areas in King County, often returning to the bodies to engage in acts of necrophilia.

Ridgway had been a suspect in the murders since 1982; however, investigators were unable to link him to the murders at that time. Later advances in DNA profiling allowed investigators to definitively link Ridgway to the murders, and he was arrested on November 30, 2001, as he was leaving the Kenworth truck factory where he worked in Renton, Washington. As part of a plea bargain wherein he agreed to disclose the locations of still-missing women, he was spared the death penalty and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

==Early life==
Gary Ridgway was born on February 18, 1949, in Salt Lake City, Utah, the second of Mary and Thomas Ridgway&#x27;s three sons. His home life was somewhat troubled; relatives have described his mother as domineering and have said that, while young, he witnessed more than one violent argument between his parents. His father was a bus driver who would often complain about the presence of sex workers.

Ridgway and his brothers would face corporal punishment from his mother with belts or sticks for minor offenses. He would later tell defense psychologists that, as an adolescent, he had conflicting feelings of anger and sexual attraction toward his mother, and fantasized about killing her.

Ridgway is dyslexic, and was held back a year in high school. When he was 16, he stabbed a six-year-old boy, who survived the attack. Ridgway had led the boy into the woods and then stabbed him through the ribs into his liver. Ridgway&#x27;s IQ was recorded as being in the &quot;low eighties&quot;.

==Adult life==
Ridgway graduated from Tyee High School in 1969 and married his 19-year-old high school girlfriend, Claudia Kraig. He joined the United States Navy and was sent to Vietnam, where he served on board a supply ship and saw combat. During his time in the military, Ridgway had frequent sexual intercourse with sex workers and contracted gonorrhea; although angered by this, he continued this activity without protection. The marriage ended within a year.

When questioned about Ridgway after his arrest, friends and family described him as friendly but strange. His first two marriages resulted in divorce because of infidelities by both partners. His second wife, Marcia Winslow, claimed that he had placed her in a chokehold. He became religious during his second marriage, proselytizing door-to-door, reading the Bible aloud at work and at home, and insisting that his wife follow the strict teachings of their pastor. Ridgway would also frequently cry after sermons or reading the Bible. Despite his beliefs, Ridgway continued to solicit the services of sex workers and wanted his wife to participate in sex in public and inappropriate places, sometimes even in areas where his victims&#x27; bodies were later discovered.

According to women in his life, Ridgway had an insatiable sexual appetite. His three ex-wives and several ex-girlfriends reported that he demanded sex from them several times a day. Often, he would want to have sex in a public area or in the woods. Ridgway himself admitted to having a fixation with sex workers, with whom he had a love/hate relationship. He frequently complained about their presence in his neighborhood, but he also took advantage of their services regularly. In a statement read at his plea hearing, Ridgway said he hated prostitutes and did not want to pay them for sex. Some have speculated that Ridgway was torn between his lusts and his staunch religious beliefs. With his second wife Marcia, Ridgway had a son.

== Murders ==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ridgway is believed to have murdered at least 71 teenage girls and women near Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. In court statements, Ridgway later reported that he had killed so many that he lost count. A majority of the murders occurred between 1982 and 1984. The victims were believed to be either sex workers or runaways, whom he picked up along Pacific Highway South. Ridgway sometimes showed the women a picture of his son, to trick them into trusting him. They would engage in sexual activity, and after minutes of intercourse from behind, Ridgway would wrap his forearm around the front of their necks and use the other arm to pull back as tightly as he could, strangling them. He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area. Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the Green River, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and other &quot;dump sites&quot; within South King County.

There were also two confirmed and another two suspected victims found in the Portland, Oregon, area. The bodies were often left in clusters, sometimes posed, usually nude. He would sometimes return to the victims&#x27; bodies and engage in necrophilia with their bodies. Ridgway later explained that he did not find necrophilia more sexually satisfying, but having sex with the deceased reduced his need to obtain a living victim and thus limited his exposure to being caught. Ridgway occasionally contaminated the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported a few victims&#x27; remains across state lines into Oregon, to confuse the police.

=== 1982–1984: First known victims ===
The body of Ridgway&#x27;s first known victim was found in July 1982. A unique kind of spray paint was found on clothing wrapped around the victim&#x27;s neck, but the paint was not tested for 20 years. If it had been tested at the time, it would have been easier to link the murder to Ridgway. After four more victims were found, the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. Task force members included Robert Keppel and Dave Reichert, who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy in 1984. Bundy offered his opinions on the psychology, motivations, and behavior of the killer. He suggested that the killer was revisiting the dump sites to have sex with his victims, which turned out to be true, and if police found a fresh grave, they should stake it out and wait for him to come back. Also contributing to the investigation was FBI Special Agent John E. Douglas, who developed a profile of the suspect.

Ridgway was arrested in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became a suspect in the Green River killings in 1983, when 18-year-old Marie Malvar disappeared. Her boyfriend and her pimp later found a truck in front of Ridgway&#x27;s house which they thought was the same one she had boarded the day she went missing. Ridgway was interviewed in conjunction with that event, and police received several other tips that mentioned him. In 1984, he passed a polygraph test.

=== 1985–2001: Marriage to Judith Mawson, arrest for murder ===
Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet. In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway&#x27;s crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news. Ridgway said that while he was in a relationship with Mawson, his kill rate went down and that he truly loved her. Of his 49 known victims, only three were killed after he married Mawson. Mawson told a local television reporter, &quot;I feel I have saved lives ... by being his wife and making him happy.&quot;

In April 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. The samples collected were later subjected to DNA profiling, providing the evidence for his arrest warrant.

On November 30, 2001, he was at the Kenworth truck factory, where he worked as a spray painter, when police arrived to arrest him.

Ridgway had been arrested on suspicion of murdering four women nearly 20 years earlier after initially being identified as a potential suspect. But it was not until 2001 that DNA evidence conclusively linked semen left in the victims to the saliva swab taken by the police.

The four victims named in the original indictment were Marcia Chapman, Opal Mills, Cynthia Hinds, and Carol Ann Christensen. Three more victims—Wendy Coffield, Debra Bonner, and Debra Estes—were added to the indictment after a forensic scientist identified microscopic spray paint spheres as a specific brand and composition of paint used at the Kenworth factory during the time when these victims were killed.

==Plea bargain, confessions, sentencing==
Early in August 2003, Seattle television news reported that Ridgway had been moved from a maximum security cell at King County Jail to an Airway Heights Minimum-Medium Security Level Tank. Other news reports stated that his lawyers, led by Anthony Savage, were closing a plea bargain that would spare him the death penalty in return for his confession to a number of the Green River murders.

On November 5, 2003, Ridgway entered a guilty plea to 48 charges of aggravated first degree murder as part of a plea bargain that would spare him execution in exchange for his cooperation in locating the remains of his victims and providing other details. In his statement accompanying his guilty plea, Ridgway explained that he had killed all of his victims inside King County, Washington, and that he had transported and dumped the remains of the two women near Portland to confuse the police.

Deputy prosecutor Jeffrey Baird noted in court that the deal contained &quot;the names of 41 victims who would not be the subject of &quot;State v. Ridgway&quot; if it were not for the plea agreement&quot;. King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng explained his decision to make the deal:

 On December 18, 2003, King County Superior Court Judge Richard A. Jones sentenced Ridgway to 48 life sentences without the possibility of parole to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to an additional 10 years for tampering with evidence for each of the 48 victims, adding 480 years to his 48 life sentences. Later he was given another life sentence after the remains of his 49th victim were found.

Ridgway led prosecutors to three bodies in 2003. On August 16 of that year, the remains of a 16-year-old girl found near Enumclaw, Washington, 40 feet from State Route 410, were pronounced as belonging to Pammy Annette Avent, who had been believed to be a victim of the Green River Killer. The remains of Marie Malvar and April Buttram were found in September 2003.

On November 23, 2005, the Associated Press reported that a weekend hiker found the skull of one of the women Ridgway admitted murdering in his 2003 plea bargain with King County prosecutors. The skull of another victim, Tracy Winston, who was 19 when she disappeared from Northgate Mall on September 12, 1983, was found on November 20, 2005, by a man hiking in a wooded area near Highway 18 near Issaquah, southeast of Seattle. This was the find that led to Ridgway&#x27;s 49th life sentence. In 2023, remains discovered in 1985 and known as Bones 17 were identified as belonging to 15-year-old Lori Anne Razpotnik, who was last seen by her family in Lewis County, Washington, in November 1982.

Ridgway confessed to more confirmed murders than any other American serial killer. Over a period of five months of police and prosecutor interviews, he confessed to 48 murders—42 of which were on the police&#x27;s list of probable Green River Killer victims. On February 9, 2004, county prosecutors began to release the videotaped records of Ridgway&#x27;s confession. In one taped interview, he initially told investigators that he was responsible for the deaths of 65 women. In another taped interview on December 31, 2003, Ridgway claimed to have murdered 71 victims and confessed to having had sex with them before killing them, a detail which he did not reveal until after his sentencing.

In his confession, he acknowledged that he targeted prostitutes because they were &quot;easy to pick up&quot; and that he &quot;hated most of them.&quot; He confessed that he had sex with his victims&#x27; bodies after he murdered them, but claimed he began burying the later victims so that he could resist the urge to commit necrophilia.

==Incarceration==
Ridgway was placed in solitary confinement at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla in January 2004. On May 14, 2015, he was transferred to the USP Florence High, a high-security federal prison east of Cañon City, Colorado. In September 2015, after a public outcry and discussions with Governor Jay Inslee, Corrections Secretary Bernie Warner announced that Ridgway would be transferred back to Washington to be &quot;easily accessible&quot; for open murder investigations. Ridgway was returned by chartered plane to Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla from USP Florence High, on October 24, 2015. In September 2024, Ridgway was briefly transferred from the Washington State Penitentiary to the King County jail for a few days before being transferred back to WSP. Authorities refused to give any explanation for the transfer.
==Victims==
Before Ridgway&#x27;s confession, authorities had attributed 49 murders to the Green River Killer. Ridgway confessed to murdering at least 71 victims.

===Confirmed killings===
At the time of Ridgway&#x27;s December 18, 2003, sentencing, authorities had been able to find at least 48 sets of remains, including victims not originally attributed to the Green River Killer. Ridgway was sentenced for the deaths of each of these 48 victims, with a plea agreement that he would &quot;plead guilty to any and all future cases (in King County) where his confession could be corroborated by reliable evidence.&quot;

Footnotes

* Before Ridgway&#x27;s confession, authorities had not attributed to the Green River Killer the deaths of victims Rule, Barczak, Hayes, Reeves, Yellowrobe, and Jane Doe B-20.
* On December 21, 2010, hikers near the West Valley Highway in Auburn, Washington, found a skull in the vicinity of where Marie Malvar&#x27;s remains had been found in 2003. The skull was identified as belonging to Marrero, who was last seen leaving the Western Six Motel at South 168th Street and Pacific Highway South on December 3, 1982. The King County Prosecutor confirmed that Ridgway would be formally charged with her murder on February 11, 2011. On February 18, 2011, he entered a guilty plea in the murder of Rebecca Marrero, adding a 49th life sentence to his existing 48. Ridgway confessed to murdering Marrero in his original plea bargain, but due to insufficient evidence, the charges could not be filed. Therefore, there is no change in his current incarceration status.
* The remains of Winston were found, without a skull, in Kent&#x27;s Cottonwood Grove Park in March 1986. Winston&#x27;s skull was found in November, 2005 near Tiger Mountain, miles away from the discovery site of the rest of her body. Police assume someone carried it to the location.
* Major was not identified until June 2012. A family member asked the King County Sheriff to investigate after seeing a TV movie about Ridgway. DNA confirmed Major&#x27;s identity.
* Wendy Stephens, previously known as Jane Doe B-10, was previously unidentified. Ridgway claimed that she was a white female in her early 20s and possibly had brown hair. Examination of the remains suggested that she was actually between 12 and 18, most likely around 15. She was later confirmed to be 14. Analysis of the victim&#x27;s skeleton indicated she was probably left-handed, and she had at one point in her life had skull fracture to the left temple that later healed.
* Jane Doe B-17 was discovered on January 2, 1986; remains that had been found in another area February 18, 1984, were later matched to this victim. In 2003, Ridgway claimed responsibility for her death. In December 2023, DNA testing at Parabon NanoLabs identified the victim as Lori Anne Razpotnik, who had run away from home in 1982 at age 15.
* Jane Doe B-20 was discovered in August 2003. Because the remains were partial, her face could not be reconstructed and her race could not be determined, but she was estimated to have been between 13 and 24 at the time of her death. She was estimated to have been murdered between 1970 and 1993, but she was believed to have been murdered during the first decade of Ridgway&#x27;s murder spree. In January 2024, DNA testing identified the victim as Liles. A separate set of remains from Liles had been found in Oregon in 1985 and identified in 1988 from dental records.

===Task force victims list===
Ridgway is suspected of—but not charged with—murdering the remaining six victims of the original list attributed to the Green River Killer.
Footnotes
* Ridgway denied killing Agisheff who does not fit the profile of any of the victims of the Green River Killer considering her age, and she was not a sex worker or a teenage runaway.
* Although he has never been charged with her murder, during police interrogations in 2003, Ridgway did confess to killing Lee. He stated that he strangled Lee in 1982 and left her body near a drive-in theatre off of the Sea-Tac Strip. Law enforcement officials have been unable to locate Lee&#x27;s remains at the dumpsite that Ridgway indicated.
* Evidence exists to suggest that Ridgway murdered McGinniss. Shortly before her disappearance, McGinniss was questioned by a Port of Seattle police officer while &quot;dating&quot; Ridgway near the SeaTac Strip. Furthermore, during the summer of 2003, Ridgway led authorities to the bodies of several of his victims. One of those bodies, later identified as that of April Buttram, was initially identified by Ridgway as being that of McGinniss. According to Ridgway, he often confused McGinniss with Buttram because of their similar physiques.
* Ridgway is a suspect in the death of Girdner whose remains were discovered within a mile of the bodies of known victims Sherrill, Bush, and Liles. Girdner remained unidentified until October 2009.

===Suspected===

<text>Component video is an analog video signal that has been split into two or more component channels. In popular use, it refers to a type of component analog video (CAV) information that is transmitted or stored as three separate signals. Component video can be contrasted with &quot;composite video&quot; in which all the video information is combined into a single signal that is used in analog television. Like composite, component cables do not carry audio and are often paired with audio cables.

When used without any other qualifications, the term &quot;component video&quot; usually refers to analog  component video with sync on luma (Y) found on analog high-definition televisions and associated equipment from the 1990s through the 2000s when they were largely replaced with HDMI and other all-digital standards. Component video cables and their RCA jack connectors on equipment are normally color-coded red, green and blue, although the signal is not in RGB. YPbPr component video can be losslessly converted to the RGB signal that internally drives the monitor; the encoding is useful as the Y signal will also work on black and white monitors.

==Analog component video==
Reproducing a video signal on a display device (for example, a cathode-ray tube; CRT) is a straightforward process complicated by the multitude of signal sources. DVD, VHS, computers and video game consoles all store, process and transmit video signals using different methods, and often each will provide more than one signal option. One way of maintaining signal clarity is by separating the components of a video signal so that they do not interfere with each other. A signal separated in this way is called &quot;component video&quot;. S-Video, RGB and  signals comprise two or more separate signals and thus are all component-video signals. For most consumer-level video applications, the common three-cable system using BNC or RCA connectors analog component video was used. Typical formats are 480i (480 lines visible, 525 full for NTSC) and 576i (576 lines visible, 625 full for PAL). For personal computer displays the 15-pin DIN connector (IBM VGA) provided screen resolutions including 640×480, 800×600, 1024×768, 1152×864, 1280×1024.

===RGB analog component video===

The various RGB (red, green, blue) analog component video standards (e.g., RGBS, RGBHV, RGsB) use no compression and impose no real limit on color depth or resolution, but require large bandwidth to carry the signal and contain a lot of redundant data since each channel typically includes much of the same black-and-white image. Early personal computers such as the IBM PS/2 offered this signal via a VGA port. Many televisions, especially in Europe, can utilize RGB via the SCART connector.

In addition to the red, green and blue color signals, RGB requires two additional signals to synchronize the video display. Several methods are used: 
* Composite sync, where the horizontal and vertical signals are mixed together on a separate wire (the S in RGBS)
* Separate sync, where the horizontal and vertical are each on their own wire (the H and V in RGBHV; also the acronym HD/VD, meaning &quot;horizontal deflection/vertical deflection&quot;, is used)
* Sync on green, where a composite sync signal is overlaid on the wire used to transport the green signal (SoG, Sync on G, or RGsB).
* Sync on red or sync on blue, where a composite sync signal is overlaid on either the red or blue wire
* Sync on composite (not to be confused with composite sync), where the signal normally used for composite video is used alongside the RGB signal only for the purposes of sync.
* Sync on luma, where the Y signal from S-Video is used alongside the RGB signal only for the purposes of sync.

Composite sync is common in the European SCART connection scheme (using pins 17 [ground] and 19 [composite-out] or 20 [composite-in]). RGBS requires four wires – red, green, blue and sync. If separate cables are used, the sync cable is usually colored yellow (as is the standard for composite video) or white.

Separate sync is most common with VGA, used worldwide for analog computer monitors. This is sometimes known as RGBHV, as the horizontal and vertical synchronization pulses are sent in separate channels. This mode requires five conductors. If separate cables are used, the sync lines are usually yellow (H) and white (V), yellow (H) and black (V), or gray (H) and black (V).

Sync on Green (SoG) is less common, and while some VGA monitors support it, most do not. Sony is a big proponent of SoG, and most of their monitors (and their PlayStation line of video game consoles) use it. Like devices that use composite video or S-video, SoG devices require additional circuitry to remove the sync signal from the green line. A monitor that is not equipped to handle SoG will display an image with an extreme green tint, if any image at all, when given a SoG input.

Sync on red and sync on blue are even rarer than sync on green and are typically used only in certain specialized equipment.

Sync on composite, not to be confused with composite sync, is commonly used on devices that output both composite video and RGB over SCART. The RGB signal is used for color information, while the composite video signal is only used to extract the sync information. This is generally an inferior sync method, as this often causes checkerboards to appear on an image, but the image quality is still much sharper than standalone composite video.

Sync on luma is much similar to sync on composite but uses the Y signal from S-Video instead of a composite video signal. This is sometimes used on SCART since both composite video and S-Video luma ride along the same pins. This generally does not suffer from the same checkerboard issue as sync on composite, and is generally acceptable on devices that do not feature composite sync, such as the Sony PlayStation and some modded Nintendo 64 models.

===Luma-based analog component video===

Further types of component analog video signals do not use separate red, green and blue components but rather a colorless component, termed luma, which provides brightness information (as in black-and-white video). This combines with one or more color-carrying components, termed chroma, that give only color information. Both the S-Video component video output (two separate signals) and the  component video output (three separate signals) seen on DVD players are examples of this method.

Converting video into luma and chroma allows for chroma subsampling, a method used by JPEG and MPEG compression schemes to reduce the storage requirements for images and video (respectively).

Many consumer TVs, DVD players, monitors, video projectors and other video devices at one time used output or input.

When used for connecting a video source to a video display where both support 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, the PAL television standard provides for signaling pulses that will automatically switch the display from one format to the other.

====Connectors used====
* D-Terminal: Used mostly on Japanese electronics.
* Three BNC (professional) or RCA connectors (consumer): Typically colored green (Y), blue (PB) and red (PR).
* SCART used in Europe.
* Video-in video-out (VIVO): 9-pin Mini-DIN-connectors called &quot;TV Out&quot; in computer video cards, which usually include an adaptor for component RCA, composite RCA and 4-pin S-Video-Mini-DIN.

==Synchronization==
Component video requires an extra synchronization signal to be sent along with the video. Component video sync signals can be sent in several different ways:

; Separate sync 
: Uses separate wires for horizontal and vertical synchronization. When used in RGB (i.e. VGA) connections, five separate signals are sent (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, and vertical sync).
; Composite sync 
: Combines horizontal and vertical synchronization onto one wire. When used in RGB connections, only four separate signals are sent (red, green, blue, and composite sync).
; Sync-on-green (SOG) 
: Combines composite sync with the green signal in RGB. Only three signals are sent (red, green with sync, and blue). This synchronization system is used in, among other applications, many systems by Silicon Graphics and Sun Microsystems through a DB13W3 connector.
; Sync-on-luminance 
: Similar to sync-on-green, but combines sync with the luminance signal (Y) of a color system such as YPbPr and S-Video. This is the synchronization system normally used in home theater systems.
; Sync-on-composite 
: The connector carries a standard composite video signal along with the RGB components, for use with devices that cannot process RGB signals. For devices that do understand RGB, the sync component of that composite signal is used along with the color information from the RGB lines. This arrangement is found in the SCART connector in common use in Europe and some other PAL/SECAM areas.

==Digital component video==
Digital component video makes use of single cables with signal lines/connector pins dedicated to digital signals, transmitting digital color space values allowing higher resolutions up to 1080p.

RGB component video has largely been replaced by modern digital formats, such as DisplayPort or Digital Visual Interface (DVI) digital connections, while home theater systems increasingly favor High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), which support higher resolutions, higher dynamic range, and can be made to support digital rights management. The demise of analog is largely due to screens moving to large flat digital panels as well as the desire for having a single cable for both audio and video, but also due to a slight loss of clarity when converting from a digital media source to analog and back again for a flat digital display, particularly when used at higher resolutions where analog signals are highly susceptible to noise.

==International standards==
Examples of international component video standards are:
* RS-170 RGB (525 lines, based on NTSC timings, now EIA/TIA-343)
* RS-343 RGB (525, 625 or 875 lines)
* STANAG 3350 Analogue Video Standard (NATO military version of RS-343 RGB, now EIA-343A)
* CEA-770.3 High Definition TV Analog Component Video Interface Consumer Electronics Association

==&quot;Component&quot; versus &quot;composite&quot;==
In a composite signal, such as NTSC, PAL or SECAM, the luminance, Brightness (Y) signal and the chrominance, Color (C) signals are encoded together into one signal. When the color components are kept as separate signals, the video is called component analog video (CAV), which requires three separate signals: the luminance signal (Y) and the color difference signals (R-Y and B-Y).

Since component video does not undergo the encoding process, the color quality is noticeably better than composite video.

Component video connectors are not unique in that the same connectors are used for several different standards; hence, making a component video connection often does not lead to a satisfactory video signal being transferred. Many DVD players and TVs may need to be set to indicate the type of input/output being used, and if set incorrectly the image may not be properly displayed. Progressive scan, for example, is often not enabled by default, even when component video output is selected.

<doc id="288213" wikidata="Q1048500" url="?curid=288213" title="Ys">
<text>Ys (pronounced ), also spelled Is or Kêr-Is in Breton, and Ville d&#x27;Ys in French, is a mythical city on the coast of Brittany that was swallowed up by the ocean. Most versions of the legend place the city in the Baie de Douarnenez.

==Etymology==

In the original Breton, the city receives the name of , which translates as &quot;low city&quot;. is the Breton word for &quot;city&quot;, and is related to the Welsh and Cornish &quot;ker-&quot;, while / is related to Welsh , Scottish Gaelic and Irish (&quot;low&quot;).

== The legend ==
Different versions of the legend share several basic common elements. King Gradlon (Gralon in Breton) ruled in Ys, a city built on land reclaimed from the sea, sometimes described as rich in commerce and the arts, with Gradlon&#x27;s palace being made of marble, cedar and gold. In some versions, Gradlon built the city upon the request of his daughter Dahut, who loved the sea. To protect Ys from inundation, a dike was built with a gate that was opened for ships during low tide. The one key that opened the gate was held by the king.

Most versions of the legend present Gradlon as a pious man, and his daughter, Princess Dahut, as wayward. Dahut (sometimes called Ahez) is often presented as frivolous and an unrepentant sinner, or, sometimes, as a sorceress. However, in another version, that of an ancient ballad, Gradlon himself is blamed by his people for extravagances of every kind.

In most variations, Dahut acquires the key to the dikes from Gradlon, and its misuse leads to catastrophe. Commonly, Dahut steals the keys (made either of silver or gold) from her father while he sleeps, either to allow her lover inside for a banquet or after being persuaded to do so by her flattering lover. She opens the gates of the dikes, either in a wine-induced folly or by mistake, believing she is opening the city gates.

The sea inundates the city, killing everyone but the king. A Saint (either St. Gwénnolé or St. Corentin) wakes the sleeping king and urges him to flee. The king mounts his horse and takes his daughter with him. As the water is about to overtake him, a voice calls out: &quot;Throw the demon thou carriest into the sea, if thou dost not desire to perish.&quot; Dahut falls from the horse&#x27;s back, and Gradlon is saved. In Le Braz&#x27;s version, it is Gradlon himself who throws her off on St. Gwénnolé&#x27;s orders.

In some versions, after falling into the sea, Dahut becomes a morgen or mermaid who continues haunting the sea, and can be seen combing her golden hair and singing sad songs. Some 19th-century folklorists also collected old beliefs that said, during the low tides, the ruins of Ys could be seen, or the sound of its carillon could be heard.

In Le Grand&#x27;s version, St. Gwénnolé goes to see Gradlon and warns him about the sins being committed in the city, which is absorbed in luxury, debauchery and vanity. God has warned St. Gwénnolé that he is going to punish the city, and the Saint tells the king to flee since God&#x27;s wrath is about to fall upon the city. The king flees the city on horseback. A storm falls upon the city and quickly inundates it. The main culprit is Princess Dahut, the king&#x27;s indecent daughter, who has stolen the key, symbol of royalty, from around her father&#x27;s neck. Gradlon takes refuge in Quimper.

Other versions of the legend tell that Ys was founded more than 2,000 years before Gradlon&#x27;s reign in a then-dry location off the current coast of the Bay of Douarnenez, but the Breton coast had slowly given way to the sea so that Ys was under it at each high tide when Gradlon&#x27;s reign began.
==Development of the legend==

While legends and literature about Gradlon are much older, the story of Ys appears to have developed between the end of the fifteenth century and the seventeenth century. An early mention of Ys appears in Pierre Le Baud&#x27;s &quot;Cronicques et ystoires des Bretons&quot; (1480) in which Gradlon is the king of the city, but Dahut is not mentioned. Bernard d&#x27;Argentre&#x27;s &quot;La histoire de Bretagne&quot; and mystery plays on the life of St. Winwaloe, in the sixteenth century, also provide early references to the city.

Albert Le Grand&#x27;s &quot;Vie des Saincts de la Bretagne Armorique,&quot; third edition published in 1680, contains all the basic elements of the later story including the first known mention of Dahut.

===Literary versions===
In 1839, T. Hersart de la Villemarqué published a collection of popular songs collected from oral tradition, the &quot;Barzaz Breizh&quot;. The collection achieved a wide distribution and brought Breton folk culture into European awareness. In the second edition, the poem &quot;Livaden Geris&quot; (&quot;The Submersion of Ker-Is&quot;) appeared. The same basic story elements are present and, in this version, Dahut steals the key at the incitement of a lover.

Villemarqué studied several versions of the song and created his song using the best material from each. As a result, his song mentions several traditions. In the Stanza V, it mentions King Gradlon&#x27;s horse that can only be heard once a year during the Black Night, a detail he may have borrowed from &quot;Lai de Graelent&quot;, probably written in the late 12th century. Also, the last verses of the song mention a fisherman seeing a mermaid combing her hair and singing a sad song. The mermaid is Dahut transformed into a morgen, which references another tradition. It also appears that elements of the text of this version were adapted from the medieval Welsh poem about the legend of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod, a very similar Welsh legend about a land that disappeared beneath the ocean as a result of human error. The poem appears in the &quot;Black Book of Carmarthen&quot;, which Villemarqué had studied at Jesus College, Oxford, in 1839. Villemarqué wrongly considered that the Welsh spoken in the sixth century was the same as the Breton spoken in his days.

In 1844, Emile Souvestre told a version of the legend in his work &quot;Le Foyer breton&quot;. In the tale &quot;Keris&quot;, the character of the Devil disguised as a man with a red beard appeared. His version may have come from a different oral source. His telling also played a great part in making the legend widely known, and many 19th century English tellings of the story are closely derived from this version.

In the early 1890s, Édouard Schuré&#x27;s essay &quot;Les Grandes légendes de France&quot; introduced the character of Malgven, a sorceress who was Gradlon&#x27;s wife and Dahut&#x27;s mother. Malgven appeared in many subsequent retellings, including Charles Guyot&#x27;s &quot;La Légende de la ville d&#x27;Ys d&#x27;après les anciens textes&quot; (1926). Guyot named Gradlon&#x27;s horse Morvarc&#x27;h and wrote that the horse was a gift from Malgven. 

A novel by Norman Douglas, &quot;They Went&quot; (1920), is based upon the Breton legend.

In 1893, Anatole Le Braz collected a fragmentary version of the legend in his book &quot;La Légende de la mort en Basse-Bretagne&quot;, and its posterior 1902 augmented edition &quot;La Légende de la mort chez les Bretons armoricains&quot; This version also mentions Dahut (here called Ahés) transformation into a mermaid but, unlike other versions, here Dahut is thrown off the horse by king Gralon himself, on orders from St. Gwénolé.

Paul Sébillot also collected oral versions among his extensive review of the history of the legend in the second volume of his 1905 book &quot;Le folk-lore de France&quot;

===English language versions===
In 1917, Scottish folklorist Lewis Spence included the legend of Ys among the tales told in his book &quot;Legends &amp; Romances of Brittany&quot;. One year later, Jonathan Ceredig Davies published a short version of the legend in the 29th issue of the &quot;Folklore&quot; journal. A few years later, in 1929, Elsie Masson also included it in her book &quot;Folk Tales of Brittany&quot;, citing Souvestre and Le Braz among her sources.

The science fiction and fantasy writer Poul Anderson and his wife Karen Anderson published the novel &quot;The King of Ys&quot; in four volumes (1986–1988): &quot;Roma Mater, Gallicenae, Dahut&quot;, and &quot;The Dog and the Wolf&quot;. Their version portrays Gradlon as a Roman centurion, Gratillonius, sent to be the prefect of Ys.

&quot;The Daughters of Ys&quot; (2020) by M. T. Anderson and Jo Rioux is based on the folktale. The graphic novel&#x27;s adaptation follows Dahut&#x27;s perspective of the events leading to the destruction of Ys.

===The devil in Souvestre&#x27;s version===
Émile Souvestre&#x27;s telling differs from the tale in several points. Ys was still protected by dikes, whose gates were opened for ships at certain moments, but it was Dahut herself who kept the silver keys of the dikes around her neck. Dahut was a sorceress and had embellished the city with the help of the korrigans, which built works men could not make. With her magic, Dahut also tamed the sea dragons, and gave one to each inhabitant of the city, which they used to go find rare goods or to reach their enemies&#x27; vessels.

The citizens were so wealthy that they measured out grain with silver hanaps (goblets), but their wealth had also turned them vicious and harsh. Beggars had been chased from the city like beasts; the church had been abandoned, and the citizens spent all day and night entertaining themselves at the inns, dance halls and performances, while Dahut herself threw parties at her palace all day around. St. Corentin warned Gradlon that God&#x27;s patience with the city was at an end, but the King had lost his power, living alone in one wing of the palace, and Dahut ignored the Saint&#x27;s warning.

One day, a bearded prince dressed in red came to Ys, and seduced Dahut and her friends with his compliments and sweet words. He proposed to them to dance a new kind of branle, and he played the tune on his bagpipe, sending everyone into a frenzy. He took advantage of the situation to steal the dike&#x27;s keys from Dahut and, taking his true appearance as the demon, used them to open all the dikes, allowing the sea to flood the city.

St. Corentin appeared in Gradlon&#x27;s chambers and urged him to flee. He mounted his black horse and ran. When he passed Dahut&#x27;s castle, she threw herself on her father&#x27;s horse, but the horse stopped suddenly. St. Corentin told the King to push Dahut off the horse, but Gradlon could not do it. So it was Corentin himself who hit her with his crozier to make her fall off into the sea. The horse ran again, taking the king to safety. When Gradlon looked back, from the ruins of the city the demon mockingly showed him the silver keys.

==Ys&#x27; return==
A few legends speak of Ys&#x27; resurrection. Le Braz mentions one which says that, on the day it happens, the first person who sees the church&#x27;s spire or hears the sound of its bells, will become king of the city and all of its territory.

There is another legend told in a Breton saying, that when Paris is swallowed, the city of Ys will rise up from under the waves (in Breton, Par Is means &quot;similar to Ys&quot;):

==Adaptations in the arts==

Several famous artistic adaptations of the Ys legend appeared in the late 19th and early 20th century.
E. V. Luminais&#x27; painting &quot;Flight of King Gradlon&quot;, depicting Gradlon&#x27;s escape from Ys, scored a success at the Salon of 1884.

===Music===
&quot;Le roi d&#x27;Ys&quot;, an opera by the French composer Édouard Lalo which premiered in 1888, transforms the story significantly, replacing the figure of Dahut with Margared, whose motive for opening the gates (with the aid of her own betrothed Karnac) is her jealousy at her sister Rozenn&#x27;s marriage to Mylio (characters who are also inventions of Lalo).

Also inspired by the story of Ys is Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot;, found in his first book of &quot;Preludes&quot; (published 1910). This is a prelude intended to evoke the atmosphere of the legend by its sound.

In 1929 M.C. Escher made a woodcut print inspired by Debussy&#x27;s piece, also titled &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot;.

Alan Stivell&#x27;s album &quot;Renaissance of the Celtic Harp&quot; opens with a track entitled &quot;Ys&quot;. Harpist Joanna Newsom titled her sophomore album &quot;Ys&quot; after the mythical city. The story of Ys also inspired a 1972 album of the same name by the Italian progressive rock band Il Balletto di Bronzo.

Cornish composer William Lewarne Harris wrote his third and largest opera, &quot;The Sunken City&quot;, about &quot;Ker-ys&quot;. The three-act, prologue and epilogue opera, completed in 1992, has not been publicly performed, but there are many private recordings of excerpts.
