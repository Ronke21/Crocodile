<text>Religious philosophy is philosophical thinking that is influenced and directed as a consequence of teachings from a particular religion. It can be done objectively, but it may also be done as a persuasion tool by believers in that faith. Religious philosophy is concerned with the nature of religion, theories of salvation, and conceptions of god, gods, and/or the divine.

Due to the historical development of religions, many religions share commonalities concerning their philosophies. These philosophies are often considered to be universal and include beliefs about concepts such as the afterlife, souls, and miracles.

== Philosophical commonalities ==
Religious faith and philosophical reflection are connected to one another. Religious tradition influences the philosophical thinking and beliefs of followers of that religion.

Many philosophical commonalities have arisen among religions due to their core historical foundations. For example, Abrahamic religions, which encompass Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baha&#x27;i Faith, Yezidi, Druze, Samaritan, and Rastafari, share philosophical commonalities, although they differ in their presentation of these philosophical concepts through their respective religious texts.

There are also philosophical concepts and reasoning in religious teachings that were conceived independently from one another but are still similar and reflect analogous ideas. For example, the arguments and reasoning for the existence of an omniscient god or multiple gods can be found in several religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Another example includes the philosophical concept of free will, which is present in both monotheistic and polytheistic religions.

== Types ==

=== Intuitive religious philosophy ===
Many religious concepts are considered to be &quot;cross-culturally ubiquitous&quot; as they are &quot;cognitively natural.&quot; They are deemed intuitive, meaning that they arise without much direction, instruction, or coaching in the early stages of our intellectual development and do not necessarily originate from cultural influence. Such religious concepts include beliefs concerning the &quot;afterlife, souls, supernatural agents, and miraculous events.&quot;

=== Reflective religious philosophy ===
Some religious concepts require deliberate teaching to ensure the transmission of their ideas and beliefs to others. These beliefs are categorised as reflective and are often stored in a linguistic format that allows for ease of transmission. Reflective philosophies are thought to contribute significantly to the continuation of cultural and religious beliefs. Such religious philosophies include karma, divine immanent justice, or providence, and also encompass theological concepts such as Trinity in Christianity or Brahman in Hinduism.

== God ==
Religious philosophy is predominantly concerned with the conceptions of god, gods, and/or the divine.

=== Ontological arguments ===

Ontological arguments are arguments based on reason with the conclusion that God exists. There are many notable contributors to the development of various ontological arguments.

In the 11th century C.E., Saint Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) reasoned in his work &quot;Proslogion&quot; about the existence of God in an ontological argument based on the idea that there is a &#x27;being than which no greater can be conceived&#x27;.

Thomas Aquinas (–1274) extracted components of philosophical teaching relevant to Christianity, using philosophy as a means to demonstrate God&#x27;s existence. In his work &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Aquinas presents five arguments for the existence of God, known as &#x27;quinque viae&#x27; or &#x27;five ways&#x27;.

In the 17th century, René Descartes (1596–1650) proposed similar arguments to those of Saint Anselm of Canterbury. For example, in his work &quot;Fifth Meditation&quot;, he provides an ontological argument based on the reasoning that if we are able to conceive the idea of a supremely perfect being (i.e., that we have an idea of a supremely perfect being), then, he claims, we are able to reach the conclusion that there exists a supremely perfect being. Two versions of Descartes&#x27; ontological argument exist:
* Version A:
# Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to be contained in the idea of something is true of that thing.
# I clearly and distinctly perceive that necessary existence is contained in the idea of God.
# Therefore, God exists.

* Version B:
# I have an idea of a supremely perfect being, i.e. a being having all perfections.
# Necessary existence is perfection.
# Therefore, a supremely perfect being exists.

In the 18th century, Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) further developed Descartes ontological argument by attempting to satisfy a shortcoming in Descartes&#x27; proposal, which did not address the coherence of a supremely perfect being. Leibniz reasoned that perfections are compatible as they are unable to be analysed, and therefore are able to exist in a single entity, thereby validating Descartes argument.

More recently, individuals such as Kurt Gödel, Charles Hartshorne, Norman Malcolm, and Alvin Plantinga have proposed ontological arguments, many of which elaborate on or are connected to older ontological arguments presented by individuals such as St. Anselm, Descartes, and Leibniz. For example, Kurt Godel (1905–1978) used modal logic to elaborate and clarify Leibniz&#x27;s version of Saint Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s ontological proof of the existence of God, known as Godel&#x27;s Ontological Proof.

=== Concept of God ===

An individual&#x27;s perception of the concept of God influences their coping style. There are four main religiously affiliated coping mechanisms, as follows:
# Self-directing style: the individual does not involve God directly and instead individually adopts a problem-solving method.
# Deferring style: the individual submits their issue and the required problem-solving to God.
# Collaborative style: both the individual and God are involved in the problem-solving process.
# Surrender style: the individual works collaboratively with God in the problem-solving process but values God&#x27;s direction above their own.

== Bioethics ==
=== Medical care ===
An individual&#x27;s religious philosophy is important in the consideration of their medical care and medical decisions, and taking that into account improves the quality of their medical treatment. Particularly in the case of palliative care, understanding different religious philosophical foundations allows for the proper spiritual care to be obtained by the patient. Religious philosophy is also a necessary consideration in the psychotherapeutic treatment of psychiatric disorders. Consideration of organ donation post-death is related to an individual&#x27;s religious philosophy.

=== Diet ===
Many religions follow dietary habits. For example, a vegetarian diet is adhered to by individuals who follow Buddhism, Hinduism, Seventh-day Adventist. The emphasis on sanctity of all life in the ethical doctrine known as &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-injury to living beings) in Buddhist and Hindu philosophies encompass human as well as animal life, and influence this vegetarian tradition, with modern influence including the concept of reincarnation.

Fasting of various forms (exclusion of specific foods or food groups, or exclusion of food for certain periods of time) are undertaken by individuals who follow philosophies of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Eastern Orthodox, Islam, Roman Catholicism.

Some religions require for food to be invoked in God&#x27;s name. For example, in Islam, meat must be from properly slaughtered &#x27;clean&#x27; animals, known as &quot;halal&quot;, although it is forbidden to consume scavenger animals. The religious philosophical purpose behind Islamic dietary laws derived from the commandments of Allah (Quran and Sunnah of Muhammad) is the concept of purity, where Muslims consume what is considered pure and clean to be pure both in a physical and spiritual sense. Another example includes Jewish Kosher laws, where individuals must observe kosher food laws derived from Torah and Mishnah religious scripture texts.

=== Euthanasia ===

Consideration of euthanasia is influenced by an individual&#x27;s religious philosophy. Much of the opposition towards legislation of euthanasia is due to religious beliefs. Individuals who express a belief in God as an entity who controls destiny were more opposed to legalisation of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. For example, religions such as Christian Science, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Hinduism, Islam, Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, Seventh-day Adventist generally do not allow for or practice euthanasia.

=== Abortion ===

Many religions hold philosophical value toward life of all forms and are thus completely against abortion. However abortion is tolerated in specific cases, such as rape or when the mother&#x27;s life is in danger.

== Religions ==
Religious philosophy influences many aspects of an individual&#x27;s conception and outlook on life. For example, empirical studies concentrating on the philosophical concept of spirituality at or near the end of life, conducted in India, found that individuals who follow Indian philosophical concepts are influenced by these concepts in their &#x27;perception of spirituality&#x27;.

Considerations concerning medical care, death, diet, and pregnancy differ among followers of various religions due to their respective philosophies.

=== Islamic philosophy ===
Islamic philosophies forbid the violation of the human body, however simultaneously place importance on selflessness;
And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. (Quran 5:32)

Organ donation is generally endorsed, through the principle that necessity overrides prohibition known as &quot;al-darurat tubih al-mahzurat.&quot; Objections to organ donation in Islamic religion is mainly originated on cultural foundations rather than religious philosophical ones, with their altruistic principle allowing for exceptions in regard to medical intervention, for example; involving porcine bone grafts and pork insulin. Formal decisions have been made regarding organ donation in association with Islamic teachings, for example, the UK Muslim Law Council in 1996 issued a &quot;Ijtihad&quot; (religious ruling) that defined organ transplantation within the scope of the Islamic following, and Islamic Jurisprudence Assembly Council in Saudi Arabia in 1988 approving organ donation, with similar formal decisions made in Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan.

Islamic jurisprudence does not condone or allow for an individual to die voluntarily. Islamic philosophies indicate that life is a divine, sacred gift, with Allah deciding how long each individual will live. The moment of death, known as &quot;ajal&quot;, cannot be hastened by any form of passive or active voluntary intervention (e.g. in the form of euthanasia) as this is completely under the control of Allah. Only Allah has the absolute authority and ability to give life as well as take it away. Islamic philosophies emphasise that life does not belong to the human, but to Allah. Although the Qur&#x27;an states &quot;Nor take life – which Allah has made sacred – except for just cause&quot; (Quran 17:33), &quot;hadith&quot; literature indicates that despite intolerable pain and suffering, euthanasia is not condoned. For example, according to &quot;Sahih Muslim,&quot; in the Battle of Hunayn a Muslim warrior committed suicide due to the pain of his wound however Muhammad declared that this act negated his courage and service to God and doomed him to Hell.

=== Christian philosophy ===

Christian philosophies generally endorse organ donation although reasoning and opinion differ amongst sects. Christian theologians reference the Bible in regard to organ donation, particularly;
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: Freely you have received, freely give. (Matthew 10:8)

Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. (John 15:13)Most Christian scholar sanction organ transplantation as it is deemed an act of selflessness, with the Catholic and Protestant Church endorsing organ donation in a joint declaration in 1990, promoting the action as an act of Christian love.

=== Jewish philosophy ===

Jewish philosophies hold great importance on the intact burial of the deceased persons due to &quot;halakhic&quot; foundations. However, much like Islam, altruism in the form of saving a life, known as &quot;pikuach nefesh&quot; in Jewish law, overrides all other commandments and prohibition;
Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world. (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin 37a)

Organ donation is endorsed by most Jewish scholars.

Jewish philosophies in Rabbinical works generally condemn abortion, foeticide, or infanticide as it is viewed as an immoral action on human life. However, &#x27;abortion appears as an option for Jewish women from the earliest sources of the Bible and Mishnaic commentary&#x27;, where the Talmud indicates that a mother&#x27;s life is prioritised if her life or wellbeing is put at risk by the child, thereby permitting abortion. Jewish laws do not condone abortion in scenarios involving rape or incest.

=== Hindu philosophy ===
Hindu philosophies prohibit abortion, in line with &quot;dharmasastras&quot;. Hindu philosophy regarding conception involve the belief that both physical and spiritual qualities, like an individual&#x27;s past karma, exist and enter the human embryo from the moment of conception.

=== Buddhist philosophy ===
In Buddhist philosophies, much like Hindu philosophies, there is a morally negative view towards abortion in accordance to the Five Precepts. However, the intention behind an action is an important consideration, and therefore many Buddhists accept the idea of abortion if under the pretence of good intention.

=== Taoist philosophy ===
Taoist philosophy expresses a desire to find and maintain a balance between populations and their resources. Therefore, due to these philosophies, population management were of national interests observed in China&#x27;s &#x27;one child&#x27; policy. However, abortion is not encouraged as it would &#x27;corrupt the body and would wrongly negate the body&#x27;s capacity to give life&#x27;.

<text>Huntsman spiders, members of the family Sparassidae (formerly Heteropodidae), catch their prey by hunting rather than in webs. They are also called giant crab spiders because of their size and appearance. Larger species sometimes are referred to as wood spiders, because of their preference for woody places (forests, mine shafts, woodpiles, wooden shacks). In southern Africa the genus &quot;Palystes&quot; are known as rain spiders or lizard-eating spiders. Commonly, they are confused with baboon spiders from the Mygalomorphae infraorder, which are not closely related.

More than a thousand Sparassidae species occur in most warm temperate to tropical regions of the world, including much of Australia, Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Americas.

Several species of huntsman spider can use an unusual form of locomotion. The wheel spider (&quot;Carparachne aureoflava&quot;) from the Namib uses a cartwheeling motion which gives it its name, while &quot;Cebrennus rechenbergi&quot; uses a handspring motion.

==Description==
Sparassids are eight-eyed spiders. The eyes appear in two largely forward-facing rows of four on the anterior aspect of the prosoma. Many species grow very large – in Laos, male giant huntsman spiders (&quot;Heteropoda maxima&quot;) attain a legspan of . People unfamiliar with spider taxonomy commonly confuse large species with tarantulas, but huntsman spiders can generally be identified by their legs, which, rather than being jointed vertically relative to the body, are twisted in such a way that in some attitudes the legs extend forward in a crab-like fashion. It is also commonly confused for a brown recluse spider, due to their shared coloring. However, brown recluse venom is significantly dangerous to humans, while that of the huntsman spider is less so. 

On their upper surfaces the main colours of huntsman spiders are inconspicuous shades of brown or grey, but many species have undersides more or less aposematically marked in black-and-white. Their legs bear fairly prominent spines, but the rest of their bodies are smoothly furry. They tend to live under rocks, bark and similar shelters, but human encounters are common in sheds, garages and other infrequently-disturbed places. The banded huntsman (&quot;Holconia&quot;) is large, grey to brown with striped bands on its legs. The badge huntsman (&quot;Neosparassus&quot;) is larger still, brown and hairy. The tropical or brown huntsman (&quot;Heteropoda&quot;) is also large and hairy, with mottled brown, white and black markings. The eyesight of these spiders is not as good as that of the &quot;Salticidae&quot; (jumping spiders). Nevertheless, their vision is quite sufficient to detect approaching humans or other large animals from some distance.

== Identification ==
They can be distinguished from other spider families by their appearance, as other spiders similar to them are smaller in size. They are often confused for tarantulas due to their hairy nature, but can easily be distinguished by their laterigrade legs, similar to those of crabs. Members of this family are also typically less bulky than tarantulas. They possess two claws, as is the case for most spiders that actively hunt their prey. If this is not enough to fully identify them, they also possess eight eyes divided into two regular rows.

==Size, venom, and aggression==
On average, a huntsman spider&#x27;s leg-span can reach up to , while their bodies measure about long. Like most spiders, Sparassidae use venom to immobilize prey.

There have been reports of members of various genera such as &quot;Palystes&quot;, &quot;Neosparassus&quot;, and several others inflicting severe bites on humans. The effects vary, including local swelling and pain, nausea, headache, vomiting, irregular pulse rate, and heart palpitations, indicating some systemic neurotoxin effects, especially when the bites were severe or repeated. However, the formal study of spider bites is fraught with complications, including unpredictable infections, dry bites, shock, nocebo effects, and even bite misdiagnosis by medical professionals and specimen misidentification by the general public.

It is not always clear what provokes Sparassidae to attack and bite humans and animals, but it is known that female members of this family will aggressively defend their egg-sacs and young against perceived threats. Bites from sparassids usually do not require hospital treatment.

==Sound production in mating rituals==
Males of the huntsman spider &quot;Heteropoda venatoria&quot; have recently been found to deliberately make a substrate-borne sound when they detect a chemical (pheromone) left by a nearby female of their species. The males anchor themselves firmly to the surface onto which they have crawled and then use their legs to transmit vibrations from their bodies to the surface. Most of the sound emitted is produced by strong vibrations of the abdomen. The characteristic frequency of vibration and the pattern of bursts of sound identify them to females of their species, who will approach if they are interested in mating. This sound can often be heard as a rhythmic ticking, somewhat like a quartz clock, which fades in and out and can be heard by human ears in a relatively quiet environment.

==Distribution and habitat==
Members of the Sparassidae are native to tropical and warm temperate regions worldwide. A few species are native to colder climates, like the green huntsman spider (&quot;Micrommata virescens&quot;) which is native to Northern and Central Europe. Some tropical species like &quot;Heteropoda venatoria&quot; (Cane huntsman) and &quot;Delena cancerides&quot; (Social huntsman) have been accidentally introduced to many subtropical parts of the world, including New Zealand (which has no native sparassid species).

As adults, huntsman spiders do not build webs, but hunt and forage for food: their diet consists primarily of insects and other invertebrates, and occasionally small skinks and geckos. They live in the crevices of tree bark, but will frequently wander into homes and vehicles. They are able to travel extremely quickly, often using a springing jump while running, and walk on walls and even on ceilings. They also tend to exhibit a &quot;cling&quot; reflex if picked up, making them difficult to shake off and much more likely to bite. The females are fierce defenders of their egg sacs and young. They will generally make a threat display if provoked, and if the warning is ignored they may attack and bite. The egg sacs differ fairly widely among the various genera. For example, in &quot;Heteropoda&quot; spp. egg sacs are carried underneath the female&#x27;s body, while in other species like &quot;Palystes&quot; and &quot;Pseudomicrommata&quot; spp., females generally attach egg sacs to vegetation.

<text>Tectonics (; ) are the processes that result in the structure and properties of the Earth&#x27;s crust and its evolution through time. The field of &quot;planetary tectonics&quot; extends the concept to other planets and moons.

These processes include those of mountain-building, the growth and behavior of the strong, old cores of continents known as cratons, and the ways in which the relatively rigid plates that constitute the Earth&#x27;s outer shell interact with each other. Principles of tectonics also provide a framework for understanding the earthquake and volcanic belts that directly affect much of the global population.

Tectonic studies are important as guides for economic geologists searching for fossil fuels and ore deposits of metallic and nonmetallic resources. An understanding of tectonic principles can help geomorphologists to explain erosion patterns and other Earth-surface features.

==Main types of tectonic regime==

===Extensional tectonics===

Extensional tectonics is associated with the stretching and thinning of the crust or the lithosphere. This type of tectonics is found at divergent plate boundaries, in continental rifts, during and after a period of continental collision caused by the lateral spreading of the thickened crust formed, at releasing bends in strike-slip faults, in back-arc basins, and on the continental end of passive margin sequences where a detachment layer is present.

===Thrust (contractional) tectonics===

Thrust tectonics is associated with the shortening and thickening of the crust, or the lithosphere. This type of tectonics is found at zones of continental collision, at restraining bends in strike-slip faults, and at the oceanward part of passive margin sequences where a detachment layer is present.

===Strike-slip tectonics===

Strike-slip tectonics is associated with the relative lateral movement of parts of the crust or the lithosphere. This type of tectonics is found along oceanic and continental transform faults which connect offset segments of mid-ocean ridges. Strike-slip tectonics also occurs at lateral offsets in extensional and thrust fault systems. In areas involved with plate collisions strike-slip deformation occurs in the over-riding plate in zones of oblique collision and accommodates deformation in the foreland to a collisional belt.

==Plate tectonics==


In plate tectonics, the outermost part of the Earth known as the lithosphere (the crust and uppermost mantle) act as a single mechanical layer. The lithosphere is divided into separate &quot;plates&quot; that move relative to each other on the underlying, relatively weak asthenosphere in a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from the Earth&#x27;s interior. There are three main types of plate boundaries: divergent, where plates move apart from each other and new lithosphere is formed in the process of sea-floor spreading; transform, where plates slide past each other, and convergent, where plates converge and lithosphere is &quot;consumed&quot; by the process of subduction. Convergent and transform boundaries are responsible for most of the world&#x27;s major (Mw &gt; 7) earthquakes. Convergent and divergent boundaries are also the site of most of the world&#x27;s volcanoes, such as around the Pacific Ring of Fire. Most of the deformation in the lithosphere is related to the interaction between plates at or near plate boundaries.
The latest studies, based on the integration of available geological data, and satellite imagery and Gravimetric and magnetic anomaly datasets have shown that the crust of the Earth is dissected by thousands of different types of tectonic elements which define the subdivision into numerous smaller microplates which have amalgamated into the larger Plates.

==Other fields of tectonic studies==

===Salt tectonics===

Salt tectonics is concerned with the structural geometries and deformation processes associated with the presence of significant thicknesses of rock salt within a sequence of rocks. This is due both to the low density of salt, which does not increase with burial, and its low strength.

===Neotectonics===

Neotectonics is the study of the motions and deformations of the Earth&#x27;s crust (geological and geomorphological processes) that are current or recent in geological time. The term may also refer to the motions and deformations themselves. The corresponding time frame is referred to as the &quot;neotectonic period&quot;. Accordingly, the preceding time is referred to as &quot;palaeotectonic period&quot;.

===Tectonophysics===

Tectonophysics is the study of the physical processes associated with deformation of the crust and mantle from the scale of individual mineral grains up to that of tectonic plates.

===Seismotectonics===

Seismotectonics is the study of the relationship between earthquakes, active tectonics, and individual faults in a region. It seeks to understand which faults are responsible for seismic activity in an area by analysing a combination of regional tectonics, recent instrumentally recorded events, accounts of historical earthquakes, and geomorphological evidence. This information can then be used to quantify the seismic hazard of an area.

===Impact tectonics===
Impact tectonics is the study of modification of the lithosphere through high velocity impact cratering events.

===Planetary tectonics===
Techniques used in the analysis of tectonics on Earth have also been applied to the study of the planets and their moons, especially icy moons.

<text>New class is a polemic term by critics of countries that followed the Soviet-type state socialism to describe the privileged ruling class of bureaucrats and Communist party functionaries which arose in these states. Generally, the group known in the Soviet Union as the nomenklatura conforms to the theory of the new class. The term was earlier applied to other emerging strata of the society. Milovan Đilas&#x27; new-class theory was also used extensively by anti-communist commentators in the Western world in their criticism of the Communist states during the Cold War.

&quot;Red [[bourgeoisie]]&quot; is a pejorative synonym for the term new class, crafted by leftist critics and movements like the 1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade. New class is also used as a term in late 1960s post-industrial sociology.

== Milovan Đilas&#x27; analysis ==
A theory of the new class was developed by Milovan Đilas the Vice President of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito, who participated with Tito in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Liberation War but was later purged by him as Đilas began to advocate democratic and egalitarian ideals, which he believed were more in line with the way socialism and communism should look like. There were also personal antagonisms between the two men, and Tito felt Đilas undermined his leadership. The theory of the new class can be considered to oppose the theories of certain ruling Communists, such as Joseph Stalin, who argued that their revolutions and/or social reforms would result in the extinction of any ruling class as such. It was Đilas&#x27; observation as a member of a Communist government that Party members stepped into the role of ruling class, a problem which he believed should be corrected through revolution. Đilas&#x27; completed his primary work on his new class theory in the mid-1950s. While Đilas was in prison, it was published in 1957 in the West under the title &quot;The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System&quot;.

Đilas posited that the new class&#x27; specific relationship to the means of production was one of collective political control, and that the new class&#x27; property form was political control. For Đilas, the new class not only seeks expanded material reproduction to politically justify its existence to the working class but also seeks expanded reproduction of political control as a form of property in itself. This can be compared to the capitalist who seeks expanded value through increased sharemarket values, even though the sharemarket itself does not necessarily reflect an increase in the value of commodities produced. Đilas used this argument about property forms to indicate why the new class sought parades, marches and spectacles despite this activity lowering the levels of material productivity. Đilas proposed that the new class only slowly came to self-consciousness of itself as a class. On arriving at a full self-consciousness the initial project undertaken would be massive industrialisation in order to cement the external security of the new class&#x27; rule against foreign or alternative ruling classes. In Đilas&#x27; schema, this approximated the 1930s and 1940s in the Soviet Union. As the new class suborns all other interests to its own security during this period, it freely executes and purges its own members in order to achieve its major goal of security as a ruling class. After security has been achieved, the new class pursues a policy of moderation towards its own members, effectively granting material rewards and freedom of thought and action within the new class, so long as this freedom is not used to undermine the rule of the new class. Đilas identified this period as the period of Khrushchev&#x27;s government in the Soviet Union. Due to the emergence of conflicts of policy within the new class, the potential for palace coups, or populist revolutions is possible, as experienced in Poland and Hungary, respectively. Finally, Đilas predicted a period of economic decline, as the political future of the new class was consolidated around a staid programme of corruption and self-interest at the expense of other social classes. This can be interpreted as a prediction of the Leonid Brezhnev so-called Era of Stagnation by Đilas. Đilas also heavily criticized Soviet imperialist practices for violating the national sovereignty of Eastern European countries and the unequal price exchange in trade between the USSR and these republics. He predicted that these countries would desire more sovereignty and independence from the totalitarian communist imperialist system. This can be interpreted as the prediction of Revolutions of 1989.

While Đilas posited that the new class was a social class with a distinct relationship to the means of production, he did not claim that this new class was associated with a self-sustaining mode of production. This claim, within Marxist theory, argues that the Soviet-style societies must eventually either collapse backwards towards capitalism, or experience a social revolution towards real socialism. This can be seen as a prediction of the downfall of the Soviet Union. Robert D. Kaplan&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Balkan Ghosts: A Journey through history&quot; also contains a discussion with Đilas, who used his model to anticipate many of the events that subsequently came to pass in the former Yugoslavia. Đilas also argues that a communist society has three phases: the revolutionary phase, the dogmatic phase, and the non-dogmatic phase. The new class does not perish despite attempts to moderate communist practices such as Yugoslavia’s workers&#x27; self-management or the reversal of Stalinist totalitarian policies of Khrushchev Thaw. Djilas argues these moderations are only concessions of the communist bureaucracy to appease the working class and therefore consolidate their new class rule. Marxists like Ernest Mandel have criticised Djilas for ignoring the existence of a new socio-economic system, which cannot be reconciled with the old class system.

=== Similarity to other analyses ===

Mikhail Bakunin had made a point in his International Workingmen&#x27;s Association debates with Marx in the mid-to-late 19th century of bureaucrats becoming a new oppressive class in socialist states. This idea was repeated after the Russian revolution by anarchists like Peter Kropotkin and Nestor Makhno, as well as some Marxists. In 1911, Robert Michels first proposed the Iron law of oligarchy, which described the development of bureaucratic hierarchies in supposedly egalitarian and democratic socialist parties. It was later repeated by a leader of the Russian Revolution, Leon Trotsky through his theory of degenerated workers state. Mao Zedong also had his own version of this idea developed during the Socialist Education Movement to criticize the Chinese Communist Party under Liu Shaoqi. This wide range of people over the decades had different perspectives on the matter, but there was also a degree of core agreement on this idea.

Đilas&#x27; &quot;New Class&quot; has also been likened to the professional–managerial class seen in advanced capitalist societies. In fact, originating with James Burnham&#x27;s famous discussion thereof, there is a whole tradition that posits a purportedly very troublesome convergence between especially the Chinese and Western political order along such lines. 

== John Kenneth Galbraith and post-industrial sociology ==
Canadian-American economist John Kenneth Galbraith also wrote about a similar phenomenon under capitalism, the emergence of a technocratic layer in &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; and &quot;The Affluent Society&quot;. The new-class model as a theory of new social groups in post-industrial societies gained ascendency during the 1970s as social and political scientists noted how new-class groups were shaped by post-material orientations in their pursuit of political and social goals. New-class themes &quot;no longer have a direct relationship to the imperatives of economic security.&quot;

<doc id="286821" wikidata="Q636563" url="?curid=286821" title="Dazed and Confused (Jake Holmes song)">
<text>&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jake Holmes in 1967. Performed in a folk rock-style, he recorded it for his debut album &quot;&quot;The Above Ground Sound&quot; of Jake Holmes&quot;. Although some concluded that it was about a bad acid trip, Holmes insists the lyrics refer to the effects of a girl&#x27;s indecision on ending a relationship.

After hearing Holmes perform the song in August 1967, English rock group the Yardbirds reworked it with a new arrangement. It soon became a centerpiece of their tours, several recordings of which have been released, including on &quot;Yardbirds &#x27;68&quot;, produced by guitarist Jimmy Page.

In 1968 &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, with new lyrics and vocal line, was recorded by Page&#x27;s new group Led Zeppelin and released on their debut album. It became a signature song and concert staple for much of the group&#x27;s career. Holmes attempted to contact Page in the 1980s regarding the songwriting credit, but received no response. In 2010, Holmes filed a lawsuit and the matter was settled out of court, with the credit on Led Zeppelin releases being changed to &quot;Jimmy Page, inspired by Jake Holmes&quot;.

==Background and composition==
Jake Holmes began his music career in the early 1960s, and recorded and performed with several different groups. He was influenced by psychedelic rock and groups such as the Byrds and the Blues Project, and wrote &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; in a similar style with a blues influence. In early1967, he recorded the song for his debut solo album &quot;&quot;The Above Ground Sound&quot; of Jake Holmes&quot;, as a trio of acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and bass. On July 10, it was released on the Tower Records label.

The arrangement is a modular dirge in the key of E minor built on a descending chromatic bass line alternating between the 3rd (E-G-F#-F-E) and the 7th (E-D-C#-C-B). Holmes&#x27; singing has been described as &quot;pained&quot;, and the lyrics (&quot;you&#x27;re out to get me/you&#x27;re on the right track&quot;) and (&quot;I&#x27;m being abused/I&#x27;m better off dead&quot;), coupled with the arrangement led some people to think the song was about a bad acid trip. However, Holmes said it was a song about a girl.

In August 1967, Holmes opened for the Yardbirds at a Greenwich Village gig in New York. According to Holmes, &quot;That was the infamous moment of my life when &#x27;Dazed and Confused&#x27; fell into the loving arms and hands of Jimmy Page.&quot; He was aware of the song appearing on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s eponymous debut album less than two years later, but did not take any action at the time. In the early 1980s, he wrote to the group and asked for a co-credit, but received no reply.

In June 2010, Holmes sued Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for copyright infringement, claiming to be the author of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; In court documents, he cited a 1967 copyright registration for the song, which was renewed in 1995. On January 17, 2012, the case was &quot;dismissed with prejudice&quot; after the parties reached an undisclosed settlement out of court.

==The Yardbirds==
===Background===
By late 1966, English rock group the Yardbirds had moved away from recording hit singles towards regular touring. In July 1967, they began their second tour of the US as a quartet, with Jimmy Page as the sole guitarist. The group performed at more countercultural venues, such as the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. Their sets became more varied with extended medleys and featured guitar instrumentals by Page, such as &quot;White Summer&quot; and &quot;Glimpses&quot;.

On August 25, 1967, the group headlined at the Village Theater in New York City, with opening acts the Youngbloods and Jake Holmes. Yardbirds drummer Jim McCarty was the only Yardbird to catch Holmes&#x27; performance. He liked &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and bought the album the next day, subsequently playing it to the rest of the band. They reworked the song, focusing the arrangements based on the descending bass line. Page added additional guitar riffs in the middle of the song.

===Composition===
The Yardbirds began to develop a new arrangement for &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; while still on tour in the U.S. Holmes&#x27; brooding atmosphere and descending bass line were retained, as well as most of the lyrics. Page doubled the bass line, echoing Holmes&#x27; live performances with two acoustic guitarists. However, propelled by drums and an overdriven Fender Telecaster, the song quickly took on a new, distinctly non-folk sound.

Singer Keith Relf initially followed Holmes&#x27; verses, but later often changed the order or mixed lines from different verses. Led Zeppelin biographer Mick Wall feels that Relf only &quot;slightly altered&quot; the lyrics, while Page biographer Martin Power credits Relf with &quot;writing new lyrics&quot;. Yardbirds chronicler Greg Russo describes that gradually the song &quot;moved from Holmes&#x27; original lyrics to an alternate set of lyrics that combined words from Jake Holmes and Keith Relf.&quot;

The Yardbirds&#x27; major innovations were the instrumental breaks and an extended instrumental middle section. Writer-educator Susan Fast describes the breaks, appearing between the verses and after Page&#x27;s solo, as &quot;a detail that contributes significantly to the drama of the piece, creating enormous tension at the end of each verse before moving on to the next.

The song begins with bowed electric guitar phrasings by Page, answered by vocal and harmonica interjections by Relf. Page attributed the idea of using a violin bow on the guitar to a suggestion from violinist David McCallum, Sr., whom he met in his pre-Yardbirds days as a session musician. The bowed section gives way to Page&#x27;s riff-laden guitar solo, propelled by a bass ostinato and fast driving 4/4-meter. The song returns to the slow tempo 12/8 verse structure before the coda. The Yardbirds&#x27; new arrangement, contributed by the four members, soon amounted to a major reworking of Holmes&#x27; original piece. Bassist Chris Dreja later said, &quot;We found it, arranged it and played it. In a way, it was a great epitaph, because we were feeling very dazed and confused about what the hell was going on!&quot;

===Performances===
&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; was a regular part of the Yardbirds&#x27; performances during their final tours in 1967 and 1968. The song debuted during their short US tour in late 1967, which included a date at the Village Theater. When they returned to England, the group performed a nine-minute version in January 1968, around the time the full quartet recorded their last single, &quot;Think About It&quot;. On March 5–6, the Yardbirds performed &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; for BBC Radio. In his Led Zeppelin biography &quot;When Giants Walked the Earth&quot;, Wall notes that the relatively concise 5:48 version &quot;sounds almost identical musically to the number Page would take credit for on the first Zeppelin album&quot;. (Led Zeppelin&#x27;s studio version lasts 6:28.) Another short (5:46) performance was filmed by French television on March 9 for &quot;Bouton Rouge&quot;. AllMusic critic Bruce Eder notes it &quot;comes off much better than the official Anderson Theater version from later the same month.&quot;

On March 28, 1968, the Yardbirds returned to New York to begin their final US tour. Before their March 30 concert at the Anderson Theater, representatives from Epic Records, the group&#x27;s American label, informed them that it was going to be recorded for a live album. The group felt that it was not sufficiently prepared, but proceeded, with &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; as their third number. Disappointed with the playbacks, the Yardbirds rejected any idea of releasing the recordings as a live album. However, after Page&#x27;s rise to fame in Led Zeppelin, Epic released the album in 1971, with &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; retitled &quot;I&#x27;m Confused&quot; (with no composer credit or performance rights organization). (Within a week, Page responded with an injunction, which prevented further sales of the album.) Although the recording and the group&#x27;s performance is a bit rough, in a review Eder singled out the song as &quot;something new, a slow blues as dark, forbidding, and intense as anything that the band ever cut – it showed where Page, if not his band, was heading.&quot; In 2017, Page remixed the Anderson Theater recordings and the song (with the correct title) was issued on &quot;Yardbirds &#x27;68&quot;.

===Recordings and releases===
The Yardbirds never attempted to record the piece in the studio. However, Page used an abbreviated version of his guitar solo from &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; for the middle-section guitar solo of &quot;Think About It&quot;.

Several live recordings of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; are in release. If the song was introduced, it was announced as &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; – it is unknown why Epic re-titled it &quot;I&#x27;m Confused&quot;.
* Unknown venue, England (January 1968) – &quot;Glimpses 1963–1968&quot;, released 2011
* BBC Radio broadcast, England (March 5–6, 1968) – &quot;Glimpses 1963–1968&quot;, released 2011
* &quot;Bouton Rouge&quot; television broadcast, France (March 9, 1968) – &quot;Cumular Limit&quot;, released 2000
* Anderson Theatre, New York City (March 30, 1968) – &quot;Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page&quot;, released 1971, &quot;Yardbirds &#x27;68&quot; (2017)
* Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles (May 31 &amp; June 1, 1968) – &quot;Last Rave-Up in L.A.&quot;

==Led Zeppelin==

When the Yardbirds disbanded in 1968, Page planned to record the song in the studio with the successor group he had assembled that summer. According to Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, the first time he heard the song was at the band&#x27;s first rehearsal session at Gerrard Street in London, in 1968: &quot;Jimmy played us the riffs at the first rehearsal and said, &#x27;This is a number I want us to do&#x27;.&quot; The future Led Zeppelin recorded their version in October 1968 at Olympic Studios, London, and the song was included on their self-titled debut album (1969). &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; was the second song recorded at the Olympic sessions.

The group recorded the song in two takes. Page played a Telecaster and violin bow as he had performed it with the Yardbirds. Singer Robert Plant wrote a new set of bluesier lyrics, according to Page, though Plant is not credited on the album, due to contractual obligations to Chrysalis Records. Plant&#x27;s vocal is raw and powerful, delivered with &quot;unrelenting passion&quot;. Other than the lyrics and vocal, the song remained very similar to that performed by the Yardbirds earlier that year.

As of 2002, the 1969 promotional EP using &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot; as the A-side track and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; as B-side had been one of top ten Led Zeppelin music collectibles. A collector Rick Barrett, dedicated to his Led Zeppelin memorabilia, sold several copies of the promo EP for –500 each, &quot;depending on the condition of the sleeve and of the record itself,&quot; said Barrett.

In June 2010, Holmes filed a lawsuit in US federal court, alleging copyright infringement and naming Page as a co-defendant. The suit was &quot;dismissed with prejudice&quot; on January 17, 2012, after an undisclosed settlement between Page and Holmes was reached out of court in the fall of 2011. Subsequent Led Zeppelin albums, such as &quot;Celebration Day&quot; (2012) and the remastered and deluxe editions of the group&#x27;s debut album (2014), expanded the songwriter&#x27;s credit for &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; to &quot;By Page – Inspired by Jake Holmes.&quot;

===Live performances===
&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; was the most regularly performed song by Led Zeppelin, appearing at over 400 concerts. It was played on every tour up to and including their 1975 shows at Earls Court. It was greatly expanded to include more improvisation, including short portions of other songs, and live performances could exceed 30 minutes. It was subsequently removed from their live set, although Page continued to perform parts of the bowed guitar segment during solo spots on subsequent tours, as preludes to &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; (1977 tour) and &quot;In the Evening&quot; (Knebworth 1979 and Tour Over Europe 1980). It was part of the group&#x27;s set at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert on December 10, 2007.

A live version of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; recorded July 1973 at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden was featured in the 1976 Led Zeppelin concert film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. Other live recordings are found on the following official releases: 
* &quot;Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions&quot; (1997), two versions from 1969 and 1971.
* &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot; (2003), three versions filmed, March 17, 1969 (Gladsaxe Teen Club, Denmark), March 25, 1969 (Staines Studio, London), June 19, 1969 (Olympia Theatre, Paris) and January 9, 1970 (Royal Albert Hall, London)
* &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (2003), recorded June 25, 1972 (LA Forum)
* &quot;Celebration Day&quot; (2012), recorded at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute.
* &quot;Led Zeppelin (Deluxe Edition)&quot; remastered series (2014), recorded at the Paris Olympia and released as a companion disc to the studio remaster.

<text>A marine park is a designated park consisting of an area of sea (or lake) set aside to achieve ecological sustainability, promote marine awareness and understanding, enable marine recreational activities, and provide benefits for Indigenous peoples and coastal communities. Most marine parks are managed by national governments, and organized like &#x27;watery&#x27; national parks, whereas marine protected areas and marine reserves are often managed by a subnational entity or non-governmental organization, such as a conservation authority.

The largest marine park used to be the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia, at 350,000 km² until 2010, when the United Kingdom announced the opening of the Chagos Marine Park or Chagos Archipelago.

Although for many uses it is sufficient to designate the boundaries of the marine park and to inform commercial fishing boats and other maritime enterprises, some parks have gone to additional effort to make their wonders accessible to visitors. These can range from glass-bottomed boats and small submarines, to windowed undersea tubes.

In New Zealand a marine reserve is an area which has a higher degree of legal protection than marine parks for conservation purposes.

In New South Wales, there are planned marine parks which will stretch along the coastline of the entire state.

France and its territories are home to nine marine parks, known as &quot;&quot;.

===High seas===
Nearly all existing marine reserves have been set close to shore, mostly in territorial waters. A main reason for this lies in the fragmented nature of maritime governance in international waters, the poor enforcement of existing regulations in the High seas, plus the difficult co-management that would be required of countries often in conflict. How to circumvent such obstacles? In 2011, based on unique biological, geological and oceanographic features, the Mediterranean Science Commission proposed the creation of eight large international, coast-to coast &quot;Marine Peace Parks&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea where no coastal point is farther than 200 nautical miles from waters under another jurisdiction. The trans-frontier structure of such &#x27;Peace&#x27; Parks puts this problem aside, encouraging the local Governments involved to join forces in the pursuit of a cause higher than their national interest without prejudice to current national claims .

Greenpeace is campaigning for the &quot;doughnut holes&quot; of the western pacific to be declared as marine reserves. 
They are also campaigning for 40 percent of the world’s oceans to be protected as marine reserves.

<doc id="286828" wikidata="Q172284" url="?curid=286828" title="Lady and the Tramp">
<text>Lady and the Tramp is a 1955 American animated musical romantic comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Film Distribution. Based on Ward Greene&#x27;s 1945 &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine story &quot;Happy Dan, the Cynical Dog&quot;, it was directed by Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, and Wilfred Jackson. Featuring the voices of Peggy Lee, Barbara Luddy, Larry Roberts, Bill Thompson, Bill Baucom, Stan Freberg, Verna Felton, Alan Reed, George Givot, Dallas McKennon, and Lee Millar, the film follows Lady, the pampered Cocker Spaniel, as she grows from puppy to adult, deals with changes in her family, and meets and falls in love with the homeless mutt Tramp.

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was released to theaters on June 22, 1955, to box office success. It was the first animated film to be filmed in the CinemaScope widescreen film process, as well as Disney&#x27;s first animated film to be distributed by their Buena Vista division following their split from RKO Radio Pictures. It initially received generally mixed reviews by film critics, but critical reception for the film has been generally positive in modern times.

A direct-to-video sequel, titled &quot;Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, was released in 2001, and a live-action/CGI hybrid remake premiered in 2019 as a launch title for the Disney+ streaming service. In 2023, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==

In 1909, in a small town, &quot;Jim Dear&quot; gives his wife &quot;Darling&quot; a cocker spaniel puppy as a Christmas present. The puppy, named Lady, grows up pampered by her doting owners and befriends her neighbors&#x27; dogs, Jock (a Scottie) and Trusty (an elderly Bloodhound). Meanwhile, across town, a stray terrier-mix named Tramp spends his days wandering the streets, feeding on scraps and handouts, and causing trouble for the local dogcatcher.

Fleeing the angry dogcatcher after freeing his friends Peg the Pekingese and Bull the Bulldog, Tramp finds himself in Lady&#x27;s neighborhood. He overhears a distraught Lady conversing with Jock and Trusty about her owners&#x27; suddenly distant behavior towards her. When Jock and Trusty deduce this is because Darling is pregnant, Tramp inserts himself into the conversation as the &quot;voice of experience&quot; and warns Lady that &quot;when a baby moves in, a dog moves out.&quot; Annoyed, Jock drives him from the yard. Tramp&#x27;s words cause Lady to fret throughout Darling&#x27;s pregnancy, but when the baby boy arrives, she is allowed to meet and bond with him, dispelling her fears.

Later, Jim Dear and Darling take a short trip, leaving the house, Lady, and the baby in the care of Jim Dear&#x27;s aunt Sarah, who brings along her two Siamese cats, Si and Am. Sarah dislikes dogs and prohibits Lady from seeing the baby; later, the cats destroy the house and pin the deed on Lady by pretending she injured them. Sarah takes Lady to the pet shop and has a muzzle put on her; Lady panics and flees into the street, where she is pursued by three savage dogs until Tramp intervenes to protect her.

Tramp takes Lady to the zoo to have the muzzle removed by a beaver; he then shows Lady his owner-free lifestyle, and they explore the town. The kindly proprietor of Tony&#x27;s Restaurant gives them a spaghetti dinner to share, before they end the evening with a walk in the park.

The next day, Tramp tries to convince Lady to live &quot;footloose and collar free&quot; with him; despite liking Tramp, she decides her duty is to watch over the baby. As Tramp escorts Lady home, he stops to chase some chickens; the dogcatcher pursues them both, but only Lady is caught. At the pound, she meets Peg, Bull, and some other strays, who all know Tramp. They reveal he has had many girlfriends in the past, and claim that females are his weakness.

Sarah comes to claim Lady, and chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away. Jock and Trusty propose that Lady should marry and come live with one of them, to escape the abuse, but she gently refuses them. When Tramp arrives to apologize to Lady, she berates him for his many girlfriends and sends him away, too. Afterwards, Lady notices a large rat sneaking into the house through the baby&#x27;s bedroom window. Her attempts to alert Sarah fail, but Tramp hears her barking, returns, and enters the house himself to save the baby. Lady breaks her chain and follows soon after. Tramp is wounded in the battle with the rat, but manages to kill it behind a curtain. During the struggle, the baby&#x27;s crib overturns, and he begins to cry; Sarah comes to investigate, and assumes the dogs attacked the baby.

Jim Dear and Darling return home to find that Sarah has locked Lady in the cellar and handed Tramp over to the dogcatcher to be euthanized. Disbelieving Sarah&#x27;s story, Jim Dear frees Lady, who immediately shows them the dead rat. Overhearing the truth, Jock and Trusty pursue the dogcatcher&#x27;s cart and try to stop it; the horses spook, causing the cart to crash. Jim Dear and Darling arrive with Lady to rescue Tramp, but Trusty is badly injured in the wreck.

Later, at Christmastime, Tramp has become an official part of the family, and he and Lady have four little puppies of their own. Jock and a mostly healed Trusty visit the family; the puppies now provide Trusty a new audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them, much 
to his and everyone else&#x27;s amusement.

==Cast==

* Peggy Lee as Darling, Lady&#x27;s owner and Jim Dear&#x27;s wife.
** Lee also voiced Peg, a stray female Pekingese with a Brooklyn Accent whom Lady meets at the pound, as well as Si and Am, Aunt Sarah&#x27;s twin Siamese cats with a knack for mischief and never-ending trouble.
* Barbara Luddy as Lady, an American Cocker Spaniel, who is the primary character in the film. A Christmas present to Darling from Jim Dear, she quickly becomes the center of their lives, but is then subconsciously neglected due to the birth of a human baby who she comes to love unconditionally. Her experiences outside the household, and her encounter with Tramp force her to question the nature of her relationship with her humans (who she never sees as her owners), and give her a new understanding of the world around her.
* Larry Roberts as Tramp, a mongrel (with a mixture of a schnauzer and a terrier), with a talent for escaping dog-catchers. He nicknames Lady &quot;Pidge&quot;, short for Pigeon, which he calls her owing to her naivety. He never refers to himself by name, although most of the film&#x27;s canine cast refer to him as the Tramp. Tramp had other names in the film, and when asked by Lady about having a family, Tramp states that he has, &quot;One for every day of the week. Point is, none of them have me.&quot; Each family mentioned called him a different name (such as Mike or Fritzi). The families also had different nationalities (such as Irish or German). As he did not belong to a single-family, Tramp implied that it was easier than the baby problems Lady was going through at the time.
* Bill Thompson as Jock, a Scottish Terrier who is one of Lady&#x27;s neighbors.
** Thompson also voiced Joe, Tony&#x27;s assistant chef; Bull, a stray male bulldog from the dog pound who speaks with a Cockney accent; Dachsie, a stray male dachshund at the dog pound who speaks with a German accent; an Irish-accented policeman; and Jim&#x27;s friend.
* Bill Baucom as Trusty, a bloodhound who used to track criminals with his Grandpappy, Old Reliable, until he lost his sense of smell.
* Stan Freberg as the beaver, a diligent, absent-minded beaver at the zoo who speaks with a lisp. He gnaws off the muzzle that Aunt Sarah had placed upon Lady after Tramp realizes that the muzzle is just what the beaver needs for pulling logs. This character would later serve as the inspiration for Gopher from &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; (1966), down to the speech pattern (a whistling sound when he makes the &quot;S&quot; sound). On the 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD, Stan Freberg demonstrates how it was done and that a whistle was eventually used because it was hard to continue repeating the effect.
* Verna Felton as Aunt Sarah, Jim Dear&#x27;s aunt who babysits for the couple. She is a cat person and dislikes dogs.
* Alan Reed as Boris, a stray male Borzoi from the dog pound with a Russian accent.
* George Givot as Tony, the owner and chef of Tony&#x27;s Italian restaurant.
* Dallas McKennon as:
** Toughy, a stray male mutt with a slight Brooklyn accent
** Pedro, a stray male Chihuahua with a Mexican accent
** McKennon also voices a professor and a laughing hyena
* Lee Millar as Jim Dear, Lady&#x27;s owner and Darling&#x27;s husband.
** Millar also voiced the Dogcatcher.
* The Mellomen (Thurl Ravenscroft, Bill Lee, Max Smith, Bob Hamlin and Bob Stevens) as Dog Chorus
** Ravenscroft also plays Al the alligator
==Production==
===Story development===
In 1937, Walt Disney Productions story artist Joe Grant came up with an idea inspired by the antics of his English Springer Spaniel Lady, and how she got &quot;shoved aside&quot; by Joe&#x27;s new baby. He approached Walt Disney with sketches of Lady. Disney enjoyed the sketches and commissioned Grant to start story development on a new animated feature titled &quot;Lady&quot;. Through the late 1930s and early 1940s, Joe Grant and other artists worked on the story, taking a variety of approaches, but Disney was not pleased with any of them, primarily because he thought Lady was too sweet, and there was not enough action.

Walt Disney read the short story written by Ward Greene, titled &quot;Happy Dan, the Cynical Dog&quot;, in the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, published in 1945. He thought that Grant&#x27;s story would be improved if Lady fell in love with a cynical dog character like the one in Greene&#x27;s story, and bought the rights to it. The cynical dog had various names during development, including Homer, Rags, and Bozo, before &quot;Tramp&quot; was chosen.

The finished film is slightly different from what was originally planned. Lady was to have only one next-door neighbor, a Ralph Bellamy-type canine named Hubert. Hubert was later replaced with Jock and Trusty. Aunt Sarah was the traditional overbearing mother-in-law. In the final film, she is softened to a busybody who, though antagonistic towards Lady and Tramp, is well-meaning (she sends a packet of dog biscuits to the dogs at Christmas to apologize for mistreating them). Aunt Sarah&#x27;s Nip and Tuck were later renamed Si and Am. Originally, Lady&#x27;s owners were called Jim Brown and Elizabeth. These were changed to highlight Lady&#x27;s point of view. They were briefly referred to as &quot;Mister&quot; and &quot;Missis&quot; before settling on the names &quot;Jim Dear&quot; and &quot;Darling&quot;. To maintain a dog&#x27;s perspective, Darling and Jim&#x27;s faces are rarely shown, similar to Tom&#x27;s various owners in the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons. The rat was a somewhat comic character in early sketches, but became a great deal more frightening, due to the need to raise dramatic tension. A scene created but then deleted was one in which after Trusty says &quot;Everybody knows, a dog&#x27;s best friend is his human&quot;, Tramp describes a world in which the roles of both dogs and humans are switched; the dogs are the masters and vice versa. There was a love triangle among Lady, Tramp, and a Russian wolfhound named Boris (who appears in the dog pound in the final version).

The film&#x27;s opening sequence, in which Darling unwraps a hat box on Christmas morning and finds Lady inside, is inspired by an incident when Walt Disney presented his wife Lily with a Chow puppy as a gift in a hat box to make up for having previously forgotten a dinner date with her.

In 1949, Grant left the studio, yet Disney story men were continually pulling Grant&#x27;s original drawings and story off the shelf to retool. A solid story began taking shape in 1953, based on Grant&#x27;s storyboards and Greene&#x27;s short story. Greene later wrote a novelization of the film that was released two years before the film itself, at Walt Disney&#x27;s insistence, so that audiences would be familiar with the story. Due to Greene&#x27;s novelization, Grant did not receive film credit for his story work, an issue that animation director Eric Goldberg hoped to rectify in the &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; Platinum Edition&#x27;s behind-the-scenes vignette that explained Grant&#x27;s role.

Singer Peggy Lee not only voiced four characters but co-wrote six songs for the film.

===Animation===
As they had done with the deer on &quot;Bambi&quot;, the animators studied many dogs of different breeds to capture the movement and personality of dogs. Although the spaghetti eating sequence is one of the most notable scenes in the film, Walt Disney was prepared to cut it, thinking that it would not be romantic and that dogs eating spaghetti would look silly. Animator Frank Thomas was against Walt&#x27;s decision and animated the entire scene himself without any lay-outs. Walt was impressed by Thomas&#x27;s work and how he romanticized the scene and kept it in. On viewing the first take of the scene, the animators felt that the action should be slowed down, so an apprentice trainee was assigned to create &quot;half numbers&quot; in between many of the original frames.

Originally, the background artist was supposed to be Mary Blair and she did some inspirational sketches for the film. However, she left the studio to become a children&#x27;s book illustrator in 1953. Claude Coats was then appointed as the key background artist. Coats made models of the interiors of Jim Dear and Darling&#x27;s house, and shot photos and film at a low perspective as reference to maintain a dog&#x27;s view. Eyvind Earle (who later became the art director of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;) did almost 50 miniature concept sketches for the &quot;Bella Notte&quot; sequence and was a key contributor to the film.

====CinemaScope====

Originally, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was planned to be filmed in a regular full frame aspect ratio. However, due to the growing interest of widescreen film among movie-goers, Disney decided to animate the film in CinemaScope making &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; the first animated feature filmed in the process. This new innovation presented additional problems for the animators: the expansion of space created more realism but gave fewer closeups. It also made it difficult for a single character to dominate the screen so that groups had to be spread out to keep the screen from appearing sparse. Longer takes become necessary since constant jump-cutting would seem too busy or annoying. Layout artists essentially had to reinvent their technique. Animators had to remember that they had to move their characters across a background instead of the background passing behind them. Yet the animators overcame these obstacles during the action scenes, such as Tramp killing the rat.

More problems arose as the premiere date got closer since not all theaters had the capability to show CinemaScope at the time. Upon learning this, Walt issued two versions of the film: one in widescreen, and another in the Academy ratio. This involved gathering the layout artists to restructure key scenes when characters were on the edges of the screen.

==Release==
&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was originally released to theaters on June 22, 1955. An episode of &quot;Disneyland&quot; called &quot;A Story of Dogs&quot; aired before the film&#x27;s release. The film was also reissued to theaters in 1962, 1972, 1980, and 1986. &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; also played a limited engagement in select Cinemark Theatres from February 16–18, 2013.

===Home media===
&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was first released on North American VHS cassette and Laserdisc in 1987 as part of the Walt Disney Classics video series and in the United Kingdom in 1990. At the end of its initial home video release, it was reported to have sold more than three million copies, becoming the best-selling videocassette at the time. It went into moratorium on March 31, 1988. The video cassette had grossed in sales by 1988. Peggy Lee was asked to help promote the release, for which she was paid $500. After its release on videotape, she sought performance and song royalties on the video sales. Disney CEO Michael Eisner refused, thus she filed suit in 1988. Eventually in 1992, the California Court of Appeals order Disney to pay Lee $3.2 million in compensation or about 4% of the video sales.

It was released on VHS again in 1998 as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection video series. This one is a THX certified release that comes in either widescreen or standard versions. A Disney Limited Issue series DVD of the film was released on November 23, 1999, for a limited sixty-day time period.

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was remastered and restored for DVD on February 28, 2006, as the seventh installment of Disney&#x27;s Platinum Editions series. On its first day, one million copies of the Platinum Edition were sold. The Platinum Edition DVD went on moratorium on January 31, 2007, along with the 2006 DVD re-issue of the film&#x27;s sequel &quot;Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp&#x27;s Adventure&quot;.

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was released on Blu-ray on February 7, 2012, as a part of Disney&#x27;s Diamond Editions series. A standalone 1-disc DVD edition was released on March 20, 2012.

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was re-released on Digital HD on February 20, 2018, and on Blu-ray February 27, 2018, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection line.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
During its initial release, the film initially received mixed reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed the film was &quot;not the best [Disney] has done in this line. The sentimentality is mighty, and the CinemaScope size does not make for any less aware of the thickness of the goo. It also magnifies the animation, so that the flaws and poor foreshortening are more plain. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, the artists&#x27; work is below par in this film.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; wrote &quot;Walt Disney has for so long parlayed gooey sentiment and stark horror into profitable cartoons that most moviegoers are apt to be more surprised than disappointed to discover that the combination somehow does not work this time.&quot; However, &quot;Variety&quot; deemed the film &quot;a delight for the juveniles and a joy for adults&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; felt the &quot;scintillating musical score and several songs, the dialogue and the voices, the behaviors and expressions of the different characters, the mellow turn-of-the-century backgrounds, the beautiful color and sweep of the CinemaScope process — all these add up to the one of the most enjoyable cartoon features Disney has ever made.&quot; Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as a &quot;delightful, haunting, charmed fantasy that is remarkably enriched with music and, incidentally, with rare conversations among the canine characters.&quot;

However, the film has since gone on to become regarded as a classic. Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review on their show &quot;At the Movies&quot; when re-released in 1986, with Ebert in particular praising the opening scene of Lady as a puppy calling it one of the greatest animated sequences Disney ever did. Dave Kehr, writing for &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four stars. Animation historian Charles Solomon praised the film. The sequence of Lady and Tramp sharing a plate of spaghetti — climaxed by an accidental kiss as they swallow opposite ends of the same strand of spaghetti — is considered an iconic scene in American film history. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received approval rating, with an average rating of , based on reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;A nostalgic charmer, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;″s token sweetness is mighty but the songs and richly colored animation are technically superb and make for a memorable experience.&quot;

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; contains several instances of ethnic and cultural stereotyping. The depiction of the pair of Siamese cats in particular has been recognized for its racist Asian stereotypes. &quot;The Siamese Cat Song&quot; was cut from the 2019 live-action remake of the film, and in 2020 Disney+ included a content warning at the beginning of the film, advising viewers of &quot;negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures&quot;.

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was named number 95 out of the &quot;100 Greatest Love Stories of All Time&quot; by the American Film Institute in their &quot;100 Years...100 Passions&quot; special, as one of only two animated films to appear on the list, along with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; which ranked 34th. In 2010, Rhapsody called its accompanying soundtrack one of the all-time great Disney and Pixar soundtracks. In June 2011, &quot;TIME&quot; named it one of &quot;The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films&quot;.

===Box office===
In its initial release, the film took in a higher figure than any other Disney animated feature since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, earning an estimated $6.5 million in distributor rentals. When it was re-released in 1962, it grossed roughly between $6 million and $7 million. During its 1971 re-release, the film grossed $10 million, and when it was re-released again in 1980, it grossed $27 million. During its fourth re-release in 1986, it garnered $31.1 million.

&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; has had a domestic lifetime gross of $93.6 million, and a lifetime international gross of $187 million.

==Music==


The score for the film was composed and conducted by Oliver Wallace. It was the last Disney animated film for which Oliver Wallace did the score, as the scores for the next six Disney animated films were composed by George Bruns, starting with &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; until &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. Recording artist Peggy Lee wrote the songs with Sonny Burke and assisted with the score as well. In the film, she sings &quot;La La Lu&quot;, &quot;The Siamese Cat Song&quot;, and &quot;He&#x27;s a Tramp&quot;. She helped promote the film on the Disney TV series, explaining her work with the score and singing a few of the film&#x27;s numbers. These appearances are available as part of the &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; Platinum Edition DVD set.

On November 16, 1988, Peggy Lee sued the Walt Disney Company for breach of contract, claiming that she retained the rights to transcriptions of the music, arguing that videotape editions were transcriptions. After a protracted legal battle, she was awarded $2.3 million in 1991.

The remastered soundtrack of &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was released on CD by Walt Disney Records on September 9, 1997, and was released as a digital download on September 26, 2006.

*The comic book was also published by Dell Comics&#x27; first issue being &quot;Four Color&quot; #703 (May 1956); this turned into a regular comic book series which had #16 issues ending in December 1960. A second series was launched by Gold Key Comics in 1967-1979; which ran for 45 issues.

===Sequel===

On February 27, 2001, Disney Television Animation and Disney Video Premiere released a direct-to-video sequel to the film titled &quot;Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp&#x27;s Adventure&quot;. Produced 46 years after its predecessor and set two years and a few months after the events of the first film, it centers on the adventures of Lady and Tramp&#x27;s only son, Scamp, who desires to be a wild dog. He runs away from his family and joins a gang of junkyard dogs to fulfill his longing for freedom and a life without rules. Reviews for the sequel were generally mixed to negative, with critics panning its plot.

===Live-action remake===

Walt Disney Pictures produced a live-action remake of the film with Justin Theroux and Tessa Thompson in the voice roles of Tramp and Lady respectively. The movie premiered on Disney&#x27;s new streaming service, Disney+, on its US launch date of November 12, 2019 to mixed reviews.

===Video games===
In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games, a statue of Lady and Tramp appears in a fountain in Traverse Town.

In the world builder game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, Lady, Tramp, Tony, Joe, Jock and Trusty appear as playable characters, along with some attractions based on locations of the film. In the game the characters are involved in new storylines that serve as a continuation of the film.

== Disney Parks and Resorts ==
Walt Disney wanted the setting of the film to be Marceline, Missouri which had been his childhood hometown. Whilst &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was in production, Walt was also designing Disneyland in California and styled the Main Street, U.S.A. area of the park to Marceline. Tony&#x27;s Town Square Restaurant is an Italian restaurant inspired by Lady and the Tramp and is located on Main Street, U.S.A. at Walt Disney World, whilst the Pizzeria Bella Notte restaurant is in Fantasyland at Disneyland Paris.

<doc id="286833" wikidata="Q2491076" url="?curid=286833" title="Hideous Kinky">
<text>Hideous Kinky is an autobiographical novel by Esther Freud, daughter of British painter Lucian Freud and Bernardine Coverley and great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud. It depicts the author&#x27;s unconventional childhood in Morocco with her mother and her elder sister, Bella. In 1998, a film adaptation was released.

==Plot summary==
A young mother and her two daughters travel to Marrakech, Morocco, during the 1960s. The mother, Julia, is disenchanted by the dreary conventions of English life, hence the journey. They live in a low-rent Marrakech hotel and make a living out of sewing dresses and with some money sent by the girls&#x27; father, an artist in London.

Whilst the mother explores Sufism and quests for personal fulfilment, the daughters rebel. The elder, Bea, attempting to re-create her English life, wants to get an education and insists on going to school. The younger, Lucy, dreams of trivial things, like mashed potatoes, but also yearns for a father. Her hopes settle on a most unlikely candidate.

The girls match their mother with Bilal, a Moroccan acrobat; the relationship turns sexual and he moves in, becoming almost a surrogate father. However, Julia&#x27;s friend encourages her to travel to Algiers and study with a Sufi master at a school that advocates the &quot;annihilation of the ego.&quot; As money vanishes, Julia&#x27;s response is to claim that &quot;God will provide,&quot; albeit in the person of Bilal.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
In 1998, the novel was adapted into a film, &quot;Hideous Kinky&quot;, directed by Gillies MacKinnon.

<doc id="286834" wikidata="Q542559" url="?curid=286834" title="George Cadle Price">
<text>George Cadle Price (15 January 191919 September 2011) was a Belizean statesman who served as the head of government of Belize from 1961 to 1984 and 1989 to 1993. He was the first minister and premier under British rule until independence in 1981 and was the nation&#x27;s first prime minister after independence that year. He is considered one of the principal architects of Belizean independence. Today he is referred to by many as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;. Price effectively dominated Belizean politics from the early 1960s until his 1996 retirement from party leadership, having been the nation&#x27;s head of government under various titles for most of that period.

He entered politics in 1947 with his election to the Belize City Council. In 1949, with the devaluation of the British Honduran dollar he, together with a group of citizens, formed the People&#x27;s Committee. It was the start of the &quot;peaceful, constructive Belizean revolution&quot;. On 29 September 1950, he co-founded the People&#x27;s United Party, which he led for four decades and which was devoted to the political and economic independence of the British colony, then known as British Honduras.

==Early life and education==
George Price was born in Belize City in what was then British Honduras, to William and Irene (née Escalante) Price. He had eight sisters and two brothers.

Price received his early education at Holy Redeemer Primary School and St. John&#x27;s College High School (SJC). He survived the hurricane of 1931 which destroyed SJC at Loyola Park, swimming away from the wreckage. Under the Jesuits, he was exposed to the teachings of Catholic social justice, in particular the encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;. Upon graduation, the young Price felt a call to the priesthood, so he went to study abroad, first attending Saint Augustine&#x27;s Minor Seminary in Mississippi, United States, and later the Mayor Seminario Conciliar in Guatemala City. Throughout his life Price remained a devout Roman Catholic and attended Mass daily.

The war in Europe prevented him from completing his studies in Rome and, instead, George Price returned to Belize. He was hired by local businessman Robert Sidney Turton as his private secretary. Price also contributed to the &quot;Belize Billboard&quot;, then run by Philip Goldson.

==Political career==

After receiving encouragement from Turton, Price ran for election to the Belize City Council in 1944 and 1947, being successful in 1947. Upon the formation of the People&#x27;s Committee (PC) in 1950, Price was named its Assistant Secretary, and in a famous speech later that year claimed that &quot;National Unity&quot; propelled the PC&#x27;s actions. With the formation of the PUP, Price&#x27;s stature rose and he ascended through the party ranks until he became Party Leader following a leadership dispute in 1956.

Elected to the colony&#x27;s newly created Legislative Assembly in 1954, he also served as mayor of Belize City from 1956 to 1962. In 1956, Price became party leader of the PUP. As First Minister, a post he held since 1961, he led the team which began negotiations over independence with the United Kingdom. He maintained that post as Premier in 1964.

In 1981 Belize gained its independence, and Price served as the country&#x27;s first prime minister and foreign minister until 1984. The PUP was defeated in the elections by the United Democratic Party under Manuel Esquivel, with Price unexpectedly losing his own House of Representatives seat to a political newcomer. Price continued to lead the PUP from outside the National Assembly while Florencio Marin became the Leader of the Opposition. Price resumed the post of prime minister after successfully returning to the House in the 1989 election, serving until 1993, when he was again succeeded by Esquivel. In October 1996 he announced his resignation as party leader, and on 10 November 1996 was formally succeeded by Said Musa. Price remained a member of the Belize House until the 2003 election.

==Honours==
In September 2000, Price became the first person to receive Belize&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of National Hero, for the prominent role he played in leading his country to independence. He has received similar honours in other Caribbean and Central American countries. In 1982, he was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

==Death==
Price died on 19 September 2011, at the age of 92. On 26 September 2011, a state funeral was held. Price was laid to rest at the Lord&#x27;s Ridge Cemetery in Belize City.

<doc id="286835" wikidata="Q235517" url="?curid=286835" title="Beverly Sills">
<text>Beverly Sills (born Belle Miriam Silverman; May 25, 1929July 2, 2007) was an American operatic soprano whose career peak was between the 1950s and 1970s.

Although she sang a repertoire from Handel and Mozart to Puccini, Massenet and Verdi, she was especially renowned for her performances in coloratura soprano roles in live opera and recordings. Sills was largely associated with the operas of Donizetti, of which she performed and recorded many roles. Her signature roles include the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, the title role in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, Marie in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, the three heroines in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;, Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Violetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, and most notably Elisabetta in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted,

In her prime her technique was exemplary. She could dispatch coloratura roulades and embellishments, capped by radiant high Ds and E-flats, with seemingly effortless agility. She sang with scrupulous musicianship, rhythmic incisiveness and a vivid sense of text.

NPR said her voice was &quot;Capable of spinning a seemingly endless legato line, or bursting with crystalline perfection into waves of dazzling fioriture and thrilling high notes.&quot;

After retiring from singing in 1980, she became the general manager of the New York City Opera. In 1994, she became the chairwoman of Lincoln Center and then, in 2002, of the Metropolitan Opera, stepping down in 2005. Sills lent her celebrity to further her charity work for the prevention and treatment of birth defects.

==Biography==
Sills was born Belle Miriam Silverman in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York City, to Shirley Bahn (née Sonia Markovna), a musician, and Morris Silverman, an insurance broker. Her parents were Jewish immigrants from Odesa, Ukraine (then part of Russia), and Bucharest, Romania. She was raised in Brooklyn, where she was known, among friends, as &quot;Bubbles&quot; Silverman. As a child, she spoke Yiddish, Russian, Romanian, French, and English. She attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, as well as Manhattan&#x27;s Professional Children&#x27;s School.

At the age of three, Sills won a &quot;Miss Beautiful Baby&quot; contest, in which she sang &quot;The Wedding of Jack and Jill&quot;. Beginning at age four, she performed professionally on the Saturday morning radio program, &quot;Rainbow House&quot;, as &quot;Bubbles&quot; Silverman. Sills began taking singing lessons with Estelle Liebling at the age of seven and a year later sang in the short film &quot;Uncle Sol Solves It&quot; (filmed August 1937, released June 1938 by Educational Pictures), by which time she had adopted her stage name, Beverly Sills. Liebling encouraged her to audition for CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Major Bowes&#x27; Amateur Hour&quot;, and on October 26, 1939, at the age of 10, Sills was the winner of that week&#x27;s program. Bowes then asked her to appear on his &quot;Capitol Family Hour&quot;, a weekly variety show. Her first appearance was on November 19, 1939, the 17th anniversary of the show, and she appeared frequently on the program thereafter.

In 1945, Sills made her professional stage debut with a Gilbert and Sullivan touring company produced by Jacob J. Shubert, playing twelve cities in the US and Canada, in seven different Gilbert and Sullivan operas. In her 1987 autobiography, she credits that tour with helping to develop the comic timing she soon became famous for: &quot;I played the title role in &quot;Patience&quot;... a very funny, flaky girl. ... I played her as a dumb Dora all the way through... I found that I had a gift for slapstick humor, and it was fun to exercise it onstage.&quot; Sills sang in operettas for several more years.

On July 9, 1946, Sills appeared as a contestant on the radio show &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;. She sang under the pseudonym of &quot;Vicki Lynn&quot;, as she was under contract to Shubert. Shubert did not want Godfrey to be able to say he had discovered &quot;Beverly Sills&quot; if she won the contest (although she did not ultimately win). Sills sang &quot;Romany Life&quot; from Victor Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot;.
Sills made her operatic stage debut as Frasquita in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; with the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company on February 14, 1951 (erroneously listed in most references as 1947). She toured North America with the Charles Wagner Opera Company, in the fall of 1951, singing Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot; and, in the fall of 1952, singing Micaëla in &quot;Carmen&quot;. On September 15, 1953, she made her debut with the San Francisco Opera as Helen of Troy in Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot; and also sang Donna Elvira in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; the same season. In a step outside of the repertoire she is commonly associated with, Sills gave four performances of the title role of &quot;Aida&quot; in July 1954 in Salt Lake City. On October 29, 1955, she first appeared with the New York City Opera as Rosalinde in Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, which received critical praise. As early as 1956 she performed before an audience of over 13,000 at the Lewisohn Stadium with the noted operatic conductor Alfredo Antonini in an aria from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;. Her reputation expanded with her performance of the title role in the New York premiere of Douglas Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot; in 1958.

On November 17, 1956, Sills married journalist Peter Greenough, of the Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and moved to Cleveland. She had two children with Greenough, Meredith (&quot;Muffy&quot;) in 1959 and Peter, Jr. (&quot;Bucky&quot;) in 1961. Muffy (died July 3, 2016) was profoundly deaf and had multiple sclerosis; Peter, Jr. is severely mentally disabled. Sills restricted her performing schedule to care for her children.

In 1960, Sills and her family moved to Milton, Massachusetts, near Boston. In 1962, Sills sang the title role in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; with the Opera Company of Boston, the first of many roles for opera director Sarah Caldwell. Manon continued to be one of Sills&#x27; signature roles throughout most of her career. In January 1964, she sang her first Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for Caldwell. Although Sills drew critical praise for her coloratura technique and for her performance, she was not fond of the latter role; she observed that she often passed the time between the two arias and the finale addressing holiday cards.

===Peak singing years===
In 1966, the New York City Opera revived Handel&#x27;s then virtually unknown opera seria &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (with Norman Treigle as Caesar), and Sills&#x27; performance as Cleopatra made her an international opera star. Sills also made her &quot;unofficial&quot; Met debut at a Lewisohn Stadium summer concert performance as Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, though nothing further came of this other than offers from Rudolf Bing for roles such as Flotow&#x27;s &quot;Martha&quot;. In subsequent seasons at the NYCO, Sills had great successes in the roles of the Queen of Shemakha in Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;, the title role in &quot;Manon&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, and the three female leads Suor Angelica, Giorgetta, and Lauretta in Puccini&#x27;s trilogy &quot;Il trittico&quot;.

In 1969, Sills sang Zerbinetta in the American premiere (in a concert version) of the 1912 version of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; with the Boston Symphony. Her performance of the role, especially Zerbinetta&#x27;s aria, &quot;Großmächtige Prinzessin&quot;, which she sang in the original higher key, won her acclaim. Home video-taped copies circulated among collectors for years afterwards, often commanding large sums on Internet auction sites (the performance was released commercially in 2006, garnering high praise). The second major event of the year was her debut as Pamira in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot; at La Scala, a success that put her on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Sills&#x27;s now high-profile career landed her on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in 1971, where she was described as &quot;America&#x27;s Queen of Opera&quot;. The title was appropriate because Sills had purposely limited her overseas engagements because of her family. Her major overseas appearances include London&#x27;s Covent Garden, Milan&#x27;s La Scala, La Fenice in Venice, the Vienna State Opera, the Théâtre de Beaulieu in Lausanne, Switzerland, and concerts in Paris. In South America, she sang in the opera houses of Buenos Aires and Santiago, a concert in Lima, Peru, and appeared in several productions in Mexico City, including &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; with Luciano Pavarotti. On November 9, 1971, her performance in the New York City Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; was telecast live to cable TV subscribers.

During this period, she made her first television appearance as a talk-show personality in May 1968 on &quot;Virginia Graham&#x27;s Girl Talk&quot;, a weekday series syndicated by ABC Films. An opera fan who was Talent Coordinator for the series persuaded the producer to put her on the air and she was a huge hit. Throughout the rest of her career she shone as a talk show guest, sometimes also functioning as a guest host. Sills underwent successful surgery for ovarian cancer in late October 1974 (sometimes misreported as breast cancer). Her recovery was so rapid and complete that she opened in &quot;The Daughter of the Regiment&quot; at the San Francisco Opera a month later.

Following Sir Rudolf Bing&#x27;s departure as director, Sills finally made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera on April 7, 1975 in &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot;, receiving an eighteen-minute ovation at her curtain call. Other operas she sang at the Met include &quot;La Traviata&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Thaïs&quot;, and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (directed by John Dexter). In an interview after his retirement, Bing stated that his refusal to use Sills – as well as his preference for engaging, almost exclusively, Italian stars such as Renata Tebaldi due to his notion that American audiences expected to see Italian stars – was the single biggest mistake of his career. Sills attempted to downplay her animosity towards Bing while she was still singing, and even in her two autobiographies. But in a 1997 interview, Sills spoke her mind plainly, &quot;Oh, Mr. Bing is an ass. [W]hile everybody said what a great administrator he was and a great this, Mr. Bing was just an improbable, impossible General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera... The arrogance of that man.&quot;

Sills was a recitalist, especially in the final decade of her career. She sang in mid-size cities and on college concert series, bringing her art to many who might never see her on stage in a fully staged opera. She also sang concerts with a number of symphony orchestras. Sills continued to perform for New York City Opera, her home opera house, essaying new roles right up to her retirement, including the leading roles in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il Turco in Italia&quot;, Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; and Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;La Loca&quot;, an opera commissioned in honor of her 50th birthday. &quot;La Loca&quot; was the first work written expressly as a vehicle for Sills and was her last new role, as she retired the following year. Her farewell performance was at San Diego Opera in 1980, where she shared the stage with Joan Sutherland in a production of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;.

Although Sills&#x27; voice type was characterized as a &quot;lyric coloratura&quot;, she took a number of heavier spinto and dramatic coloratura roles more associated with heavier voices as she grew older, including Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; (with Susanne Marsee as Orsini) and the latter composer&#x27;s &quot;Three Queens&quot;, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; and Elisabetta in &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; (opposite Plácido Domingo in the title part). She was admired in those roles for transcending the lightness of her voice with dramatic interpretation, although it may have come at a cost: Sills later commented that &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; shortened her career by at least four years.

Sills popularized opera through her talk show appearances, including Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, David Frost, Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and Dinah Shore. Sills hosted her own talk show, &quot;Lifestyles with Beverly Sills&quot;, which ran on Sunday mornings on NBC for two years in the late 1970s; it won an Emmy Award. In 1979 she appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, where she famously went into a &quot;high-note contest&quot; with Miss Piggy. Down-to-earth and approachable, Sills helped dispel the traditional image of the temperamental opera diva.

===Later years and death===

In 1978, Sills announced she would retire on October 27, 1980, in a farewell gala at the New York City Opera (NYCO). In the spring of 1979, she began acting as co-director of NYCO, and became its sole general director as of the fall season of that year, a post she held until 1989, although she remained on the NYCO board until 1991. During her time as general director, Sills helped turn what was then a financially struggling opera company into a viable enterprise. She also devoted herself to various arts causes and such charities as March of Dimes and was sought after for speaking engagements on college campuses and for fund raisers.

From 1994 to 2002, Sills was chairwoman of Lincoln Center. In October 2002, she agreed to serve as chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera, for which she had been a board member since 1991. She resigned as Met chairwoman in January 2005, citing family as the main reason (she had to place her husband, whom she had cared for over eight years, in a nursing home). She stayed long enough to supervise the appointment of Peter Gelb, formerly head of Sony Classical Records, as the Met&#x27;s general manager, to succeed Joseph Volpe in August 2006.

 Peter Greenough, Sills&#x27;s husband, died on September 6, 2006, at the age of 89, shortly before what would have been their 50th wedding anniversary on November 17, 2006.

She co-hosted &quot;The View&quot; for Best Friends Week on November 9, 2006, as Barbara Walters&#x27; best friend. She said she did not sing anymore, even in the shower, to preserve the memory of her voice.

She appeared on screen in movie theaters during HD transmissions live from the Met, interviewed during intermissions by the host Margaret Juntwait on January 6, 2007 (&quot;I puritani&quot; simulcast), as a backstage interviewer on February 24, 2007 (&quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; simulcast), and then, briefly, on April 28, 2007 (&quot;Il trittico&quot; simulcast).

On June 28, 2007, the Associated Press and CNN reported that Sills was hospitalized as &quot;gravely ill&quot;, from lung cancer. With her daughter at her bedside, Beverly Sills succumbed to cancer on July 2, 2007, at the age of 78. She is buried in Sharon Gardens, the Jewish division of Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. She was survived by her two children and three step-children from Peter Greenough&#x27;s first marriage. Her daughter Meredith (&quot;Muffy&quot;) Greenough died on July 3, 2016, in New York City.

==Voice==
Sills&#x27;s voice has been variously described as &quot;rich, supple&quot;, &quot;silvery&quot;, &quot;precise, a little light&quot;, &quot;multicolored&quot;, &quot;robust and enveloping&quot;, with &quot;a cutting edge that can slice through the largest orchestra and chorus&quot;, soaring easily above high C. Her technique and musicianship have been much praised. Conductor Thomas Schippers said in a 1971 interview with &quot;Time&quot; that she had &quot;the fastest voice alive&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that &quot;she could dispatch coloratura roulade (music) and embellishments, capped with radiant high Ds and E-flats, with seemingly effortless agility. She sang with scrupulous musicianship, rhythmic incisiveness and a vivid sense of text.&quot; Soprano Leontyne Price was &quot;flabbergasted at how many millions of things she can do with a written scale.&quot; Her vocal range, in performance, extended from F3 to F6, and she said she could sometimes hit a G6 in warm up.

==Operatic repertoire==
These are the roles that Sills performed on stage or for television or radio.

<doc id="286836" wikidata="Q523767" url="?curid=286836" title="Jude (film)">
<text>Jude is a 1996 British period drama film directed by Michael Winterbottom, and written by Hossein Amini, based on Thomas Hardy&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;. The original music score was composed by Adrian Johnston.

The film was shot in late 1995 in Edinburgh and locations in County Durham including Durham Cathedral, Durham City, Ushaw College, Blanchland village and Beamish museum.

In a 2011 interview for &quot;theartsdesk&quot;, lead actor Christopher Eccleston commented on the film: &quot;Of all the films I&#x27;ve done, &quot;Jude&quot; is the one that I&#x27;d stand by, the one I&#x27;d like people to come back to. The rest is much of a muchness.&quot;

==Plot==
In the Victorian period, Jude Fawley is a bright young working-class man who dreams of a university education. Circumstances conspire against him, and he is forced into a job as a stonemason and an unhappy marriage to a country girl, Arabella. He remains true to his dream and, months later, after his wife&#x27;s sudden departure, he heads for the city. He thinks education is available for any man who is willing to work hard. However, he is rejected by the university based primarily on his lower-class status. During this period, he encounters his cousin, Sue Bridehead, who is beautiful and intelligent, and shares his disdain for convention. Whilst Jude is enraptured by Sue, and vice versa, she marries Jude&#x27;s former school teacher, Phillotson, after Jude tells her he is married to Arabella.

The marriage of Sue and Phillotson is not a success, as she refuses to give herself sexually or romantically to her husband. She leaves Phillotson to join Jude in what turns out to be a rough life, moving from place to place as Jude picks up occasional work as a stonemason. Jude learns that Arabella bore a son, whom she named Jude (&quot;Juey&quot;) soon after she left Jude. The boy comes to live with his father Jude, and Sue. Sue gives birth to two children. Agnostic and independent, she refuses to legalise their arrangement by marriage.

Sue and Jude are forbidden a permanent rental lodging because their living arrangement without marriage is considered scandalous. Sue tells Juey that the family cannot stay long at their present lodging because there are too many of them. The next day Sue and Jude return to their lodging to find that Juey has killed his half-siblings and committed suicide, hanging himself. His suicide note says the reason: &quot;Becos we were to menny.&quot;

Each of the couple falls into a deep depression after the deaths of their children. Turning to the religion she previously rejected, Sue comes to believe that God has judged and punished the couple for not having married. She decides to return to Phillotson, although she finds him sexually repugnant, as he is her true husband in the eyes of God.

A year after the death of their children, Jude and Sue happen to meet when separately visiting the tombstones of their children. They both look worse for wear. Jude demands that Sue tell him whether she still loves him, to which she replies, &quot;You&#x27;ve always known&quot;. After a passionate kiss, she walks away from Jude to return to Phillotson.

As Sue walks away, Jude shouts to her, &quot;We are man and wife, if ever two people were on this earth!&quot;

==Cast==
*Christopher Eccleston as Jude Fawley
*Kate Winslet as Sue Bridehead

==Filming locations==
The production filmed in a variety of countries including France, New Zealand and the UK. The Kent and East Sussex Railway was used as a film location for the scenes where Jude (Christopher Eccleston) and Sue (Kate Winslet) are on a train which was intercut with scenery from the North of England.

==Reception==
It holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Superb acting from a beautifully matched Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet make &quot;Jude&quot; well worth watching even as it struggles with its source material.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="286837" wikidata="Q1434465" url="?curid=286837" title="Fluvial sediment processes">
<text>In geography and geology, fluvial sediment processes or fluvial sediment transport are associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by sediments. It can result in the formation of ripples and dunes, in fractal-shaped patterns of erosion, in complex patterns of natural river systems, and in the development of floodplains and the occurrence of flash floods. Sediment moved by water can be larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher density and viscosity. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of sand and gravel size, but larger floods can carry cobbles and even boulders.
When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term &quot;glaciofluvial&quot; or &quot;fluvioglacial&quot; is used, as in periglacial flows and glacial lake outburst floods. Fluvial sediment processes include the motion of sediment and erosion or deposition on the river bed.

==Principles==
The movement of water across the stream bed exerts a shear stress directly onto the bed. If the cohesive strength of the substrate is lower than the shear exerted, or the bed is composed of loose sediment which can be mobilized by such stresses, then the bed will be lowered purely by clearwater flow. In addition, if the river carries significant quantities of sediment, this material can act as tools to enhance wear of the bed (abrasion). At the same time the fragments themselves are ground down, becoming smaller and more rounded (attrition).

Sediment in rivers is transported as either bedload (the coarser fragments which move close to the bed) or suspended load (finer fragments carried in the water). There is also a component carried as dissolved material.

For each grain size there is a specific flow velocity at which the grains start to move, called &quot;entrainment velocity&quot;. However the grains will continue to be transported even if the velocity falls below the entrainment velocity due to the reduced (or removed) friction between the grains and the river bed. Eventually the velocity will fall low enough for the grains to be deposited. This is shown by the Hjulström curve.

A river is continually picking up and dropping solid particles of rock and soil from its bed throughout its length. Where the river flow is fast, more particles are picked up than dropped. Where the river flow is slow, more particles are dropped than picked up. Areas where more particles are dropped are called alluvial or flood plains, and the dropped particles are called alluvium.

Even small streams make alluvial deposits, but it is in floodplains and deltas of large rivers that large, geologically-significant alluvial deposits are found.

The amount of matter carried by a large river is enormous. It has been estimated that the Mississippi River annually carries 406 million tons of sediment to the sea, the Yellow River 796 million tons, and the Po River in Italy 67 million tons. The names of many rivers derive from the color that the transported matter gives the water. For example, the Yellow River (Huang He) in China is named after the hue of the sediment it carries, and the White Nile is named for the clay it carries. 

==Types==
The main kinds of fluvial processes are:
* (solution)
**
*
== Depositional environments ==
The major fluvial (river and stream) depositional environments include:
* Deltas (arguably an intermediate environment between fluvial and marine)
* Point bars
* Alluvial fans
* Braided rivers
* Oxbow lakes
* Levees
* Waterfalls

==Related concepts==

===Particle motion===
Rivers and streams carry sediment in their flows. This sediment can be in a variety of locations within the flow, depending on the balance between the upwards velocity on the particle (drag and lift forces), and the settling velocity of the particle. These relationships are shown in the following table for the Rouse number, which is a ratio of sediment settling velocity (fall velocity) to upwards velocity.

formula_1

where
* formula_2 is the settling velocity
* formula_3 is the von Kármán constant
* formula_4 is the shear velocity

If the upwards velocity is approximately equal to the settling velocity, sediment will be transported downstream entirely as suspended load. If the upwards velocity is much less than the settling velocity, but still high enough for the sediment to move (see Initiation of motion), it will move along the bed as bed load by rolling, sliding, and saltating (jumping up into the flow, being transported a short distance then settling again). If the upwards velocity is higher than the settling velocity, the sediment will be transported high in the flow as wash load.

As there are generally a range of different particle sizes in the flow, it is common for material of different sizes to move through all areas of the flow for given stream conditions.

=== Fluvial bedforms ===

Sediment motion can create self-organized structures such as ripples, dunes, or antidunes on the river or stream bed. These bedforms are often preserved in sedimentary rocks and can be used to estimate the direction and magnitude of the flow that deposited the sediment.

=== Surface runoff ===

Overland flow can erode soil particles and transport them downslope. The erosion associated with overland flow may occur through different methods depending on meteorological and flow conditions.
* If the initial impact of rain droplets dislodges soil, the phenomenon is called rainsplash erosion.
* If overland flow is directly responsible for sediment entrainment but does not form gullies, it is called &quot;sheet erosion&quot;.
* If the flow and the substrate permit channelization, gullies may form; this is termed &quot;gully erosion&quot;.

<text>Owen Wister (July 14, 1860 – July 21, 1938) was an American writer and historian, considered the &quot;father&quot; of western fiction. He is best remembered for writing &quot;The Virginian&quot; and a biography of Ulysses S. Grant.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Owen Wister was born on July 14, 1860, in Germantown, a neighborhood in the northwestern part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Owen Jones Wister, was a wealthy physician raised at Grumblethorpe in Germantown. He was a distant cousin of Sally Wister through his descent from John Wister (born Johannes Wüster) (1708–1789), brother of Caspar Wistar. His mother, Sarah Butler Wister, was the daughter of Fanny Kemble, a British actress, and Pierce Mease Butler. Pierce Mease Butler, heir to a fabulous fortune, was a notorious profligate, gambler, and slaveowner. In 1906 Wister wrote a novel, &quot;Lady Baltimore&quot;, glorifying plantation life. His friend and Harvard classmate, Theodore Roosevelt, wrote to him criticizing the Southern bias of the novel.

===Education===
Wister briefly attended schools in Switzerland and Britain, and later studied at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he was a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Alpha chapter). Wister was also a member of the Porcellian Club, through which he became lifelong friends with future 26th President Theodore Roosevelt. As a senior Wister wrote the Hasty Pudding&#x27;s then most successful show, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, whose proceeds aided in the construction of their theater. Wister graduated from Harvard in 1882.

At first he aspired to a career in music and spent two years studying at a Paris conservatory. Thereafter, he worked briefly in a bank in New York before studying law; he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1888. Following this, he practiced with a Philadelphia firm but was never truly interested in that career. He was interested in politics, however, and was a staunch supporter of U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt.

Harvard&#x27;s Board of Overseers had Theodore Roosevelt as a member in 1916 and Owen Wister as a member in 1918.

In the 1930s, Wister opposed President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal.

===Writing career===

Wister began his literary work in 1882, publishing &quot;The New Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, a parody of the 1812 novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. It was so well received that Mark Twain wrote a letter to Wister praising it.

Wister had spent several summers in the American West, making his first trip to the Territory of Wyoming in 1885, planning to shoot big game, fish trout, meet the Indians, and spend nights in the wild. Like his friend Teddy Roosevelt, Wister was fascinated with the culture, lore and terrain of the region. He was &quot;...struck with wonder and delight, had the eye to see and the talent to portray the life unfolding in America. After six journeys [into the dying &#x27;wild west&#x27;] for pleasure, he gave up the profession of law...&quot;, and became the writer he is better known as. On an 1893 visit to Yellowstone National Park, Wister met the western artist Frederic Remington, who remained a lifelong friend.

When he started writing, Wister naturally inclined towards fiction set on the western frontier. His most famous work remains the 1902 novel &quot;The Virginian&quot;, a complex mixture of persons, places and events dramatized from experience, word of mouth, and his own imaginationultimately creating the archetypal cowboy, who is a natural aristocrat, set against a highly mythologized version of the Johnson County War, and taking the side of the large landowners. This is widely regarded as being the first cowboy novel, though many modern scholars argue that this distinction belongs to Emma Ghent Curtis&#x27;s &quot;The Administratrix,&quot; published over ten years earlier. &quot;The Virginian&quot; was reprinted fourteen times in eight months. It stands as one of the top 50 best-selling works of fiction and is considered by Hollywood experts to be the basis for the modern fictional cowboy portrayed in literature, film, and television.

In 1904 Wister collaborated with Kirke La Shelle on a successful stage adaptation of &quot;The Virginian&quot; that featured Dustin Farnum in the title role. Farnum reprised the role ten years later in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s film adaptation of the play.

Wister was a member of several literary societies, a member of The Franklin Inn Club, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University. He was also an elected member of the American Philosophical Society.

===Personal life===
In 1898, Wister married Mary Channing, his second cousin. The couple had six children. Mary died during childbirth in 1913. Their daughter, Mary Channing Wister, married artist Andrew Dasburg in 1933.

===Death===

In 1938, Wister died at his home in Saunderstown, Rhode Island. He is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
In 1976, Wister was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

Since 1978, University of Wyoming Student Publications has published the literary and arts magazine &quot;Owen Wister Review&quot;. The magazine was published bi-annually until 1996 and became an annual publication in the spring of 1997.

Mount Wister, just within the western boundary of the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, is named for him.

Near a house that Wister built near La Mesa, California, but never occupied due to his wife&#x27;s death, is a street called Wister Drive. In the same neighborhood are Virginian Lane and Molly Woods Avenue (named for a character in &quot;The Virginian&quot;). All of those streets were named by Wister himself.

The most popular legend of the Lady Baltimore cake is that Alicia Rhett Mayberry, a Southern belle, baked and served the cake to Wister in Charleston, South Carolina. Wister was said to have been so enamored with the cake that he used it as the namesake of his novel, &quot;Lady Baltimore&quot;.

==Works inspired by &quot;The Virginian&quot;==
Many movie industry historians will agree that most, if not all, westerns can be claimed to contain influences from &quot;The Virginian&quot;. It is nearly universally accepted that the &quot;Hollywood cowboy&quot; was, and still is, based on this book.

<text>Goh Chok Tong (born 20 May 1941) is a Singaporean former politician who served as the second prime minister of Singapore from 1990 to 2004 and as a senior minister of Singapore from 2004 to 2011. 

He served as the secretary-general of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) from 1992 to 2004 and was the member of Parliament (MP) for Marine Parade SMC from 1976 to 1988, and Marine Parade GRC from 1988 to 2020.

Prior to his appointment as prime minister, he was the country&#x27;s deputy prime minister, where he advocated for the Medisave, a savings scheme that allows Singaporeans to set aside part of their income into a Medisave account to meet future medical expenses. Goh also advocated for the Edusave Awards, a monetary reward for students who did well in school based on either their academic achievements or character to enshrine meritocracy.

Shortly before and during his tenure as prime minister, Goh proposed political reforms like the introduction of Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMP), to allow more opposition into Parliament, Group Representation Constituencies (GRC), to make sure that minorities are represented in Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMP), to have independent opinions in Parliament since all NMPs are non-partisan. Goh assumed the responsibility of government in a carefully managed leadership transition. Goh enacted the Elected President scheme in 1991 as presidents before were appointed by Parliament. He also introduced the Vehicle Quota Scheme to limit the number of vehicles in the city-state.

On 12 August 2004, Goh was succeeded by Lee Hsien Loong, the eldest son of Singapore&#x27;s first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and was subsequently appointed as a senior minister in the Cabinet and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) between 2004 and 2011. He resigned from the Cabinet in 2011, and was given the honorary title of &quot;Emeritus Senior Minister&quot; by Lee. He stepped down as a Member of Parliament (MP) and retired from politics in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Goh was born in Singapore on 20 May 1941 to Goh Kah Choon and Quah Kwee Hwa, who hailed from the Minnan region of Fujian province in China. He has Chinese Hokkien ancestry. Goh studied at Raffles Institution from 1955 to 1960. He was a very competitive swimmer in his younger days and was given the nickname &quot;Bold&quot;.

Goh completed a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours degree in economics at the University of Singapore, and a Master of Arts degree in development economics at Williams College in 1967. 

Upon his graduation, Goh returned to Singapore to work in the government. Goh&#x27;s dream of getting a PhD was disrupted as the government would not transfer his bursary bond to the university, where he had signed on as a research fellow after graduation. 

In 2015, Goh was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by his alma mater, the National University of Singapore, for his contributions to the country.

== Career ==
In 1969, Goh was seconded to the national shipping company Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) as the company&#x27;s Planning and Projects Manager. His career advanced quickly and by 1973 he was the Managing Director. At NOL, Goh worked under the company&#x27;s founder, Muhammad Jalaluddin Sayeed, with whom he maintained close ties.

==Political career==
In the 1976 general election, Goh, then 35, was elected as Member of Parliament for Marine Parade SMC as a People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) candidate. He was appointed as a Senior Minister of State. In 1981, he was promoted to Minister for Trade and Industry and later served in other appointments including Minister for Health and Minister for Defence.

Goh was tasked to organise the 1981 Anson SMC by-election which was a pivotal event in shaping his political sensibilities. Despite having been passed over as first assistant secretary-general by Tony Tan, Goh was asked to his surprise by Lee Kuan Yew to lead and organise the by-election, ostensibly because of Goh&#x27;s previous successful campaigns in organising the 1979 by-election at Anson SMC and the 1980 General Elections. 

Early on in the campaigning for the 1981 Anson SMC by-election, a chasm of leadership emerged as volunteers and older activists for the previous MP Devan Nair departed along with the MP. The new PAP candidate was Pang Kim Hin, who had difficulties connecting to the electorate as he had a reputation of being a &quot;rich man&#x27;s son&quot;, as the nephew of Old Guard minister Lim Kan San. Despite being a three-cornered fight, it was apparent that the main opposition candidate was J. B. Jeyaretnam, who was a veteran opposition at the time, having previously came close in winning the seat at Telok Blangah Constituency, which is of close proximity to Anson. The rising costs of housing and upcoming public bus fares was a source of unhappiness among voters. PAP lost the Anson seat with a 37-point swing in just 10 months since the last general election, marking the first time since Independence that PAP had lost a seat. This watershed event prompted rumours within the PAP of the end of Goh&#x27;s political career. While Lee Kuan Yew was worried that Goh lacked political sensitivity towards the electorate, as he failed to detect the possible loss of the seat and remained overconfident until very close to polling day, he did not blame Goh for the loss, as he reflected in his memoir &quot;From Third World to First&quot;. 

In 1985, Goh became deputy prime minister and began to assume the responsibility of the government in a carefully managed leadership transition. According to Lee Kuan Yew, his preferred successor was Tony Tan. However, Goh was selected by the second generation of PAP leaders that included Tony Tan and Ong Teng Cheong; Lee accepted their decision. However, during the 1988 National Day Rally, Lee Kuan Yew publicly discussed his preferred choice of successor to the nation – ranking Goh as his second below Tony Tan, and while praising his &#x27;faster mind&#x27;, criticized Goh&#x27;s indecisiveness and softer and consultative approach to leadership. This led to Goh feeling humiliated and astonished, as he recounted in his 2018 memoir, &quot;Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story&quot;. 

=== Prime minister ===
On 28 November 1990, Goh succeeded Lee Kuan Yew and became the second prime minister of Singapore. During the first year of Goh&#x27;s premiership, Lee remained as secretary-general of the PAP. Lee also remained an influential member of Goh&#x27;s Cabinet, holding the post of senior minister. The 1991 general elections, the first electoral test for Goh, led to the party winning 61% of the popular vote, the all-time low for PAP since independence. Because of the drop in share of the popular vote, and losing an unprecedented four seats in Parliament to the opposition, Goh had to quell rumours about his potential resignation to the international news media. In 1992, Lee handed over the post of secretary-general of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) to Goh, successfully completing the leadership transition.

Goh&#x27;s deputy prime ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Ong Teng Cheong were both diagnosed with cancer in 1992, prompting the prime minister to call a by-election in his own constituency of Marine Parade in 1992, just over a year after the 1991 elections, citing the need for &#x27;political self-renewal&#x27; and to get &#x27;ministerial calibre&#x27; people to join the government. By calling the by-election, Goh became the first prime minister of Singapore to vacate his seat to contest a by-election. The vacation also produced a real risk of Goh losing the premiership in the event the PAP lost. Teo Chee Hean, who is currently one of the core leaders of the third generation of members of PAP and a senior minister, was one of the new politicians brought in to contest in the by-election.. The PAP retained Marine Parade GRC with 72.9% of the popular vote, allowing Goh to continue on as prime minister, eventually for the next decade.

As prime minister, Goh promised a more open-minded and consultative style of leadership than that of his predecessor. This greater openness extended also to the socio-economic spheres of life, for instance, in his support for the rise of &quot;little bohemias&quot; in Singapore, enclaves where more creativity and entrepreneurship could thrive.

Goh&#x27;s administration introduced several major policies and policy institutions, including:

* Medisave
* Non-Constituency Members of Parliament
* Government Parliamentary Committees
* Group Representation Constituency
* Nominated Members of Parliament
* Vehicle Quota Scheme
* Elected President
* Singapore 21

During the period under Goh&#x27;s administration, Singapore has experienced several crises, such as the aircraft hijack of Singapore Airlines Flight 117 in 1991, the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, threats of terrorism in 2001 including Singaporean victims of the 9/11 attacks in New York City by Al-Qaeda and the Singapore embassies attack plot by Jemaah Islamiyah, the 2001–2003 economic recession, 2003 SARS outbreak, and other events. 

Goh&#x27;s access to Bill Clinton&#x27;s White House was blocked because of the Michael Fay incident; it did not deter Goh from reaching out to the US President to pitch his idea for a free trade agreement (FTA) between Singapore and the US, as he did not believe Clinton to be aware of the diplomatic freeze. With the help of American businessman Joe Ford, Goh managed to reached out to President Clinton during the 1997 APEC summit, where he played golf with Clinton, ending the diplomatic freeze. 

In September 1998, Goh had a meeting with Clinton in the White House and agreed to contribute to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization which helped build strong ties between the two Koreas. The considerable improvement in this bilateral relationship had great impact on Singapore&#x27;s economic recovery from the Asian Financial Crisis as several trade negotiations, part of &quot;The Millennium Round&quot;, failed during the 1999 Seattle WTO protests and Doha Round. As international trade was three times Singapore&#x27;s GDP at that time, securing trade treaties was paramount to Singapore&#x27;s economic survival, with the US as its most desired trading partner. By riding on the improved relations with the Clinton administration, Goh personally reached out to President Clinton during the annual summit at Brunei in November 2000, near the end of Clinton&#x27;s second term of his presidency. After a midnight golf session with Clinton after the banquet, Goh successfully convinced Clinton on a Singapore-USA FTA, with Clinton suggesting an FTA similar to the US-Jordan FTA. The FTA with the USA was eventually signed in 2003, and it was the USA&#x27;s first FTA with an Asian country, with Goh exalting this FTA as the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of Singapore&#x27;s international trade.

As secretary-general, Goh led the PAP to three general election victories in 1991, 1997, and 2001, in which the party won 61%, 65% and 75% of the votes respectively. After the 2001 general election, Goh indicated that he would step down as prime minister after leading the country out of the recession.

During an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine in July 2003, Goh surprised Singaporeans by announcing that his government was openly employing homosexuals, even in sensitive jobs, despite homosexual acts remaining illegal under Section 377A of the Penal Code.

=== Senior minister ===
In October 2003, Goh announced that he would step down when the economy recovered from a downturn that was caused by the SARS. Eventually on 12 August 2004, Goh stepped down as prime minister and held a new position as Senior Minister in the Cabinet of his successor, Lee Hsien Loong. On 20 August 2004, Goh assumed the position of Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. After a number of threats of terrorism in Singapore, Goh met local Islamic religious leaders in 2004 and made a visit to Iran, where he met Iranian president Mohammad Khatami and visited local mosques.

Goh subsequently visited other Middle Eastern countries as Senior Minister, with a view to improving diplomatic relationships and thus gaining wider opportunities for Singaporean businesses, especially in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait.

On 1 February 2005, Goh was appointed an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia, Australia&#x27;s highest civilian honour, &quot;for eminent service to Australia-Singapore relations&quot;.

On 19 May 2005, Goh signed a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Israel&#x27;s Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a visit to Israel, superseding the agreement signed in 1971. Improvements in the agreement include enhancements to the withholding tax rate on interest income, which was reduced from 15% to 7%. This would benefit Singaporean businessmen with investments in Israel and vice versa, by ensuring they are not taxed twice.

Goh is a founding patron for the Institute of Policy Studies, a government think tank.

In the 2006 general election, Goh was tasked to help the PAP win back the two opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir. However, he was unsuccessful in this task, as Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong retained their respective wards.

In 2006, Goh was briefly considered for the job of United Nations Secretary-General but he lost out and the job eventually went to Ban Ki-moon.

In 2008, Goh was invited to join the InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government, an independent international organisation of former world leaders.

On 24 January 2011, Goh announced that he would continue to seek re-election to Parliament at the 2011 general election. Over the following months, he progressively released snippets prior to the election on the importance of grooming a successor who could be part of the fourth generation PAP leadership to helm Marine Parade GRC in the long run.

=== Emeritus senior minister ===
After the 2011 general election in which the opposition made unprecedented gains by winning a group representative constituency in (Aljunied), Goh and Lee Kuan Yew announced that they were retiring from the Cabinet in order to give Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the rest of his team a clean slate from which they can make a fresh start in the new parliamentary term.

On 18 May 2011, Lee Hsien Loong announced that Goh was to be appointed a senior adviser to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and would be given the honorary title of &quot;Emeritus Senior Minister&quot;.

On 24 June 2011, Goh was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government.

On 4 May 2012, Goh was appointed as Patron for Advancement of the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

In 2018, Goh&#x27;s first volume authorised biography book titled &quot;Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story&quot; was published. It details Goh&#x27;s life from his childhood to until he took office as Singapore&#x27;s second prime minister in 1990.

In an interview in 2019, Goh stated that he believed a 75% to 80% majority in Parliament, in the future, would constitute a &#x27;strong mandate&#x27; for the Singapore government. In the same interview, he noted that he does not believe the electoral system needed any further tweaking.

On 4 August 2019, Goh made a Facebook post stating that he felt saddened by how his long-time friend, former PAP politician Tan Cheng Bock, had &quot;lost his way&quot; by forming a new political party, Progress Singapore Party (PSP), to contest in the next general election.

On 25 June 2020, Goh made a Facebook post announcing his retirement as a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade GRC after 44 years of service and will therefore retire from politics.

A second volume of his biography titled &quot;Standing Tall: The Goh Chok Tong Years&quot; was released in April 2021 to mark his 80th birthday. The sequel consists of the 14 years which Goh was the Prime Minister of Singapore.

==Honours==
**:
*** Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Johor (11 May 1991)
** Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia (1 February 2005) 
** Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (24 June 2011)

== Personal life ==
Goh is married to Tan Choo Leng and they have a son and a daughter, who are twins. Their son, Goh Jin Hian, is a physician and their daughter, Goh Jin Theng, lives in London with her husband. In his biography &quot;Standing Tall&quot;, Goh described himself as having no religion; he was brought up with traditional Chinese religions and &quot;nominally practise ancestor worship&quot;. His wife is a Tibetan Buddhist while both his children are Methodist Christians.

In December 2020, Goh stated in a Facebook post that he would be undergoing four weeks of radiotherapy following the removal of a lump in his larynx, in order to ensure that all cancer cells are eliminated. It was the latest in a series of health issues faced by Goh in recent years.

In 2021, now retired and talking about his health, Goh indicated that he plans to try to live until at least 93 years of age, much like his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad.

==Legacy==
Having served as prime minister between the Lee Kwan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong eras, Goh has often been referred to in Singaporean political jokes as part of the trinity of &quot;father, son, and the holy Goh&quot;.

In October 2014, the Madame Tussauds Singapore museum unveiled a wax figure of Goh. At its opening, Goh posed for pictures with his statue.

The Goh Chok Tong Enable Awards by Mediacorp Enable Fund is named after him.

<text>Kenneth Clark Loggins (born January 7, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. His early songs were recorded with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1970, which led to seven albums recorded with Jim Messina as Loggins and Messina from 1972 to 1977. His early soundtrack contributions date back to &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; in 1976, and he is known as the &quot;King of the Movie Soundtrack&quot;. As a solo artist, Loggins experienced a string of soundtrack successes, including an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Footloose&quot; in 1985. &quot;Finally Home&quot; was released in 2013, shortly after Loggins formed the group Blue Sky Riders with Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman. He won a Daytime Emmy Award, two Grammy Awards and was nominated for an Academy Award, a Tony Award, and a Golden Globe Award.

== Early life ==
Loggins was born in Everett, Washington, the youngest of three brothers. His father, Robert George Loggins, was a salesman of English and Irish ancestry, while his mother, Lina (née Massie), was a homemaker of Italian descent, from Avezzano. They lived in Detroit and Seattle before settling in Alhambra, California. According to his biography, Loggins was born on the birthday of his brother, Bobby. As such, and allowing him to keep a Christmas promise his father had made his brother, Bobby got to name his new brother Clark Kent Loggins. Later, his first and middle names were flipped, and Kent was changed to Kenneth.

Loggins attended San Gabriel Mission High School, graduating in 1966. He formed a band, The Second Helping, that released three singles during 1968 and 1969 on Viva Records. Greg Shaw described the efforts as &quot;excellent punky folk-pop records&quot; that were written by Loggins who was likely to be the bandleader and singer as well; Shaw included &quot;Let Me In&quot; on both &quot;Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2&quot; and the &quot;Pebbles, Volume 9&quot; CD.

Loggins had a short gig playing guitar for the New Improved Electric Prunes in 1969 before writing four songs for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that were included on their album &quot;Uncle Charlie &amp; His Dog Teddy&quot;. During his early 20s, he was in the band Gator Creek with Mike Deasy. The first recorded version of &quot;Danny&#x27;s Song&quot; (later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No. 7 Hot 100 hit for Anne Murray in 1973) was included on their only album, released on Mercury Records.

== Loggins and Messina ==
Jim Messina, formerly of Poco and Buffalo Springfield, was working as an independent record producer for Columbia Records in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins, then a little-known singer-songwriter who was signed to ABC-Dunhill.

The two recorded a number of Loggins&#x27;s compositions in Messina&#x27;s home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins (with Messina&#x27;s help) to a six-album contract, recording began in earnest for Loggins&#x27;s debut album, with Messina as producer. He assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante (both formerly of the Sunshine Company, a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles), violinist/multireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke. Keyboardist Michael Omartian also played on the album and despite dropping out at the start of the touring, continued to play keyboards on the next two albums. Los Angeles–based session percussionist Milt Holland, described by Messina as an ethnomusicologist, also contributed.

Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina&#x27;s well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. But by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation and vocals that an &quot;accidental&quot; duo was born. Thus the full name of their first album was &quot;Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin&#x27; In&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single release, the Caribbean-flavored &quot;Vahevala&quot;, found top 3 success on WCFL on May 18, 1972.
Although the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually found success by fall 1972, particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily. Loggins and Messina&#x27;s vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity in itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo, Loggins &amp; Messina.

&quot;When our first album, &#x27;Sittin&#x27; In&#x27;, came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales&quot;, Messina recalled in 2005.
Both members of the duo were guitarists: Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin and Dobro. Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio, plus one album of covers of other artists&#x27; material and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates. Their work also included Lynn Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Listen to a Country Song&quot;, which was released in 1972 and reached No. 4 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart, and &quot;Danny&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;A Love Song&quot; for Anne Murray, which reached No. 7 and No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart in 1973 and 1974 respectively. The latter two songs also hit No. 1 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart. Later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership. As they both noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition. Following their January 1976 release of &quot;Native Sons&quot; and a final concert in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 25, 1976, the pair amicably and quietly parted to pursue solo careers. A greatest-hits album, &quot;The Best of Friends&quot;, was released in November 1976. Two months later, a live album, &quot;Finale&quot; was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists, one year after the duo had come to an end.

== Solo career ==

In 1977, Loggins produced his first solo album, &quot;Celebrate Me Home&quot;, which included the successful song &quot;I Believe in Love&quot;, originally sung by Barbra Streisand in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. &quot;Nightwatch&quot;, a popular album released in 1978, included the hit song &quot;Whenever I Call You Friend&quot;, a duet with Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac, co-written with Melissa Manchester. Loggins followed that in 1979 with &quot;Keep the Fire&quot; and in 1982 with &quot;High Adventure&quot;. The latter contained his rock duet with Journey frontman Steve Perry, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot;, which rose to No. 17 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Loggins abandoned the harmonica in his solo career but continued to play guitar, just as he had done with Loggins &amp; Messina.

=== With Michael McDonald ===
Loggins also co-wrote the song &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; with Michael McDonald. Each recorded his own version of it, with McDonald recording as a member of the Doobie Brothers. Loggins&#x27; version was released first, but the Doobie Brothers&#x27; version achieved greater success, reaching No. 1 on the Hot 100 and earning Loggins and McDonald the 1980 Grammy for Song of the Year.

In 1979, Loggins and McDonald wrote &quot;This Is It&quot;, about summoning one&#x27;s inner resources and seizing the moment. As Loggins told &quot;American Songwriter&quot; in 1987, &quot;The best musical statements are usually the ones that aren&#x27;t calculated and the ones that come out in the largest chunks. Michael McDonald and I must have written &#x27;This Is It&#x27; four times. The first three times it was a love song, &#x27;Baby I this, baby I that…,&#x27; and we both said, &#x27;Eh! This is boring. This song is not working as a love song.&#x27; Then I had a fight with my dad when he was going into the hospital because he gave me the feeling that he was ready to check out. He&#x27;d given up, he wasn&#x27;t thinking in terms of the future, and I was so pissed at him. It was real emotional. That afternoon, I was meeting with Michael to work on new tunes and I walked in and said, &#x27;Man, I got it. It&#x27;s &#x27;This Is It.&#x27;&quot;

=== Soundtracks ===
During the next decade, Loggins recorded so many successful songs for film soundtracks that he became known as the King of the Movie Soundtrack. It began with &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; from &quot;Caddyshack&quot;. Hits followed with &quot;Footloose&quot; (his only solo No. 1) and &quot;I&#x27;m Free (Heaven Helps the Man)&quot; from &quot;Footloose&quot;; &quot;Meet Me Half Way&quot; from &quot;Over the Top&quot;; and &quot;Danger Zone&quot; and &quot;Playing with the Boys&quot; from &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Loggins also performed &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; for the film &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;. He performed as a member of USA for Africa on the famine-relief fundraising single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, which led to an appearance performing &quot;Footloose&quot; at the Philadelphia leg of the July 13, 1985, Live Aid famine-relief dual-venue charity concert and global television broadcast.

During the 1990s, Loggins continued his album career, including the popular 1994 children&#x27;s album &quot;Return to Pooh Corner&quot;, which included the title single, a reworking of &quot;House at Pooh Corner&quot;, written for his newborn son Luke.

In 1991, Loggins recorded and produced &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, which included the single &quot;Conviction of the Heart&quot;. Vice President Al Gore called this song &quot;the unofficial anthem of the environmental movement&quot;. On Earth Day 1995, Loggins performed at The National Mall in Washington, D.C., before a live audience of 500,000.

In 1997, Loggins released the album &quot;The Unimaginable Life&quot;, based on a book he co-wrote with his then-wife Julia. Tracks include &quot;Now That I Know Love&quot;, &quot;The Art of Letting Go&quot; and &quot;One Chance at a Time&quot;. The album was produced by Loggins and Randy Jackson with background vocals by Skyler Jett, Lamont VanHook and Howard Smith.

In 1998, Loggins recorded a version of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; song &quot;One Small Voice&quot; for the ABC television special &quot;Elmopalooza&quot;, which was included as a track on the Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album.

=== Other work ===

Loggins scored a No. 1 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart in 1997 with &quot;For the First Time&quot; (his Oscar-nominated song from &quot;One Fine Day&quot;). In 2000, he performed the theme song for Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;, &quot;Your Heart Will Lead You Home&quot;, which he co-wrote with Richard and Robert Sherman.

In 1999, he appeared as himself on the television show &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; in the episode &quot;Tye-Dying the Knot&quot;, performing at Abby and Larry&#x27;s wedding.
In 2004, Loggins appeared as himself in episode three, &quot;Well Well Well,&quot; of Fox TV&#x27;s &quot;Method &amp; Red&quot;. In 2005, Loggins and Messina gave a nationwide tour that resulted in the CD and DVD &quot;Loggins and Messina Sittin&#x27; In Again&quot;. The tour&#x27;s concerts were three hours long with an intermission and included an acoustic set in the middle. Complete with a set change that turned the stage into an old gas station setting, the show had a large IMAG video screen that showed old footage of the band, as well as tribute footage of recently deceased former L&amp;M bandmate Jon Clarke. In 2007, Loggins joined the new recording company 180 Music for the release of his album &quot;How About Now&quot;. That year he was also inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard RockWalk.

In 2009, he recorded a new children&#x27;s album, &quot;All Join In&quot;, but it was not released due to complications with his record company. In 2009 Loggins and Messina toured the United States and Canada, reviving their &quot;Sittin&#x27; In Again tour&quot;. In 2011, he performed a short tour in South East Asia including Manila, Philippines and Singapore. On June 3, 2011, he performed at the Arcada Theater in St. Charles, Illinois. He stopped by the Eddie and Jobo Show in Chicago to talk about his music, his personal life and what kind of show you can expect from him.

The 2016 parody film &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s The Art of the Deal: The Movie&quot; features an original song by Loggins, &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot;, written specifically for the film. In July 2016 Loggins performed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

In January 2017 Loggins was featured with McDonald on Thundercat&#x27;s single &quot;Show You the Way&quot;. Loggins made a cameo appearance as himself in episode 1 of season 3 of the television show &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;.
In October 2018, he received the inaugural Music Icon Award at the San Diego International Film Festival.

On September 22 and 24, 2022, Loggins and Messina reunited at the Hollywood Bowl for a 50-year anniversary weekend celebration of when they played the Bowl supporting their debut album, &quot;Sittin&#x27; In&quot;. The opening set featured songs like &quot;Danny&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;House at Pooh Corner&quot;. Loggins took the second act on his own, performing some of his best-known hits such as &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;, &quot;Footloose&quot;, and &quot;Danger Zone&quot;.

=== Blue Sky Riders ===
Loggins is a member of Blue Sky Riders, a country music trio also featuring Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman. They released their debut album, &quot;Finally Home&quot;, on January 29, 2013. The band released a special pre-release edition of their second studio album, &quot;Why Not&quot;, in 2015 to Kickstarter backers.

== Other media ==

Loggins appears in the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; playing himself as the host of an in-game radio station called Los Santos Rock Radio. He also lends the songs &quot;Danger Zone&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Free (Heaven Helps the Man)&quot; and sings station jingles.

In 2014, Loggins appeared as himself in the episode &quot;Baby Shower&quot; of the fifth season of the animated comedy series &quot;Archer&quot;. His song &quot;Danger Zone&quot; had been a recurring joke in the show. At the end of the episode and during the credits, Loggins also performs a country version of &quot;Danger Zone&quot; as a duet with the character of Cherlene. Loggins stated in a later interview that his in-show nickname &#x27;K-Log&#x27; is a complete creation of the show, stating, &quot;It was always a joke. That&#x27;s why it works, because it&#x27;s so absurd.&quot;

In 2018, Loggins lent his voice to a caricature of himself on the animated comedy series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;Veteran Guy&quot;. He also voiced himself in 2019 in &quot;Yacht Rocky&quot; from season 18 and in 2021 in the episode &quot;80&#x27;s Guy&quot; from season 20.

In 2022, the Mall of America overlayed their Log Chute attraction into the &quot;Kenny Loggins Chute&quot; for April Fools Day, with the animatronic Paul Bunyan being redressed as Loggins.

== Personal life ==
Loggins was married to Eva Ein from 1978 to 1990; they had three children: Crosby, Cody and Isabella. In 2007, the oldest, Crosby Loggins, produced his first CD, &quot;We All Go Home&quot;. In 2008 Crosby Loggins was voted the winner of the MTV reality show &quot;Rock the Cradle&quot;. Cody was born in 1983 and Isabella in 1988. As of 2009, Isabella was a music major in college.

When Loggins experienced health problems in 1982, he was referred to Julia Cooper, a colon therapist. Their relationship was limited to a friendship, but near the end of the 1980s, Loggins separated from his wife at nearly the same time Cooper left her husband. Loggins&#x27;s divorce was made final in 1990 and he and Cooper married in July 1992. In 1994 they became involved with Equinox International, a multi-level marketing organization and created a promotional video for the company, as did Ted Danson and Dave Parker.

The couple had two children: Lukas, born in 1993 and Hana, born in 1997. After several years of marriage, they assembled material from the journals each kept, which included poems, songs and letters. They authored a 1997 book, &quot;The Unimaginable Life&quot;, about their relationship. Its purpose was to offer an alternative to typical relationships where spouses feel they cannot be completely honest. Later on, they faced possible bankruptcy.

The couple divorced in 2004. Loggins said in 2009, &quot;I got pretty blindsided by Julia&#x27;s decision to leave. She&#x27;s a very impulsive woman and she found herself going through a midlife crisis and she didn&#x27;t know what to make of it and it changed her life.&quot;

Loggins has a home in the hills north of Santa Barbara, California, and has lived there for several decades. Loggins is a second cousin to singer-songwriter Dave Loggins.

<text>Pemex (a portmanteau of Petróleos Mexicanos, which translates to &quot;Mexican Petroleum&quot; in English; ) is the Mexican state-owned petroleum corporation managed and operated by the Mexican government. It was formed in 1938 by nationalization and expropriation of all private oil companies in Mexico at the time of its formation. Pemex had total assets worth $101.8 billion in December 2019 and as of 2009 was Latin America&#x27;s second largest enterprise by annual revenue, surpassed only by Petrobras (the Brazilian national oil company). The company is the seventh most polluting in the world according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

== History ==
Asphalt and pitch had been worked in Mexico since the time of the Aztecs. Small quantities of oil were first refined into kerosene around 1876 near Tampico. By the early 20th century, commercial quantities of oil were being extracted and refined by subsidiaries of the British Pearson and American Doheny companies and had attracted the attention of the Mexican government who then claimed all mineral rights for the state as part of its Constitution.

In 1938, President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–40) sided with oil workers striking against foreign-owned oil companies for an increase in pay and social services. On March 18, 1938, citing Article 27 of the Constitution of 1917, President Cárdenas embarked on the state-expropriation of all resources and facilities, nationalizing the United States and Anglo–Dutch operating companies. He is famous in saying in his speech addressing the nation,

&quot;I ask the entire nation to furnish the necessary moral and material support to face the consequences of a decision which we, of our own free will, would neither have sought nor desired.&quot;

Pemex was established by Cárdenas&#x27;s decree of June 7, 1938.

He framed expropriation as a necessary national response to the injustice of the operations of foreign companies operating on Mexican soil. Expropriation was not outright confiscation since the Mexican government promised to compensate companies. However, in retaliation, many foreign governments closed their markets to Mexican oil until the Allies demand for petroleum in World War II caused the boycott to be dropped. In spite of the early boycott, Pemex developed into one of the largest oil companies in the world.

In an interview on the oil news website in November 2005, a Pemex employee spoke anonymously of the company&#x27;s inability to grow production, stating that the company and country is at Hubbert&#x27;s Peak. The person interviewed believed export levels could not be recovered once peak had passed, as the size of current fields that have been discovered or are coming online represent a fraction of the size of the oilfields going into terminal decline. Annual production has dropped each year between 2004 and 2007. Furthermore, it has been reported the 2005–2006 daily oil production was down by approximately (a large proportion of the country&#x27;s 4,500,000 barrels) on the previous year. Pemex averaged 3.71 MMBPD in 2006. Pemex has never produced 4 MMBPD or higher for a yearly average. Pemex was replaced as Latin America&#x27;s largest company by Petrobras, according to a Latin Business Chronicle ranking of Latin America&#x27;s Top 500 companies.

To help capitalize the company, former President Vicente Fox brought forward the possibility of making shares of Pemex available to Mexican citizens and pension funds, to complement a current project-specific investment setup known as &quot;Proyectos de Inversión Diferida En El Registro del Gasto&quot; (Deferred Investment Projects in the Expenditure Registry). The proposal, which intended to alleviate Pemex&#x27;s tax burden and create a substantial budget increase, met opposition in Congress. President Felipe Calderón made clear at the beginning of his presidency that he would try his best to open up the sector to private investment. Pemex is Latin America&#x27;s second-largest company measured by revenues, according to a ranking of the region&#x27;s 500 largest companies by Latin Business Chronicle, behind Brazilian oil company Petrobras. In June 2009, Pemex has asked for an extra $1.5 billion state aid to finance oil fields investments, reported Bloomberg.

President Calderón called for a change in Mexico&#x27;s oil industry after output at Pemex fell at the fastest rate since 1942. His comments came after Petrobras and London-based BP said they made a &quot;giant&quot; oil find of as much as in the Gulf of Mexico, southeast of Houston. According to Mexican Energy Minister Georgina Kessel, Mexico may seek to emulate Brazilian Oil rules that strengthened Petroleo Brasileiro SA as it considers regulation changes to revive the oil industry.

In January 2014, Pemex signed a cooperation agreement with the Russian oil company Lukoil focusing on oil production and field exploration as well as exchange of knowledge in the aforementioned areas, including actions for ecological preservation and environmental protection.

In February 2016, Emilio Lozoya Austin stepped down as CEO of Pemex and was replaced by José Antonio González Anaya.

On November 27, 2017, José Antonio González Anaya was appointed to be the Secretary of Finance and Public Credit. Carlos Alberto Treviño Medina was appointed CEO, sequentially.

In July 2021, it was announced that PEMEX.UL for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution was to be created. Even though Pemex is highly indebted, it is still determined to assist the poor that are affected by the rising energy prices. n a rare turn of events, Pemex saw profits of $719 million in the second quarter of 2021. Also in July 2021, the SENER appointed Pemex as the operator for the Zama oil field which was originally discovered by Talos Energy in 2017. The two companies shall work together for the final development of Zama. In September that year, Talos disputed the governments decision, since Pemex doesn&#x27;t have the required $2 billion for the oil fields development.

With debts still at over $100 billion by September 2021, Pemex and the finance ministry of Mexico&#x27;s relationship was strengthened as the government decided to continue to support the company, but would not change the laws in order to directly reflect their debt. some speculation was made that the government may use International Monetary Fund (IMF) money to lighten Pemex&#x27;s debt. Budget increases of 17% over 2021 amounts were proposed, with a 14% reduction of its profit-sharing duties, for 2022&#x27;s exploration and production processes.

An agreement between Pemex and Braskem (BRKM5.SA) was reached in September 2021 for a new gas supply agreement and also to build a $400 million ethane terminal to be located in Laguna de Pajaritos, in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz.

In October 2021, Pemex was in debt with a recorded loss of $3.7 billion in profits for the third quarter compared to the previous year. In the last quarter of 2021, production was 4.5% higher than that of the last quarter of 2020. Due to tax payments and the currency being weak against the dollar, Pemex still reported a net loss of $6.05 billion. In order to reduce the debt Pemex is working on a plan to domestically refine its oil and reduce exports by 2023.

February 23, 2023, three major fires broke out at three different Mexico and U.S. operated Pemex facilities.

In March 2023, Pemex and U.S. based, Talos Energy submitted to develop an offshore oil field. The two companies have been partnered since 2022. The platform that was submitted was for two offshore platforms and 46 wells with oil and gas from Zama would filter into the Pemex-run terminal at Dos Bocas.

In June 2023, Pemex received bids for the renewal of the Dos Bocas wastewater treatment plant (PTE) which was originally built in 1970 and is no longer capable of treating the oily waters.

Pemex&#x27;s credit rating changed to from stable to negative in July 2023 due to the ongoing debt accumulation. The government assistance from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is said to likely continue until the end of his term in 2024. In September 2023, it was announced that Pemex would receive capital allocations from the federal government of Mexico to assist in paying off over $11 million in accumulated debt.

==Operation==

===Exploration===

Proponents of Calderón&#x27;s energy policy stated that Pemex lacks the equipment, technology and financial means to explore for new reserves in deep water or shale gas; hence, a reform to Mexican law is needed. In addition to a failing infrastructure, dwindling reserves have created urgency in completing some type of reform. Only 20% of Mexico has been extensively explored for further reserves and it has been argued that Pemex will need the help of some form of foreign investment to successfully explore new reserves, including in the Gulf of Mexico.

In February 2015, the board approved a $4.16 billion spending cut, pulling the company&#x27;s budget down 11.5 percent from the 2015 budget approved by Mexico&#x27;s congress. The company also said it will delay deepwater exploration plans and cut jobs in response to weak oil prices. In December 2019, the company stated the discovery of a deposit in southeastern Mexico that could produce 500 million barrels of crude, the largest discovery in more than 30 years.

===Financial status===

Taxes on Pemex revenue provide about a third of all the tax revenues collected by the Mexican government. Pemex has a debt of $42.5 billion, including $24 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. The state-owned company pays out over 60% of its revenue in royalties and taxes. Mexico exports crude oil, but imports more expensive gasoline. National Hydrocarbons Commission, created in 2008 by the Mexican Congress to increase regulatory oversight, has increased scrutiny over Pemex in 2012.

As of July 2019, Pemex is the most indebted oil company in the world.

==Incidents and controversies==
===Incidents===
In 1979, Pemex&#x27;s Ixtoc 1 exploratory oil well in the Bay of Campeche suffered a blowout resulting in one of the largest oil spills in history. Pemex spent $100 million to clean up the spill and avoided most compensation claims by asserting sovereign immunity as a state-run company.

On November 19th, 1984, a series of BLEVE&#x27;s at a Pemex LPG storage facility occur in the heavily populated outskirts of San Juan Ixhuatepec, near Mexico City, resulting in the deaths of around 500-600 residents and up to 7000 injured by the explosions, ensuing fire and shrapnel from exploding tanks. It is considered among the deadliest industrial accidents in world history.

Pemex was blamed for a series of 1992 gas explosions in Guadalajara.

On September 19, 2012, an explosion at the Pemex gas plant in Reynosa, Tamaulipas killed 30 and injured 46 people. Pemex Director Juan Jose Suarez said that there was &quot;no evidence that it was a deliberate incident, or some kind of attack&quot;.

On January 31, 2013, an explosion occurred at the administrative offices of Pemex in Mexico City. At least 37 people were killed and at least 126 were injured. The cause has not been confirmed. Local media reported that machinery exploded in the basement of an administrative center next door to the 52-story Pemex tower.

On April 1, 2015, a fire occurred on platform Abkatun A in the southern Gulf of Mexico which killed 4 workers.

On April 20, 2016, a large explosion and fire at the company&#x27;s Chlorinate 3 plant in Coatzacoalcos killed at least 28 people.

On September 24, 2016, a fire broke out on the oil tanker &quot;Burgos&quot;, off the coast of Boca del Río, Veracruz, forcing all the crew (31 members) to be evacuated safely. The tanker was carrying 80,000 barrels of diesel and 70,000 barrels of gasoline.

On January 18, 2019, an explosion occurred on a pipeline passing through the village of Tlauhuelilpan, Hidalgo killing at least 137 people. Several hundred people were gathering around an illegal pipe drain in order to get fuel. Images of the event shows people collecting fuel with buckets and small containers from a waterfall of gasoline. Military and police forces were present during the event for several hours before the explosion but were unable to stop the people from stealing fuel. The pipeline was not closed on time even after the fuel drain was reported.

On July 2, 2021, a natural gas pipeline owned by Pemex burst in the Gulf of Mexico. The natural gas was then ignited, causing a &quot;fireball&quot; to appear on the water&#x27;s surface. The blaze was extinguished with nitrogen after approximately five hours. With two explosions at offshore platforms during the summer of 2021, Pemex&#x27;s security and maintenance procedures are being questioned.

On August 24, 2021, an oil rig fire killed five workers.

On July 7, 2023, an explosion followed by a fire on the Nohoch Alfa oil platform offshore Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico. The incident was classified as &quot;serious&quot;. There were 180 workers on the platform. Two people were killed, another was missing, several were injured. The platform personnel have been evacuated.

On April 6, 2024, an explosion followed by a fire on the Akal Bravo oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The incident was classified as &quot;serious&quot;. There were 28 workers on the platform. There was one person killed and at least 13 others were injured

===Controversies===
In 2009, the U.S. Justice Department reported that some U.S. refineries had bought millions of dollars&#x27; worth of oil stolen from Mexican government pipelines. Criminals, especially drug gangs, tap remote pipelines and sometimes build their own pipelines to siphon off hundreds of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of oil each year. One oil executive has been charged and has pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges. The U.S. Homeland Security Department will return $2.4 million to Mexico&#x27;s tax administration—the first money seized during a binational investigation into smuggled oil that authorities expect to lead to more arrests and seizures. In 2010 the former president of Houston-based Trammo Petroleum was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $10,000 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to receive stolen goods.

Pemex has a long history of alleged violation of human and labour rights regarding engineers, unrightfully considered to be &quot;trusted workers&quot; who have tried to unionize since 1995 and succeeded, after several repression episodes, in doing so in 2008 and 2009, although at a high human cost. This included the death of a person who was refused medical service at one of Pemex&#x27;s hospitals because his son had just been sacked for belonging to this union, the Unión Nacional de Técnicos y Profesionistas (shorthand UNTyPP). It also included forcing union members to resign from the Union from their hospital beds, as happened to three cancer patients in 2009. Up to date and in spite of pressure by the Mexican Congress, the International Labour Organization, the Global Compact, the Industrial Global Union and thousands of citizens all over the world, workers fired in 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 have not been all reinstated nor has there been any other reparation. Pemex has denied these accusations.

On November 10, 2019, the institution suffered a cyber attack and its computers were infected with DoppelPaymer ransomware.

In November 2021, the arrest of former CEO Carlos Trevino was ordered after he did not show for his hearing, in which he was being charged with criminal association and money laundering. Testimony was presented by other ex-CEO, Emilio Lozoya, who was initially placed in witness protection. In January 2022, Lozoya was formally charged with money laundering, bribery and criminal association, which could amount to 39 years in prison.

====Corruption====

There have been various allegations of corruption in Pemex for over a decade. These range from political contributions to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) (over $200 million), &quot;no show&quot; jobs – individuals who receive a salary while performing no duties – various forms of fraud, embezzlement and even under-the-table fuel sales. It has been estimated these various forms of corruption contribute to the loss of over $1 billion a year.

Odebrecht is a Brazilian conglomerate that like Pemex also operates in the field of petroleum. Back in 2010–2012, Emilio Lozoya Austin was part of the PRI&#x27;s team supporting Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) in his presidential campaign. After EPN won the elections, Lozoya was promoted to director of Pemex, a role in which he served for most of EPN&#x27;s presidency. In 2017, Brazilian newspaper O Globo claimed that Odebrecht helped finance EPN&#x27;s presidential campaign, by giving $10 million to Emilio Lozoya as a bribe during times close to the 2012 elections. Soon after EPN won the elections in 2012, Lozoya became a director of Pemex and Odebrecht &quot;won&quot; huge contracts from Pemex and the Mexican government.

The news of the controversy surfaced in 2017, revealing Lozoya bought a $38 million house with a single payment even before he was named a director of Pemex. Such a house did not fit with his salary at the time. In October 2017, it was confirmed by the presidency that EPN himself also met with Odebrecht four times during his presidential campaign. This directly tied EPN into the scandal, albeit EPN claimed not to have received any bribes. A document from Brazil reported Lozoya received $5 million in November 2014.

Santiago Nieto, in charge of the (FEPADE), an office in charge of investigating electoral crimes, was controversially fired soon after the Odebrecht scandal began. He was said to be receiving too much pressure from EPN and Lozoya to stop the investigation. The firing was criticized by ex-president Felipe Calderon&#x27;s wife and independent 2018 presidential candidate Margarita Zavala.

President Peña Nieto said Santiago&#x27;s restitution fate depended on the Mexican Senate. The organization Borde Politico had published weeks before that 116 out of the 128 Mexican senators were incompetent.

<doc id="286847" wikidata="Q212188" url="?curid=286847" title="S. R. Nathan">
<text>Sellapan Ramanathan (; 3 July 1924 – 22 August 2016), often known as S. R. Nathan, was a Singaporean politician and civil servant who served as the sixth president of Singapore between 1999 and 2011. He was the longest-serving president in Singapore&#x27;s history and the only one to serve two full terms.

In January 2010, Nathan surpassed his predecessor Benjamin Sheares to become Singapore&#x27;s longest-serving President. In August of that same year, he surpassed Yusof Ishak as Singapore&#x27;s longest-serving Head of State. Nathan was reportedly considering a re-election and decided not to run.

Nathan suffered a stroke on 31 July 2016 and was taken to Singapore General Hospital before he died in the hospital on 22 August 2016, at the age of 92.

==Early life and education==
Nathan, who was of Tamil Indian descent, was born in Singapore on 3 July 1924. He spent his childhood with his parents, V. Sellapan and Abirami, and two older brothers in Muar, Johor, in a house overlooking the sea. Nathan would eventually be one of seven siblings; his three older brothers died in childhood. His father had been posted to the Malayan town as a lawyer&#x27;s clerk for a firm that serviced rubber plantations, but the Great Depression and rubber slump of the 1930s sent the family&#x27;s fortunes crashing. Nathan&#x27;s father accrued debts and eventually committed suicide when Nathan was eight.

Returning to Singapore, Nathan received his primary education at Anglo-Chinese Primary School and Rangoon Road morning School, and his secondary education at Victoria School. However, he was expelled from school twice and, after quarrelling with his mother, ran away from home at the age of 16. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Nathan learned Japanese and worked for the Japanese civilian police as a translator. After the war, whilst working, he completed his secondary education through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, and entered the University of Malaya (then in Singapore), where he became the secretary of the University Socialist Club in his second year of university. He graduated in 1954 with a Diploma in Social Studies (Distinction). He earned a diploma from the University of Malaya in Singapore in 1954. This was followed by a long career in the Singapore Civil Service, which he joined in 1955. Between 1962 and 1966 he was seconded to the National Trades Union Congress, and then worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs. He was with the Security and Intelligence Division of the Defence Ministry when the Laju incident happened in 1974, and was among the government officers who agreed to accompany terrorists who had bombed petroleum tanks to Kuwait to secure the release of civilian hostages and ensure the terrorists&#x27; safe passage. He served as First Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Ministry from 1979 to 1982.

Nathan left the Civil Service in 1982 to take up the executive chairmanship of the Straits Times Press; he also held directorships in other companies. Between 1988 and 1996 he served as Singapore&#x27;s High Commissioner to Malaysia and Ambassador to the United States, before his 12-year term as President of the Republic from 1999 to 2011.

Following retirement, Nathan turned to writing and also became a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the School of Social Sciences of Singapore Management University (SMU), and at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. He died in 2016 and was accorded a state funeral by the Government.

Among the awards and honours Nathan received were the renamed of Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) School of Human Development and Social Services to S R Nathan School of Human Development (NSHD) in 2018, &quot;Bintang Bakti Masyarakat&quot; (Public Service Star) in 1964, the &quot;Pingat Pentadbiran Awam&quot; (Perak) (Public Administration Medal, Silver) in 1967, the &quot;Pingat Pentadbiran Awam&quot; (Meritorious Service Medal) in 1975, and the &quot;Darjah Utama Temasek&quot; (Order of Temasek) (First Class) in 2013; and honorary degrees from the National University of Singapore and SMU.

==Civil Service career==
Nathan began his career in the Singapore Civil Service as a medical social worker in 1955. He was appointed Seamen&#x27;s Welfare Officer the following year. In 1962, he was seconded to the Labour Research Unit of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), first as assistant director and later as director of the Labour Research Unit until January 1966. Nathan negotiated Singapore&#x27;s membership of the Afro-Asian People&#x27;s Solidarity Organisation. He later served as a member of the NTUC&#x27;s Board of Trustees from 1983 to April 1988.

In February 1966, Nathan was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served as Assistant Secretary and rose to be Deputy Secretary before being appointed Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs in January 1971. On 6 August of the same year, Nathan moved to the Ministry of Defence where he was Director of the Security and Intelligence Division (SID). In the Laju incident on 31 January 1974, members of the terrorist Japanese Red Army and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine bombed petroleum tanks on Pulau Bukom off the coast of Singapore; Nathan was among a group of government officers who volunteered to be held hostage by the JRA and flown to Kuwait to secure the release of civilian hostages and ensure the terrorists&#x27; safe passage. For his bravery, in August 1974 he was awarded the &quot;Pingat Jasa Gemilang&quot; (Meritorious Service Medal).

In February 1979, Nathan returned to the Foreign Ministry and became its First Permanent Secretary until February 1982, when he left to become the Executive Chairman of the newspaper company the Straits Times Press. The appointment was viewed dimly by journalists who felt that the Government was trying to limit freedom of the press; they wore black armbands in protest. According to Nathan in a 2010 interview, &quot; When they saw I was not doing what they expected me to do, they began to have confidence.&quot; At various times between 1982 and 1988, Nathan also held directorships of several other companies, including the Singapore Mint, The Straits Times Press (London), Singapore Press Holdings and Marshall Cavendish. He held a directorship in the Singapore International Media between September 1996 and August 1999. He was Chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Singapore, a ship-repairing and engineering joint venture with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan, from 1973 to 1986. From 1983 to April 1988, Nathan was Chairman of the Hindu Endowments Board. He was a founding member of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and its term trustee until August 1999.

In April 1988, Nathan was appointed Singapore&#x27;s High Commissioner to Malaysia, and in July 1990 he became Ambassador to the United States, serving until June 1996. On his return, Nathan was made an Ambassador-at-Large and was concurrently Director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at the Nanyang Technological University. He resigned as ambassador and director of the institute on 17 August 1999 to become an independent candidate in the 1999 Singapore presidential election.

==Presidency (1999–2011)==
During the 1999 presidential election, as two other prospective candidates were found to be constitutionally ineligible, Nathan was elected unopposed as president on 18 August 1999 and was &quot;ex officio&quot; appointed Chancellor of the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University.

His candidacy was supported by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former President Wee Kim Wee. Nathan succeeded Ong Teng Cheong as the president of Singapore, and was sworn in on 1 September 1999.

Nathan launched the annual President&#x27;s Challenge charity fundraising initiative in 2000. Continued in 2012 by his successor, President Tony Tan, and as of 2016 about S$160 million had been raised by the movement.

During the 2005 presidential election, the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC) declared Nathan as the only eligible candidate on 13 August, rejecting three other applications based on constitutional criteria. Thus, Nathan was elected unopposed for a second term on 17 August 2005. He was sworn in for a second term of office on 1 September 2005, and as of 2016, is the only person who has served two terms as president.

On 21 January 2009, Nathan approved in principle the Government&#x27;s request to draw $4.9 billion from the nation&#x27;s past financial reserves to fund the Government&#x27;s Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the Great Recession: the Jobs Credit scheme, which provided employers with financial assistance to pay employees&#x27; salaries; and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative, which helped mid-sized companies to obtain credit. This was the first time the President&#x27;s discretionary powers had been exercised for this purpose. The President&#x27;s formal approval of the drawdown was subsequently signified in two notifications dated 13 March 2009.

==Post–presidency (2011–2016)==
On 1 July 2011, Nathan announced that he would not be seeking a third term in office as president. He cited his age as one of the reasons, as he did not believe he could undertake indefinitely the heavy responsibilities and physical demands of the position of head of state at 87. He left office on 1 September that same year and was succeeded by Tony Tan. A few weeks later, on 19 September, his book &quot;An Unexpected Journey: Path to the Presidency&quot; was launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. At the same time, the S. R. Nathan Educational Upliftment Fund was inaugurated to provide bursaries, scholarships and other forms of financial assistance to needy Institute of Technical Education, polytechnic and university students.

As President, Nathan was the patron of Singapore Management University from 2000 to 2011, and after completing his term of office he became a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the SMU School of Social Sciences. Additionally, he was also a patron of the Singapore University of Social Sciences from 2006 to 2011. He held a similar position at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. He was also the first patron of the Inter-Religious Organisation from 2012 till his death in 2016.

==Personal life==
On 15 December 1958, Nathan married Urmila Nandey (born 1929) and had one son and one daughter.

==Illness and death==
Nathan suffered a stroke on the morning of 31 July 2016 and was taken to Singapore General Hospital&#x27;s Intensive Care Unit. He died in hospital on 22 August that year at 9:48 pm SST, aged 92. He was survived by his wife Urmila Nandey (known as Umi), their daughter Juthika and son Osith, three grandchildren, and his sister Sundari.

As a mark of respect, the Government directed that the National Flag would fly at half-mast from all government buildings from 23 to 26 August. Nathan&#x27;s body lay in state at Parliament House on 25 August to enable members of the public to pay their respects.

On 26 August, a state funeral was held to honour Nathan. His body was conveyed by a ceremonial 25-pounder gun carriage from Parliament House to the University Cultural Centre of the National University of Singapore (NUS). The state funeral procession passed by landmarks of significance to his life, including City Hall, where he had attended three National Day Parades; The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, formerly the Fullerton Building which had housed the Marine Department where he had worked; and NTUC Centre, recalling Nathan&#x27;s time in the labour movement. Speakers who delivered eulogies at the state funeral included Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Ambassadors-at-Large Tommy Koh and Gopinath Pillai. The music played at the ceremony included the song &quot;Thanjavooru Mannu Eduthu&quot; (&quot;Taking the Sands of Thanjavur&quot;) from the Tamil film &quot;Porkkaalam&quot; (&quot;Golden Age&quot;, 1997), about a dollmaker who moulds a doll of a beautiful lady with sand, clay and water from different lands, and eventually gives life to the doll. It was Nathan&#x27;s favourite song as he saw it as a metaphor for Singapore&#x27;s multiracial heritage.

The state funeral was followed by a private cremation at Mandai Crematorium.

==Legacy==
*In 2018, the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) School of Human Development and Social Services has renamed the S R Nathan School of Human Development (NSHD) in honor of Singapore&#x27;s sixth president, Mr S. R. Nathan to recognise his advocacy of social and community causes when he was patron of SUSS.

==Honours==
In addition to the &quot;Pingat Jasa Gemilang&quot; (Meritorious Service Medal) he was awarded in 1975 for his actions during the Laju incident, Nathan was conferred the &quot;Bintang Bakti Masyarakat&quot; (Public Service Star) in 1964 and the &quot;Pingat Pentadbiran Awam&quot; (&quot;Perak&quot;) (Public Administration Medal, Silver) in 1967. On 8 August 2013, Nathan was conferred the &quot;Darjah Utama Temasek&quot; (Order of Temasek) (First Class). On 2006 he was conferred with Order of the Bath.

Nathan, who had been chancellor of NUS from 1999 to 2011 during his presidency, was conferred an Eminent Alumni award by the university in 2007, and an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) on 5 July 2012. SMU also conferred on him an honorary D.Litt. on 14 July 2014. In 2015, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of NUS gave him its Distinguished Arts and Social Sciences Alumni Award for lifetime achievement.

Nathan was the Singapore Scout Association&#x27;s Chief Scout when he was president. He received the Asia-Pacific Regional Distinguished Scout Award in 2005, and the Association&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award (Gold) in 2010.

Nathan&#x27;s achievements were also recognised abroad. During a state visit to Bahrain on 22 November 2010 he was given the Al-Khalifa Order, and while on a state visit to Mauritius in June 2011 he was conferred an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Mauritius for his contributions to education and culture.

<text>Holy Smoke! is a 1999 independent romantic comedy drama film directed by Jane Campion, and starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. The plot follows an American exit counselor (Keitel) who attempts to deprogram a young Australian woman (Winslet) who has been indoctrinated into a new age cult in India. Julie Hamilton, Tim Robertson, Daniel Wyllie, and Pam Grier appear in supporting roles.

Director Jane Campion wrote the screenplay for the film with her sister, Anna Campion. The film was a co-production between Australia and the United States. The film premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival and was shown at the New York Film Festival and the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival before being released theatrically.

==Plot==
During a trip to India, Ruth Barron has a spiritual awakening and embraces the teachings of a guru named Baba. Back home in the Sydney suburb of Sans Souci, her parents are appalled to learn their daughter now answers to the name Nazni and has no intention of returning. They concoct a tale about her father Gilbert having had a stroke and being on the verge of death, and her mother Miriam travels to India in hopes of persuading her to come home, with no success until she suffers a serious asthma attack. Ruth agrees to accompany her to Australia on her return flight.

Meanwhile, Miriam has arranged a phony reunion with Gilbert in the Outback, claiming to Ruth that he is recuperating there. Gilbert, as well as Ruth&#x27;s brothers Robbie—along with his promiscuous wife Yvonne—and Tim—along with his male lover, Yani—all convene at a nearby resort. There, they meet with P.J. Waters, a famous American exit counselor who deprograms members of religious cults. Ruth arrives, and goes to visit her father at a farm; there, she is confronted by her family along with P.J., who have staged an intervention. Ruth is defiant and attempts to fight them, but ultimately relents and agrees to accompany P.J. for a treatment session, under the provision that she may return to India once they have finished.

Ruth departs with P.J. to a remote cabin where he isolates her and begins to challenge her faith in Baba, exposing that Baba&#x27;s doctrines have been directly copied from Hinduism. During the first night, Yvonne, who is staying nearby, arrives to bring a change of clothes for Ruth, and performs oral sex on P.J. The following morning, Ruth is angered when she finds P.J. has strung her sari up in a tree, and retaliates by forming a &quot;HELP&quot; signal out of stones. Later, P.J. takes Ruth to visit her family, and they all screen a documentary exposing the tactics of cults, including the Manson family, Heaven&#x27;s Gate, and the Rajneesh.

That night, after returning to the cabin, P.J. awakens to find a distressed, naked Ruth has lit the tree and her sari on fire. Ruth propositions P.J., and the two have sex; Ruth asks P.J. &quot;Don&#x27;t come, don&#x27;t come&quot;, but P.J. still comes. In the morning, Yvonne, Tim, and Yani arrive to bring Ruth to a party, which P.J. accompanies her on. When they return, a drunken Ruth insults P.J.&#x27;s manhood before ordering him to perform oral sex on her. The next morning, P.J&#x27;s assistant and lover, Carol, arrives from the United States, chastising him for screening her phone calls, and demanding he return home. She ultimately agrees to the deprogramming session lasting one more day. Ruth begins to taunt P.J. and emasculates him by making him wear a dress, but relents when he responds by writing the phrase &quot;Be Kind&quot; on her forehead; she is suddenly overcome with guilt and begins crying, confessing that she does not allow anyone to become emotionally close to her.

Ruth decides to leave, but P.J., who believes himself to be in love with her, attempts to stop her. The two have a physical altercation in which he punches her, knocking her unconscious. P.J. leaves with an unconscious Ruth in the boot of his car. On the road, he encounters Tim, Robbie, and Yvonne en route to the cabin. P.J. tells them Ruth has fled, and that they should separate and search for her. Yvonne insists she accompany P.J., who reluctantly allows her in the car. As they drive, Yvonne hears Ruth banging on the lid of the boot, and orders him to stop the car. She lets Ruth out of the boot, and she begins running into the bush, with P.J. pursuing her on foot, proclaiming his love for her. P.J. eventually collapses of exhaustion in the heat, and has a vision of Ruth as the Durga before Yvonne, Tim, and Robbie come to his and Ruth&#x27;s aid. Ruth departs with Yvonne, Tim, and Robbie, along with P.J., whom they place in the bed of the truck. During the drive, Ruth asks them to stop the truck. She gets into the bed with P.J., and comforts him.

A year later, Ruth writes to P.J. from Jaipur, where she is now living with her mother, after her father left her for his secretary. Ruth explains to P.J. that she is still seeking spirituality, and has recently completed reading the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. She now has a boyfriend, but confesses she still loves P.J. &quot;from afar.&quot; Back in the United States, P.J. responds to Ruth, explaining that he and Carol now have twin sons, though he too confesses a love for her.

==Cast==
==Production ==
The film was made on location in Paharganj in Delhi and Pushkar in India and Sydney and Hawker in the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. Interiors were filmed at Fox Studios Australia.

Angelo Badalamenti&#x27;s soundtrack is performed by artists including Annie Lennox, Alanis Morissette, Burt Bacharach, Neil Diamond and Chloe Goodchild.

==Release==
===Box office===
In the United States, the film was initially given a limited release on 3 December 1999, earning $33,307 its opening weekend. The release expanded to a total of 93 cinemas, ultimately grossing $1,758,780 at the U.S. box office. The film earned a further $1,380,029 during its theatrical release in Australia. The film&#x27;s worldwide box office gross totaled $3,580,723.

===Critical response===
&quot;Holy Smoke!&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, holding a 46% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 82 reviews. The critical consensus on the website reads, &quot;Superb performances hindered by weak script and incoherent story.&quot; On Metacritic, it receives an average score of 57 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin said, &quot;As &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into [the] more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble . . . the screenplay . . . threatens to become heavy-handedly ideological beneath its outward whimsy . . . it turns out to be more fundamentally conventional than might be expected . . . Shot so beautifully by Dion Beebe that it seems bathed in divine light, [the film] has a sensual allure that transcends its deep-seated ponderousness. The richly colored Indian scenes have a hallucinogenic magic, while exquisite desert vistas radiate an attunement with nature. And the steamily claustrophobic look of the intense scenes between Ms. Winslet and Keitel have an eroticism that will not surprise viewers of &quot;The Piano&quot;.&quot;

In his review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 and a half stars out of 4. He observed, &quot;It&#x27;s a little surprising, although not boring, when it turns from a mystic travelogue into a feminist parable . . . Winslet and Keitel are both interesting in the film, and indeed Winslet seems to be following Keitel&#x27;s long-standing career plan, which is to go with intriguing screenplays and directors and let stardom take care of itself . . . A smaller picture like this, shot out of the mainstream, has a better chance of being quirky and original. And quirky it is, even if not successful.&quot;

In &quot;Variety&quot;, David Rooney stated, &quot;Original in every sense, this often difficult film about family, relationships, sexual politics, spiritual questing, faith and obsession further explores the director&#x27;s abiding fascinations in excitingly unconventional terms. Mainstream audiences may be unwilling to surrender to the pull of a unique journey that strips away its characters&#x27; masks and refuses easy solutions, and many men especially will find it too confronting. But others will embrace its thematic and stylistic complexity as qualities all too rare in contemporary cinema.&quot;

Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Holy Smoke&quot; sometimes has the mentality, for better or worse, of an encounter group. It also has a terrific subject and the spirit to bring it off.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the Venice Film Festival, Jane Campion and Kate Winslet won the Elvira Notari Prize. Campion was nominated for the Golden Lion but lost to Zhang Yimou for &quot;Not One Less&quot;.

<doc id="286851" wikidata="Q611672" url="?curid=286851" title="Larry McMurtry">
<text>Larry Jeff McMurtry (June 3, 1936March 25, 2021) was an American novelist, essayist, and screenwriter whose work was predominantly set in either the Old West or contemporary Texas. His novels included &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot; (1962), &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1966), and &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1975), which were adapted into films. Films adapted from McMurtry&#x27;s works earned 34 Oscar nominations (13 wins). He was also a prominent book collector and bookseller.

His 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; was adapted into a television miniseries that earned 18 Emmy Award nominations (seven wins). The subsequent three novels in his &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series were adapted as three more miniseries, earning eight more Emmy nominations. McMurtry and co-writer Diana Ossana adapted the screenplay for &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), which earned eight Academy Award nominations with three wins, including McMurtry and Ossana for Best Adapted Screenplay. In 2014, McMurtry received the National Humanities Medal.

In Tracy Daugherty&#x27;s 2023 biography of McMurtry, the biographer quotes critic Dave Hickey as saying about McMurtry: &quot;Larry is a writer, and it&#x27;s kind of like being a critter. If you leave a cow alone, he&#x27;ll eat grass. If you leave Larry alone, he&#x27;ll write books. When he&#x27;s in public, he may say hello and goodbye, but otherwise he is just resting, getting ready to go write.&quot;

==Early life and education==
McMurtry&#x27;s birth certificate states that he was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, the son of Hazel Ruth (née McIver) and William Jefferson McMurtry. He grew up on his parents&#x27; ranch outside Archer City, Texas. The city was the model for the town of Thalia which is a setting for much of his fiction. He earned a BA from the University of North Texas in 1958 and an MA from Rice University in 1960.

In his memoir, McMurtry said that during his first five or six years in his grandfather&#x27;s ranch house, there were no books, but his extended family would sit on the front porch every night and tell stories. In 1942, McMurtry&#x27;s cousin Robert Hilburn stopped by the ranch house on his way to enlist for World War II, and left a box containing 19 boys&#x27; adventure books from the 1930s. The first book he read was &quot;Sergeant Silk: The Prairie Scout&quot;.

==Career==

===Writer===
During the 1960–1961 academic year, McMurtry was a Wallace Stegner Fellow at the Stanford University Creative Writing Center, where he studied the craft of fiction under Frank O&#x27;Connor and Malcolm Cowley, alongside other aspiring writers, including Wendell Berry, Ken Kesey, Peter S. Beagle, and Gurney Norman. (Wallace Stegner was on sabbatical in Europe during McMurtry&#x27;s fellowship year.)

McMurtry and Kesey remained friends after McMurtry left California and returned to Texas to take a year-long composition instructorship at Texas Christian University. In 1963, he returned to Rice University, where he served as a lecturer in English until 1969, and a visiting professor at George Mason College (1970) and American University (1970–71). He entertained some of his early students with accounts of Hollywood and the filming of &quot;Hud&quot;, for which he was consulting. In 1964, Kesey and his Merry Pranksters conducted their noted cross-country trip, stopping at McMurtry&#x27;s home in Houston. The adventure in the day-glo-painted school bus &quot;Furthur&quot; was chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;. That same year, McMurtry was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.

McMurtry won numerous awards from the Texas Institute of Letters: three times the Jesse H. Jones Award—in 1962, for &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot;; in 1967, for &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, which he shared with Tom Pendleton&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Orchard&quot;; and in 1986, for &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. He won the Amon G. Carter award for periodical prose in 1966 for &quot;Texas: Good Times Gone or Here Again?&quot; and the Lon Tinkle Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1984. In 1986, McMurtry received the annual Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award from the Tulsa Library Trust. He reflected on his 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, in &quot;Literary Life: A Second Memoir&quot; (2009), writing that it was the &quot;&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; of the West … a pretty good book; it&#x27;s not a towering masterpiece.&quot;

McMurtry described his method for writing novels in &quot;Books: A Memoir&quot;. He said that from his first novel on, he would get up early and dash off five pages of narrative. When he published the memoir in 2008, he said this was still his method, although by then, he wrote 10 pages a day. He also wrote every day, ignoring holidays and weekends. McMurtry was a regular contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

McMurtry was a vigorous defender of free speech and, while serving as president of PEN American Center (now PEN America) from 1989 to 1991, led the organization&#x27;s efforts to support writer Salman Rushdie, whose novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988) caused a major controversy among some Muslims, with the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issuing a &quot;fatwā&quot; calling for Rushdie&#x27;s assassination, after which attempts were made on his life.

In 1989, McMurtry testified on behalf of PEN America before the U.S. Congress in opposition to immigration rules in the 1952 McCarran–Walter Act that for decades permitted the visa denial and deportation of foreign writers for ideological reasons. He recounted how before PEN America was to host the 1986 International PEN Congress, &quot;there was a serious question as to whether such a meeting could in fact take place in this country... the McCarran–Walter Act could have effectively prevented such a gathering in the United States.&quot; He denounced the relevant rules as &quot;an affront to all who cherish the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and association. To a writer whose living depends upon the uninhibited interchange of ideas and experiences, these provisions are especially appalling.&quot; Subsequently, some provisions that excluded certain classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs were revoked by the Immigration Act of 1990.

===Antiquarian bookstore businesses===
While at Stanford, McMurtry became a rare-book scout. During his years in Houston, he managed a book store called the Bookman. In 1969, he moved to the Washington, D.C., area. In 1970 with two partners, he started a bookshop in Georgetown, which he named Booked Up. In 1988, he opened another Booked Up in Archer City. It became one of the largest antiquarian bookstores in the United States, carrying between 400,000 and 450,000 titles. Citing economic pressures from Internet bookselling, McMurtry came close to shutting down the Archer City store in 2005, but chose to keep it open after great public support.

In early 2012, McMurtry decided to downsize and sell off the greater portion of his inventory. He felt the collection was a liability for his heirs. The auction was conducted on August 10 and 11, 2012, and was overseen by Addison and Sarova Auctioneers of Macon, Georgia. This epic book auction sold books by the shelf, and was billed as &quot;The Last Booksale&quot;, in keeping with the title of McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. Dealers, collectors, and gawkers came out &quot;en masse&quot; from all over the country to witness this historic auction. As stated by McMurtry on the weekend of the sale, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen that many people lined up in Archer City, and I&#x27;m sure I never will again.&quot;

In April 2006, McMurtry was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

===Film and television===
McMurtry became well known for the film adaptations of his work, which were seen by many viewers, especially &quot;Hud&quot; (from the novel &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot;), starring Paul Newman and Patricia Neal; the Peter Bogdanovich–directed &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;; James L. Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture (1984); and &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, which became a popular television miniseries starring Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall.

In 2006, he was co-winner (with Diana Ossana) of both the Best Screenplay Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, adapted from a short story by E. Annie Proulx. He accepted his Oscar while wearing a dinner jacket over jeans and cowboy boots. In his speech, he promoted books, reminding the audience the movie was developed from a short story. In his Golden Globe acceptance speech, he paid tribute to his Swiss-made Hermes 3000 typewriter.

==Personal life==
McMurtry married Jo Scott, an English professor who has authored five books. Before divorcing, they had a son together, James McMurtry. Both James and his own son, Curtis McMurtry, are singer/songwriters and guitarists.

In 1991 McMurtry underwent heart surgery. During his recovery, he suffered severe depression. He recovered at the home of his future writing partner Diana Ossana and wrote his novel &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; at her kitchen counter.

McMurtry married Norma Faye Kesey, the widow of writer Ken Kesey, on April 29, 2011, in a civil ceremony in Archer City.

McMurtry died on March 25, 2021, at his home in Tucson, Arizona. He was 84 years old.

It was announced in early 2023 that McMurtry&#x27;s personal property including his writing desk, typewriters and personal book collection would be sold at public auction by Vogt Auction in San Antonio, Texas, on May 29, 2023.

<doc id="286852" wikidata="Q947262" url="?curid=286852" title="A Kid in King Arthur's Court">
<text>A Kid in King Arthur&#x27;s Court is a 1995 adventure comedy fantasy film directed by Michael Gottlieb (in his final directorial film before his death in 2014). It is loosely based on the Mark Twain 1889 novel &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, previously filmed by Disney as &quot;Unidentified Flying Oddball&quot; in 1978. The film stars Thomas Ian Nicholas, Joss Ackland and Art Malik, and is notable for being one of the first film roles of Daniel Craig and Kate Winslet.

==Plot==
In the Los Angeles suburb of Reseda, 14-year-old Calvin Fuller is at a baseball game, standing at bat for his team, the Knights, ready for yet another strike out. Suddenly an earthquake hits; as the others run for safety, the ground opens up under Calvin&#x27;s shoes and he falls through the chasm. He eventually lands on the head of a 6th-century black knight. Upon hearing of his miraculous appearance, the elderly King Arthur, seeing him as the savior whose appearance Merlin has predicted, dubs him &quot;Calvin of Reseda&quot; and invites him to dine with the court.

Calvin begins his knight training under Arthur&#x27;s top knight, Sir Kane, to help Arthur retain his crown. When the earthquake hit, Calvin had just grabbed his knapsack, a fact that enables him to dazzle the people of Camelot with his futuristic &quot;magic&quot;, including an introduction to rock and roll via CD player, a Swiss Army knife, and inline roller skates. His work wins him adulation and renown, but it also rouses the jealousy and disdain of Arthur’s advisor Lord Belasco, who is secretly scheming to take over the throne. Meanwhile, Calvin finds himself spending time and developing a crush on young Princess Katey, while her elder sister, Sarah, is secretly in love with Sir Kane. Belasco moves forward with his plans and kidnaps Katey and tries to frame Calvin for murder and tells Sarah that if she does not marry him, Katey will die. As Belasco is about to arrest Calvin, Sarah rescues him, tells him Katey is alive and to find her father and show him the proof. Calvin goes to Arthur and shows the proof of Belasco&#x27;s scheme. Playing along, Arthur misdirects the knights and helps Calvin escape and they disguise themselves to go rescue Katey.

Walking amongst the people, Calvin tells Arthur that Belasco has been stealing from them for years and they think Arthur does not care about them, and Arthur vows to be a better king. Calvin and Arthur find the castle Katey is being held captive; during the fight, Calvin renews Arthur&#x27;s will to fight by giving him Excalibur (gifted to Calvin by Merlin). They release Katey, but Belasco&#x27; second-in-command, Richard, kidnaps her again and holds her hostage over the moat. Calvin uses a laser pointer from his CD player to blind Richard, causing him to fall and save Katey. Arthur knights Calvin as a Knight of the Round Table and arrive back in Camelot to stop Belasco from forcing Sarah into marriage. To take Belasco down for good, Arthur holds a jousting tournament for Sarah&#x27;s hand.

During the tournament, Sir Kane defeats all the opponents and just him and Belasco are in the finals. Belasco uses a magnifying crystal to use the sunlight to beam it into Kane&#x27;s eyes and nearly knock him out. Sarah runs off in anger and Calvin asks Arthur to stall Belasco. Belasco is close to declaring his victory if Kane does not return, but Kane does return and faces him in another joust; Belasco knocks Kane&#x27;s helmet off, but the now headless Kane still jousts and makes a comeback victory by knocking Belasco off his horse. However, it is not Kane, but Calvin, who pokes his head out from the large armor. Belasco pulls Calvin off the horse and tries to kill him, but the black knight that Calvin encountered earlier appears and ambushes Belasco, saving Calvin. Forfeiting his victory to the black knight, Calvin, Arthur, and all of Camelot are surprised to see the knight is Sarah herself; an astounded but happy Arthur rewards his daughter with the right to choose her own hand in marriage, and she proudly chooses Kane. Belasco is banished from Camelot forever.

Now that he has helped Arthur keep the Crown, Calvin has Merlin uphold his end of the bargain and send him home, and he sadly bids Arthur and Katey farewell. He is returned to the 20th century just before the moment when he struck out. Once he steps up to the plate, this time, he is ready and hits a home run. He is greeted by his teammates, including Katey, and is looked on by Arthur, who is whittling a piece of wood with a pocketknife – the same knife Calvin gave to him. The ball meanwhile sails into a chasm where Merlin catches Calvin’s home run and then breaks the fourth wall by stating &quot;Taught that kid everything he knows.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
Most of the 6th-century portion of the film was shot in Budapest, Hungary, while the majority of the 20th-century portion was filmed in late September 1994, at the softball field of London Central High School (LCHS), an American institution at RAF Daws Hill, High Wycombe, England.

==Release==
The film was theatrically released in North America on August 11, 1995. It was accompanied in theaters by Walt Disney Feature Animation&#x27;s short film &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse.

==Reception==
Upon its release, the movie was universally panned by critics. It currently holds a rating of 5% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Disappointing even by the relaxed standards of live-action children&#x27;s entertainment, &quot;A Kid in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; stands as a rare near-total misfire from Disney.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Since its release, and since Kate Winslet and Daniel Craig went on to become major superstars in Hollywood, the film received slightly more attention. Despite the negative reviews, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; replied &quot;A must-see for the whole family!&quot;

===Box office===
The movie debuted at No. 9. In the movie&#x27;s second week it fell to No. 10.

==Sequel==
A sequel titled &quot;A Kid in Aladdin&#x27;s Palace&quot; was released in 1998 as a direct-to-video with Nicholas reprising his role as Calvin Fuller. The cast also included Rhona Mitra as Scheherazade, Nicholas Irons as Ali Baba, James Faulkner as Luxor, Taylor Negron as the Genie, Aharon Ipalé as Aladdin and Diana Kent as Jasmine.

<text>The Universiti Malaya (lit &#x27;University of Malaya&#x27;; abbreviated UM) is a public research university located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is the oldest and highest ranking Malaysian institution of higher education, and was the only university in newly independent Malaya. The university has graduated five prime ministers of Malaysia, and other political, business, and cultural figures of national prominence.

The predecessor of the university, King Edward VII College of Medicine, was established on 28 September 1905 in Singapore, then a territory of the British Empire. In October 1949, the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College created the university. Rapid growth during its first decade caused the university to organize as two autonomous divisions on 15 January 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur. In 1960, the governments of Malaya and Singapore indicated that these two divisions should become autonomous and separate national universities. One branch was located in Singapore, becoming the University of Singapore (merging into the National University of Singapore in 1980) after the independence of Singapore from Malaysia, and the other branch was located in Kuala Lumpur, retaining the name &quot;Universiti Malaya&quot;. Legislation was passed in 1961 and the Universiti Malaya was established on 1 January 1962. In 2012, UM was granted autonomy by the Ministry of Higher Education. The university also collaborated with the University of Wales in 2013 to establish International University of Malaya-Wales (IUMW), a private university in Malaysia.

Today, UM has more than 2,300 faculty members and is divided into fourteen faculties, two academies, three institutes and two academic centres. In the latest QS World University Rankings, UM is currently ranked 60th in the world, 11th in Asia, 3rd in Southeast Asia and the highest ranked learning institution in Malaysia.

== History ==
===King Edward VII College of Medicine===

The establishment of the university began with the issue of shortage of medical assistants in Singapore and Penang during the late 1890s. The problem was addressed in a report published by the Education Commission in April 1902. The report stated that the commission was in favour of establishing a medical school to fulfil the demand for medical assistants in government hospitals. However, such a view was not in favour among the European community.

Legislation was passed by the Straits Legislative Council in June 1905 under Ordinance No. XV 1905. The school opened on 3 July 1905 and began functioning in September. On 28 September 1905, Sir John Anderson officiated the school under the name &#x27;The Straits and Federated Malay States Government Medical School.&#x27;

The school was located in the old Female Lunatic Asylum near the Singapore General Hospital at Sepoy Lines off New Bridge Road, where four of the asylum buildings were converted into a medical school. In 1907, a lecture hall and laboratory were added. There were no library and room to keep pathological specimens.

In 1905, there were 17 medical students, four students attending the hospital assistant course. Five years later, the enrolments increased to 90 medical students and 30 trainee hospital assistants. The school had only one permanent staff which was the Principal, the teaching staff were employed on a part-time basis. The Principal was Dr Gerald Dudley Freer, who previously served as Senior Colonial Surgeon Resident of Penang.

The School Council wanted to gain recognition of its Diploma by the General Council of Medical Education in the United Kingdom to ensure that the Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery Diploma offered by the school would gain worldwide recognition. In 1916, the GCME recognised the Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery Diploma offered by the school. The licentiates were placed on the General Council&#x27;s Colonial List of the British Medical Register and were entitled to practise anywhere within the British Empire.

In 1910, Dr Robert Donald Keith became the second Principal of the School. The first two years of the five-year course were devoted to pure science studies. Physics, biology and chemistry were taught in the first year, followed by physiology and elementary anatomy in the second year. The remaining three years were attachment to clinical clerkships in medicine, surgery and midwifery, which covered pathology, hygiene and medical jurisprudence. Materia Medica was integrated into the fourth year, where practical pharmacy was taught.

Students were posted to several hospitals, initially at the Singapore General Hospital. From 1908 onwards, attachments were made to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (for medicine and surgery) and Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital (for midwifery).

In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from the King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Dr Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to the King Edward VII School of Medicine.

In the first batch of 16 students of 1905, only seven made to the final and graduated in May 1910 while the remaining six students graduated in four months later and others resigned from the school. In 1919, the drop-out rate had risen to 35%, while in 1939 the number of students failed in their final examinations stood at 44%.

At this time a hostel was built to accommodate 72 male students from the Federated Malay States.

In 1921, the school was elevated in status to college. Between 1920 and 1930, the college went through a series of transformations, by replacing the old teaching staff with a younger generation of professionals and also nine new Chairs were created, the first in Anatomy in 1920, followed by Medicine, Surgery, and Midwifery &amp; Gynaecology in 1922 and Clinical Surgery, Bacteriology, Biology, Bio-Chemistry, and Dental Surgery in 1926. And the tenth chair for Pathology was created in 1935.

In 1923, the college&#x27;s new building at Outram Road was commenced. It was completed in November 1925 and officially opened by Sir Laurence Guillemard in February 1926. During the opening ceremony, the college conferred Honorary Diplomas on Sir David James Galloway, Dr Malcolm Watson and Dr Lim Boon Keng.

In 1929, Dr George V. Allen the new principal took the helm, succeeding his predecessor Dr MacAlister.

===Raffles College===
The establishment of Raffles College was a brainchild of Sir Stamford Raffles and Dr Robert Morison. Sir Stamford had some knowledge of the Malay language and culture, while Morison was a distinguished sinologist missionary. Both men wanted to establish a centre dedicating to the study of Malays and Chinese at tertiary level.

On 5 June 1823, a site designated for an education institution had its foundation stone laid by Sir Stamford. Soon after that, Raffles left for England and Morrison left for China, thus the establishment of the school never happened. The school building was revived as an English school named the Raffles Institution.

In 1918, Sir William George Maxwell, the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements chaired the Maxwell Committee to review the scheme to commemorate the centenary of the founding of Singapore by Sir Stamford. The committee members were Roland Braddell, A.W. Still, Seah Ling Seah, Dr Lim Boon Keng, Mohammed Yusoff bin Mohammed, N.V. Samy, and Mannesseh Meyer. The working committee headed by H.W. Firmstone recommended the establishment of a college for tertiary education to commemorate the centenary founding of Singapore. On 12 July 1919, the Government decided to undertake the construction of the building with the cost not more than $1,000,000 and would contribute $50,000 as annual recurrent expenditure as soon as the Centenary Committee had collected $2,000,000 for the Raffles College Endowment Fund. On 31 August 1920, the committee had achieved the figure, amounting to $2,391,040. On 31 May 1920, Richard Olaf Winstedt was appointed as the Acting Principal of Raffles College. The course offered was a three-year basis. The establishment of the school was seen far more systematic compared to the King Edward VII Medical College. The school was situated at a site called the Economic Gardens and was designed by Cyril Farey and Graham Dawbarn. And the construction took place in 1926.

Following completion of the first hostel, Raffles College was opened informally to students on 12 June 1928. Of the first 43 students, nine were private students, and the rest were government-funded; there were two women among this first cohort. On 22 July 1929, Raffles College was formally established. Its students studied either arts or sciences, and graduated with a diploma after three years. Science students were permitted to use the labs of the King Edward VII College. Four years later, the College Council proposed changes in the curriculum, so that the Diploma could be furthered to a Degree through external examinations in collaboration with universities in England.

In 1937, Sir Shenton Thomas declared the college would have a full-time Principal. The college had its fourth Principal, Alexander Keir, succeeding Frederick Joseph Morten. By 1939 war was waged in Europe, and had put a halt to the development of the college. The war in Europe came to Asia and Singapore was invaded by the Japanese in February 1942.

After the war, the school was reopened and W.E. Dyer was Principal. The future of Raffles College was uncertain, until 1948 when Dr George V. Allen (later Sir) who was formerly the Principal of King Edward VII Medical College posted as the last Principal of Raffles College. The college was amalgamated with the former, for the making of a university for the Malayans.

===Universiti Malaya (1949–1962)===
In 1938, the government appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Sir William McLean to study the higher education potential and progress in Malaya. The Commission concluded that Malaya was not ready to have a university, and that a university college would be more suitable.

In 1943, Oliver Stanley, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, appointed a commission of inquiry chaired by Cyril Asquith to consider the development of higher education in the colonies across the British Empire. The Asquith Commission, reporting in 1945, endorsed the McLean Commission&#x27;s recommendations for Malaya.

In 1946, Raymond Priestley, the Vice-Chancellor of Birmingham University and member of the previous Asquith Commission, was invited by the British Malaya Government to visit and discuss the application of the Asquith Commission&#x27;s recommendations to Singapore and Malaya. Priestley again recommended the establishment of a university college as a first step.

In January 1947, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, now Arthur Creech Jones, appointed Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders to chair a commission determining the details of establishing a university college in Malaya. In March of the same year, the other members of the commission were announced and George Allen, principal of King George VII College, was appointed principal-designate of the planned university college. Carr-Saunders listened to the thoughts of the alumni association and students&#x27; union of King Edward VII College; he was impressed with the ideas of the president of the students&#x27; union, Kanagaratnam Shanmugaratnam. In 1948, the Carr-Saunders Commission recommended the immediate establishment of a full university, bypassing the intermediate step of a university college recommended by previous commissions.

As a result, the institution named the Universiti Malaya was chartered under the Carr-Saunders Commission in 1949. The formation of the Universiti Malaya on 8 October 1949 in Bukit Timah Campus (Former site of Raffles College), Singapore came from the merger of King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College, which had been established in 1905 and 1929, respectively.

In Carr-Saunders Commission&#x27;s report in 1949, it was stated that &quot;the university shall act as a single medium of mingle for enhancing the understanding among the multi-ethnics and religions in the back than Malaya. The University too should be modelled after the tertiary educations in the United Kingdom of Great Britain in term of academic system and administration structure&quot;.

The Carr-Saunders Commission postulates &quot;the principle that all children who show the necessary capacity should enjoy an equal chance of reaching the University; and, in particular, that no able child should be handicapped in climbing the educational ladder by race, religion, rural domicile, or lack of means.&quot;

In 1959, the university was divided into two autonomous campuses, one in Singapore, known as University of Malaya in Singapore, and the other in Kuala Lumpur (Universiti Malaya in Kuala Lumpur).

===Universiti Malaya (re-established 1962)===
In 1961, the governments of Malaysia and Singapore passed laws to split the Universiti Malaya into two national universities. As a result, on 1 January 1962, the Universiti Malaya was re-established on the 309 hectare campus in Kuala Lumpur, retaining its original name and became the only university in the post-independent Malaya. The Bukit Timah campus in Singapore became the University of Singapore (today the National University of Singapore).

On 16 June 1962, the newly independent university in Kuala Lumpur celebrated the installation of its first Chancellor, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia&#x27;s first Prime Minister. The first Vice-Chancellor was former Dean of Arts, Sir Alexander Oppenheim, the mathematician who formulated the Oppenheim conjecture in 1929. When Oppenheim left in 1965 with no successor in sight, Rayson Huang who later became the Vice Chancellor of Nanyang University, Singapore in 1969 and in 1972 went on to become the first Asian Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, was asked to take over as the Acting Vice-Chancellor. He served in that capacity for 12 months but declined reappointment to return to academic pursuits.

Chin Fung Kee, an authority in geotechnical engineering, replaced Huang as Acting Vice-Chancellor until the university filling the position in 1967 by the appointment of James H.E. Griffiths. A distinguished physicist and a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, Griffiths was also the former head of Clarendon Laboratory of Oxford University and one of the discoverers of ferromagnetic resonance.

UM remained Malaysia&#x27;s primary public university until 1 June 1969, when the nation&#x27;s second public university – Universiti Sains Malaysia was established in Gelugor on Penang Island.

On 1 March 1997, UM became the first university in Malaysia to be corporatised, in a move intended by the Federal Government to decentralise and transform public universities to become more effective and competitive.

==Coat of arms==

The UM&#x27;s coat of arms was designed under a council established in 1961, chaired by Tan Sri Y.C. Foo. The members of the committee involved in the design were the chairman of the council, Y.C. Foo, Professor A. Oppenheim (the vice-chancellor) and Professor Ungku Aziz (later regius professor). The coat of arms was officially chartered in April 1962 by Tunku Abdul Rahman, the university&#x27;s first chancellor.

The coat of arms is divided into two parts, namely the chief (upper part) and the base (the remainder). The chief is a bundle of seventeen strips of the leaves of &quot;Borassus flabellifer&quot; or the Palmrya palm. These strips were used as printed material for ancient books by the Malays, long before paper was invented. On the centre of these seventeen strips is the university&#x27;s motto &#x27;Ilmu Puncha Kemajuan&#x27;. The motto consists of &#x27;Ilmu&#x27; derived from Arabic, &#x27;Puncha&#x27; from Sanskrit (Za&#x27;aba Spelling for &#x27;Punca&#x27;), and &#x27;Kemajuan&#x27; from Malay. These words mean knowledge is the source of progress.

In the centre of the arms is a Bunga Raya or hibiscus rosa-sinensis species encircled by three Malayan tigers. The tigers symbolise the three main races in Malaysia (Malays, Chinese and Indians), who work hand-in-hand to protect the nation and uphold the duty to serve the country. It is blazoned: 

Since the late 1990s, the UM coat of arms was accompanied by the university&#x27;s wordmark which is written in capital letters – &#x27;UNIVERSITI MALAYA&#x27; in Malay or &#x27;UNIVERSITY OF MALAYA&#x27; in English as seen on its corporate logo. This made UM the only university in Malaysia to have a different language versions of its logo. But in late 2019, the university have decided to only use its logo with its official name in Malay language and thus, the English version of its logo is no longer used. The reason given by the university for the change was to make its official Malay name easier to pronounce. In 2022, UM made a refreshment on its corporate logo where the university&#x27;s wordmark is shown to be thinner instead and the red colour in the &#x27;U&#x27; and &#x27;M&#x27; letters were removed while its coat of arms remains unchanged. However, the university&#x27;s previous logo would continued to be used for non-academic and non-corporate purposes.

UM is currently one of the three public universities in Malaysia to adopt its coat of arms, the other two are University of Science Malaysia (USM) and the National University of Malaysia.

==Academic profile==
UM has been ranked consistently as the No. 1 university in Malaysia and among the top 3 universities in Southeast Asia, as well as among the top 300 universities in the world according to reputed ranking publisher such as &quot;QS&quot;, &quot;ARWU&quot;, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in the recent few years. Currently UM is ranked 60th in the world in the QS World University Rankings 2025, 281th in the USNWR 2024 global rankings, 293rd in the 2024 CWTS Leiden Ranking, and among the top 300 universities in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings. 

In 2015 it has been ranked 54th in Engineering &amp; Technology in &quot;QS&quot; world ranking. UM rose to the top 100 universities in the QS World University Rankings 2019, and has consistently increased in ranking to 59th in the world and 9th in Asia in the 2021 series. In 2021,&quot; U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UM 17th and 87th in the world in Engineering and Computer Science respectively by its subject ranking.

The business school of UM has achieved two international accreditations i.e. Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and Association of MBAs (AMBA).

The Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, Japanese Language and Linguistic Course was awarded the Japanese Foreign Minister&#x27;s Commendation for their contributions to promotion of Japanese language education in Malaysia on 1 December 2020.

==Transportation access==
The Universiti Malaya campus is accessible by car, bus, and both the LRT Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5), MRT Kajang Line (Line 9) and KTM Port Klang Line (Line 2) of the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. The campus will also become accessible by future MRT Circle Line.

The campus can be accessed by alighting from Universiti on LRT Kelana Jaya Line, with a 15-minute walk to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) entrance. Angkasapuri station on the Port Klang Komuter Line or Phileo Damansara MRT station are the other two nearest stations. The former has a connection to the GoKL Pink Line bus service, where the bus stops at the nearby mosque, which is about a 5 to 10-minute walk from the KL entrance. The latter is 3 km from the campus&#x27; Petaling Jaya (PJ) main entrance, supplemented by T815 MRT Feeder Bus service. Several bus routes operated by Rapid KL include T815 and T789, both of which connect to Phileo Damansara and Universiti stations respectively. PJ City Bus free ride service also has a stop in University Malaya Medical Centre (PPUM) and can be accessed from the PJ gate. Other rapidKL bus services may stop at PPUM. The proposed UM on MRT Circle Line is planned to be built inside the campus, near PPUM.

Signage showing the direction of buildings and other sites appears frequently next to the campus roadways.

The university also provides complimentary shuttle bus services during weekdays for students with 5 different routes, named AB, BA, C, D and E. Certain routes serve areas within the campus, while others connect external accommodation or buildings with the main campus area.

<text>Donald Duck, also known as Donald Duck and Friends, is an American Disney comic book series starring the character Donald Duck and published by various publishers from October 1942 to June 2017. As with many early Disney comics titles, &quot;Donald Duck&quot; began as individual issues of Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Four Color&quot; one-shots series. It was published as its own regular series in November 1952, starting with issue #26.

&quot;Donald Duck&quot; featured many early stories by Carl Barks, including the first American Donald Duck comic book story, &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot;. All of the stories in the first nine years of the comic were written and drawn by Barks.

The comic passed through many different publishers. Western Publishing produced the book from 1962 to 1984 (issues #85-245), and it was then revived by Gladstone Publishing from 1986 to 1998 (issues #246-307).

From 2003 to 2006, the comic was renamed &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot; by Gemstone Publishing (issues #308-347). Boom! Studios continued the series under that title, but reverted to &quot;Donald Duck&quot; near the end of its 2009–2011 run (issues #347-367).

When IDW took over publishing &quot;Donald Duck&quot; in May 2015 they restarted from #1, but retained the &#x27;legacy&#x27; numbering as a secondary number (issue #1 is also #368). IDW cancelled the book in 2017; the last issue was #21 (#388) in June.

==Four Color one-shots==
The first American Donald Duck comic book story, &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot;, was published as &quot;Four Color&quot; #9, October 1942. The story was written by Bob Karp and illustrated by Carl Barks and Jack Hannah, beginning Barks&#x27; decades-long career as &quot;the Good Duck Artist&quot;. Barks wrote and drew all 21 of the Donald Duck &quot;Four Color&quot; issues between 1942 and May 1951, ultimately penning 24 out of the total 29.

In 1943, Barks began his run of Donald Duck 10-page stories in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, often pitting Donald in competition with his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie, or his next-door adversary Neighbor Jones. The stories published in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; enriched the character, as historian Alberto Becattini points out: &quot;In the longer adventures which appeared in &quot;Four Color Comics&quot;, Donald and his nephews acted more like a team, and though luck did not necessarily seem to favor him, the Duck was often the winner in the end, showing qualities and feelings that made him even more sympathetic to the readers&quot;.

The second issue, &quot;Donald Duck and the Mummy&#x27;s Ring&quot; (&quot;Four Color&quot; #29, Sept 1943), was the first long Duck story written and drawn by Barks, and it established patterns that would soon become standards. Donald and the nephews are swept up into an adventure with life-and-death stakes, although there are many comedic gags to lighten the tone. There are nasty criminals, mistaken identities, humorous coincidences and a surprise ending. The boys also get a tour of an exotic setting, with many detailed panels of Egyptian landmarks, painstakingly copied from Barks&#x27; collection of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazines.

While Donald and his nephews mostly stayed close to home in the &quot;WDC&amp;S&quot; 10-page stories, the &quot;Four Color&quot; adventure stories sent the ducks to more exotic locales. The third issue, &quot;Frozen Gold&quot; (Jan 1945), took them to Alaska; the fourth, &quot;The Terror of the River!&quot; (1946), takes place on a houseboat traveling to New Orleans; and the fifth, &quot;Volcano Valley&quot; (May 1947), involves a trip to the Central American nation of Volcanovia. These periodic adventures helped Barks to deepen the ducks&#x27; characterization—not just putting them in new settings, but broadening the kinds of events and experiences that they could react to.

At first, the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; issues were released on a roughly annual basis—the first four came out in 1942, 1943, 1945 and 1946—but beginning in 1947, Barks produced three issues a year. This included &quot;Volcano Valley&quot;, &quot;The Ghost of the Grotto&quot; (Aug 1947) and &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot; (Dec 1947), the first story featuring Donald&#x27;s uncle, Scrooge McDuck. Barks&#x27; second Uncle Scrooge adventure, &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot;, was published in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; in June 1948.

In 1950, the rate of &quot;Donald Duck&quot; one-shots increased to five issues a year, and then to six issues a year in 1951. At that point, other writers and artists were enlisted to create the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; adventure stories. The first three issues of 1951 were Barks creations -- &quot;Dangerous Disguise&quot; (Jan 1951), &quot;No Such Varmint&quot; (March 1951) and &quot;In Old California&quot; (May 1951), but these were followed by &quot;Donald Duck and the Magic Fountain&quot; (July 1951, written by Del Connell and drawn by Bob Moore), &quot;The Crocodile Collector&quot; (Sept 1951, by Don Christensen and Frank McSavage) and &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; (Nov 1951, Frank McSavage).

In 1952, Barks wrote four of the six &quot;Donald Duck&quot; issues, including the classics &quot;A Christmas for Shacktown&quot; (Jan 1952) and &quot;The Golden Helmet&quot; (July 1952).

==Dell Comics series==
Starting with the November 1952 issue, Dell transitioned &quot;Donald Duck&quot; from a bimonthly series of one-shots to its own bimonthly series. Dell called the first &quot;Donald Duck&quot; issue #26, counting the previous issues as if they&#x27;d always been part of the series. Unfortunately, the numbering was a mistake, as &quot;Four Color&quot; #422 was actually the 29th &quot;Four Color&quot; issue titled &quot;Donald Duck&quot;.

The first issue of the new series led with a Carl Barks Halloween story, &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, which was based on the October 1952 Donald Duck short of the same name. That was Barks&#x27; last contribution to the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic for several years. In 1953, Barks&#x27; attention turned to producing a quarterly &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; comic, and the bimonthly &quot;Donald Duck&quot; passed to other creators. Barks returned to &quot;Donald Duck&quot; periodically, writing eight more stories over the next eighteen years, ending with three that were drawn by other artists -- &quot;Pawns of the Loup Garou&quot; in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; #117 (Jan 1968, drawn by Tony Strobl), &quot;Officer for a Day&quot; in #126 (July 1969, also Strobl) and &quot;A Day in a Duck&#x27;s Life&quot; in #138 (July 1971, drawn by Kay Wright).

Most of the issues from 1954 to 1972 were drawn by Tony Strobl, including &quot;The Kitchy-Kaw Diamond&quot; (#40, March 1955), &quot;Rainbow Island Rendezvous&quot; (#41, May 1955), &quot;The Mysterious Crewless Ship&quot; (#47, May 1956), &quot;The Secret of the Glacier&quot; (#51, Jan 1957), &quot;One for the Whammy&quot; (#65, May 1959), &quot;The Stone Money Mystery&quot; (#69, Jan 1960) and &quot;Secret of the Sargasso Sea&quot; (#72, July 1960).

==Western Publishing==
In 1962, all of Dell Comics&#x27; Disney comic books moved to Western Publishing, who released them first under the Gold Key Comics imprint, and then as Whitman Publishing. Gold Key continued the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic, beginning with issue #85 (Dec 1962).

Donald&#x27;s seafaring relative Moby Duck premiered in issue #112 (March 1967) in &quot;A Whale of an Adventure&quot;, written by Vic Lockman and illustrated by Strobl. Moby returned two issues later in &quot;The Jewels of Skull Rock&quot; (#114, July 1967), and then graduated to his own series in October.

In 1972, Strobl left Western to write for the Disney Studio Program; his last &quot;Donald Duck&quot; story was &quot;The Siren&#x27;s Whistle&quot; in issue #142 (March 1972). John Carey took Strobl&#x27;s place as the main artist for the original &quot;Donald Duck&quot; stories starting with issue #144 (July 1972).

Starting with issue #147 (Jan 1973), &quot;Donald Duck&quot; began alternating new stories with reprints of earlier issues. Four years later, the comic moved to all reprints; the last original story of the 1970s was &quot;Inspiration Hunt&quot;, a story written and drawn by Bob Gregory in issue #186 (Aug 1977).

In 1979, Western Publishing was bought by toy company Mattel, and the management decided to stop publishing comic books for newsstands, preferring to sell bagged sets of three comics at department, variety and grocery stores. At this point, they stopped publishing the comics as Gold Key Comics and switched to Whitman Comics, another Western Publishing imprint.

The first issue of &quot;Donald Duck&quot; under the Whitman label was #212, published in October 1979. The comic continued to be mostly reprints, with only a few original stories. Sales declined, and the release schedule became erratic. They even managed to print the same reprint issue twice in a little over a year—issue #222 (Oct 1980) was a reprint of a 1969 issue led by the Carl Fallberg/Tony Strobl story &quot;The Fuddleduck Diggin&#x27;s&quot;, and then issue #235 (Jan 1982) reprinted the same stories, using the same cover. The series came to an end in 1984, with issue #245 reprinting three Vic Lockman/Tony Strobl stories from 1968.

==Gladstone Publishing==
Gladstone Publishing got the license to publish Disney comics in 1986, and began publishing the four core comics in October: &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck&quot;. Gladstone&#x27;s approach was to publish an equal mix of the best classic stories (which in &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s&quot; case meant Carl Barks reprints), and new stories from Denmark and the Netherlands.

Gladstone began &quot;Donald Duck&quot; with issue #246 (Oct 1986), reprinting Barks&#x27; &quot;The Gilded Man&quot; from 1952, and issue #250 (Feb 1987) went all the way back to the beginning, reprinting &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold!&quot; from the first &quot;Four Color&quot; issue in 1942. Gladstone also printed stories by Volker Reiche and Daan Jippes first published in the Netherlands&#x27; &quot;Donald Duck Weekblad&quot;, and stories drawn by Vicar and Daniel Branca from Denmark&#x27;s &quot;Anders And &amp; C:o&quot;.

The new comics were a success, and in 1987, Gladstone began publishing a second Donald Duck book, &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;.

In issue #262 (March 1988), Gladstone&#x27;s &quot;Donald Duck&quot; spotlighted a reprint of a 1938 sequence from Al Taliaferro&#x27;s &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip which introduced Gus Goose as Donald&#x27;s troublesome cousin. Gus was featured on the cover, and an accompanying text piece described the history of the character in cartoons, comic strips and comics.

In 1990, the Walt Disney Company—seeing that Gladstone was successful at marketing Disney comics—revoked Gladstone&#x27;s license, and began their own Disney Comics line. Gladstone&#x27;s final issue of &quot;Donald Duck&quot; was a double-sized #279 (May 1990).

The next month, Disney published their first set of comics, starting again with the core four comics. &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics &amp; Stories&quot; and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; continued their legacy numbering, but the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck books were retitled &quot;Mickey Mouse Adventures&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;, starting with a new issue #1. The original &quot;Donald Duck&quot; series had to wait three years before it resumed.

==Gladstone Publishing, 2nd series==

Disney&#x27;s attempt at comics publishing only lasted three years, from 1990 to 1993. When Disney cancelled their books, they returned the license to Gladstone Publishing, which picked up from where they left off. Gladstone&#x27;s second line included both &quot;Donald Duck&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;, which resumed their numbering from the first Gladstone run.

The new &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot; contained the longer adventure stories, mixing occasional reprints of Barks stories with new stories by Don Rosa, William Van Horn and others. With &quot;DDA&quot; taking the adventure stories and the revived &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics &amp; Stories&quot; printing traditional Donald Duck 10-page stories (mostly new ones by Van Horn), &quot;Donald Duck&quot; focused almost entirely on the past—specifically, the Al Taliaferro comic strips from the 1930s and 40s.

Starting with issue #280 (July 1993) and for the next 20 issues, almost every issue contained one 10-page story by Carl Barks (or Don Rosa, in issue #283), with the rest of the pages filled with Taliaferro reprints, in chronological order.

The historical focus of the title continued in issue #286 (Sept 1994), a 64-page special celebrating the character&#x27;s 60th anniversary, featuring a special anniversary story by Don Rosa, and a reprint of the first Donald Duck adventure story from 1937, Federico Pedrocchi&#x27;s &quot;Paolino Paperino e il mistero di Marte&quot; (&quot;Donald Duck and the Secret of Mars&quot;) published in the Italian comic &quot;Donald Duck and Other Adventures&quot; (&quot;Paperino e altre avventure&quot;).

Issue #300 (Jan 1997) also broke the Barks/Taliaferro format, celebrating the milestone with a Dutch story by Evert Geradts and Mau Heymans originally written to celebrate the 2000th issue of the weekly &quot;Donald Duck Weekblad&quot;. The issue also featured the first American printing of one of Marco Rota&#x27;s &quot;Andold Wild Duck&quot; stories.

Gladstone continued with the 10-pager/Taliaferro format until the end of the run, with issue #307 (March 1998).

==Gemstone Publishing==
Five years later, publisher Steve Geppi got the license to publish Disney comics, and continued where Gladstone left off, even with the same creative staff. Now under Gemstone Publishing, the team retitled the Duck book &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot;, and continued Gladstone&#x27;s numbering, with #308 coming out in September 2003.

While the last Gladstone run had focused on the past, the new &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot; published recent stories created for the Danish publisher Egmont. Most issues had three stories: a 10-16 page Donald Duck story, a 10-page Mickey Mouse story, and a 6-10 page story featuring one of the other Donald Duck universe characters, including Uncle Scrooge, Gyro Gearloose, Daisy Duck and Grandma Duck.

Almost all of the stories were from the late 1990s and early 2000s, often by creators that were previously unknown in the US, including Noel Van Horn, Pat and Carol McGreal, César Ferioli and Stefan Petrucha.

When the sales dipped lower than expected, Gemstone returned to a previously successful strategy: publishing Carl Barks stories. Issue #325 (March 2005) reprinted &quot;Lost in the Andes!&quot;, #332 (Oct 2005) published &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, #339 (May 2006) ran &quot;In Ancient Persia&quot;, and #344 &quot;Pawns of the Loup Garou&quot;.

Gemstone&#x27;s Disney comics run ended in December 2006; the last issue of &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot; was #346.

==Boom! Studios==
Three years later, Boom! Studios picked up the Disney license, and began releasing a new slate of comics, including &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot;, which began with issue #347 (Nov 2009).

Boom! used two new strategies at the start of their run. The first was to use variant covers to encourage collectors to purchase multiple copies of each issue; every issue from #347 to 356 had two or three covers each.

The other strategy was to use non-traditional subseries for the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck&quot; books, attempting to attract a new audience with modern storylines. Boom!&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse and Friends&quot; began with the Italian fantasy-world story &quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot;, and &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot; began with &quot;DoubleDuck&quot;, an Italian subseries in which Donald is transformed into a secret agent. &quot;DoubleDuck&quot; is darker than traditional Donald Duck stories—both literally using a darker color scheme, as well as a darker, less comedic tone. The characters all keep secrets, and don&#x27;t trust each other; one of the main characters is revealed to be a double agent. Boom! published 12 issues of the &quot;DoubleDuck&quot; storyline, from #347 to #358, comprising four complete stories originally published in &quot;Topolino&quot;.

The next four issues (#359-362) featured stories about Donald Duck doing martial arts. The first two reprinted &quot;Son of the Rising Sun&quot;, an Italian story from 1989. The third and fourth reprinted other Donald martial-arts stories from Italy and Denmark.

In 2011, with the Disney line struggling, Boom! followed the same path as Gladstone and Gemstone ultimately did: they printed Carl Barks stories. The line pivoted to a celebration of &quot;70 years of Disney comics&quot;, with all of the comics reprinting favorite stories from the past, as well as anniversary stories and sequels. Issue #363 (Feb 2011) featured the Barks 10-pager &quot;Mystery of the Loch&quot;, and two recent Dutch stories that returned to the typical cast and locations of traditional Duck comics. The comic&#x27;s title also reverted from &quot;Donald Duck and Friends&quot; back to &quot;Donald Duck&quot;.

In issues #364 and 365 (March–April 2011), &quot;Donald Duck&quot; featured one of the earliest Donald Duck adventure stories: &quot;Donald Duck, Special Correspondent&quot;, from the 1938 Italian comic &quot;Paperino e altre avventure&quot;. Issue #366 (May 2011) featured &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold... Again!&quot;, a 1962 Italian sequel to Barks&#x27; first Duck adventure, the 1942 tale &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot;. The final issue, #367 (June 2011), reprinted a 2006 story written by Carl Barks and drawn by Daan Jippes.

Boom!&#x27;s Disney comic line ended in 2011.

==IDW Publishing==
In 2015, IDW Publishing obtained the Disney comics license and began publishing their own set of comics. IDW restarted &quot;Donald Duck&quot;&#x27;s numbering over from #1, but also retained a secondary legacy numbering system that continued the series with #368. The new series continued Boom! Studios&#x27; variant covers gimmick; almost every issue had three different covers, and #1 had five.

This series featured a wide mix of stories, with contributions from Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, the Disney Studio Program, and American stories seeing their first reprint. The most common source was Italian comics from the late 1960s and 70s, with stories by Romano Scarpa, Luciano Bottaro and Giorgio Cavazzano leading many issues.

Issue #5 and 6 (Sept/Oct 2015) presented &quot;The True Origin of the Diabolical Duck Avenger&quot;—an Italian story from June 1969 by Elisa Penna, Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi that introduced Paperinik, Donald Duck&#x27;s costumed vigilante alter ego which began as a way to get revenge on his own relatives, but later became a crime-fighting superhero. For the English translation, IDW used &quot;the Duck Avenger&quot;. The second &quot;Duck Avenger&quot; story was presented in issues #14 and 15 (June/July 2016), and then IDW began a six-issue &quot;Duck Avenger&quot; spin-off series, reprinting stories from the 1996 Italian series &quot;PKNA&quot;.

Slow sales prompted IDW to drop most of their Disney comics titles in 2017, and &quot;Donald Duck&quot;&#x27;s last issue was #21, aka #388 (June 2017).

<doc id="286857" wikidata="Q7329047" url="?curid=286857" title="Richard Simmons (actor)">
<text>Richard Simmons (August 19, 1913 – January 11, 2003) was an American actor.

==Early life==
Simmons was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and his family later moved across the Mississippi River to Minneapolis. There, he attended West Side High School and then the University of Minnesota, where he studied drama. Simmons was a professional pilot.

==Career==
While attending the university, Simmons competed in fencing and swimming, and also acted in a few theater productions. Simmons left the Twin Cities in the 1930s to launch his film acting career in 1937. He soon became an MGM contract player. Many of his minor movie roles went uncredited through the 1940s. One even included his portrayal of a Mountie in &quot;King of the Royal Mounted&quot; produced by Republic Pictures.

Starting in 1943, he began appearing in credited roles, beginning with his appearance in &quot;The Youngest Profession&quot;, starring Virginia Weidler. From 1943 through 1949, he appeared in 17 films, of which 10 listed him in the credits.

Simmons interrupted his film career to serve as a flight officer pilot with the Air Transport Command in World War II.

The 1950s mirrored the 1940s, with his appearing in several films and television series, at times uncredited. In 1952, he played the co-pilot in &quot;Above and Beyond&quot;. In 1955, Simmons won his best-known role, portraying Sergeant William Preston in &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot;. Following the end of the series in 1958, he continued to have a successful acting career, mostly in television series guest appearances, through 1982. Simmons appeared in a 1963 episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (&quot;The Case of the Decadent Dean&quot;). In 1964, he appeared in the episode &quot;Tin Can Man&quot; (aired November 5, 1964) of &quot;The Munsters&quot; as Harold Balding, the principal of Eddie Munster&#x27;s school. His last role was in a 1982 episode of &quot;CHiPs&quot;.

==Later life and death==

In the 1970s, when acting roles became scarce, Simmons managed a mobile home park in Carlsbad, near San Diego. Towards the end of his life, Simmons was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on January 11, 2003, at the age of 89, in an Oceanside, California, nursing home.

<doc id="286864" wikidata="Q6682302" url="?curid=286864" title="Grand Tour">
<text>The Grand Tour was the principally 17th- to early 19th-century custom of a traditional trip through Europe, with Italy as a key destination, undertaken by upper-class young European men of sufficient means and rank (typically accompanied by a tutor or family member) when they had come of age (about 21 years old). The custom—which flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transport in the 1840s and was associated with a standard itinerary—served as an educational rite of passage. Though it was primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of other Protestant Northern European nations, and, from the second half of the 18th century, by some South and North Americans.

By the mid-18th century, the Grand Tour had become a regular feature of aristocratic education in Central Europe as well, although it was restricted to the higher nobility. The tradition declined in Europe as enthusiasm for classical culture waned, and with the advent of accessible rail and steamship travel—an era in which Thomas Cook made the &quot;Cook&#x27;s Tour&quot; of early mass tourism a byword starting in the 1870s. However, with the rise of industrialization in the United States in the 19th century, American Gilded Age nouveau riche adopted the Grand Tour for both sexes and among those of more advanced years as a means of gaining both exposure and association with the sophistication of Europe. Even those of lesser means sought to mimic the pilgrimage, as satirized in Mark Twain&#x27;s enormously popular &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; in 1869.

The primary value of the Grand Tour lay in its exposure to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent. It also provided the only opportunity to view specific works of art, and possibly the only chance to hear certain music. A Grand Tour could last anywhere from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a cicerone, a knowledgeable guide or tutor.

==History==

Rome for many centuries had already been the destination of pilgrims, especially during Jubilee when European clergy visited the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome.

In Britain, Thomas Coryat&#x27;s travel book &quot;Coryat&#x27;s Crudities&quot; (1611), published during the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, was an early influence on the Grand Tour but it was the far more extensive tour through Italy as far as Naples undertaken by the &#x27;Collector&#x27; Earl of Arundel, with his wife and children in 1613–14 that established the most significant precedent. This is partly because he asked Inigo Jones, not yet established as an architect but already known as a &#x27;great traveller&#x27; and masque designer, to act as his cicerone (guide).

Larger numbers of tourists began their tours after the Peace of Münster in 1648. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first recorded use of the term (perhaps its introduction to English) was by Richard Lassels (circa 1603–1668), an expatriate Roman Catholic priest, in his book &quot;The Voyage of Italy&quot;, which was published posthumously in Paris in 1670 and then in London. Lassels&#x27;s introduction listed four areas in which travel furnished &quot;an accomplished, consummate Traveller&quot;: the intellectual, the social, the ethical (by the opportunity of drawing moral instruction from all the traveller saw), and the political.
As a young man at the outset of his account of a repeat Grand Tour, the historian Edward Gibbon remarked that &quot;According to the law of custom, and perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English gentleman.&quot; Consciously adapted for intellectual self-improvement, Gibbon was &quot;revisiting the Continent on a larger and more liberal plan&quot;; most Grand Tourists did not pause more than briefly in libraries. On the eve of the Romantic era he played a significant part in introducing, William Beckford wrote a vivid account of his Grand Tour that made Gibbon&#x27;s unadventurous Italian tour look distinctly conventional.

The typical 18th-century stance was that of the studious observer travelling through foreign lands reporting his findings on human nature for those unfortunates who stayed at home. Recounting one&#x27;s observations to society at large to increase its welfare was considered an obligation. The Grand Tour flourished in this mindset. In essence, the Grand Tour was neither a scholarly pilgrimage nor a religious one. Grand Tourists in the 18th century frequently traveled with entourage, which could include tutors and servants, but still Grand Tourists used guide books. Popular guide book for the Grand Tour were prolifically published from the mid 18th century onward, though guide books for major Italian cities had been in circulation since 1660. Grand Tour guide books were used by young aristocrats, but had the bourgeoisie purpose of helping the reader make an authoritative choice. Grand Tour hot spots were Paris and Rome. European capital cities were Grand Tour stop overs frequently requiring traveling across the Alps and forcing Grand Tourists to gaze at length at natural sights such as Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius. Climbing mountains, crossing rivers, and purchasing souvenirs were part of the traveling experience.

The Grand Tour offered a liberal education, and the opportunity to acquire things otherwise unavailable, lending an air of accomplishment and prestige to the traveller. Grand Tourists would return with crates full of books, works of art, scientific instruments, and cultural artefacts – from snuff boxes and paperweights to altars, fountains, and statuary – to be displayed in libraries, cabinets, gardens, drawing rooms, and galleries built for that purpose. The trappings of the Grand Tour, especially portraits of the traveller painted in continental settings, became the obligatory emblems of worldliness, gravitas and influence. Artists who particularly thrived on the Grand Tour market included Carlo Maratti, who was first patronised by John Evelyn as early as 1645, Pompeo Batoni the portraitist, and the vedutisti such as Canaletto, Pannini and Guardi. The less well-off could return with an album of Piranesi etchings.

The &quot;perhaps&quot; in Gibbon&#x27;s opening remark cast an ironic shadow over his resounding statement. Critics of the Grand Tour derided its lack of adventure. &quot;The tour of Europe is a paltry thing&quot;, said one 18th century critic, &quot;a tame, uniform, unvaried prospect&quot;. The Grand Tour was said to reinforce the old preconceptions and prejudices about national characteristics, as Jean Gailhard&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Gentleman&quot; (1678) observes: &quot;French courteous. Spanish lordly. Italian amorous. German clownish.&quot; The deep suspicion with which Tour was viewed at home in England, where it was feared that the very experiences that completed the British gentleman might well undo him, were epitomised in the sarcastic nativist view of the ostentatiously &quot;well-travelled&quot; maccaroni of the 1760s and 1770s.

Also worth noticing is that the Grand Tour not only fostered stereotypes of the countries visited but also led to a dynamic of contrast between northern and southern Europe. By constantly depicting Italy as a &quot;picturesque place&quot;, the travellers also unconsciously degraded Italy as a place of backwardness. This unconscious degradation is best reflected in the famous verses of Lamartine in which Italy is depicted as a &quot;land of the past... where everything sleeps.&quot;

In Rome, antiquaries like Thomas Jenkins were also dealers and were able to sell and advise on the purchase of marbles; their price would rise if it were known that the Tourists were interested. Coins and medals, which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman&#x27;s guide to ancient history were also popular. Pompeo Batoni made a career of painting the English &quot;milordi&quot; posed with graceful ease among Roman antiquities. Many continued on to Naples, where they also viewed Herculaneum and Pompeii, but few ventured far into Southern Italy, and fewer still to Greece, then still under Turkish rule.

After the advent of steam-powered transportation around 1825, the Grand Tour custom continued, but it was of a qualitative difference — cheaper to undertake, safer, easier, open to anyone. During much of the 19th century, most educated young men of privilege undertook the Grand Tour. Germany and Switzerland came to be included in a more broadly defined circuit. Later, it became fashionable for young women as well; a trip to Italy, with a spinster aunt as chaperone, was part of the upper-class women&#x27;s education, as in E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;A Room with a View&quot;.

British travellers were far from alone on the roads of Europe. On the contrary, from the mid-16th century, the grand tour was established as an ideal way to finish off the education of young men in countries such as Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. In spite of this the bulk of research conducted on the Grand Tour has been on British travellers. Dutch scholar Frank-van Westrienen Anna has made note of this historiographic focus, claiming that the scholarly understanding of the Grand Tour would have been more complex if more comparative studies had been carried out on continental travellers.

Recent scholarship on the Swedish aristocracy has demonstrated that Swedish aristocrats, though being relatively poorer than their British peers, from around 1620 and onwards in many ways acted as their British counterparts. After studies at one or two renowned universities, preferably those of Leiden and Heidelberg, the Swedish grand tourists set off to France and Italy, where they spent time in Paris, Rome and Venice and completed the original grand tour on the French countryside. King Gustav III of Sweden made his Grand Tour in 1783–84.

==Typical itinerary==

The itinerary of the Grand Tour was not set in stone, but was subject to innumerable variations, depending on an individual&#x27;s interests and finances, though Paris and Rome were popular destinations for most English tourists.

The most common itinerary of the Grand Tour shifted across generations, but the British tourist usually began in Dover, England, and crossed the English Channel to Ostend in Belgium, or to Calais or Le Havre in France. From there the tourist, usually accompanied by a tutor (known colloquially as a &quot;bear-leader&quot;) and (if wealthy enough) a troop of servants, could rent or acquire a coach (which could be resold in any city – as in Giacomo Casanova&#x27;s travels – or disassembled and packed across the Alps), or he could opt to make the trip by riverboat as far as the Alps, either travelling up the Seine to Paris, or up the Rhine to Basel.

Upon hiring a French-speaking guide, as French was the dominant language of the elite in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, the tourist and his entourage would travel to Paris. There the traveller might undertake lessons in French, dancing, fencing, and riding. The appeal of Paris lay in the sophisticated language and manners of French high society, including courtly behavior and fashion. This served to polish the young man&#x27;s manners in preparation for a leadership position at home, often in government or diplomacy.

From Paris he would typically sojourn in urban Switzerland, often in Geneva (the cradle of the Protestant Reformation) or Lausanne. (&quot;Alpinism&quot; or mountaineering developed later, in the 19th century.) From there the traveller would endure a difficult crossing over the Alps (such as at the Great St Bernard Pass), which required dismantling the carriage and larger luggage. If wealthy enough, he might be carried over the hard terrain by servants.

Once in Italy, the tourist would visit Turin (and sometimes Milan), then might spend a few months in Florence, where there was a considerable Anglo-Italian society accessible to travelling Englishmen &quot;of quality&quot; and where the &quot;Tribuna&quot; of the Uffizi gallery brought together in one space the monuments of High Renaissance paintings and Roman sculpture. After a side trip to Pisa, the tourist would move on to Padua, Bologna, and Venice. The British idea of Venice as the &quot;locus of decadent Italianate allure&quot; made it an epitome and cultural set piece of the Grand Tour.

From Venice the traveller went to Rome to study the ancient ruins and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, and architecture of Rome&#x27;s Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Some travellers also visited Naples to study music, and (after the mid-18th century) to appreciate the recently discovered archaeological sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and perhaps (for the adventurous) an ascent of Mount Vesuvius. Later in the period, the more adventurous, especially if provided with a yacht, might attempt Sicily to see its archeological sites, volcanoes and its baroque architecture, Malta or even Greece itself. But Naples – or later Paestum further south – was the usual terminus.

Returning northward, the tourist might recross the Alps to the German-speaking parts of Europe, visiting Innsbruck, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin and Potsdam, with perhaps a period of study at the universities in Ingolstadt or Heidelberg. From there, travellers could visit Holland and Flanders (with more gallery-going and art appreciation) before returning across the Channel to England.

==Published accounts==
Published accounts of the Grand Tour provided illuminating detail and an often polished first-hand perspective of the experience. Examining some accounts offered by authors in their own lifetimes, Jeremy Black detects the element of literary artifice in these and cautions that they should be approached as travel literature rather than unvarnished accounts. He lists as examples Joseph Addison, John Andrews, William Thomas Beckford (whose &quot;Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents&quot; was a published account of his letters back home in 1780–1781, embellished with stream-of-consciousness associations), William Coxe, Elizabeth Craven, John Moore, tutor to successive dukes of Hamilton, Samuel Jackson Pratt, Tobias Smollett, Philip Thicknesse, and Arthur Young.

Although Italy was written as the &quot;sink of iniquity&quot;, many travelers were not kept from recording the activities they participated in or the people they met, especially the women they encountered. To the Grand Tourists, Italy was an unconventional country, for &quot;The shameless women of Venice made it unusual, in its own way.&quot; Sir James Hall confided in his written diary to comment on seeing &quot;more handsome women this day than I ever saw in my life&quot;, also noting &quot;how flattering Venetian dress [was] — or perhaps the lack of it&quot;.

Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Italian women, with their unfamiliar methods and routines, were opposites to the western dress expected of European women in the eighteenth and nineteenth century; their &quot;foreign&quot; ways led to the documentation of encounters with them, providing published accounts of the Grand Tour.

James Boswell in the 18th century courted noble ladies and recorded his progress with his relationships, mentioning that Madame Micheli &quot;Talked of religion, philosophy... Kissed hand often.&quot; The promiscuity of Boswell&#x27;s encounters with Italian elite are shared in his diary and provide further detail on events that occurred during the Grand Tour. Boswell notes &quot;Yesterday morning with her. Pulled up petticoat and showed whole knees... Touched with her goodness. All other liberties exquisite.&quot; He describes his time with the Italian women he encounters and shares a part of history in his written accounts.

Lord Byron&#x27;s letters to his mother with the accounts of his travels have also been published from the early 19th century. Byron spoke of his first enduring Venetian love, his landlord&#x27;s wife, mentioning that he has &quot;fallen in love with a very pretty Venetian of two and twenty — with great black eyes — she is married — and so am I — we have found &amp; sworn an eternal attachment ... &amp; I am more in love than ever... and I verily believe we are one of the happiest unlawful couples on this side of the Alps.&quot; Many tourists enjoyed sexual relations while abroad but to a great extent were well behaved, such as Thomas Pelham, and scholars, such as Richard Pococke, who wrote lengthy letters of their Grand Tour experiences.

Inventor Sir Francis Ronalds&#x27; journals and sketches of his 1818–20 tour to Europe and the Near East have been published online. The letters written by sisters Mary and Ida Saxton of Canton, Ohio in 1869 while on a six-month tour offer insight into the Grand Tour tradition from an American perspective.

Immediately following the American Civil War U.S. author and humorist Mark Twain undertook a decidedly modest yet greatly aspiring &quot;grand tour&quot; of Europe, the Middle East, and the Holy Land, which he chronicled in his highly popular satire &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; in 1867. Not only was it the best-selling of Twain&#x27;s works during his lifetime, it became one of the best-selling travel books of all time.

==In literature==
Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s American Civil War-based novel, &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, makes reference to the Grand Tour. Stuart Tartleton, in a conversation with his twin brother, Brent, suspects that their mother is not likely to provide them with a Grand Tour, since they have been expelled from college again. Brent is not concerned, remarking, &quot;What is there to see in Europe? I&#x27;ll bet those foreigners can&#x27;t show us a thing we haven&#x27;t got right here in Georgia&quot;. Ashley Wilkes, on the other hand, enjoyed the scenery and music he encountered on his Grand Tour and was always talking about it.

==Popular culture==
In 1998, the BBC produced an art history series &quot;Sister Wendy&#x27;s Grand Tour&quot; presented by British Carmelite nun Sister Wendy. Ostensibly an art history series, the journey takes her from Madrid to Saint Petersburg with stop-offs to see the great masterpieces.

In 2005, British art historian Brian Sewell followed in the footsteps of the Grand Tourists for a 10-part television series &quot;Brian Sewell&#x27;s Grand Tour&quot;. Produced by UK&#x27;s Channel Five, Sewell travelled by car and confined his attention solely to Italy stopping in Rome, Florence, Naples, Pompeii, Turin, Milan, Cremona, Siena, Bologna, Vicenza, Paestum, Urbino, Tivoli and concluding at a Venetian masked ball. Material relating to this can be found in the Brian Sewell Archive held by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.

In 2009, the Grand Tour featured prominently in a BBC/PBS miniseries based on &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; by Charles Dickens. Set mainly in Venice, it portrayed the Grand Tour as a rite of passage.

Kevin McCloud presented &quot;Kevin McCloud&#x27;s Grand Tour&quot; on Channel 4 in 2009 with McCloud retracing the tours of British architects.

<doc id="286865" wikidata="Q71747" url="?curid=286865" title="Duchy of Brittany">
<text>The Duchy of Brittany (, ; ) was a medieval feudal state that existed between approximately 939 and 1547. Its territory covered the northwestern peninsula of Europe, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the English Channel to the north. It was also less definitively bordered by the river Loire to the south, and Normandy, and other French provinces, to the east. The Duchy was established after the expulsion of Viking armies from the region around 939. The Duchy, in the 10th and 11th centuries, was politically unstable, with the dukes holding only limited power outside their own personal lands. The Duchy had mixed relationships with the neighbouring Duchy of Normandy, sometimes allying itself with Normandy, and at other times, such as the Breton–Norman War, entering into open conflict.

Henry II of England invaded Brittany in the mid-12th century and became Count of Nantes in 1158 under a treaty with Duke Conan IV. Henry&#x27;s son, Geoffrey, became Duke through his marriage to Constance, the hereditary Duchess. The Angevins remained in control until the collapse of their empire in northern France in 1204. The French Crown maintained its influence over the Duchy for the rest of the 13th century. Monastic orders supported by the Breton aristocracy spread across the Duchy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and in the 13th, the first of the mendicant orders established themselves in Brittany&#x27;s major towns. Civil war broke out in the 14th century, as rival claimants for the Duchy vied for power during the Breton War of Succession, with different factions supported by England and France.

The independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of Francis II in 1488. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, Anne, but King Charles VIII of France had her existing marriage annulled and then married her himself. As a result, the King of France acquired the title of Duke of Brittany – . The Ducal crown became united with the French crown in 1532 through a vote of the Estates of Brittany, after the death of Queen Claude of France, the last sovereign duchess. Her sons Francis III, Duke of Brittany and then Henry II of France would in any case have created a personal union on the death of their father.

Following the French Revolution, and as a result of the various republican forms of French government since 1792, the duchy was replaced by the French system of (or departments) which continues under the Fifth Republic of France. In modern times the departments have also joined into administrative regions although the administrative region of Brittany does not encompass the entirety of the medieval duchy.

==Background==

===Origins===
The Duchy of Brittany that emerged in the early 10th century was influenced by several earlier polities. Prior to the expansion of the Roman Empire into the region, Gallic tribes had occupied the Armorican peninsula, dividing it into five regions that then formed the basis for the Roman administration of the area, and which survived into the period of the Duchy. These Gallic tribes – termed the &quot;Armorici&quot; in Latin – had close relationships with the Britonnes tribes in Roman Britain. Between the late 4th and the early 7th centuries, many of these Britonnes migrated to the Armorican peninsula, blending with the local people to form the later Britons, who eventually became the Bretons. The reasons for these migrations remain uncertain. These migrations from Britain contributed to Brittany&#x27;s name. 

Brittany fragmented into small, warring &quot;regna&quot;, kingdoms, each competing for resources. The Frankish Carolingian Empire conquered the region during the 8th century, starting around 748 taking the whole of Brittany by 799. The Carolingians tried to create a unitary administration around the centres of Rennes, Nantes, and Vannes using the local rulers, but the kings of Brittany&#x27;s hold on the region remained tenuous. Carolingian technology and culture began to influence Brittany, and the church in Brittany also began to emulate the Frankish model. 

The greatest influence on the later Duchy, however, was the formation of a unitary Brittany kingdom in the 9th century. In 831 Louis the Pious appointed Nominoe, the Count of Vannes, ruler of the Bretons, imperial &quot;missus&quot;, at Ingelheim in 831. After the death of Louis in 840, Nominoe rose to challenge the new emperor, Charles the Bald, emboldened in part by new Viking raids on the empire. Charles the Bald created the Marches of Neustria to defend Western Francia from the Bretons and the Vikings. Erispoe fought Charles the Bald, who felt that a quick attack would successfully challenge the new Breton leader. Erispoe won a victory at the Battle of Jengland and, under their Treaty of Angers in 851, Brittany&#x27;s independence was secured.
The new kingdom proved fragile and collapsed under Viking attack. In 853 the Viking Godfried left the Seine with his fleet, sailed around the Breton peninsula and sacked Nantes. Erispoe entered into an alliance with the leader of another Viking fleet, Sidroc, who betrayed him, resulting in Erispoe&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the Vikings. A weakened Erispoe ruled until 857 when he was assassinated and then followed as Breton ruler by his cousin and rival, Salomon, the Count of Rennes and Nantes. Viking raids continued. Alan I successfully defeated one wave of Vikings around 900, expanding the kingdom to include not only the Breton territories of Léon, Domnonée, Cornouaille, and the Vannetais, but also the Frankish counties of Rennes, Nantes, Coutances, and Avranches, as well as the western parts of Poitou and Anjou. Alan I&#x27;s military success resulted in a period of peace from Viking invasions and few raids from the Vikings were recorded from 900 through to 907.

After Alan I&#x27;s death in 907, Brittany was overrun once again by Vikings. Fulk the Red, Count of Anjou, is said to have occupied Nantes from 907 to 919 when he abandoned it to the invading Vikings. In 919, the great Viking fleet of Rognvaldr landed in Nantes, quickly coming to dominate the region. This invasion accelerated the exodus of Bretons, including that of the &quot;machtierns&quot;, &quot;the local hereditary officers upon whom the civil administration depended&quot;. Among the refugees were Mathedoi, the Count of Poher, and his son Alan Barbetorte, the grandson of Alan I; they fled to England and lived in exile in the courts of Edward the Elder and Edward&#x27;s son and successor Æthelstan. The Viking occupation of Brittany lasted until about 936. Little recorded history of this period is available until Alan Barbetorte returned in 937 to expel the Vikings and reestablish a version of the former Carolingian kingdom.

==History==
===10th century===
The Duchy of Brittany emerged after Alan Barbetorte&#x27;s return to the region from England in 936. Barbetorte claimed the titles of the Count of Cornouaille and Nantes and, as Alan II, reigned as the new &quot;Brittonum dux&quot;. Using a network of small, defended towns and monastic sites, Alan pushed back the Viking advances. On 1 August 939, with the aid of Judicael Berengar, Count of Rennes, and Hugh I, Count of Maine, he defeated the Vikings in the Battle of Trans-la-Forêt, completing their expulsion from Brittany. Alan&#x27;s duchy was smaller than the previous Kingdom of Brittany, as, despite gaining Magues and Tiffauges in the south, the dukes no longer ruled over the regions of Cotentin, Avranchin, and Mayenne. Alan paid homage to Louis IV of France for Brittany in 942. Despite some older Celtic influences, the new duchy was in many ways similar to the other, post-Carolingian states forming across the region. Over the coming decades, a network of powerful local lords emerged across Brittany, occupying motte and bailey castles and owing a loose feudal loyalty to the duke. The east of Brittany was the first to change, but the practices spread over the next fifty years to the more remote regions of the north- and south-west.

Alan II was also allied to Theobald I of Blois, the count of Chartres. Alan II had married Theobald&#x27;s sister, Adelaide, giving Theobald influence all the way to Rennes. However Alan II&#x27;s death left a void in Brittany leaving it vulnerable to encroachment by either the Normans or the Angevins. In turn the recently widowed Fulk II, Count of Anjou, Theobald&#x27;s ally, married Alan II&#x27;s widow. Upon his death, Alan II was succeeded by his son Drogo. Drogo&#x27;s rule set the precedent for the role of a regent during the minority of a ducal heir. Throughout his reign, Drogo was under the shared regency of his uncle the Count of Blois, Theobald I (who entrusted the administration of the duchy to Wicohen, Archbishop of Dol, and the Count of Rennes Juhel Berengar as administrators), and his stepfather, the Fulk II, Count of Anjou.

Under Drogo, the duchy continued to experience political instability and he was unable to sustain his line. Drogo died in 958. Two of Alan II&#x27;s illegitimate sons, Hoël and Guerich, attempted to act as Counts of Nantes and preserve their claim to duchy but were eventually unsuccessful. In 990 Juhel Berengar&#x27;s son Conan I, the grandson of Pascweten, became Duke and the title passed to the House of Rennes. Conan I ruled for only two years and died fighting against his brother-in-law Fulk III, Count of Anjou at the Battle of Conquereuil on 27 June 992. He was succeeded by his oldest son Geoffrey I. Blois threatened Conan&#x27;s succession. Duke Geoffrey I, a member of the House of Nantes, entered into a dynastic alliance with Richard II, Duke of Normandy in a diplomatic double marriage between the two houses. The church-sanctioned marriage ceremonies were held at Mont Saint-Michel. Geoffrey I married Hawise of Normandy, Richard II&#x27;s sister; and Richard II married Judith of Brittany, Geoffrey I&#x27;s sister and Conan I&#x27;s daughter.

===11th century===

The 11th century was marked by a failed alliance with Normandy. William the Conqueror challenged the Breton dukes, and they formed an alliance with the French king. 
The death of Geoffrey I, in 1008, allowed Richard II to intervene directly in Brittany during the minority of his nephew, Alan III, against rebellious counts who attempted to take advantage of the youthful duke. The guardianship would be reciprocated later when Alan III was named as one of the primary guardians of William of Normandy. By designating Alan III as a guardian of William, Robert I was &quot;involving a close family member who would not compete with his heir&quot;. In his guardianship of Duke William, Alan III was allied with Count Gilbert and Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen, William&#x27;s uncles. However, when Archbishop Robert died in 1037 instability surfaced. Alan III countered the instability by reinforcing the power of the Norman ducal house providing Robert I&#x27;s two youngest brothers with land and title. However, by October 1, 1040, Alan III was killed by poison while besieging a rebel castle in Vimoutiers. Tension increased in Normandy following his death, with Count Gilbert dying shortly thereafter. A rival faction in the guardianship of Normandy emerged, one that would intervene in Brittany, suppressing Alan III&#x27;s heir, Conan II, from claiming his inheritance.

At around eight years of age, Conan II succeeded his father Alan III as Duke of Brittany, with the ducal regency entrusted to Alan&#x27;s brother Odo, Count of Penthièvre. However, by the time Conan II reached his majority at age sixteen, around 1048, Odo refused to relinquish power. During the dynastic conflict between uncle and nephew, Hoel of Cornouaille supported Odo in suppressing Conan&#x27;s inheritance. Odo was Hoèl&#x27;s brother-in-law as he was married to Hoel&#x27;s sister Agnes of Cornouaille. By 1057, Conan II captured and imprisoned Odo. He came to terms with Hoèl of Cornouaille later that year. Conan II faced numerous threats posed by the pro-Norman faction in Brittany, including revolts sponsored by William, Duke of Normandy for whom Conan&#x27;s father had served as Guardian. William supported challengers to Conan&#x27;s authority, encouraging them to rebel against the Breton duke, his cousin. William continued courting the family of Odo, who was imprisoned. In response, Conan promoted his own legitimate claim as Duke of Normandy over William, as the Catholic Church began preferring legitimate heirs born in church-sanctioned marriage over out-of-wedlock issue. This rivalry led to war between Normandy and Brittany. 
The 1064–1065 war between Brittany and Normandy (the Breton-Norman War) was sparked after Duke William supported the rebellion against Conan II led by Rivallon I of Dol. In 1065, before his invasion of Anglo-Saxon England, William of Normandy warned his rivals in Brittany and Anjou to abstain from any attacks on his duchy, on the grounds that his mission bore the papal banner. However, Conan II rebuffed the warning and declared that he would press any advantage against William. While William plotted to take the English crown, Conan consolidated his authority in Brittany and planned to take advantage of William&#x27;s absence to invade Normandy. First, however, he needed to neutralize Anjou, another historic rival. Once Anjou was pacified he planned to advance into Maine and then into Normandy. However, during his 1066 siege of Angers, Conan was found dead after wearing poisoned riding gloves. Duke William was widely suspected of organizing the assassination.

William the Conqueror successfully invaded England in 1066 with an army that included some Bretons. William was able to attract Bretons into his expeditionary army for the upcoming campaign to claim the English crown., perhaps in part because the Breton commanders in Duke William&#x27;s army were the second-sons of Breton lords, such as Alain Le Roux (son of Eudas of Penthièvre). The Bretons within the Conquest army represented at least three major groupings, two of which would become relevant to the long-term future of the duchy. One group was represented by Ralph de Gael, briefly the Earl of Suffolk. In 1075 he was among the leaders of a &quot;Breton revolt&quot;. Ralph escaped returning to Brittany where he also revolted against the Breton Duke before eventually reconciling with the duchy. To the south and west of England, William granted lands to groups of Breton nobles who were more fractious than united, whether in Brittany or in England. This group had no one singular leader who could serve a unifying role . Their numbers included Herve of Leon, the viscount of Leon, who was briefly the Earl of Wiltshire. The third group were those nobles associated with the Richmond-Penthièvre family. Odo of Penthièvre was a principal antagonist of Conan II. Under William I, three of Odo of Penthièvre&#x27;s sons (Alan, Stephen and Brien) were granted substantial lands in England, including the Honour of Richmond, lands in Suffolk, and the Earldoms of Richmond and Cornwall.

Also in 1066, Hawise succeeded her brother Conan II as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. She married Hoël of Cornouaille. Hoel ruled as Hoel II, Duke of Brittany and started the House of Kernev which continued to rule Brittany until 1156 (see below). Hoël inherited a divided Brittany which was split into six largely independent regions: Rennes, Panthièvre, Léon, Cornouaille, the Broërec, and Nantes. Ducal power was non-existent in Panthièvre and Léon, and even in the rest of Brittany the duke&#x27;s powers did not extend beyond his own personal lands. The barons in Brittany did not feel that they were in any way vassals of the duke, owing him service in exchange for their lands, and only attended the ducal courts when they felt it was in their own interests to do so.
However, the historic rivalry between Brittany and Normandy resurfaced at the close of the 11th century. By 1075, Hoèl returned to the traditional Breton policy of opposing Norman expansion with an alliance with the young king Philip I of France. Ralph de Gael, in exile in Brittany after the unsuccessful 1075 rebellion in England, led incursions into Normandy from his base in Dol. In 1076, King William of England retaliated by leading an army into Brittany to eject Ralph, but was met with a rare defeat by an allied army of Bretons and French forces. In the peace negotiations which followed William offered his second daughter Constance in marriage to the Breton heir Alan IV, though nothing came of the betrothal at the time.

By 1086, Alan IV was forced to abandon his duchy after an invasion launched by William I of England. However, a peace settlement was reached that same year and in the negotiations that followed Alan IV was forced into marriage with King William I&#x27;s second daughter Constance of England. The marriage ceremonies may have taken place in Bayeux in Normandy. William of Malmesbury wrote that Constance was unpopular at the Breton court because of her &#x27;severe and conservative&#x27; manner. William of Malmesbury also alleged that Alan IV had Constance poisoned to death, but this was unverified However, Orderic Vitalis wrote that as duchess, Constance did all she could to further the welfare of the Bretons, who grieved deeply at her death in 1090.

In 1092, Alan IV donated property to Redon Abbey by charter, and by 1093, married his second wife, Ermengarde of Anjou as part of a political alliance with Fulk IV, Count of Anjou to counter Anglo-Norman influence. With Ermengarde, he had a son, Geoffrey, who died young, Conan III, and a daughter Hawise. Hawise was married to count Baldwin VII of Flanders. In 1098, Alan IV joined the First Crusade, leaving Brittany under the regency of his wife Ermengarde of Anjou until his return early in the 12th century. Ermengarde ruled from Nantes rather than Rennes, as it was closer to her home county of Anjou.

===12th century===

Alan IV returned from Crusade in 1101. In 1112, Alan IV&#x27;s son Conan III inherited Brittany on the abdication of his father, who retired to the monastery of Redon. By 1113, Conan III married Maude, an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. With Maude he had three children, Hoel, Bertha, and Constance. During his reign he strengthened the rule of the duchy.

During the dynastic struggle between Stephen of England (Stephen of Blois) and the dispossessed Empress Matilda, Conan III allied himself with King Stephen. Empress Matilda&#x27;s unpopular marriage with Geoffrey V of Anjou was forced upon her by her father Henry I. It reflected the historic rivalry between Brittany, Normandy, and Anjou.

Conan III sought to counter Angevin influence and preserve Breton independence. In his alliance with Stephen, Conan III looked for greater influence with Stephen, who needed allies on the continent to out-flank Matilda. Matilda was able to consolidate power in Normandy and Anjou. Brittany&#x27;s position to the west of the Angevin controlled territory exposed a wide frontier for Stephen to exploit against Matilda.

In 1138, Conan III&#x27;s daughter, Bertha, was married to Alan of Penthièvre, a supporter of King Stephen. For his support, Stephan created Conan&#x27;s son-in-law Alan as 1st Earl of Richmond in the second creation, a title previously held by Alan&#x27;s uncle Alain Le Roux. Later, when Alan died in 1146, Bertha returned home to Brittany from England. On his death-bed in 1148, Conan III disinherited his son Hoel, Count of Nantes from succession to the duchy. With this surprise move, Bertha became his heiress and successor as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. However, Hoel was to retain the county of Nantes.

Duchess Bertha, as dowager countess of Richmond, continued Brittany&#x27;s alliance with Stephen&#x27;s England against the Angevins. However this strategy became untenable after 1153, when Stephen&#x27;s son Eustace died suddenly. Eustace&#x27;s death provided an opportunity for Matilda&#x27;s son, Henry FitzEmpress, to land an invasion army in England and press for his mother&#x27;s claims. In the Treaty of Wallingford, Stephen was forced to recognize Henry FitzEmpress as his heir, with Matilda abdicating her claim in her son&#x27;s favour. The treaty exposed Brittany to retaliatory incursions from Henry FitzEmpress and his brother Geoffery FitzEmpress.

On the death of Bertha in early 1156, her son, Conan IV, expected to inherit the ducal throne. However, he was denied his inheritance by his stepfather Odo, Viscount of Porhoët (also known as Odo II), Bertha&#x27;s second husband; Odo II refused to relinquish his authority over Brittany. To consolidate his hold on power, Odo II entered into a pact with the disinherited Hoel, Count of Nantes, to divide Brittany between them. But at the same time, Hoel was under threat of rebellion in Nantes, sponsored by Geoffrey Fitzempress, and he could not send any aid to Eudas. Conan IV landed in Brittany and took Rennes, while his ally Raoul de Fougères captured and imprisoned Eudas. Conan IV was formally enthroned as Duke of Brittany in Rennes. While Conan IV was consolidating his inheritance in 1156, Geoffrey FitzEmpress successfully took Nantes from Hoel.

Upon Geoffrey&#x27;s death in 1158, Conan IV seized Nantes, reuniting the Duchy once again. However, Henry II, now King of England, seized the Earldom of Richmond, Conan&#x27;s paternal inheritance. Henry demanded the return of Nantes, and when he obtained control of it from Conan IV, became the Count of Nantes, without obligation to the Duke of Brittany (later dukes would eventually reunite Nantes to Brittany).

Henry II of England continued to stoke revolts and rebellions in Brittany against Conan IV. In response, Conan IV took the Breton counties of Tréguier and Guingamp from his uncle Count Henri, a supporter of Henry II of England. Richmond was returned to Conan IV later that year in an agreement reached with Henry II of England.
By 1160 Conan was forced to yield to Henry. In the peace negotiations which followed, Conan was obliged to marry Henry&#x27;s cousin, Margaret of Scotland, in 1160.

Later, Conan IV was faced with additional revolts from barons, possibly sponsored by Henry II. Conan appealed to Henry II for aid to end the revolts. For his aid Henry II insisted on the betrothal of Conan&#x27;s only daughter and heiress Constance to Henry&#x27;s son Geoffrey Plantagenet, continuing the policy of interweaving the Breton succession with the Plantagenet&#x27;s succession. 

Upon her father&#x27;s abdication in 1166, Constance became duchess, although Henry II held the Duchy until Constance married Geoffrey. Geoffrey and Constance ruled jointly until 1186, when Geoffrey was stamped to death in a riding accident during a tournament in Paris. Constance thereafter ruled the Duchy on her own. Henry II of England next arranged for Constance to marry Ranulph de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester on 3 February 1188 or 1189. Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by Richard I as King of England. Lacking a male heir, King Richard I of England officially proclaimed his nephew, Constance&#x27;s son, Arthur I of Brittany, as his heir presumptive in a treaty signed with Philip Augustus and Tancred of Sicily.

To promote her son&#x27;s position and inheritance, Constance, Duchess of Brittany included Arthur in the government of Brittany in 1196. The same year, Constance&#x27;s marriage with Ranulph deteriorated, with Ranulph imprisoning Constance. Her imprisonment sparked rebellion across Brittany on her behalf. Ranulph bowed to growing pressure and had the Duchess released in 1198. Once back in Brittany, Constance had her marriage to Ranulph annulled in 1199 (there was no issue from this marriage). Later that year, Constance took Guy of Thouars as her &#x27;second&#x27; husband at Angers. Throughout these years, Constance advised her son Arthur towards a French alliance, pursuing the policy of her late husband Geoffrey II, despite his designation as Richard I&#x27;s heir. In Constance bore Guy of Thouars two or three daughters. The first born, Alix of Thouars, was followed by Catherine of Thouars (1201-c. 1240) and maybe Margaret of Thouars (1201-c. 1216/1220). Constance died due to complications during the delivery.

===13th century===

In the 13th century England&#x27;s alliance with Brittany collapsed under King John of England. When Richard I died in 1199, Philip agreed to recognize Arthur of Brittany as count of Anjou, Maine, and Poitou, in exchange for Arthur swearing fealty to him, and thereby becoming a direct vassal of France. However, in 1202, 15-year-old Arthur was captured by the English while besieging Mirebeau. By 1203, the imprisoned Arthur was transferred to Rouen, under the charge of William de Braose, the court favorite of King John. Arthur vanished mysteriously in April 1203. Arthur&#x27;s legal successor was Eleanor of Brittany. However John of England had Eleanor captured and imprisoned at Corfe Castle in Dorset.

Recognizing that John of England could have Eleanor married to a vassal loyal to England, who would rule Brittany through her, Philip II formally recognized Constance&#x27;s infant daughter Alix as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. Initially Alix&#x27;s father Guy of Thouars acted as regent. Philip II of France was maneuvering to keep Brittany within his sphere of influence. The marriage of the infant Alix to Capetian cadet Pierre Mauclerc in 1213, began the new House of Dreux. After Guy of Thouars&#x27; regency, Alix ruled as nominal duchess with her husband Pierre as Duke &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. In 1214, King John sent an expedition into France, in part to establish Eleanor as his puppet duchess, but after his defeat also recognized Alix and Peter as rulers of the Duchy. Eleanor was kept captive in England until her death in 1241, ending the line of Geoffrey II.

In 1235, the stage was set for the next century&#x27;s Breton War of Succession when Peter I dispossessed the heir of the Penthièvre Dynasty in order to give the countship of Penthièvre to his second child, Yolande.

Beginning in the 13th century, the Duchy of Brittany experienced nearly a century of peace. Peter I continued as Regent for a time for his son John I. When John I reached his majority, Peter I ceded him the Ducal crown and left Brittany on Crusade. John I married Blanche of Navarre. Upon the death of his sister Yolande of Brittany, John I seized the countship of Penthièvre for himself. John I in turn was succeeded by his son John II. John II married Beatrice of England and ruled until 1305.

===14th century===
In the 14th century, the Breton War of Succession ensued; the title of Duke passed to the House of Montfort. John II died in 1305 and was succeeded by this son, Arthur II as Duke. Arthur II ruled independently of the French crown. His reign included several administrative innovations including the creation of several &quot;battles&quot; or districts meant to provide a stronger defense, and the creation of the Estates of Brittany, marking a critical step towards a parliamentary form of government. Arthur II&#x27;s reign is also distinguished by his two marriages, the first to Mary of Limoges and the second to Yolande of Dreux, Queen of Scotland.

Arthur II&#x27;s son by Mary of Limoges, John III became Duke but failed to produce a living heir, despite three marriages. John III&#x27;s succession efforts were focused on his attempts to deny his half brother, John of Montfort from inheriting the Ducal Crown. He attempted to name the King of France as heir in an act that defied all precedents to maintain Brittany as an independent sovereign state. The Breton nobles predictably rejected the attempt and Brittany&#x27;s independence continued. John III died in 1341 without a succession plan.

John III&#x27;s half-brother, John of Montfort, claimed the title of Duke, but his claim was rejected by the King of France who favored the competing claims of Joan of Penthièvre and her husband Charles of Blois, who also claimed the Ducal title. The Breton War of Succession between the claimants ensued when John of Montfort refused to cede his rights in their favor. The Breton War of Succession was fought from 1341 to 1364 between these two Breton houses, the House of Blois Châtillon and the House of Montfort.

Charles of Blois Châtillon claimed the title Duke of Brittany from 1341 to his death.

During the war, John of Montfort was imprisoned in Paris. Hostilities abated for a short time, and he was freed under the Treaty of Malestroit in 1341. He died in 1345, leaving his son John as the Montfort claimant to the ducal title. John&#x27;s widowed Duchess Consort, Joanna of Flanders, acted as regent for her son John and continued the war in his name. The House of Montfort emerged victorious with substantial help from English allies Under the terms of their surrender, Joan was allowed to keep Penthièvre and retained the title Duchess of Brittany for life. Under the Treaties of Guerande, semi-Salic succession was agreed under which, if the reigning member of the House of Montfort died without legitimate male issue, the eldest direct legitimate male descendant of Joan would inherit the Ducal crown of Brittany. John IV, Duke of Brittany ruled with difficulty after the Breton civil war, and was forced into exile in England for a second time in 1373 where he lived in the court of Edward III.

The House of Montfort&#x27;s victory strengthened the position of England in Brittany. One of the effects of the Breton War of Succession was to intensify the rivalries between England and France with Brittany as the contested prize. The Houses of Penthièvre and Montfort were united in the sense of their opposition to the attempted annexation of Brittany by Charles V of France as a consequence of this Breton civil war. The French king sent the Constable of France, Bertrand de Guesclin, into Brittany with the goal of uniting it to the French crown. When the Breton nobles rebelled against this proposed unification, John IV was able to return from England, assisted once again by a strong army including his English ally, and was able to re-establish his rule. The deposed Joan of Penthièvre joined in the efforts to return John IV to Brittany to defend the Duchy against the advances of Charles V. John IV had three wives but only his third wife, Joan of Navarre, Queen of England, bore him children. John IV died on 1 November 1399. Joan remained a widow for four years acting as a regent for her son John V. The House of Montfort&#x27;s difficulties in maintaining the Ducal crown continued when John V, Duke of Brittany succeeded his father. By 1417, the Duke of Brittany were styled &quot;rulers by the Grace of God&quot;.

===15th century===

The intrigues and contests between the House of Montfort and the House of Penthièvre continued well after the Breton War of Succession. John IV&#x27;s successor, John V, Duke of Brittany, was kidnapped by the grandson of Joan of Penthièvre. He was freed through the efforts of his wife the Duchess of Brittany, Joan of France and the remaining wealth of the Penthièvre family was confiscated. John V was succeeded first by his son Francis I. Since Francis I had no male heir, he was followed by a younger son of John V, Peter II. When Peter II died without issue, the Ducal Crown passed to his uncle Arthur III. He was, in turn, succeeded by his nephew Francis II.

The reign of Francis II was notable in many respects including two wars against Charles VIII of France, both of which were lost, the establishment of the Parlement of Rennes, and the death of all of his children save for his daughter Anne of Brittany. Francis II&#x27;s rule as Duke was also marked by continued intrigues with the House of Penthièvre. Joan of Penthièvre&#x27;s later descendants, the Brosse line of the House of Penthièvre through Jean de Brosse, were denied their claims to the Ducal Crown in the 15th century, possibly as an alteration of the rules of inheritance by the then Duke of Brittany Francis II. The wars with France eventually cost Ducal Brittany its independence, while the Parlement ensured a degree of autonomy that would continue through the reign of Louis XIV of France. That Francis II&#x27;s sole heir was his daughter Anne assured an inheritance contest on his death that would pit the power of the House of Montfort against conflicting treaty obligations to the House of Penthièvre in Brittany, and the House of Valois in France, and would also be a test of the Breton tradition of semi-Salic law in which a daughter could be the principal inheritor. The position of the King of France dominated these events through two wars. After the first war, under the Treaty of Verger, the marriage of Francis II&#x27;s sole surviving issue, Anne, would need to be approved by the King of France.

Francis II worked to seek a husband for Anne who would be strong enough to defend Brittany from further influence from the French Crown. Duchesse Anne of Brittany was initially betrothed to Edward, Prince of Wales, the son of Edward IV of England, but upon the king&#x27;s death his son disappeared and the English throne passed to Richard III of England. Anne was then married to Maximillian I of Austria.

However, relations between Brittany and France deteriorated and Francis II was forced into the last Franco-Breton war, which he lost. At the end of the second war between Francis II and Charles VIII of France, the so-called Mad War, Anne of Brittany&#x27;s first marriage to Maximillian was declared illegal on the basis that the French King had not approved it under the terms of the Treaty of Verger. Anne was married to Charles VIII of France in a ceremony that was validated by Pope Innocent VIII. Once they were married, Charles did not allow Anne to use the title Duchess of Brittany. However, upon his death, Anne returned to Brittany and took steps to return the Duchy to independent rule under herself as Duchess. The children of Charles and Anne did not reach adulthood and this presented a new Breton succession problem as well as one for France. Both succession issues were solved upon Anne&#x27;s marriage to Louis XII of France but at the cost of restoring and furthering the independence of Brittany.

In 1499, the birth of Anne of Brittany&#x27;s sole heir with Louis XII of France, her daughter Claude of France, introduced a new succession issue in Brittany and France. In Brittany, with the provisions of the Treaty of Guerande set aside by the Estates of Brittany, Claude could claim to be Duchess of Brittany in her own right, as several Duchesses by right of inheritance had done over the centuries. France, however operated under strict Salic law, requiring a male heir. The French requirement was solved upon Claude&#x27;s marriage to Francis I of France. The birth of Claude&#x27;s sons Francis (who became Francis III, Duke of Brittany, as well as the Dauphin of France) and Henry II of France represented a resolution to these contrasting succession issues but accelerated the loss of Brittany&#x27;s independence and the eventual disappearance of the Ducal title as an independent sovereign Ducal crown.

===16th century===

Anne of Brittany&#x27;s second marriage making her Queen Consort of France continued into the 16th century; and she died in 1514. Queen Claude of France, reigned as duchess of Brittany from 1514, but under her husband king Francis was not able to maintain an independent government in the Duchy of Brittany. Claude&#x27;s son Francis I was invested as duke of Brittany. But this act meant next to nothing to advance Breton independence. Some members of the House of Penthièvre were appointed as royal governors of Brittany by the French. Their failure to reassert their Ducal rights successfully hastened the merger of the Ducal crown into the Kingdom of France. At this time the title Duke of Brittany began to lose independent sovereign status and began to become only titular in character; the Breton region lost independence and became a province of France.

During the Middle Ages, the Kings of France considered that the Duchy of Brittany was feudally a part of their Kingdom of France (i.e. it was within the traditional borders of the realm, and the King of France was deemed to be overlord of the Duchy). In practice, however, the Duchy of Brittany was a largely independent sovereign state.

The independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, Anne, but King Charles VIII of France, determined to bring the territory under royal control, had her marriage annulled and then forced her to marry him in a series of actions that were acknowledged by the Pope. As a result, the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Brittany were placed in the personal union of their marriage, and the King of France also held the title of Duke of Brittany &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. During their marriage, Charles VIII prohibited Anne of Brittany from using the title Duchess of Brittany, and imposed a Royal Governor from the House of Penthièvre on the Duchy.

Legally, however, the Duchy remained separate from France proper; the two titles were linked only by the marriage of the King and Queen and, in 1498 when Charles VIII died childless, the title &quot;Duke of Brittany&quot; remained with Anne, rather than passing to the heir of France, Louis XII. Anne of Brittany returned to Brittany and began to re-establish an independent sovereign rule. However, the new French king, Louis XII married Anne himself, and so the King of France was once more Duke of Brittany &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. Legally, Brittany still remained distinct, and its future remained dependent on the Ducal bloodline, now held by the House of Montfort. When Anne died, Brittany passed to her daughter and heiress, Claude, rather than remaining with the King of France, her father.

Claude married the future King of France, Francis I. By this marriage, and through the succession to the French crown, the King of France became Duke of Brittany &quot;jure uxoris&quot; once more.
Claude&#x27;s death in 1524 separated the Duchy from the crown again, and (it would transpire) for the final time. Because Claude, like her mother, was sovereign Duchess, the title of &#x27;Duke&#x27; did not remain with her husband, but instead passed to her son, Francis III of Brittany, who was also Dauphin of France. Legally, the Crown and Duchy were again separate, but the Duke was a child, and the Duchy had been governed as an integral part of France for years; the King had little trouble in maintaining royal control over the Duchy. Breton independence was effectively ended when in 1532 the Estates of Brittany proclaimed the perpetual union of Brittany with the French crown. Legally, the Duchy was part of France.

Francis III remained Duke of Brittany, but died without attaining the French crown in 1536. He was succeeded by his brother Henry, who was the first person to become both King of France and Duke of Brittany in his own right. Any trace of Breton independence ended with the ascension of Henry, as Henry II of France, to the French throne. The French Crown and Breton Duchy were now united by inheritance, and the merging of Brittany into France was thus completed. Henry II was not crowned separately as Duke of Brittany. However Henry attempted to create a separate legal status for Brittany vis-a-vis the Kingdom of France similar to the position of the Duchy of Cornwall to the Kingdom of Great Britain. In some histories it is meant to be a ducal territory he would attempt to preserve for himself and his heirs if he were to lose the French Crown. This attempt at legal separation did not survive his reign.

When Henry III (last direct male from Claude of France) died, Brittany passed as part of the Crown to the next heir of France, Henry of Navarre, rather than to Claude&#x27;s most senior heirs (either Henry II, Duke of Lorraine or Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia). While these nobles were technically Henry&#x27;s heirs, there were problems with both claimants to the Ducal crown. The most important issue was that the crown, as a Sovereign Duke, could not be separated from that of the French Crown. Meanwhile, the French Crown and the Spanish Crown had been permanently separated beginning with the reign of Philip of Spain.

In 1582, Henry III of France, last living male-line grandson of Claude, Duchess of Brittany, made Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur, his brother-in-law and a leader of Catholic League, governor of Brittany. Invoking the hereditary rights of his wife Marie de Luxembourg, he endeavoured to make himself independent in that province from 1589 onward, and organized a government at Nantes, proclaiming their young son Philippe Louis de Lorraine-Mercœur &quot;prince and duke of Brittany&quot;. (Infanta Isabella was the eldest daughter of the eldest sister of Henry III but being female weakened her status, and her position as Infanta all but blocked inheritance to the Breton Duchy.) Through maternal ancestry he was the direct primogenitural heir of Duchess Joan, of the House of Penthièvre, wife of Charles of Blois. Mercœur organized a government at Nantes, supported by the Spaniards. He prevented Henry IV&#x27;s attempts to subjugate Brittany until 20 March 1598, when Mercœur was forced to surrender. Henry IV then had one of his own illegitimate sons marry the young daughter of the Mercœurs, and thereby assured direct French control of the province. Mercœur subsequently went in exile to Hungary.

The title &quot;Duke of Brittany&quot; largely ceased to be used as a title of the King of France. When it appeared the title was bestowed by the King of France to one of his direct descendants, and was in any event titular in status.

===17th and 18th centuries===

Under the Kings of France the nobles of Brittany continued to enjoy the privileges that had been accorded them by the various independent Dukes of Brittany. Brittany&#x27;s Celtic legal traditions were maintained, to a degree, and the Estates of Brittany and the Parlement of Rennes were kept separate from the French parliamentary system in Paris. The Breton noble privileges protected in this parliamentary system included exemption from taxes, representation in the Breton Parlement, and the maintenance of Breton titles in the tradition of the Duchy rather than that of France, including, in theory, the application of Brittany&#x27;s form of semi-Salic, rather than pure Salic Law to the succession issues.

After Henry II, the title Duke of Brittany was not used for over 200 years. The title Duke of Brittany reappeared when a great-grandson of Louis XIV was named Louis, Duke of Brittany; He was the last holder of the title prior to the French Revolution and did not live to inherit the French throne. At his death the title in essence became defunct.

Claims on the titular Ducal title by Spanish nobles at various times were not to be considered legitimate by the French, and its use by Louis XIV demonstrated that as the title had merged into the crown of France only the King could assert the title himself or bestow it on another. Louis XIV&#x27;s actions with regard to the Ducal title also underscored the fact that the Spanish or cadet branch of the House of Bourbon had relinquished all French claims and inheritance rights as a condition of gaining the crown of Spain under the Treaty of Utrecht.

Shortly before the French Revolution the leaders of the Parlement of Rennes issued Remonstrances to Louis XVI, in part to remind the King of his duties as Duke and to preserve the privileges of the Breton people under the Treaty of Union. The King&#x27;s response was to close the Breton Parlement. The Remontrances were delivered to the King by Members of the Breton Parlement led by the Comte de Saisy de Kerampuil, and others.

When French King Louis XVI dissolved the Breton Parlement he did so to strengthen his claims as an absolute monarch (where a representative parliament was not necessary). He also did this to advance a centralized federal form of government, but in so doing preserved the nature of the Brittany&#x27;s autonomy by acknowledging its nobles&#x27; traditional privileges, and acted as the Duke of Brittany.

The Breton Parlement has not met since this event. During the French Revolution, the legal state of Brittany was dissolved by the French National Assembly. The province of Brittany was divided and replaced by the 5 departements that have continued in the modern French Republic.

==Society, culture and governance==

===Economy===
The north and western parts of the territory relied on a pastoral farming economy; the south-east enjoyed warmer weather and conducted mixed-arable and pastoral farming, based around small holdings. The region enjoyed a strong and diverse maritime economy including active ports of trade and fishing. Over the time of the Duchy, many currencies were present, and the Dukes of Brittany sometimes minted their own coins. Gold and silver were also used for trade.

===Folklore and legends===

In the 12th century, legends of Conan Meriadoc became popular in North-West Europe. By the 18th century these accounts had been described as mythical.

A reference is made by the chronicler Jordanes to a commander named Riothamus – the Celtic for &quot;supreme leader&quot; – fighting in the region on behalf of the Roman emperor around 470 but little other evidence exists for this period.

The chroniclers of Viking raids in Brittany and Normandy recounted that St Olaf raided the northern coast of Brittany in the area of the town of Dol.

===Role of the Catholic Church===

The Duchy was influenced by the growth of the major monastic orders in the wake of the Gregorian reforms of the 11th century. Backed by the Breton aristocracy, new churches and priories were built and the Church administration became more active. In the 13th century, the new mendicant orders spread across the towns of the Duchy, again with support of the lords who controlled the urban centres. These mendicant orders were popular, and became more so in the 15th century. Relics of local saints remained popular, but relics associated with central Catholic figures such as the Virgin Mary and John the Apostle became increasingly popular in the 13th and 14th centuries.

===Customs and laws===
The Duchy that formed in the 10th and the 11th centuries was a feudal society, with laws and customs run through a hierarchy of Breton lords, from the numerous holders of local castles through to the handful of counts and the Duke in the urban centres. This reliance on the mass of local lords was a break with the former Celtic and Carolingian polities in the region. The aristocracy in Breton were, as historians Galliou and Jones describe, &quot;conservative and tenancious&quot; in their outlook, but heavily influenced by French society and culture, which sometimes produced tensions with older, more local traditions and customs.

===Rise of parliamentary government===

The Estates of Brittany were founded by Arthur II who was considered completely independent of the Kingdom of France. He convoked the first Estates of Brittany in 1309. In addition to creating a parliamentary body, Arthur II added the innovation of including the Third Estate.

These parliamentary bodies figured prominently in the Breton War of Succession and helped to resolve the Ducal Claims of the House of Penthièvre in favor of the House of Montfort. The Estates of Brittany acted during the reign of Francis II, of the House of Montfort, to nullify provisions of the Treaty of Guerande and to confirm that Anne was Francis II&#x27;s sole and legal Ducal heir. The action in favor of Anne, Duchess of Brittany effectively ended the Ducal claims of the House of Penthièvre.

The Parlement of Rennes was founded in 1485 by Francis II and first met in Vannes. Later the Parlement was moved to Rennes where the Parlement building remains in use to today as a Court of Justice. Initially the Parlement of Rennes functioned as a sovereign court of justice and was designed, among other things, to protect the ancient rights of the Breton nobles. Many of its members were also members of the Estates of Brittany.

After the Duchy of Brittany was merged into the Crown of France, the Parlement of Rennes took on greater responsibility to manage and preserve the rights of the Duchy as separate from the Kingdom of France. While Henry II of France held all rights as Duke of Brittany he was neither frequently present in the Duchy nor entirely inclined to preserve the independent actions of its parliament. As the Kings of France moved to greater centralized authority under Louis XIV of France, Louis XV of France, and Louis XVI of France, tensions between the Kingdom and the Duchy grew. In September 1771, the Parlement was closed by order of Louis XVI of France; the National Assembly subsequently issued a French law to close the Parlement in 1790. The Parlement of Rennes met and they established that these actions had no force of law based on the Breton laws and traditions on which the Parliament had been founded. Notwithstanding this claim, the Parlement of Rennes has not met since 1790.

===Richmondshire===
Nobles from the Breton Ducal family who fought for William the Conqueror in 1066 were the first Lords of Richmond, and eventually the first in a series of Earls of Richmond in England. Alan Rufus was among William&#x27;s Earls and built Richmond Castle. Conan III allied himself with Stephen of England in his war against the dispossessed Empress Matilda. For his support, Stephen created Conan&#x27;s son-in-law Alan 1st Earl of Richmond.

Arthur III of Brittany (August 24, 1393 – December 26, 1458), was known as Arthur de Richemont, and was the titular Earl of Richmond. For eleven months at the very end of his life, Arthur was both Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort, after inheriting those titles upon the death of his nephew. After the death of Arthur&#x27;s father, John V of Brittany, the English refused to recognize his heirs as earls. Nevertheless, the Breton Dukes continued to style themselves &quot;Count of Richmond&quot;, while the English title was given to John of Lancaster (1389–1435) in 1414.

Francis II was host to Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII of England when he fled England to seek safety from Richard III of England. Brittany&#x27;s possessions in Richmond passed indisputably to England when Francis II, Duke of Brittany, surrendered his rights to Henry, thereby permitting him to take the title Earl of Richmond.

There is no modern-day Duchy of Brittany. The Duchy of Brittany and the sovereign title and role of the Duke of Brittany no longer exist in the modern 5th Republic of France. The Breton Parlement no longer exists. Its seat was in Rennes. It was disbanded by Louis XIV but the Parlement voted to ignore the King&#x27;s order of dissolution upon the claim it alone had the authority to dissolve this legislative and judicial body. Since 1956, there does exist the administrative Region of Brittany – which, however, includes only 80 percent of the former Duchy of Brittany. The remaining 20 percent of the former Duchy is the Loire-Atlantique department which now lies inside the Pays de la Loire region, whose capital, Nantes, was the historical capital of the Duchy of Brittany.

<text>Hilary Norman Peterson is a regular fictional character on the American television show &quot;Cheers&quot;. The character was portrayed by actor George Wendt and is named Hilary after his paternal grandfather.

Norm appeared in all 275 episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot; from 1982 to 1993 and was initially the only customer featured in the show&#x27;s main cast, later joined by best friend Cliff Clavin, Frasier Crane, and Lilith Sternin. Along with Sam Malone and Carla Tortelli, Norm is one of only three characters to appear in every episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;. He also made one guest appearance each in the three other sitcoms set in the &quot;Cheers&quot; universe: the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes,&quot; the &quot;Wings&quot; episode &quot;The Story of Joe&quot; and the spin-off &quot;The Tortellis.&quot;

==Casting and creation==
In the original script of the 1982 pilot, &quot;Give Me a Ring Sometime,&quot; there was no Norm Peterson (contrary to beliefs that Norm is one of the original characters). George Wendt and John Ratzenberger auditioned for the same role, originally named George, and Wendt was hired for that role. George was Diane Chambers&#x27;s first customer, appeared at the end of this episode, could not bear her long explanation of becoming a waitress, and had only one line consisting of one word: &quot;Beer!&quot; The writers expanded Wendt&#x27;s role, and the character evolved into Norm Peterson, the first onscreen customer to enter the bar and who &quot;badgered Diane rather than the other way around.&quot; Show co-creator Les Charles stated that the character was based on a frequent customer he met while working as a bartender during college.

Meanwhile, Ratzenberger suggested to the producers that a know-it-all character should be added, resulting in Cliff Clavin.

==Role==
Norm&#x27;s entrance into the bar is a running gag on &quot;Cheers&quot;, typically beginning with a greeting by Norm, usually &quot;Afternoon (or Evening), everybody!&quot;. This is followed by the bar crowd yelling his name (except Diane Chambers, who would follow them with a more refined &quot;Norman&quot;). Afterwards, someone, usually either Sam, Coach, or Woody (who addresses Norm as &quot;Mr. Peterson&quot;) will ask how Norm is doing, and what he&#x27;d like to order, and Norm usually responds with a witty remark, frequently about his life, and orders a beer. Norm is also greeted with the customary &quot;Norm!&quot; shout at other locations, including a bowling alley (&quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot;, season 4, episode 9), The Hungry Heifer (&quot;Cheers: The Motion Picture&quot;, season 5, episode 24), and Gary&#x27;s Olde Towne Tavern, Cheers&#x27; rival bar (&quot;Bar Wars VI&quot;, season 10, episode 23). When Sam asks why the people at Gary&#x27;s know him by name, Norm replies that he goes there on Christmas when Cheers is closed. A recurring gag in the series is, following a commercial, for the bartender to ask Norm if he wants another beer; Norm replies &quot;one quick one,&quot; after which he inevitably stays a lot longer. &quot;Norm&quot; is actually the first word of Frederick Crane, son of Frasier Crane and Lilith Sternin. (However, Lilith joyously believes that he said &quot;Mommy!&quot;)

Prior to the show, Norm was born in Chicago, and moved to Boston to become an accountant, and is a lifelong Boston Celtics fan who went to Boston Garden as a child. Norm previously served in the United States Coast Guard, though in an earlier episode he stated he had been in the Army. He loses his job in an accounting firm by defending Diane from his boss, and after struggling for few years as an independent accountant, eventually becomes a housepainter. Norm was also revealed to be an accomplished interior decorator and beer taster, capable of spotting a bad vat in a factory by drinking a single bottle.

Even when unemployed, Norm is the bar&#x27;s best customer. A running gag throughout the series are the numerous jokes made about the enormous size of Norm&#x27;s tab at &quot;Cheers&quot;: several large binders are shown as being just a portion of it. In the episode &quot;Home Malone&quot; (season 9, episode 24), when Woody&#x27;s rich, naïve girlfriend Kelly waitresses at Cheers to gain &quot;real-life experience,&quot; Norm convinces her that the tab is a record of the beers for which he has already paid, and for each new beer a mark should be erased. In the finale, Sam jokes that he has to have Norm&#x27;s total tab calculated by NASA. The only time he was seen to pay off any of his tab was when new manager Rebecca Howe temporarily cut him off after discovering he owed almost $850, but she agreed to payment in kind by him painting her office and apartment. This led to him setting up as a housepainter. As well, when Sam regains ownership of the bar in the ninth season, one of his first acts as owner is to eradicate all amounts owning on existing bar tabs (for which Norm is profoundly grateful). Norm also annually receives a complimentary beer on his birthday.

Norm&#x27;s best friend is postman and fellow barfly Cliff Clavin.

Norm&#x27;s wife Vera is often mentioned but her face is never seen. When she is finally shown, her face is covered in pie thrown by Diane (season 5, episode 9 &quot;Thanksgiving Orphans,&quot;) and the actress is uncredited. The only other times she is seen, viewers can see only her legs and at one time her waving from a car which drives past Cheers on her 15th wedding anniversary. Vera is the butt of many of Norm&#x27;s jokes, but on many occasions, Norm has professed secretly an undying love for his wife or defended her honor. He also refused to cheat on her in the episode &quot;Norm&#x27;s Big Audit&quot; where a female IRS agent was prepared to overlook his tax evasion if he did. He explained in this instance that he felt he was a bad husband but would not cheat on his wife as it would make him a bad person. Norm and Vera separated during the second season of &quot;Cheers&quot; but reconciled in the last episode of the season, contrasting the romance between Sam and Diane, who enjoyed a romance then bitterly broke up in that last episode. When Vera got a job at Melville&#x27;s, however, he was deeply disturbed by her proximity to him during his bar time. Vera was played by George Wendt&#x27;s real-life wife, Bernadette Birkett.

In the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Wife&quot; (season 9, episode 21), Vera tells Rebecca off-camera that Norm&#x27;s real first name is Hilary. He explains that he was named after his grandfather who &quot;once killed a man for laughing at him.&quot; Cliff asks if his grandfather really killed a man for laughing at his first name and Norm replies, &quot;Not exactly. He was a surgeon and he sort of botched an operation.&quot;

When not sipping beer at Cheers, Norm satisfies his hunger at an eatery called The Hungry Heifer, whose emblem is a young cow smacking her chops. The customers there greet him just the same as the Cheers patrons do. He knows the waitresses by name, and usually orders a meal called a Feeding Frenzy, a monstrous supply of corn and beef. He denigrated the eatery when he first visited it in season 2, but when the place was being shut down in season 9, he insinuated it was an important place to him throughout his life and said he knew the owner since at latest his college years. Corrine (played by Doris Grau), who worked at Cheers occasionally as a temp waitress, was a server at The Hungry Heifer and said the waitstaff knew Norm as &quot;the guy who comes back.&quot;

On a lark in college, he became an ordained minister of the Church of the Living Desert after seeing an advertisement in the back of a magazine.

In season 7, Sam takes a temporary bartending job in Cancún, Mexico. One of his patrons, Pepe, greatly resembles Norm in appearance and mannerisms.

==Other appearances==
George Wendt guest starred as Norm Peterson on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;’ first spinoff &quot;The Tortellis&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, which also guest starred Ted Danson, Rhea Perlman, Woody Harrelson, and John Ratzenberger as their respective characters. Years after &quot;Cheers&quot; ended, Wendt played Norm in a 2002 episode of its spinoff &quot;Frasier&quot;, where he got along famously with Martin Crane. (Martin: &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s some mug callus you&#x27;ve got there.&quot; Norm: &quot;Judging from your grip, I&#x27;d say you were a can man.&quot;) Norm was most recently seen in animated form, voiced by Wendt, on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in the episodes &quot;Road to Rupert&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot;. Domino&#x27;s Pizza released a commercial in February 2020 parodying &quot;Cheers&quot; (including the opening theme song and a Domino&#x27;s version of the Cheers sign) with Norm entering a Domino&#x27;s, surprised to find that no one knows his name. Norm&#x27;s face was scanned from a &quot;Cheers&quot; episode to replace a body double&#x27;s face.

==Cultural references==
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;, Barney Gumble walks into the newly successful and popular Moe&#x27;s Tavern to be greeted with the friendly cry of &quot;Barney!&quot; which satirizes Norm&#x27;s entrance When a bartender similar to Woody Boyd asks him how he is doing, Barney burps in response.
*In the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Swarley&quot;, Barney Stinson walks into Maclaren&#x27;s Pub to the greeting of &quot;Swarley!&quot; with the bartender Carl then playing the Cheers theme song. This was to make fun of Barney&#x27;s new nickname, and to reference Norm&#x27;s entrance to Cheers.
*An oblique homage of Norm appears in the series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (Season 6, Episode 12), &quot;Who Mourns for Morn?&quot; in the form of the character named Morn, a corpulent and rather silent alien who has an outstanding tab in Quark&#x27;s bar.
*Norm is referenced by name in the Adventure Time Episode; Simon &amp; Marcy after Simon finishes singing the Cheers Theme song

==Lawsuit==
In 1993, Wendt and Ratzenberger sued Host International for copyright infringement, trademark infringement, and violating the actors&#x27; personality rights. The company operated airport lounges styled similarly to &quot;Cheers&quot; which included two robots, one heavyset and the other a postal worker, which the actors claimed resembled Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. The lawsuit was declined at its first and second hearings. At the first, the judge ruled that the defendant did not violate copyright because Paramount Pictures had already granted it a license to produce &quot; Cheers&quot;-based bars. At the second, the judge ruled that the robots did not resemble the characters. In 1997, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed both rulings on the grounds that Paramount&#x27;s copyright claim might not have more weight than Wendt and Ratzenberger&#x27;s ownership of publicity and that the resemblance claim should be decided by a jury, not a judge. The case resulted in an undisclosed settlement in 2001 by Host International.

<doc id="286870" wikidata="Q786897" url="?curid=286870" title="Autocatalysis">
<text>In chemistry, a chemical reaction is said to be autocatalytic if one of the reaction products is also a catalyst for the same reaction. Many forms of autocatalysis are recognized.

A &quot;set&quot; of chemical reactions can be said to be &quot;collectively autocatalytic&quot; if a number of those reactions produce, as reaction products, catalysts for enough of the other reactions that the entire set of chemical reactions is self-sustaining given an input of energy and food molecules (see autocatalytic set).

==Examples==
Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters produces carboxylic acids that also catalyze the same reaction. Indeed, the observation of an accelerating hydrolysis of gamma valerolactone to gamma-hydroxyvaleric acid led to the introduction of the concept of autocatalysis in 1890.

The oxidation of hydrocarbons by air or oxygen is the basis of autoxidation. Like many radical reactions, the rate vs time plot shows a sigmoidal behavior, characteristic of autocatalysis. Many reactions of organic compounds with halogen involve autocatalytic radical mechanisms. For example the reaction of acetophenone with bromine to give phenacyl bromide.

Oscillating reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction are more complicated examples that involve autocatalysis. In such reactions the concentrations of some intermediates oscillate, as does the rate of formation of products. Other notable examples are the Lotka–Volterra equations for the predator-prey model, and the Brusselator model.

Autocatalysis applies also to reactions involving solids. Crystal growth provide dramatic examples of autocatalysis: the growth rate depends on the surface area of the growing crystal. The growth of metal films from solution using the technique of electroless plating is autocatalytic. The rate of plating accelerates after some deposition has occurred, i.e., nucleation.

==Mathematical description==

Autocatalytic reactions are those in which at least one of the products is also a reactant. A simple autocatalytic reaction can be written 
:formula_1

with the rate equations (for an elementary reaction)
:formula_2
:formula_3.

This reaction is one in which a molecule of species A interacts with a molecule of species B. The A molecule is converted into a B molecule. The final product consists of the original B molecule plus the B molecule created in the reaction.

The key feature of these rate equations is that they are nonlinear; the second term on the right varies as the square of the concentration of B. This feature can lead to multiple fixed points of the system, much like a quadratic equation can have two roots. Multiple fixed points allow for multiple states of the system. A system existing in multiple macroscopic states is more orderly (has lower entropy) than a system in a single state.

The concentrations of A and B vary in time according to
: formula_4
and
: formula_5.

For an irreversible reaction (i.e. formula_6) 
:formula_7
and 
:formula_8.
The graph for these equations is a sigmoid curve (specifically a logistic function), which is typical for autocatalytic reactions: these chemical reactions proceed slowly at the start (the induction period) because there is little catalyst present, the rate of reaction increases progressively as the reaction proceeds as the amount of catalyst increases and then it again slows down as the reactant concentration decreases. If the concentration of a reactant or product in an experiment follows a sigmoid curve, the reaction may be autocatalytic.

These kinetic equations apply for example to the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of some esters to carboxylic acids and alcohols. There must be at least some acid present initially to start the catalyzed mechanism; if not the reaction must start by an alternate uncatalyzed path which is usually slower. The above equations (which do not consider the alternate pathway) for the catalyzed mechanism would imply that the concentration of acid product remains zero forever.

===Asymmetric autocatalysis===
Asymmetric autocatalysis occurs when the reaction product is chiral and thus serves as a catalyst for its own production. Reactions of this type, such as the Soai reaction, have the property that they can amplify a very small enantiomeric excess into a large one. In another example, sodium chlorate crystallizes as an equilibrium mixture of left- and right-handed crystals. When seeded appropriated, saturated solutions of this salt (which is optically inactive), will produce batches of single enantiomeric crystals.

=== Possible role in origin of life ===
An early example of autocatalysis is the formose reaction, in which formaldehyde and base produce sugars and related polyols. Characteristic of autocatalysis, this reaction rate is extremely slow initially but accelerates with time. This kind of reaction has often been cited as being relevant to the origin of life.

Autocatalysis is one explanation for abiogenesis. Illustrative is the reaction amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl ester in the presence of amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). This experiment demonstrated that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which could be interpreted as a rudimentary form of natural selection, and that certain environmental changes (such as irradiation) could alter the chemical structure of some of these self-replicating molecules (an analog for mutation) in such ways that could either boost or interfere with its ability to react, thus boosting or interfering with its ability to replicate and spread in the population.

<doc id="286872" wikidata="Q5041116" url="?curid=286872" title="Carla Tortelli">
<text>Carla Maria Victoria Angelina Teresa Apollonia Lozupone Tortelli LeBec, commonly known as Carla Tortelli, is a fictional character in the American television show &quot;Cheers&quot;, portrayed by Rhea Perlman. Outwardly, at least, Carla is a sarcastic woman who often mocks and makes jabs at others. She had five children with her then-husband Nick when the series started and eight children with three different men when it ended.

Carla appeared in all 275 episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot; in 1982–1993 and guest-starred in &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;, an episode of the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;. She has also appeared in &quot;Cheers&quot;, an episode of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;; &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the pilot episode of the short-lived spinoff &quot;The Tortellis&quot;. Along with Sam Malone and Norm Peterson, she is one of only three characters to appear in every episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;.

==Casting==

According to an interview with Ted Danson, Perlman was the first person of all actors to be hired as part of a cast ensemble and then was cast as Carla Tortelli, &quot;a wisecracking, cynical waitress&quot;. Before she starred as Carla, she worked once as a waitress in a New York City restaurant, serving meals like spaghetti and fish. Also, she was trained in the Bull &amp; Finch Pub (now called Cheers Beacon Hill) by a waitress to prepare her character. Perlman previously appeared as Louie DePalma&#x27;s (Danny DeVito) sweet and kind girlfriend, in contrast to tomboy Carla, on &quot;Taxi&quot;.

==Development==
When the show premiered in 1982, &quot;feisty&quot;, &quot;worldly-wise&quot;, Catholic and highly superstitious waitress Carla Tortelli has four children to support, fathered by her ex-husband Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya): Anthony (Timothy Williams), Serafina (Leah Remini), Gino (Josh Lozoff), and Anne Marie (Risa Littman). During their marriage, he was a deadbeat father and disloyal, unfaithful husband to Carla by cheating on her with other women. Over time, she gives birth to four more children: Lucinda (Sabrina Wiener) fathered by Nick; Ludlow, nicknamed Lud (Jarrett Lennon), by Frasier&#x27;s mentor Dr. Bennett Ludlow (James Karen); and twins Elvis (Danny Kramer) and Jesse (Thomas Tulak) by Eddie Lebec (Jay Thomas), a then-ice hockey player who later becomes an ice show performer. All children but one (Lud) turn out to be unruly, rotten, and spoiled. They defy whoever is substituting for their mother Carla, including babysitters.

Carla has siblings, including two sisters (younger Annette (also played by Perlman) and Angeline) and two brothers (including Sal). Six of her siblings are older. In &quot;The Cranemakers&quot; (1989), according to Whitney Norris (James R. Winker), representative of the estate of Carla&#x27;s late grandfather, Antonio Lozuponi, Antonio deserted his wife in 1921, moved to Los Angeles with just his &quot;lucky quarter&quot;, and made fortune selling peach and oil products. Feeling bad about leaving his family behind, he gave his surviving legitimate family a will of $20 million, suppressed by his illegitimate son, Paolo, who &quot;squandered the entire fortune on fast horses and loose women.&quot; The will was not discovered until Paolo&#x27;s death in the previous month. Norris delivers just Antonio&#x27;s &quot;lucky quarter&quot; to Carla, devastating her. She also has a nephew Frankie, to whom Lilith and Rebecca are attracted while he works as a temporary bartender for one time.

As a waitress, she is more experienced than her nemesis Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), who has a nice personality and upper-class traits, contrary to Carla, who treats regular customers with disdain and mostly negative sarcasm, including Cliff Clavin, a know-it-all bar patron. A devoted and often-disappointed Boston Red Sox fan, she became friends with Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and Coach Ernie Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto) during Sam&#x27;s baseball days at least five years before the show started and came to work for him at Cheers when Sam retired from baseball and bought the bar.

Carla notably idolizes Elvis Presley, opting to take annual trips to Graceland, naming one of her later kids after him, and even eventually trying to make contact with him in &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot... I&#x27;m Only the Psychiatrist&quot; (1992).

In two-part episode &quot;Never Love a Goalie&quot; (1987), Carla briefly dates the Boston Bruins ice hockey player, Guy &quot;Eddie&quot; LeBec, who has an endless winning streak and a French Canadian background. As a result, Eddie&#x27;s winning streak ends abruptly. Since both are superstitious, they promise to break up repeatedly before every game to avoid the &quot;curse&quot;. In &quot;Home Is the Sailor&quot;, Carla is revealed to be several months pregnant with Eddie&#x27;s twins (incorporated by another of Perlman&#x27;s pregnancies), so she and Eddie wed in &quot;Little Carla, Happy at Last: Part 2&quot;. Also, in the episode, the Bruins replaces him with a younger player, and he could not find another team. In &quot;Airport V&quot; (1988), Eddie becomes a penguin mascot for a traveling ice show in another state. In &quot;Tale of Two Cuties&quot;, Carla gives birth to their twin boys, named Elvis and Jesse.

In &quot;Death Takes a Holiday on Ice&quot; (1989), Eddie was killed by an ice resurfacer when he saved the life of another member of the ice show. At the funeral, it was revealed that he had concurrently another wife Gloria with twins, as well. Carla changes her surname back to Tortelli to avoid being confused with the other &quot;Mrs. LeBec&quot;. The demise of Jay Thomas&#x27;s character Eddie LeBec has been claimed to stem from Thomas&#x27;s comments &quot;about&quot; Perlman in a radio show. However, Thomas denied this and declared that he was referring only to the Carla character. Despite Ken Levine&#x27;s praise on Thomas&#x27;s acting and pairing of Eddie and Carla, Eddie was written out of the show because Perlman thought that the pairing would make her &quot;not part of the people in the bar.&quot;

In &quot;Head Over Hill&quot; (1991), Carla tries to pull a vengeance on John Allen Hill (Keene Curtis), Sam&#x27;s upper-class rival, owner of the restaurant Melville&#x27;s, and co-owner of Cheers, on Sam&#x27;s behalf. However, she ironically ends up sleeping with him. Since then, she has on-and-off sexual encounters with John. In &quot;Feelings... Whoa, Whoa, Whoa&quot; (1992), she comes into terms of her feelings for John, but she and John find each other incompatible except in bed.

In her only episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot; (2002), according to her, two of Carla&#x27;s sons are imprisoned and her house is on the verge of foreclosing. She is relieved that Cliff will be retiring into Florida. However, in his retirement party, influenced by his friends&#x27; farewell comments - including a vicious tirade by Carla which he mistakes as a sarcastic tribute - Cliff decides to stay in Boston, much to her dismay. She attempts to attack him with a harpoon but is restrained by others.

== Reception ==
Carla Tortelli was voted a favorite character by eight percent of 1,011 people, who were surveyed in 1993 by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now Pew Research Center). She was ranked No. 66 out of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Characters&quot; of all-time. Steve Craig of the University of North Texas noted that she &quot;lacks the charm, warmth, and demureness of the feminine ideal&quot; and is a ridicule of anti-feminism for her &quot;un-ladylike&quot; promiscuity. Bill Simmons, previously of ESPN, praised her in episodes that do not mainly focus on her.

Heather Hundley noted that the series sends a &quot;double standards&quot; message about men and women involved in promiscuity. She noted that the series portrays Sam Malone as heroic, who never suffers from negative consequences of his promiscuity, while it portrays Carla as &quot;nymphomaniac&quot;, who regrets her own promiscuities for out-of-wedlock pregnancies and wrong lovers. She finds the series&#x27;s portrayal of premarital sex &quot;negative and unhealthy&quot;, especially for omitting other dangers of promiscuity, like sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.

Rhea Perlman won Emmy Awards as an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1989 for her portrayal of Carla. She was honored as the Best Supporting Actress (Comedy) by Viewers for Quality Television in 1985 and the &quot;Funniest Supporting Actress&quot; by the American Comedy Awards in 1989.

<text>The National University of Singapore (NUS) is a national public research university in Singapore. It was officially established in 1980 by the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University.

The university offers degree programmes in disciplines at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, including in the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing, and music. NUS&#x27;s main campus is located adjacent to the Kent Ridge subzone of Queenstown. The Duke–NUS Medical School is located at the Outram campus. The Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. NUS&#x27;s affiliated faculty members and researchers include one Nobel Prize laureate, one Tang Prize laureate, and one Vautrin Lud laureate.

== History ==

In September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore. It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successful due to concerns over having a sufficient number of students and support from the local community. Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, including a personal donation of $12,000. On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the &quot;Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School&quot;. At Anderson&#x27;s directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.

In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from the King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by physician Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to &quot;King Edward VII Medical School&quot;. In 1921, it was again changed to &quot;King Edward VII College of Medicine&quot; to reflect its academic status.

In 1928, Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote education in arts and social sciences.

=== University of Malaya in Singapore (1949–1962) ===

On 8 October 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form the University of Malaya. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya.

The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.

=== Nanyang University (1955–1980) ===

In 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nan-tah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.

=== University of Singapore (1962–1980) ===
In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university. Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.

=== Present form ===
The National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980. This was done in part due to the government&#x27;s desire to pool the two institutions&#x27; resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore&#x27;s main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.

Most departments of the university were situated at the Bukit Timah campus, with the gradual shift to the Kent Ridge site starting in 1969 and completed in 1986. NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.

NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram. NUS also collaborates with many other Universities around the world, such as Harvard University, Yale University, UCLA, and Georgia Institute of Technology.

NUS has a diverse range of students and faculty stemming from distinct foreign nationalities. 65% of faculty and staff are foreign nationals, ranking it 3rd (tied with National University of Singapore) in terms of foreign representation among faculty across the top 100 universities according to QS. It remains one of the few top 100 universities with more than 60% of foreign faculty. Likewise, 36% or 12,057 of students are foreign nationals, with 62% them being post-graduate students. 

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms of the National University of Singapore was adopted in 1980 and modernized in 2001. It is the combination of the coat of arms of the former University of Singapore used since 1962 (consisting of an open book and a lion, which itself was derived from the former coat of arms of the University of Malaya used from 1949 until 1962, which featured a tiger instead of a lion), and the emblem of the former Nanyang University, three interlocking rings but without the star used since 1955.

It is blazoned: 

The lion represents NUS as a Singaporean university, the open book represents knowledge and the three rings represents the university&#x27;s role in creating, imparting and applying knowledge, as well as creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.

The National University of Singapore is one of two public universities in Singapore to adopt its coat of arms, alongside the Nanyang Technological University, with which it has relations.

NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campuses, including a music conservatory.

===University Scholars Programme===
The University Scholars Programme (USP) was an undergraduate academic programme established in 2001 in NUS, which comprised a compulsory general education programme. USP admitted 240 undergraduates annually. USP students resided in Cinnamon College at the NUS University Town. This programme has since merged with Yale-NUS to become the NUS College.

===NUS College===
A modernized version of the University Scholars Programme, the NUS College today serves as the university&#x27;s honors college, with a more rigorous application and a focus on global citizenship. The NUS College program notably involves foreign, service-based exchange around South-East Asia, guided by their core ideal that &quot;Learning is a contact sport.&quot;

==Faculties and Schools==

=== Business ===
The NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965. Today, the school has over 280 distinguished faculty members and a vibrant community of 7,000 students, and is a recognised leader in business education and research across Asia. The NUS Business School ranks 3rd in Asia for Financial Times Global MBA Rankings 2024 and 1st in Asia-Pacific for QS Executive MBA Rankings 2024. NUS Business School offers a transformative experience for learners of all ages with programmes such as BBA, MSc, MBA, Executive MBA, PhD and Executive Education and collaborated with overseas universities such as Peking University, HEC Paris, CEMS and Yale University.
===Computing===
The School of Computing established in 1998, has two departments: Computer Science; and Information Systems and Analytics.

===Dentistry===
The Faculty of Dentistry traces its origins in 1929 as a Department of Dentistry within the King Edward VII College of Medicine. The faculty conducts a four-year dental course leading to a Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree.

===Design and Engineering===
The interdisciplinary College of Design and Engineering (CDE) was established in 2021, bringing together two pre-existing faculties, the School of Design and Environment (SDE) and the Faculty of Engineering (FoE).

The School of Design and Environment has three departments: Department of Architecture; Department of the Built Environment; and the Division of Industrial Design. The Faculty of Engineering was established in 1968. It is the largest faculty in the university, and consists of several departments spanning diverse engineering fields.

===Humanities and Sciences===
The interdisciplinary College of Humanities and Sciences (CHS) was established in 2020. It comprises the two largest faculties, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and the Faculty of Science, though both faculties are still branded independently, unlike CDE.

The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences has roots in Raffles College. Initially offering just four subjects: English, History, Geography and Economics, the Faculty now offers majors, minors and special programmes across 16 Departments.

<doc id="286881" wikidata="Q3090825" url="?curid=286881" title="Fumbling Towards Ecstasy">
<text>Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, released on 22 October 1993 in Canada, 15 February 1994 in the United States, 24 May 1994 in Japan, and 14 August 1994 in Australia. It was produced by Pierre Marchand in Montreal; McLachlan wrote most of the album while living in a small house near Marchand&#x27;s studio.

The album was an immediate hit in Canada, where McLachlan was already an established star. It was slower to become her breakthrough album internationally, however; in some countries, most notably the US, it stayed in the middle ranges of the pop charts for almost two years. As of November 2003, the album had sold 2.8 million copies in the US.

Some editions contain an album version of McLachlan&#x27;s 1995 single used for &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; soundtrack, &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;. The track&#x27;s lyrics do not appear in the booklet, nor does the track&#x27;s crediting information.

On August 5, 2008, a three-disc 15th anniversary edition of the album was released. The set includes the original remastered album, &quot;The Freedom Sessions&quot; EP and a DVD that includes live performances, music videos and more. The album was released by Legacy Recordings.

In December 2023, McLachlan announced she would perform on a 30 city tour in 2024 for the 30th anniversary of &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, playing the entire album in shows along with other songs.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Dan Kening praised &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; as &quot;a terrific album from a gifted 26-year-old Canadian who is mature beyond her years&quot;, highlighting McLachlan&#x27;s &quot;hauntingly beautiful voice&quot; and the songs&#x27; &quot;gorgeous arrangements&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Bock opined that McLachlan&#x27;s songs &quot;probe the deeper, darker aspects of the human condition with an honesty, patience, and wisdom way beyond her 26 years.&quot; Comparing the record to its predecessor &quot;Solace&quot; (1991), Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that despite its &quot;less buoyant hooks and more muted arrangements&quot;, &quot;there are moments of quiet radiance on &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, and even the more elusive songs reveal a passionate dignity.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Andrew Leahey called &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; &quot;a softly assured album that combined the atmospheric production of Pierre Marchand... with some of McLachlan&#x27;s strongest songwriting to date&quot;, adding that &quot;McLachlan&#x27;s work was rarely as raw or honest as it is on this record&quot;. Richard Skanse, writing in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, said that McLachlan &quot;truly came into her own as an artist&quot; on the album, finding her lyrics &quot;sharper, her trademark earnestness now carrying a formidable edge.&quot; In 2000, it was voted number 200 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, and in 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it as the 119th-best album of the 1990s.

<text>&quot;Merry England&quot;, or in more jocular, archaic spelling &quot;Merrie England&quot;, refers to a utopian conception of English society and culture based on an idyllic pastoral way of life that was allegedly prevalent in Early Modern Britain at some time between the Middle Ages and the onset of the Industrial Revolution. More broadly, it connotes a putative essential Englishness with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such cultural symbols as the thatched cottage, the country inn and the Sunday roast.

Folklorist Roy Judge has described the concept as &quot;a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings.&quot; It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental nostalgic imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of conservative world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

==Medieval origins==

The concept of &quot;Merry England&quot; originated in the Middle Ages, when Henry of Huntingdon around 1150 first coined the phrase &quot;Anglia plena jocis&quot;. His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist Bartholomeus Anglicus, who claimed that &quot;England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game&quot;.

However Ronald Hutton&#x27;s study of churchwardens&#x27; accounts places the real consolidation of &quot;Merry England&quot; in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, boy bishops and decorated rood lofts. Hutton argued that, far from being pagan survivals, many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: &quot;Merry England&quot; thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost.

The same concept &quot;may&quot; have also been used to describe a utopian state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see Cockaigne). Peasant revolts, such as those led by Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, invoked a visionary idea that was also egalitarian – John Ball arguing for &quot;wines, spices, and good bread... velvet and camlet furred with grise&quot; all to be held in common. Tyler&#x27;s rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term &quot;Norman yoke&quot; belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom. The main arguments of Tyler&#x27;s rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. 

Even in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – Lawrence Stone describing rural life as &quot;at the mercy of disease and the weather... with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure&quot;. Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making. Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the &quot;abominable enough... foot-ball-game&quot; all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. Langland might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who &quot;drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there&quot;, of the field-workers who &quot;sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a &#x27;Hey-nonny-nonny&#x27;&quot;. The wandering scholar, or goliard, who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose, belonged to a similar fraternity.

More legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking, while there was also the medieval angler, of whom Juliana Berners wrote: &quot;atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease&quot;.Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved-of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, mummers, morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers, all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.

Thus there was certainly &quot;merriment&quot; in medieval England, even if always found in an unidealised and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the Black Death when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and serfdom was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, and sheep displacing men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.

==Post-Reformation conflicts==

The Reformation set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century-and-a-half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth. As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the &quot;lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days&quot;, and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven. The annual festal round in parish society, consolidated between 1350 and 1520 and including such customs as church ales, May games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. Religious austerity, opposed to Catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.

However, a reaction quickly set in, John Caius in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called &quot;the old world, when this country was called merry England&quot;. James I in 1618 issued his Book of Sports, specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of &quot;Merry England&quot; thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War. Unsurprisingly, the Long Parliament put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove Christmas underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the Restoration saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.

==Cultural revivals==
At various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated Hogarth engraving illustrating the patriotic song &quot;The Roast Beef of Old England&quot;, is as anti-French as it is patriotic.

William Hazlitt&#x27;s essay &quot;Merry England&quot;, appended to his &quot;Lectures on the English Comic Writers&quot; (1819), popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an allusion to the iconic figure of Robin Hood, under the epigraph &quot;St George for merry England!&quot;:
The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, &#x27;the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where&#x27;, the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of &#x27;Merry Sherwood&#x27;, and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to &quot;Merry England&quot;.

Hazlitt&#x27;s subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In (1844: translated as &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot;), Friedrich Engels wrote sarcastically of Young England (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore &quot;the old &#x27;merry England&#x27; with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ...&quot; The phrase &quot;merry England&quot; appears in English in the German text.
William Cobbett provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and &quot;mores&quot; of an industrialising nation by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his &quot;Rural Rides&quot; (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge also subscribed to some extent to the &quot;Merry England&quot; view. Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Past and Present&quot; also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of &quot;Crotchet Castle&quot; by Thomas Love Peacock contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social unrest. Barry Cornwall&#x27;s patriotic poem. &quot;Hurrah for Merry England&quot;, was set twice to music and printed in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, in 1861 and 1880.

In the 1830s, the Gothic revival promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels&quot;Norman&quot; for the Romanesque, and &quot;Early English&quot;, for exampleand the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically &quot;English&quot; style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named &quot;Jacobethan&quot;. The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by Joseph Nash (1839–1849), illustrating &quot;The Mansions of England in the Olden Time&quot; in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and farthingales, who personified a specific &quot;Merry England&quot; that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.
Children&#x27;s storybooks and fairytales written in the Victorian period often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as elves and fairies, as well as Robin Hood. 

The London-based Anglo-Catholic magazine of prose and verse &quot;Merry England&quot; began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by William Wordsworth as epigraph, beginning &quot;They called thee &#x27;merry England&#x27; in old time&quot; and characterising &quot;Merry England&quot; &quot;a responsive chime to the heart&#x27;s fond belief&quot;:

In the late Victorian era, the Tory Young England set perhaps best reflected the vision of &quot;Merry England&quot; on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to political conservatism, the vision of &quot;Merry England&quot; extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane clergy; an interested and altruistic squirearchy, aristocracy and royalty. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of yeoman farmers, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.

The idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the Anglo-Catholics and Catholicism, as a version of life&#x27;s generosity; for example Wilfred and Alice Meynell entitled one of their magazines &quot;Merrie England&quot;. The pastoral aspects of William Blake, a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. G. K. Chesterton in part adapted it to urban conditions. William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement and other left-inclined improvers (whom Sir Hugh Casson called &quot;the herbivores&quot;) were also (partly) believers. Walter Crane&#x27;s &quot;Garland for May Day 1895&quot; is lettered &quot;Merrie England&quot; together with progressive slogans (&quot;Shorten Working Day &amp; Lengthen Life&quot;, &quot;The Land for the People&quot;, &quot;No Child Toilers&quot;) with socialism (&quot;Production for Use Not for Profit&quot;). For a time, the &quot;Merry England&quot; vision was a common reference point for rhetorical Tories and utopian socialists, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross social inequality.
This was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the &quot;Clarion&quot;, in his booklet &quot;Merrie England&quot; (1893). In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William Morris&#x27;s &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in small self-sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely read and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably introduced more working-class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx.

Another variant of &quot;Merry England&quot; was promoted in the &quot;organic community&quot; of F. R. Leavis by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture. In his view, such communities existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and were destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the Industrial Revolution. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.

&quot;Punch&quot; in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a &#x27;Merrie Board&#x27; with powers to set up &#x27;Merrie Areas&#x27; in rural England – intended to preserve &quot;this hard core of Merriment&quot;.

==Deep England==
&quot;Deep England&quot; refers to an idealised view of a rural, Southern England. The term is often used to describe what English cultural conservatives would wish to conserve, and is used by both supporters and critics of the concept. The term, which alludes to &quot;la France profonde&quot;, has been attributed to both Patrick Wright and Angus Calder. The concept of Deep England may imply an explicit opposition to modernism and industrialisation; and may be connected to a ruralist viewpoint typified by the writer H. J. Massingham. Major artists whose work is associated with Deep England include: the writer Thomas Hardy, the painter John Constable, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, and the poets Rupert Brooke
and Sir John Betjeman.
Examples of this conservative or village green viewpoint include the ideological outlook of magazines such as &quot;This England&quot;. Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.

In Angus Calder&#x27;s re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding &quot;Little England&quot; during the Second World War in &quot;The Myth of the Blitz&quot;, he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime propaganda operations within the United Kingdom, and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.

Calder cites the writer and broadcaster J. B. Priestley whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley&#x27;s wartime BBC radio &quot;chats&quot; described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from The Blitz in its Underground stations. In reference to one of Priestley&#x27;s bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:

Priestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant&#x27;s wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars.&quot; (Angus Calder, &quot;The Myth of the Blitz&quot;, London 1991)

However, in &quot;Journey Through England&quot;, Priestley identified himself as a Little Englander because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist Industrial Revolution had on the people and environment.

Part of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song &quot;There&#x27;ll Always Be an England&quot; seems to be derived from the same source:
The continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:

The song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.

==Literature and the arts==

The transition from a literary locus of &quot;Merry England&quot; to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet William Blake to the evangelical Christian Arthur Mee. The Rudyard Kipling of &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The 1890 &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; by William Morris portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a socialist revolution.

Reference points might be taken as children&#x27;s writer Beatrix Potter, John Betjeman (more interested in Victoriana), and the fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, whose hobbit characters&#x27; culture in The Shire embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.

In his essay &quot;Epic Pooh&quot;, Michael Moorcock opined:


&quot;The Pyrates&quot;, the 1983 spoof historical novel by George MacDonald Fraser, sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England tropes:
The novel &quot;England, England&quot; by Julian Barnes describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England. The author&#x27;s views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.

In Kingsley Amis&#x27;s novel &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim&#x27;s &quot;Merrie England&quot; lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).

Richmal Crompton&#x27;s &quot;William the Bad&quot; [1930] contains a chapter, &quot;The Pennymans Hand On The Torch&quot;, about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at &quot;the morning of the world&quot;, which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongruously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal. The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say, on account of William&#x27;s involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman&#x27;s St George. &quot;The Pennymans&#x27;... pageant for May Day which involves St George and the Dragon... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict&quot;.

==Music==
Eric Saylor traces Arcadian antecedents in English pastoral music back to 18th century works such as Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (1718, text by John Gay), which remained a mainstay of English choral festivals throughout the 19th century. Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1882) made use of pastoral conventions. His ballet &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;, produced for the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, consisted of a series of scenes depicting idealised versions of British mythology and past eras typical of Merry England, including a country village celebrating May Day in Elizabethan times and Christmas during the Restoration. The final scenes were recreations of Victoria&#x27;s coronation and a celebration of the British Empire, tying the contemporary world of 1897 back to the popular idealised world of Merry England. Sullivan&#x27;s score consisted of original music mixed with a large number of popular and historical folk tunes, traditional songs and national anthems. The ballet was very popular, running continuously for nearly six months.

&quot;Merrie England&quot;, a comic opera by Edward German, also became a great success in 1902, and over the following century was so frequently produced by amateur groups in England that it has probably been performed more often than any other British opera or operetta written in the 20th century. During his heyday, German successfully tapped into and fostered a new enthusiasm for British music in the context of a romanticised Shakespearian or semi mythical &quot;Merrie England&quot;. His &quot;Three Dances from &#x27;Henry VIII″&quot; (1892) was easily the most frequently performed English orchestral work in the first decade of the Proms, with well over 30 performances between 1895 and 1905. &quot;Three Dances from &#x27;As You Like It″&quot; (1896) was similarly popular.

Other composers, such as Charles Villiers Stanford (&quot;Suite of Ancient Dances&quot;, 1895), Frederick Cowen (&quot;Four English Dances in the Old Style&quot;, 1896), Norman O&#x27;Neill (overture to &quot;Hamlet&quot;, 1904) and Percy Pitt (&quot;Three Old English Dances&quot;, 1904) turned to similar sources for inspiration.

A few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes. The Kinks and their leader Ray Davies crafted &quot;The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; in 1968 as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine as an album &quot;lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions&quot;. Their 1969 album &quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot; also contains similar elements. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs (the band&#x27;s namesake was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).

<doc id="286887" wikidata="Q333233" url="?curid=286887" title="Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck">
<text>Charles Stanley Monck, 4th Viscount Monck (10 October 1819 – 29 November 1894) was a British politician who served as the last governor-general of the Province of Canada and the first Governor General of Canada after Canadian Confederation.

== Early life ==

Charles Stanley Monck was born in Templemore, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the son of Charles Monck and his wife Bridget &quot;née&quot; Willington. His father was the younger son of Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck and the former Anne Quin. After his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1802, the viscountcy had been inherited by his father&#x27;s elder brother, Henry Monck, who in 1822 was further created Earl of Rathdowne. However, in 1848, Lord Rathdowne died without male heirs (albeit with many daughters), the earldom became extinct, and Monck&#x27;s father succeeded as 3rd Viscount. His maternal grandparents were John Willington of Killoskehan Castle in Barnane, and the former Bridget Butler (daughter of Theobald Butler of Knocka Castle in Drom).

==Career==
Monck obtained a law degree from Trinity College Dublin. He married his cousin Lady Elizabeth Monck (one of Lord Rathdowne&#x27;s daughters) in 1844, and in 1849 he inherited his father&#x27;s title as 4th Viscount Monck. In 1852 he was elected MP for Portsmouth (as an Irish peer, he had no seat in the House of Lords), and from 1855 to 1858 he served as Lord of the Treasury under Lord Palmerston.

===Governor General of Canada===
In 1861, he was appointed Governor General of British North America as well as Governor of the Province of Canada. Lord and Lady Monck and their children came to Canada, but they did not remain throughout his term of office as Governor General of Canada. The family resided at Spencerwood in Quebec during most of their stay in Canada.

During this time, the Canadian colonies were beginning to organise themselves into a confederation. The American Civil War had just broken out, and the Trent Affair caused diplomatic tension between the United States and Britain. The Canadian government was eager to gain some measure of independence during this turbulent period. The Quebec Conference, the Charlottetown Conference, and the London Conference, at which the details of confederation were discussed, all took place during Monck&#x27;s time as governor. Monck supported the idea, and worked closely with John A. Macdonald, George Brown, George-Étienne Cartier, and Étienne-Paschal Taché, who formed the &quot;Great Coalition&quot; in 1864.

In 1866, Monck was created a peer of the United Kingdom with the title Baron Monck, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. When the Canadian colonies became a semi-independent confederation the next year, Monck became the country&#x27;s first Governor General. Monck was also responsible for establishing Rideau Hall as the residence of the Governor General in Ottawa.

===Later life===
In 1869, Monck was succeeded by Sir John Young (later Lord Lisgar). He returned home to Ireland, where he became Lord Lieutenant of Dublin in 1874.

==Personal life==

On 23 June 1844, he married Lady Elizabeth Louise Mary Monck, his first cousin and the daughter of his uncle Henry, the 2nd Viscount, who had been made Earl of Rathdowne in 1822. Together, they were the parents of two sons and two daughters:

* Hon. Frances Mary Monck (d. 1930), who married the Rev. Richard Aslatt Pearce.
* Hon. Elizabeth Louise Mary Monck (d. 1913), who married John Macdonald Royse.
* Henry Power Charles Stanley Monck, 5th Viscount Monck (1849–1927), who married Lady Edith Caroline Sophia Scott, the fourth daughter of John Scott, 3rd Earl of Clonmell, in 1874.
* Hon. Richard Charles Stanley Mountjoy Monck (1858–1892), who married Alice Ann Lymer in 1879.

Lady Monck died in June 1892, aged 78. He died in November 1894, aged 75.

<doc id="286891" wikidata="Q2090328" url="?curid=286891" title="Trick or Treat (1952 film)">
<text>Trick or Treat is a 1952 animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon, which takes place on Halloween night, follows a series of pranks between Donald Duck and his nephews with Witch Hazel. The film was directed by Jack Hannah and features the voices of Clarence Nash as Donald and his nephews, and June Foray as Hazel.

The film introduced the song &quot;Trick or Treat for Halloween&quot; which was written by Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston and performed by The Mellomen.

==Plot==
The film opens with the song &quot;Trick or Treat for Halloween&quot;, the lyrics of which tell the film&#x27;s moral - one must be generous on Halloween or face trouble.

One Halloween night, Witch Hazel observes Huey, Dewey, and Louie trick-or-treating. When the trio goes to their uncle Donald Duck&#x27;s house, Donald decides to prank the boys (giving them a &quot;trick&quot; instead of a treat). Instead of giving them candy, he puts firecrackers in their bags and then pulls a string that dumps a bucket of water on their heads. After Donald bids farewell to the boys, the discouraged nephews go and sit on the curb.

Hazel, who was watching the drama unfold, approaches the boys and tries to encourage them. When she discovers that they believe in witches, Hazel happily offers to help them get their treats from Donald. At first, she tries to convince Donald but he skeptically retorts, yanks on her stretchy nose, and pranks her with a bucket of water, not believing she is a real witch. Realizing that the job may be harder than anticipated, Hazel tells the boys she will use her magic for this situation. In another location, a scene paying homage to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; shows Hazel and the nephews concocting a magic potion, adding somewhat more whimsical ingredients than the Three Witches in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (such as, &quot;Eye of needle, tongue of shoe, hand of clock that points at two!&quot;, etc.). After testing the potion, Hazel fills an insecticide sprayer (similar in appearance to a Flit gun) with the potion and returns to Donald&#x27;s house with the nephews.

Upon arriving back at Donald&#x27;s house, Hazel sprays the potion on an assortment of objects (a Jack-o&#x27;-lantern, a can of paint, three fence posts, and a gate) causing them to become animated or anthropomorphic. Donald, stunned at the magic being displayed before him, immediately gives in and agrees to treat his nephews, but when Hazel refers to him as a pushover, he changes his mind. Donald then locks his pantry and swallows the key. Hazel then uses the potion on Donald&#x27;s feet to give her control of their maneuverability and commands them to kick out the key, causing Donald to perform a crazy dance and getting his rear end and tail to get poked by a cactus and burned by the fireplace. When the key is kicked out, Donald throws it under the pantry door. Enraged, Hazel casts a spell &quot;that&#x27;s double-grim!&quot; on Donald&#x27;s feet by spraying them even harder and ordering them to &quot;smash that door down&quot; with Donald. This is initially unsuccessful, so Hazel commands him to take a longer start, and he runs even faster right before he rams down the pantry door and is left unconscious on the floor in defeat.

In the end, Huey, Dewey, and Louie collect their treats and Hazel flies off into the night. A final shot shows the enchanted Jack-o&#x27;-lantern from earlier suddenly popping onto the screen saying &quot;Boo!&quot; to the viewers before smiling.

==Adaptations==

A print adaptation by Carl Barks was published simultaneously in the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic book. Barks was given a storyboard of the film by Ralph Wright while production of the film was still in progress. Barks was asked to create a 32-page comic adaptation, yet Barks did not believe he had enough material. In the end, he wound up making a lot of his own material, creating new characters such as Smorgie the Bad, a villainous six-armed ogre serving Witch Hazel.

When the final product was sent to the publisher, Barks&#x27; segment with Smorgie was rejected, and the story was cut to 27 pages. To fill out the rest of the comic book, Barks created an additional story called &quot;Hobblin&#x27; Gobblins&quot;. The original story was later restored with the publication of the Carl Barks Library.

Disneyland Records also produced an audio adaptation that was narrated by Ginny Tyler. This version was 12 minutes long and also included a song and story from the Haunted Mansion Disneyland attraction.

<text>The Interactive Encyclopedia System, or TIES, was a hypertext system developed in the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab by Ben Shneiderman in 1983. The earliest versions of TIES ran in DOS text mode, using the cursor arrow keys for navigating through information. A later version of HyperTIES for the Sun workstation was developed by Don Hopkins using the NeWS window system, with an authoring tool based on UniPress&#x27;s Gosling Emacs text editor. 

==HyperTIES==
The TIES program has evolved into the HyperTIES commercial product, sold by the Cognetics Corporation. HyperTIES has a small feature set and has touch-screen support which makes it optimal for public displays and information kiosks. As for navigation types, only reference links are supported, which can be either text or graphics. The mouse pointer also highlights anchors when passing over them.

<doc id="286893" wikidata="Q3107519" url="?curid=286893" title="Rudy (film)">
<text>Rudy is a 1993 American biographical sports film directed by David Anspaugh. It is an account of the life of Daniel &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It was the first film that the Notre Dame administration allowed to be shot on campus since &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; in 1940.

In 2005, &quot;Rudy&quot; was named one of the best 25 sports movies of the previous 25 years in two polls by ESPN (#24 by a panel of sports experts, and #4 by ESPN.com users). It was ranked the 54th-most inspiring film of all time in the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years&quot; series.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 1993, and was released in the United States on October 13, 1993, by TriStar Pictures. It stars Sean Astin as the title character, along with Ned Beatty, Jason Miller, Robert Prosky and Charles S. Dutton. The film had supporting roles from Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, being both actors&#x27; first film roles. The script was written by Angelo Pizzo, who created &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986), which was also directed by Anspaugh.

==Plot==
In the 1960s in Joliet, Illinois, Daniel Eugene &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger dreams of playing football at Notre Dame. However, he lacks the grades and money to attend along with the talent and physical stature to play major college football. Following high school, Rudy works at a steel mill with his father, a Notre Dame fan, and older brother Frank. After Rudy&#x27;s supportive best friend Pete is killed in a mill explosion, Rudy decides to follow his dream.

In 1972, Rudy visits Notre Dame but is academically ineligible to enroll. With the help of local priest and former Notre Dame president Father John Cavanaugh, Rudy enrolls at nearby Holy Cross College, hoping to transfer. He approaches Fortune, head groundskeeper at Notre Dame Stadium, and is given a job. Homeless, Rudy sneaks into Fortune&#x27;s office through a window to sleep on a cot; initially indifferent to Rudy&#x27;s plight, Fortune later leaves him with blankets and a key to the office. Rudy learns that Fortune, despite working at the stadium for years, has never seen a Notre Dame football game.

Rudy befriends teaching assistant D-Bob, who helps him study in return for Rudy&#x27;s helping him socially with girls. D-Bob tests Rudy for a learning disability; the results indicate that Rudy suffers from dyslexia, which he then overcomes to become a better student. At Christmas, Rudy returns home to find that his family appreciates his college academic achievements, but Frank still mocks Rudy for his attempts to play college football. Rudy persists, and even losing his girlfriend to his older brother Johnny does not deter him.

After two years at Holy Cross and three rejections from Notre Dame, Rudy is finally admitted and attends football tryouts in the hope of making the team as a &quot;walk-on&quot;. Assistant coach Warren warns the walk-ons that 35 scholarship players will not even make the &quot;dress roster&quot; of players who take the field during games. However, Coach Joe Yonto notices Rudy&#x27;s determination and gives him a spot on the daily practice squad. Rudy tells Fortune and persuades him to promise to see Rudy&#x27;s first game.

Rudy&#x27;s hard work and dedication in practice convinces head coach Ara Parseghian to let him suit up for one home game in his senior year. However, Parseghian retires following the 1974 season and is replaced by former Green Bay Packers head coach Dan Devine, who refuses to put Rudy on the game-day roster. Frustrated by not being on the dress list for the last home game, Rudy quits the team.

Fortune finds a distraught Rudy and reveals that he had actually played for Notre Dame years earlier. However, Fortune quit the team because he felt that his skin color kept him from playing; Fortune has regretted this decision ever since. Reminded that he has nothing to prove to anyone but himself and will forever regret quitting, Rudy returns to the team. Each of his fellow seniors, led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, lines up to lay his jersey on Devine&#x27;s desk. Each player requests that Rudy be allowed to dress in his place for the season&#x27;s final game. Devine lets Rudy suit up against Georgia Tech.

With Rudy&#x27;s family and D-Bob in attendance, Steele invites Rudy to lead the team onto the field, and Fortune is there to see the game as promised. With Notre Dame leading 17–3 late in the fourth quarter, Devine sends all the seniors into the game except Rudy, despite Steele&#x27;s and the assistant coaches&#x27; urging. Fans are aware of Rudy&#x27;s goal from a story in the student newspaper, and a &quot;Rudy!&quot; chant begins in the stadium. Hearing this, the Notre Dame offense, led by tailback Jamie O&#x27;Hara, overrules Devine&#x27;s call for victory formation and scores a quick touchdown. This gives defensive player Rudy a chance to get in the game and be entered onto the Fighting Irish roster. Devine finally lets Rudy play on the Notre Dame kickoff to Georgia Tech. Rudy stays in for the final play, sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback, and is carried off the field on his teammates&#x27; shoulders to cheers from the stadium.

An epilogue states that since 1975, no other Notre Dame player has been carried off the field as of the time of the film&#x27;s release in 1993. Rudy graduated in 1976, and five of his younger brothers went on to earn college degrees.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 1982, Daniel &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger initially pitched a film project based on his life story to Hollywood executives but failed to generate interest. Later, he entered into a deal with a screenwriter who allegedly deceived him, resulting in the loss of his life savings. Residing in South Bend, Indiana, where the University of Notre Dame is located, Ruettiger found renewed inspiration after watching the 1986 film &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. A fortuitous encounter in South Bend led him to obtain contact information for &quot;Hoosiers&quot; screenwriter Angelo Pizzo. Around 1989, Ruettiger persistently pursued Pizzo, who initially had no interest in creating another Indiana-based sports film, especially one set at Notre Dame, a school he disliked. Despite initial reluctance, Pizzo eventually mentioned the project to &quot;Hoosiers&quot; director David Anspaugh and producer Robert Fried.

In 1991, Fried successfully sold the project to Columbia Pictures, securing Anspaugh as the director and Pizzo as the writer. However, when Columbia&#x27;s chairman Frank Price departed for Savoy Pictures, the new chairman Mark Canton put the film into turnaround in early 1992. Although Savoy Pictures nearly acquired the rights from Columbia, they opted out when foreign deals failed to materialize in time for an October 1992 production start.

TriStar Pictures joined the project in September 1992 and gave the green light to the $13-million film after resolving &quot;last-minute rights claims against the property.&quot; Filmmakers had a two-week window to revise the script and just two days to secure permission to film at Notre Dame. The school had not agreed to allow its campus to be used as a film location since 1940&#x27;s &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;. Initially uninterested in another film about Notre Dame football, the university&#x27;s administration, led by executive vice president Reverend William Beauchamp, changed its stance after reading Pizzo&#x27;s script. They recognized it as a &quot;heartwarming, enlivening story&quot; about hard work that embodied the school&#x27;s values.

The 50-day filming commenced on October 26, 1992, on the campus north of South Bend. Notre Dame, Holy Cross Junior College, and the local bar Cap N&#x27; Cork, served as filming sites. Notre Dame-specific locations encompassed its twin lakes, Notre Dame Stadium, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, and the Golden Dome. Crowd scenes were captured during halftime at Notre Dame football games against Boston College and Penn State. The pivotal scene where players carry &quot;Rudy&quot; off the field was shot during that year&#x27;s Notre Dame vs. Boston College game, with the 59,000 fans present chanting Rudy&#x27;s name. N.F.L. Films, the National Football League&#x27;s cinematic division, handled the filming of football action scenes. Following the six-week stint in South Bend, the production relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where the Thompson Steel Mill was used. The nearby town of Whiting, Indiana, stood in for Joliet, Illinois.

Actor Sean Astin, portraying the titular character, experienced &quot;head-to-toe bruises&quot; during the filming process. Additionally, Astin&#x27;s stuntman sustained injuries, necessitating knee surgery by the conclusion of the shoot.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack to &quot;Rudy&quot; was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith had previously worked with filmmakers Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh on their successful 1986 film &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, garnering the film an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score and thus making Goldsmith their first choice to compose a soundtrack for &quot;Rudy&quot;.

According to Soundtrack.net, &quot;Tryouts&quot; has been used in 12 trailers, including those for &quot;Angels in the Outfield, BASEketball, The Deep End of the Ocean, Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;The Little Vampire&quot;, &quot;Mafia!&quot;, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 2008, Senator John McCain used &quot;Take Us Out&quot; as an official anthem during his presidential run. The piece of music was played at major events such as after Senator McCain&#x27;s acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention and after John McCain announced Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate in Dayton, Ohio.

&quot;Take Us Out&quot; was played in the pilot episode of &quot;About a Boy&quot;, based on the 2002 film of the same name.

Also recorded in the film are performances of various Notre Dame fight songs by the Notre Dame Glee Club.

==Historical accuracy==
In reality, Coach Dan Devine had announced that Rudy would dress for the Georgia Tech game during practice a few days before. The dramatic scene in which Rudy&#x27;s senior teammates laid their jerseys on Devine&#x27;s desk in protest never happened. According to Ruettiger, Devine was persuaded to allow him to dress only after a number of senior players requested that he do so. Devine had agreed to be depicted as the &quot;heavy&quot; in the film for dramatic effect but was chagrined to find out the extent to which he was vilified, saying: &quot;The jersey scene is unforgivable. It&#x27;s a lie and untrue.&quot;

As a guest on &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; on September 8, 2010, Joe Montana, who was an active member of the team when Ruettiger played in the Georgia Tech game, confirmed that the jersey scene never happened, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s a movie, remember. Not all of that is true...The crowd wasn&#x27;t chanting, nobody threw in their jerseys. He did get in the ball game. He got carried off after the game.&quot;

Nearly 10 years later in an interview on Barstool Sports&#x27; &quot;Pardon My Take&quot; podcast, Montana reiterated that the jersey scene and crowd chanting did not actually occur. He also implied that carrying Ruettiger off the field was sarcastic rather than celebratory, saying: &quot;Was there a lot of things that happened? Yeah. He got in, he got a sack. Was the crowd chanting? No. Did I throw in my jersey? No. Did he get carried off the field? He got carried off by three of the biggest pranksters on the team.&quot;

==Reception==
The film was the closing night gala at the 1993 Toronto International Film Festival.

&quot;Rudy&quot; received primarily positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has a freshness and an earnestness that gets us involved, and by the end of the film we accept Rudy&#x27;s dream as more than simply sports sentiment. It&#x27;s a small but powerful illustration of the human spirit.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that &quot;For all its patness, the movie also has a gritty realism that is not found in many higher-priced versions of the same thing, and its happy ending is not the typical Hollywood leap into fantasy.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harrington called &quot;Rudy&quot; &quot;a sweet-natured family drama in which years of effort are rewarded by a brief moment of glory.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;Sweet-natured and unsurprising...this is one of those Never Say Die, I Gotta Be Me, Somebody Up There Likes Me sports movies that no amount of cynicism can make much of a dent in.&quot; 

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 78%, based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Though undeniably sentimental and predictable, &quot;Rudy&quot; succeeds with an uplifting spirit and determination.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 71, based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In 2006, AFI placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Cheers list, where it was ranked #54.

==Home media==
Rudy was released on VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Video on May 25, 1994, and on LaserDisc on June 22, 1994. The film was released as a Special Edition DVD on September 26, 2000. The film was released on Blu-Ray for the first time on September 9, 2008. A 30th Anniversary SteelBook 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray that included a new director&#x27;s cut, deleted scenes, and director&#x27;s/writer&#x27;s commentary, was released on November 14, 2023.

<text>Earl Grey is a title in the peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1806 for General Charles Grey, 1st Baron Grey. In 1801, he was given the title Baron Grey of Howick in the County of Northumberland, and in 1806 he was created Viscount Howick in the County of Northumberland, at the same time as he was given the earldom. A member of the prominent Grey family of Northumberland, Earl Grey was the third son of Sir Henry Grey, 1st Baronet of Howick (see below).

==History==

The first Earl Grey was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles, 2nd Earl Grey. The second Earl was a prominent Whig politician and served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834, which tenure saw the passing of the Reform Act 1832 and the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1833. In 1808, he also succeeded his uncle as third Baronet, of Howick.

The second Earl was succeeded by his second (but eldest surviving) son, Henry, 3rd Earl Grey. The third Earl was also a Whig politician and served under Lord John Russell as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1846 to 1852. On his death, the titles passed to his nephew, Albert, 4th Earl Grey, who was the son of General the Hon. Charles Grey, third son of the second Earl. Lord Grey was governor general of Canada between 1904 and 1911. His son, Charles, 5th Earl Grey, was a major in the Army. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, Richard, 6th Earl Grey. He was the great-great-grandson of Admiral the Hon. George Grey, fourth son of the second earl. The 6th Earl died in September 2013 and was succeeded by his brother Philip, 7th Earl Grey.

The Grey baronetcy, of Howick in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1746 for Henry Grey, High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1738. A member of an old Northumberland family, he was eighth in descent from Sir Thomas Grey, of Heton, elder brother of John Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville (see the Earl of Tankerville, 1418 creation), and fifth in descent from Sir Edward Grey, of Howick, uncle of William Grey, 1st Baron Grey of Warke. In 1720 he married Hannah, daughter of Thomas Wood of Fallodon near Alnwick in Northumberland. Grey was succeeded by his eldest son, the second baronet. He represented Northumberland in the House of Commons. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the second Earl Grey. For further history of the baronetcy, see above.

Several other members of this branch of the Grey family have gained distinction. The Hon. George Grey (1767–1828), second son of the first Earl Grey, was created a baronet, of Fallodon in the County of Northumberland, in 1814 (see Grey baronets) and was the father of Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet, and the great-grandfather of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon. The Right Reverend the Hon. Edward Grey (1782–1837), fifth son of the first Earl, was Bishop of Hereford from 1832 to 1837. His fourth son Sir William Grey (1818–1878) served as Governor of Bengal from 1866 to 1871 and as governor of Jamaica from 1874 to 1877. His daughter Sybil Frances Grey (d. 1945) was the mother of Prime Minister Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon. Sir Paul Francis Grey, British Ambassador to Czechoslovakia from 1957 to 1960 and to Switzerland from 1960 to 1964, was the grandson of Francis Douglas Grey, a son from the second marriage of the Right Reverend the Hon. Edward Grey, Bishop of Hereford. The aforementioned the Hon. Charles Grey, third son of the second Earl, was a general in the Army. The aforementioned the Hon. George Grey (1809–1891), fourth son of the second Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

The family seats were Howick Hall and Fallodon Hall in Northumberland. The traditional burial place of the Earls Grey is St Michael and All Angels Church, Howick.

<text>Book collecting is the collecting of books, including seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever books are of interest to a given collector. The love of books is &quot;bibliophilia&quot;, and someone who loves to read, admire, and a person who collects books is often called a &quot;bibliophile&quot;.

Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given edition which is based on factors such as the number of copies available, the book&#x27;s condition, and if they were signed by the author (and/or editor or illustrator, if applicable) or by a famous previous owner. For example, a first edition “And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street” can reach the price of $12,000 in the best condition.

==History==
In the ancient world, &quot;papyri&quot; and scrolls (the precursors of the book in codex form) were collected by both institutions and private individuals. In surviving accounts there are references to bibliophile book collectors in that era. Xenophon wrote disparagingly of a man who tried to collect more books than his friends. Seneca the Younger was skeptical of those who collect books they do not read, asking: &quot;What is the use of possessing numberless books and libraries, whose titles their owner can hardly read through in a lifetime?&quot; Book collectors in western antiquity prized accurate transcription and high-quality materials.

In 1344 the English bishop Richard de Bury wrote &quot;The Philobiblon&quot;, in which he praised the love and appreciation of books. Philip the Good brought together a collection of &quot;about six hundred manuscripts in his possession at the height of his reign&quot;, which was the largest private collection of his day.

With the advent of the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century, which resulted in cheaper and more abundant books, and with the contemporaneous economic, social and political changes of the Renaissance, book collecting received a great impetus. Jean Grolier, the Treasurer-General of France, was an important bibliophile and book collector of this period. 

With the advent of the Romantic era in the 18th century and its focus on the past, book collectors began to show an interest in old books, antiquarian editions and manuscripts. This new emphasis was nourished by the flood of old books onto the market following the dissolution of monastic and aristocratic libraries during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

The British Whig politician George John, 2nd Earl Spencer (1758-1834) collected tens of thousands of volumes. Strengths of his collection included first editions of the classics; works produced by important early presses, and notably an almost complete collection of Aldine editions; and many Bibles. 

Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872) collected 40,000 printed books and 60,000 manuscripts. He was &quot;the greatest collector of manuscript material the world has ever known&quot;. 

The increasingly wealthy United States during the 19th century saw the appearance of &quot;titan&quot; book collectors such as the railroad magnate Henry Huntington and the financier and banker J. Pierpont Morgan.

==Prices==
The Rothschild Prayerbook sold for $13.6 million while the St Cuthbert Gospel sold for $14.7 million. Both of these religious texts were sold in 2012. The Northumberland Bestiary sold for $20 million in 2007. The New Book of Tang sold for $17.1 million in 2018. William Shakespeare’s First Folio, printed in 1623, sold for $9.978 million in 2020. An &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 issue sold for a record $3.2 million in 2014 with a cover price of 10 cents.

==Condition==
Despite appearing in many films and other popular culture, wearing cotton gloves while handling old or rare books does not protect the book, and can increase the risk of inadvertent damage. However, the theatrical effect of showing a rare book being handled with gloved hands may increase its selling price.

==Antiquarian book collecting==
Antiquarian book collecting may be roughly defined as an interest in books printed prior to 1900 and can encompass interest in 19th, 18th, 17th, 16th, and 15th-century books. Antiquarian book collectors are not exclusively interested in first editions and first printings, although they can be. European books created before 1455 are all hand-written and are therefore one-of-a-kind historical artifacts in which the idea of &quot;edition&quot; and &quot;printing&quot; is irrelevant. Any book printed up to the year 1501 is known as an incunable or incunabulum. Such books command a premium and are particularly sought after by collectors interested in the history of printing. 

The first English movable-type printer was Caxton in the late 15th century. Editions of his books from the 15th century are very rare. Occasionally, 16th-century editions similar to Caxton&#x27;s books appear among antiquarian book dealers and auctions, often fetching very high prices. The last Shakespeare First Folio of 1623 (first edition of the collected works of William Shakespeare) garnered a record-breaking $9,978,000 at Christie&#x27;s in October 2020. 

Books owned by well-known individuals that also have a connection with the author (often as a gift from the author with a written dedication to the recipient) are known as association copies.

The American School Library is an example of a very rare multi-volume boxed set with works by many popular or famous authors. Apparently the only extant full set is owned by the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

==In China==
The history of book collecting in China dates back over two millennia. An important effort to collect books in China was made during the early Han dynasty by the government, as many important books were burned during the Qin dynasty. From then on, book collecting began to flourish in China, particularly after the invention of block printing during the early Tang dynasty, with both imperial and private collections blooming throughout the country. However, the systematic study of book collecting began only during the Qing dynasty.

===Terminology===
*Cangshulou ( &quot;book collecting tower&quot;): library, such as the private Tianyi Chamber (天一閣), the oldest existing library in China, or the imperial Wenyuan Chamber (文淵閣), where the works collected in the &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot; were reposited
*Jinxiangben (巾箱本 &quot;headscarf box edition&quot;): ancient pocket edition
*Jiupingzhuang (舊平裝 &quot;old paperback&quot;) or Jiushu (舊書 &quot;old books&quot;): old books published after 1911, when the Qing dynasty was overthrown
*Maobianben (毛邊本 &quot;hairy-side edition&quot;): uncut editions
*Songben (宋本 &quot;Song edition&quot;) or Songban (宋版 &quot;Song edition&quot;): block printed books published during the Song dynasty, highly valued by collectors
*Xianzhuangshu (線裝書 &quot;thread-bound book&quot;): thread-bound books, usually referred to those published before 1911

==Virtual book collecting==
Virtual book collecting can be described as collecting books in a digital format (virtually) on a computer or other electronic device. A bibliophile may acquire ebooks by downloading them or copying from borrowed media, such as CDs and DVDs. However, this may violate copyright law, depending on the license under which the ebook was released. Ebooks acquired from Project Gutenberg and many similar free collections cause no violation as they have gone out of copyright, have been released under a Creative Commons license, or else are in the public domain.
