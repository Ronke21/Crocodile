<text>Albert Allick Bowlly (7 January 1899 – 17 April 1941) was a South African-British vocalist, crooner and dance band guitarist who was Britain&#x27;s most popular singer for most of the 1930s. He recorded upwards of 1,000 songs that were listened to by millions.

His most popular songs include &quot;Midnight, the Stars and You&quot;, &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;, &quot;Guilty&quot;, &quot;Heartaches&quot; and &quot;Love Is the Sweetest Thing&quot;. He also recorded the only English version of &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; by Adalgiso Ferraris, as &quot;Black Eyes&quot;, with the words by Albert Mellor.

==Early life==
He was born in 1899 in Lourenço Marques (today Maputo) in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. Al&#x27;s father, Alick, was an Orthodox Christian who was Greek by nationality. His mother, born Miriam Ayoub, was a Lebanese Catholic, though Al himself was raised Greek Orthodox. They met en route to Australia and moved to British South Africa. Bowlly was brought up in Johannesburg. The family&#x27;s original surname was Pauli, which was misspelt as Bowlly; Alick was only able to speak and read Greek, so the mistake went unnoticed and the name became permanent .

==Career==
After a series of odd jobs in Colesburg South Africa, including barber and jockey, he sang in a dance band led by Edgar Adeler on a tour of South Africa, Rhodesia, India and the Dutch East Indies during the early to mid-1920s. His main role was as guitarist. He was fired from the band in Soerabaja, Dutch East Indies.

Jimmy Lequime hired Bowlly to sing with his band in India and Singapore at Raffles Hotel. When he left Lequime, it was with the pianist Monia Liter, the two of them travelling to Germany, where they played with Arthur Briggs and his Savoy Syncopators, Fred Bird&#x27;s Salon Symphonic Jazz Band, and George Carhart&#x27;s New Yorkers Jazz Orchestra. In 1927 Bowlly made his first record, a cover version of &quot;Blue Skies&quot; by Irving Berlin that was recorded with Adeler in Berlin, Germany. During the next year, he worked in London, with the orchestra of Fred Elizalde.

He moved to Britain, where in July 1928 he joined Fred Elizalde&#x27;s band that played at the Savoy Hotel, London until 1929. He went on to play with various bands on a temporary basis, before gaining more regular employment in May 1931 with Roy Fox, singing in his live band for the Monseigneur Restaurant, a stylish restaurant on Piccadilly in London, and with bandleader Ray Noble in November 1930.

During the next four years, he recorded over 500 songs. By 1933, Lew Stone had ousted Fox as the Monseigneur&#x27;s bandleader and Bowlly was singing Stone&#x27;s arrangements with Stone&#x27;s band. After much radio exposure and a successful British tour with Stone, Bowlly was now Britain&#x27;s top singer, and was inundated with demands for appearances and gigs – including undertaking a solo British tour – but continued to make most of his recordings with Noble. There was considerable competition between Noble and Stone for Bowlly&#x27;s time. For much of the year, Bowlly spent the day in the recording studio with Noble&#x27;s band, rehearsing and recording, then the evening with Stone&#x27;s band at the Monseigneur. Many of these recordings with Noble were issued in the United States by Victor, which meant that by the time Noble and Bowlly came to America, their reputation had preceded them. 
Once Bowlly and Noble arrived in the States in Autumn of 1934, Ray Noble assembled a new orchestra, which included notable artists such as Charlie Spivak, Glenn Miller, Bud Freeman, and Pee Wee Erwin. Noble&#x27;s Orchestra was resident in the Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center in New York. Noble and Bowlly would broadcast over NBC and CBS, causing Ray Noble&#x27;s Orchestra to be one of the most popular Dance Orchestras in the United States. Bowlly was also riding high in the states; he had his own NBC radio series, a magazine that featured the latest news and press interviews about Bowlly, his picture was on sheet music, and he even beat Bing Crosby in a nationwide popularity poll in 1936.

His absence from the UK in the mid-1930s damaged his popularity with British audiences, and his career began to suffer as a result of problems with his voice, which affected the frequency of his recordings. He played a few small parts in films, but the parts were often cut and scenes that were shown were brief. Noble was offered a role in Hollywood, although the offer excluded Bowlly because a singer had already been hired. Bowlly moved back to London with his wife Marjie in January 1937.

Bowlly performed in England with his band, the Radio City Rhythm Makers. But by early 1937, the band had broken up when vocal problems were traced to a wart in his throat, briefly causing him to lose his voice. Separated from his wife and with his band dissolved, he traveled to New York City for corrective surgery.

With diminished success in Britain, he toured regional theatres and recorded as often as possible to make a living, moving from orchestra to orchestra, working with people like Sydney Lipton, Geraldo, and Ken &quot;Snakehips&quot; Johnson. Al Bowlly also started to make his own solo records and would broadcast over several popular radio stations such as Radio Luxembourg and the BBC, which helped him regain a large amount of popularity, although many claim he did not enjoy as much success as he did in his earlier days before he moved to the United States. One of his songs, “It’s Time to Say Goodnight”, was used as Radio Luxembourg’s closing song until it temporarily shut down during World War II (a cover by Connie Francis would be used as the station’s ending song during the early 1960s). In 1940, there was a revival of interest in his career when he worked in a duo with Jimmy Mesene in &quot;Radio Stars with Two Guitars&quot; on the London stage. It was his last venture before his death in April 1941. The partnership was uneasy; Mesene was an alcoholic and he was occasionally unable to perform . Bowlly recorded his last song two weeks before his death. It was a duet with Mesene of Irving Berlin&#x27;s satirical song about Hitler, &quot;When That Man Is Dead and Gone&quot;.
==Personal life and death==
In December 1931, Bowlly married Constance Freda Roberts (officially divorced in 1934) in St Martin&#x27;s Register Office, London; the couple separated after a fortnight and sought a divorce. He remarried in December 1934 to Marjie Fairless; this marriage lasted until his death, although they split up in 1937, they never officially divorced.

On 16 April 1941, Bowlly and Mesene had given a performance at the Rex Cinema in Oxford Street, High Wycombe. Both were offered an overnight stay in town, but Bowlly took the last train home to his flat at 32 Duke Street, Duke&#x27;s Court, St James, London. He was killed by a Luftwaffe parachute mine that detonated outside his flat at ten past three in the morning. His body appeared unmarked. Although the explosion had not disfigured him, it had blown his bedroom door off its hinges, and the impact against his head was fatal. He was buried with other bombing victims in a mass grave at Hanwell Cemetery, Uxbridge Road, Hanwell, where his name is given as Albert Alex Bowlly.

A blue plaque commemorating Bowlly was installed in November 2013 by English Heritage at Charing Cross Mansion, 26 Charing Cross Road, described as &quot;his home at the pinnacle of his career&quot;.

==Legacy==
Al Bowlly&#x27;s cover songs have been widely included in other forms of media. The Caretaker, who sampled Bowlly&#x27;s music for his &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot; series of albums from 2016 to 2019, has said the public believed that if Bowlly had not died during the war, he would have been &quot;bigger than Bing Crosby,&quot; and that &quot;he had a better voice.&quot;

Dennis Potter&#x27;s television play &quot;Moonlight on the Highway&quot;, first broadcast in the UK on 12 April 1969, focused on a young Al Bowlly fanatic attempting to blot out memories of sexual abuse via his fixation with the singer. Potter later featured Bowlly&#x27;s music in &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1978).

Bowlly was mentioned, and his songs were used, throughout the first few series of the British TV comedy &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;.

Bowlly&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Midnight, the Stars and You&quot; has been particularly used and referenced throughout varied films, appearing in &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, and &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. Some commentators specifically highlight its use in &quot;The Shining&quot;″s ending scene, with &quot;HeadStuff&quot;″s Luka Vukos calling it &quot;haunting&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; praising it as &quot;one of the most unforgettable final shots in film history.&quot; The song has also been used in the 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea&quot; and sampled by musician Leyland Kirby on the Caretaker&#x27;s &quot;Shining&quot;-inspired album &quot;Selected Memories from the Haunted Ballroom&quot;. 

Al Bowlly&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Forgotten Now&quot; was also featured in The Shining ballroom scene.

Bowlly&#x27;s 1931 recording of &quot;Hang Out the Stars in Indiana&quot; with Ray Noble &amp; The New Mayfair Dance Orchestra, featured in Bruce Robinson&#x27;s 1987 British comedy film, &quot;Withnail and I&quot;.

Richard Thompson wrote a song called &quot;Al Bowlly&#x27;s In Heaven&quot;, about a homeless veteran reminiscing of his time as a soldier and contrasting it with his poverty since, included on his album &quot;Daring Adventures&quot;. The song has been a staple of his live set ever since and is included on many of his live releases.

A sample of &quot;My Woman&quot;, recorded by Bowlly with Lew Stone in November 1932, appeared on White Town&#x27;s UK chart topper &quot;Your Woman&quot; (1997).

Al Bowlly’s rendition of the song “Guilty” was used in the Jean-Pierre Jeunet film, &quot;Amélie (2001)&quot;.

Bowlly&#x27;s work particularly lives on in the &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot; community, where several fan albums such as The Overlook&#x27;s &quot;Colorado Lounge Section&quot; album, which features many songs by Al Bowlly. The analog horror community also uses a lot of Al Bowlly&#x27;s songs, a few examples being &quot;The Walten FIles&quot; and Battington&#x27;s &quot;Harmony &amp; Horror&quot; series.

<text>NoteCards was a hypertext-based personal knowledge base system developed at Xerox PARC by Randall Trigg, Frank Halasz and Thomas Moran in 1984. NoteCards was developed after Trigg&#x27;s pioneering 1983 Ph.D. thesis on hypertext while at the University of Maryland College Park.

NoteCards was built to model four basic kinds of objects: notecards, links, browser card, and a filebox. Each window is an analog of a cue card; window sizes may vary, but contents cannot scroll. Local and global maps are available through browsers. There are over 40 different nodes which support various media.

NoteCards was implemented in LISP on D-machine workstations from Xerox which used large, high-resolution displays. The NoteCards interface is event-driven. One interesting feature of NoteCards is that authors may use LISP commands to customize or create entirely new node types. The powerful programming language allows almost complete customization of the entire NoteCards work environment.

==Availability==
NoteCards was available commercially from the Common Lisp software vendor Venue, compiled for Solaris 2.5 and 7 (untested on later versions) and Linux x86 with the X Window System.

<text>Gimpo International Airport , sometimes referred to as Seoul–Gimpo International Airport but formerly rendered in English as Kimpo International Airport, is located in the far western end of Seoul, some west of the central district of Seoul.

Gimpo previously carried the IATA airport code SEL, which is now used by airline reservation systems within the Seoul Metropolitan Area, and was the main international airport for Seoul and South Korea before being replaced by Incheon International Airport in 2001. It now functions as Seoul&#x27;s secondary airport. In 2015, over 23 million passengers used the airport, making it the third-busiest airport in Korea since being surpassed by Jeju International Airport.

The airport is located south of the Han River in western Seoul. The name &quot;Gimpo&quot; comes from the nearby city of Gimpo, of which the airport used to be a part.

On 29 November 2003, scheduled services between Gimpo and Haneda Airport in Tokyo resumed with services also operating at Incheon Airport. Services to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport resumed on 28 October 2007. Services to Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, started on 26 October 2008 with services also operating at Incheon Airport. Services to Beijing Capital International Airport started on 1 July 2011 with services also operating at Incheon Airport. Services to Taipei Songshan Airport started on 30 April 2012.

== History ==
The airfield was built in 1939 during the Japanese Imperial period as an Imperial Army base. The runways were built on a bed of rocks manually hauled by Korean labourers from Kaihwasan and Yangchan, several miles from the base. Then known as Keijo New Airfield (京城新飛行場), Gimpo was constructed with four runways to supplement the much smaller Keijo Airfield (京城飛行場), which was later known as Yeouido Airport.

===Korean War===
Gimpo played a major role during the Korean War, and the USAF designated the airfield as Kimpo Air Base or K-14.

North Korean forces attacked South Korea on 25 June 1950 starting the Korean War. During one of the first Korean People&#x27;s Air Force (KPAF) attacks on 25 June, a Military Air Transport Service C-54 Skymaster was destroyed on the ground at Gimpo. On 27 June, US naval and air forces began evacuating 748 US diplomats, military dependents, and civilians by air transport from Kimpo and Suwon Airfield. On the afternoon of 27 June, five F-82 Twin Mustangs of the 68th Fighter Squadron and 339th Fighter Squadron were escorting four C-54 Skymaster aircraft out of Kimpo when the C-54s were attacked by five KPAF Lavochkin La-7 fighters. In the subsequent dogfights, three LA-7s were shot down for the loss of no US aircraft in the first air battle of the war. Later that day, four F-80Cs of the 35th Fighter-Bomber Squadron shot down four Ilyushin Il-10s for no losses over Gimpo in the USAF&#x27;s first jet-aircraft victory.

Gimpo was captured by the KPA shortly after the capture of Seoul on 28 June 1950. On 29 June, eight B-29s of the 19th Bomb Group bombed Gimpo and the Seoul railyards. By July, the KPAF were using the base for attacks on UN forces; on 10 July, seven Yak-7s were hidden at Gimpo and used in strikes against UN positions at Cheongju. The next day, they surprised and damaged several Lockheed F-80s in the area. On 15 July, the US launched an attack on Gimpo, destroying two or three of the seven Yak-7s there and damaging the runway. On 5 August 5th Air Force fighters strafed and bombed Gimpo, destroying 9 aircraft and damaging 9 others.

Following the Inchon landings on 15 September 1950, the 2nd Battalion 5th Marines was ordered to seize Gimpo on 17 September. Gimpo was defended by a conglomeration of half-trained fighting men and service forces, and by the morning of 18 September, the Marines had secured the airfield. The airfield was in excellent shape as the North Koreans had not had time to do any major demolition. On 19 September, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers repaired the local railroad up to inland and 32 C-54 transport planes began flying in gasoline and ordnance. VMF-212 was one of the first units to operate from Gimpo before moving forward to Yonpo Airfield. On 25 September, the 811th Engineer Aviation Battalion began repairing bomb damage on the asphalt runway at Gimpo and covering it with Marston matting. On 6 October, the USAF took control of Gimpo from the USMC.

Following the Chinese Third Phase Campaign and the defeat of UN Forces at the 38th parallel, on 5 January 1951, General Ridgway ordered the evacuation of Seoul and the withdrawal of UN forces to a new defensive line along the 37th parallel. Units based at Gimpo were withdrawn to the south and facilities were destroyed to prevent their use by Chinese and North Korean forces.

UN forces resumed the offensive again in late January 1951 and launched Operation Thunderbolt on 25 January, with the aim of pushing Chinese and North Korean forces back north of the Han River. By 10 February 1951, UN forces once again had control of Gimpo.

USAF units based at Gimpo (Kimpo) included:
*4th Fighter Wing operating F-86s from 23 August 1951 to 1 October 1954, subordinate units included:

Other UN units based at Gimpo (Kimpo) included:
*No. 77 Squadron RAAF operating Gloster Meteors from June 1951

On 21 September 1953, North Korean pilot No Kum-Sok defected in his MiG-15, landing at Gimpo.

=== International era ===


In 1958, the airport was redesignated as the Gimpo international airport of Seoul by a presidential decree, completely replacing the existing Yeouido Airport.

Following the construction of Gimpo, Yeouido Airport was demolished. Gimpo soon became the main airport of Seoul, and of South Korea in general. In 1971, a new, combined domestic and international terminal was opened. However, following the opening of what was known as Terminal 1 in 1977, the original combined terminal was converted to domestic flights only. Later, Terminal 2 was opened due to the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Gradually, Gimpo began to have more flights than it was capable of handling. After about 1980, it experienced numerous problems due to its lack of space for expansion. An additional problem was South Korea&#x27;s overnight curfew (midnight to 4 am), a security measure that was in effect for decades. The curfew, which severely limited the airport&#x27;s night operations, was finally abolished in 1982.

Eventually, the South Korean government decided to build a new airport. The facility was initially planned to be in Cheongju, away from Seoul, but that idea was strongly opposed by the citizens of Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, due to the inconvenience it would pose to them. (It would have been farther from Seoul than the distance between Viracopos Airport in Campinas, Brazil, and the city of São Paulo.) Finally, Yeongjong Island, a part of the city of Incheon, slightly west of Seoul, was chosen for the new airport, which later came to be known as Incheon International Airport. All bigger scale international flights were moved to Incheon when it opened in 2001.

=== Post-Incheon-activation era ===
&quot;Shuttle&quot; flights to Haneda Airport in Tokyo started in November 2003 on a charter basis, cutting 30 minutes or more of ground transportation at each end in an attempt to attract business travelers. This &quot;city to city&quot; route was followed by new routes to Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai starting in October 2007, Kansai Airport in Osaka starting in 2008, Beijing starting in July 2011, and Songshan Airport in Taipei starting in April 2012. Total international passenger numbers at Gimpo rose from under one million in 2005 to over four million by 2012. Most services to Osaka and Beijing also operate from Incheon Airport.

The Haneda-Gimpo route was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but resumed in June 2022 with eight weekly round trips, and recovered to 84 weekly round trips by the end of 2022 as entry restrictions were lifted. On 26 March 2023, the Haneda-Incheon services resumed with two daily round trips a week with Korean Air and Peach with Asiana Airlines resuming the route on 1 May 2023 with seven daily round trips a week.

Korea Airports announced an expansion and remodeling of the terminals in 2013, adding new gates and security checkpoints. In 2017, the South Korean government announced that a new terminal would be built to meet growing domestic traffic.

Gimpo currently has two runways, and , two passenger terminals, and one cargo terminal.

When the predecessor agency Korea Aviation Accident Investigation Board (KAIB) existed, its CVR/FDR and wreckage laboratory was located on the airport property.

==Ground transportation==
===Railway===
On 23 March 2007 the AREX airport express line started operations to Incheon International Airport, with an extension to Seoul Station which opened in December 2010. Seoul Subway Line 9 also links the airport to the Gangnam area. For many years, the airport was served by the Gimpo Line, a railway line that no longer exists. In the 1990s, Seoul Subway Line 5 was extended to Gimpo Airport. In 2019, the Gimpo Goldline began service to the airport. On 1 July 2023, the Seohae Line began service to the airport.

===Roadway===
Gimpo International Airport is connected to Incheon International Airport by Incheon International Airport Expressway via Gimpo Airport Interchange. Some others road also linked Gimpo Airport with Seoul and nearby province including National Route 39, National Route 48, Olympic-daero and Seoul City Route 92 (Nambu Beltway).

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 22 February 1957, a USAF Douglas C-124 Globemaster II crashed near SEL after takeoff because of a prop/turbine blade separation, resulting in a forced landing in the Han River. Out of a total of 159 passengers and crew on board, 21 were killed. 
* On 19 November 1980, Korean Air Lines Flight 015, a Boeing 747-200 landed short of the runway, ripping off all main landing gear, causing the aircraft to skid to a stop on the nose wheel and outer two engines starting a fire. 15 of the 226 total occupants were killed, including the first officer and captain.
* On 14 September 1986, a bomb blast occurred outside a terminal building, killing five people and wounding 36. The attack was blamed on North Korea as an attempt to disrupt the 1986 Asian Games starting six days later.
* On 25 November 1989, Korean Air Flight 175, a Fokker F28-4000 en route to Ulsan Airport crashed right after takeoff. No one was killed,but 40 people were wounded.
* On 5 August 1998, Korean Air Flight 8702, a Boeing 747-400, rolled off the runway upon touchdown and slid into a ditch, resulting in the destruction of the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage and the fuselage being split. All 395 of the total occupants survived and the aircraft was written off.

<text>Penn &amp; Teller, Penn Jillette and Teller, are American magicians, entertainers, and scientific skeptics who have performed together since the late 1970s. They are noted for their ongoing act that combines elements of comedy with magic.

The duo has been featured in numerous stage and television shows such as &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot; and currently perform in Las Vegas at The Rio, the longest-running headliners to play at the same hotel in Las Vegas history. Penn Jillette serves as the act&#x27;s orator and raconteur. Teller generally does not speak while performing, and instead communicates through mime and nonverbals, though his voice can occasionally be heard during their live shows and television appearances. Besides magic, the pair has become associated with the advocacy of scientific skepticism and libertarianism, particularly through their television show &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;

==Career==
Penn and Teller were introduced to each other by Weir Chrisemer, and they performed their first show together at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival on August 19, 1975. From the late 1970s through 1981, Penn, Teller, and Chrisemer performed as a trio called &quot;The Asparagus Valley Cultural Society&quot;, which played in Philadelphia’s Walnut Street Theater, and in San Francisco, California, at the Phoenix Theater. Chrisemer helped to develop some bits that continued, most notably Teller&#x27;s &quot;Shadows&quot; trick, which involves a single red rose. The group disbanded in 1981 after Chrisemer quit show business, leaving Penn Jillette and Teller to work as a pair on a show called &quot;Mrs. Lonsberry&#x27;s Seance of Horror&quot;.
By 1985, Penn &amp; Teller were receiving positive reviews for their Off Broadway show and Emmy Award–winning PBS special &quot;Penn &amp; Teller Go Public&quot;. In 1987, they began the first of three Broadway runs. The same year, they appeared as three-card Monte scam artists in the music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Tricky&quot; by Run-DMC. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, the duo made numerous television appearances on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as well as &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and others.

Penn &amp; Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise. They have also made television guest appearances on &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (as the comedy team Rebo and Zooty), &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, a few episodes of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; from 1998 until 2004, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, FOX&#x27;s &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, an episode of the game show &quot;Fear Factor&quot; on NBC, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The West Wing&quot;, in a two-part episode of the final season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Home Improvement&quot; in 1998, four episodes during season 1 of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; in 1996, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, and Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder&quot; and &quot;The Great Simpsina&quot; and the &quot;Futurama&quot; film &quot;&quot; in 2009. They appeared in the music video for Katy Perry&#x27;s 2009 single &quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot;, in which they are thrown out of a hotel room by Perry.

Penn and Teller made an appearance on &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; season 2, episode 7 - &quot;Light Optics&quot;.

From 2003 to 2010, their Showtime television show &quot;Bullshit!&quot; took a skeptical look at psychics, religion, the pseudoscientific, conspiracy theories, and the paranormal. It has featured critical segments on gun control, astrology, Feng Shui, environmental issues, PETA, weight loss, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the war on drugs.

The pair have written several books about magic, including &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s Cruel Tricks For Dear Friends&quot;, &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s How to Play with Your Food&quot;, and &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s How to Play in Traffic&quot;. Since 2001, Penn &amp; Teller have performed in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.

Penn Jillette hosted a weekday one-hour talk show on Infinity Broadcasting&#x27;s Free FM radio network from January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, with cohost Michael Goudeau. He also hosted the game show &quot;Identity&quot;, which debuted on December 18, 2006, on NBC.

Their television series &quot;Penn &amp; Teller Tell a Lie&quot; premiered on the Discovery Channel on October 5, 2011.

Since 2010, Penn &amp; Teller have hosted &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot;, originally on ITV, moving to The CW in 2015.

Penn &amp; Teller credit magician and skeptical activist James Randi for their own careers. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that Randi&#x27;s book &quot;Flim-Flam!&quot; was an early influence on him, and said that &quot;If not for Randi there would not be Penn &amp; Teller as we are today.&quot;

In early 2022, Penn and Teller competed in season seven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Hydra&quot; of Team Bad. Because of Hydra&#x27;s three-legged design and large size, the costume had to be assembled back stage while &quot;Hydra&quot; had to be wheeled out on a special platform to get it to and from the stage. Penn operated the left side of &quot;Hydra&quot; while Teller operated the right side of &quot;Hydra&quot;. They were eliminated on the week of April 6 where it was shown that Teller used a puppet of a rabbit in a hat to &quot;operate&quot; the central head of &quot;Hydra&quot;. Teller was given most of the singing due to how rarely people hear his voice and the possibility of people recognizing Penn&#x27;s voice. Nicole Byer, who was the guest panelist of the night, successfully guessed the duo to be underneath the &quot;Hydra&quot; masks.

==Off-stage relationship==
Jillette stated in a video where he and Teller responded to questions from members of Reddit, and also in a video interview for Big Think, that while he and Teller share few interests outside magic, Teller is his best friend, and his children treat Teller as a close relative. He stated that while most entertainment partnerships such as Martin and Lewis and Lennon–McCartney were based on a deep affection for each other that lends to a certain volatility when things go wrong, their business relationship and friendship is based on a respect for each other. Teller has made similar statements. In an NPR interview, Teller said their disagreements often lead to better artistic decisions because they bring out new ideas and expand the range of discussion.

==Honors==

On April 5, 2013, Penn &amp; Teller were honored with the 2,494th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their achievement in the category of Live Performance. Their star is a few steps away from the star of Harry Houdini and down the street from The Magic Castle. However, they were refused membership of The Magic Circle due to their tendencies to reveal how magic tricks are done during performances.

They are also recipients of a Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award.

In 2014, they were nominated for a BAFTA Award for their documentary &quot;Tim&#x27;s Vermeer&quot;.

For their contributions to the West End production Magic Goes Wrong with Mischief Theatre, they were nominated for a 2020 Olivier Award.

==Tricks==

Penn &amp; Teller perform their own adaptation of the famous bullet catch illusion. Each simultaneously fires a gun at the other through small panes of glass and then &quot;catches&quot; the other&#x27;s bullet in his mouth. They also have an assortment of card tricks in their repertoire, virtually all of them involving the force of the Three of Clubs on an unsuspecting audience member as this card is easy for viewers to identify on television cameras.

In one of their most politically charged tricks, they make an American flag seem to disappear by wrapping it in a copy of the United States Bill of Rights, and apparently setting the flag on fire, so that &quot;the flag is gone but the Bill of Rights remains&quot;. The routine may also feature the &quot;Chinese bill of rights&quot;, presented as a transparent piece of acetate. They normally end the trick by restoring the unscathed flag to its starting place on the flagpole; however, on a TV guest appearance on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, this final part was omitted. The methods of the trick were revealed by the duo in an episode of &quot;Fool Us&quot;.

One trick involves a powered nail gun with a quantity of missing nails from the series of nails in its magazine. Penn begins by firing several apparently real nails into a board in front of him. He then proceeds to fire the nail gun into the palm of his hand several times, while suffering no injuries. His pattern builds as he oscillates between firing blanks into his hand and firing nails into the board, and fires one blank into Teller&#x27;s crotch. Near the end of the trick, he says that it is a trick and that he and Teller believe that it is morally wrong to do things on stage that are really dangerous—it makes the audience complicit in unnecessary human risk.

A trick introduced in 2010 is a modern version of the bag escape, replacing the traditional sack with a black trash bag apparently filled with helium. Teller is placed in the bag which is then pumped full of helium and sealed by an audience member. For the escape, the audience is blinded by a bright light for a second and when they are able to see again, Teller has escaped from the bag and Penn is holding it, still full of helium, above his head, before releasing it to float to the ceiling. The duo had hoped to put the trick in their mini-tour in London; however, it was first shown to the public in their Las Vegas show on August 18, 2010. In June 2011, Penn &amp; Teller performed this trick for the first time in the United Kingdom on their ITV show &quot;Fool Us&quot;.

In one of their TV appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, they performed a trick that involved all members of the audience. Each person received four cards which were torn apart and &quot;mixed&quot; so as to have two out of the eight halves selected in a process that seems random, as each person has freedom of moves throughout the process. Yet in the end, everyone ends up with two halves of the same card. Some mathematicians made a deep analysis of the trick and generalized it so it would work with any number of initial cards, using mathematical induction; their complete analysis was published in the &quot;Journal of Magic Research&quot;.

==Politics and personal lives==
On &quot;Bullshit!&quot;, the duo described their social and political views as libertarian. In addition to disbelief in the paranormal and pseudoscience, Penn &amp; Teller also take a view of doubtfulness to government authority. In various episodes of their show, they have heavily criticized both the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as taken stances against circumcision and gun control, and in support of ideas such as freedom to eat fast food, private property, and lower taxes. Penn &amp; Teller were both H. L. Mencken research fellows with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank and research organization. Penn disavowed libertarianism in 2020 and is no longer affiliated with the Cato Institute.

Penn &amp; Teller have shown support for the Brights movement and are now listed on the movement&#x27;s website under the Enthusiastic Brights section.

They have described themselves as teetotalers.

The 1995 video game &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s Smoke and Mirrors&quot; featured a mini-game called Desert Bus in which the player drove a bus route between Tucson and Las Vegas. Once reaching the destination, the player gets one point and, if desired, can then drive the return route. The game was considered by some to be long and boring yet found a cult audience.
The entire set of games was actually more of a collection of tricks and pranks, rather than games meant to be actually good to play. Both in-game and in interviews Penn states that Desert Bus was a reaction to the controversy of violent video-games going on at the time. In essence making fun of this controversy, by creating a simulator &quot;stupefyingly like reality&quot;.
The game has since been used in an annual charity event called &quot;Desert Bus for Hope&quot; run by the Canadian internet comedy troupe LoadingReadyRun. The fundraiser involves members of LoadingReadyRun (and occasional guests) playing the game and streaming that live online, while interviewing celebrities via Skype and accepting challenges for the audience, with all proceeds being donated to Child&#x27;s Play. On November 14, 2011, an iOS port of Desert Bus was created and released in the iTunes Store. The game was developed in conjunction with the Desert Bus For Hope event and all profits from the game are donated to charity.

<text>Intermedia is an art theory term coined in the mid-1960s by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins to describe the strategies of interdisciplinarity that occur within artworks existing between artistic genres. It was also used by John Brockman to refer to works in expanded cinema that were associated with Jonas Mekas&#x27; Film-Makers’ Cinematheque. Gene Youngblood also described intermedia, beginning in his &quot;Intermedia&quot; column for the Los Angeles Free Press beginning in 1967 as a part of a global network of multiple media that was expanding consciousness. Youngblood gathered and expanded upon intermedia ideas from this series of columns in his 1970 book &quot;Expanded Cinema&quot;, with an introduction by Buckminster Fuller. Over the years, intermedia has been used almost interchangeably with multi-media and more recently with the categories of digital media, technoetics, electronic media and post-conceptualism. 

==Characteristics==

The areas such as those between drawing and poetry, or between painting and theatre could be described as intermedia. With repeated occurrences, these new genres between genres could develop their own names (e.g. visual poetry, performance art); historically, an example is haiga, which combined brush painting and haiku into one composition.

Dick Higgins described the tendency of what he thought was the most interesting and best in the new art to cross boundaries of recognized media or even to fuse the boundaries of art with media that had not previously been considered for art forms, including computers.

With characteristic modesty, Dick Higgins often noted that Samuel Taylor Coleridge had first used the term.

==Academia==

In 1968, Hans Breder founded the first university program in the United States to offer an M.F.A. in intermedia. The Intermedia Area at The University of Iowa graduated artists such as Ana Mendieta and Charles Ray. In addition, the program developed a substantial visiting artist tradition, bringing artists such as Dick Higgins, Vito Acconci, Allan Kaprow, Karen Finley, Robert Wilson, Eric Andersen and others to work directly with Intermedia students. Two other prominent University programs that focus on intermedia are the Intermedia program at Arizona State University and the Intermedia M.F.A. at the University of Maine, founded and directed by Fluxus scholar and author Owen Smith. Additionally, the Roski School of Fine Arts at the University of Southern California features Intermedia as an area of emphasis in their B.A. and B.F.A. programs. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County offers an M.F.A. in Intermedia and Digital Art. Concordia University in Montreal, QC offers a B.F.A. in Intermedia/Cyberarts. Herron School of Art and Design, Indiana University, Purdue University, Indianapolis, has a M.F.A. Program with Photography and Intermedia degrees. The University of Oregon offers a Master of Music degree in Intermedia Music Technology. The Pacific Northwest College of Art offers a B.F.A. in Intermedia.

In the United Kingdom, Edinburgh College of Art (within the University of Edinburgh) introduced a BA (Hons) Degree in Intermedia Arts, and intermedia can be a focus of study in Masters programmes. The Academy of Fine Arts [AVU] in Prague offers a Masters in Intermedia Studies founded by Milan Knížák and The Hungarian University of Fine Arts has an Intermedia Program.

<doc id="286925" wikidata="Q3364526" url="?curid=286925" title="Alderman">
<text>An alderman is a member of a municipal assembly or council in many jurisdictions founded upon English law with similar officials existing in the Netherlands (wethouder) and Belgium (schepen). The term may be titular, denoting a high-ranking member of a borough or county council, a council member chosen by the elected members themselves rather than by popular vote, or a council member elected by voters.

==Etymology==
The title is derived from the Old English title of &quot;ealdorman&quot;, which literally means &quot;elder person&quot;, and which was used by the chief nobles presiding over shires. Similar titles exist in other Germanic languages, such as &#x27; in Swedish, &#x27; in Norwegian, &#x27; in Danish and Low German, &#x27; in West Frisian, &#x27; in Dutch, and &#x27; in German. Finnish also has &quot;&quot;, which was borrowed from Swedish. All of these words mean &quot;elder person&quot; or &quot;wise man&quot;.

==Usage by country==
===Australia===
Many local government bodies used the term &quot;alderman&quot; in Australia. As in the way local councils have been modernised in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the term alderman has been discontinued in a number of places. For example, in the state of Queensland before 1994, rural &quot;shires&quot; elected &quot;councillors&quot; and a &quot;chairman&quot;, while &quot;cities&quot; elected a &quot;mayor&quot; and &quot;aldermen&quot;. Since 1994, all local and regional government areas in Queensland elect a &quot;mayor&quot; and &quot;councillors&quot;. (Australian capital cities usually have a Lord Mayor). An example of the use of the term alderman is evident in the City of Adelaide. Aldermen were elected from the electors in all the wards.

===Canada===
Historically, in Canada, the term &quot;alderman&quot; was used for those persons elected to a municipal council to represent the wards. As women were increasingly elected to municipal office, the term &quot;councillor&quot; slowly replaced &quot;alderman&quot;, although there was some use of the term &quot;alderperson&quot;. Today, the title of &quot;alderman&quot; is rarely used except in some cities in Alberta and Ontario, as well as some smaller municipalities elsewhere in the country, that retain the title for historical reasons.

===Ireland===
The title &quot;alderman&quot; was abolished for local authorities in the Republic of Ireland by the Local Government Act 2001, with effect from the 2004 local elections. Early usage of the term mirrored that of England and Wales. Local elections since the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1919 have used the single transferable vote in multiple-member electoral areas.

In each electoral area of a borough or county borough, the first several candidates elected were styled &quot;alderman&quot; and the rest &quot;councillor&quot;.

Someone co-opted to fill a seat vacated by an alderman would be styled &quot;councillor&quot;.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, an alderman (Dutch: ) is part of the municipal executive and not of the municipal council, which controls the aldermen&#x27;s actions in office. The alderman is comparable to the office of minister at the national level. However, the alderman can not propose bills to the council. The alderman can be forced to resign by a vote of no confidence by the council.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the term alderman refers to senior members of municipal councils. They are distinguished from ordinary councillors for their &quot;long and distinguished service as a councillor&quot;. The title may be awarded on the basis of a long term of service (commonly 20 years), or a combination of term of service along with leadership positions held within the council. In some councils the title is automatically conferred on the mayor regardless of their term of service.

===United Kingdom===
====England, Northern Ireland and Wales====
Although the term originated in England, it had no single definition there until the 19th century, as each municipal corporation had its own constitution. It was used in England, Wales and Ireland/Northern Ireland (all of Ireland being part of the United Kingdom from January 1801 until December 1922), but was not used in Scotland. Under the Municipal Reform Act 1835, municipal borough corporations consisted of councillors and aldermen. Aldermen would be elected not by the electorate, but by the council (including the outgoing aldermen), for a term of six years, which allowed a party that narrowly lost an election to retain control by choosing aldermen. This was changed by the Municipal Corporations Amendment Act 1910, so that outgoing aldermen were no longer allowed to vote. County councils, created in Great Britain in 1889 and in Ireland in 1899, also elected aldermen, but rural district and urban district councils did not. The Local Government Act 1972 finally abolished Aldermen with voting rights, with effect from 1974, except in the Greater London Council and the London borough councils, where they remained a possibility until 1978.

=====Honorary aldermen=====
Councils in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland still have the power to create honorary aldermen and alderwomen, as a reward for their services as a councillor, but must do so at a special meeting, and in each case the granting of the title needs to be approved by two-thirds of those attending. This power is little used in England and Wales, but is used more often in Northern Ireland, where councils may also designate up to a quarter of their elected councillors as aldermen.

=====City of London=====

In the City of London, but not elsewhere in London, aldermen are still elected for each of the wards of the City by the regular electorate. To be a candidate to be Lord Mayor of the City of London, it is necessary to be an alderman and to have been a sheriff of the City of London.

The title &quot;Alderman&quot; is used for both men and women and may be prefixed to a person&#x27;s name (e.g., Alderman John Smith, Alderman Smith, or for women; Alderman Mrs (or Miss) Smith).

====Scotland====
In Scotland, the office of &quot;baillie&quot; bore some similarities to that of alderman in England and Wales.

===United States===
Depending on the jurisdiction, an alderman could have been part of the legislative or judicial local government.

A &quot;board of aldermen&quot; is the governing executive or legislative body of many cities and towns in the United States. Boards of aldermen are used in many rural areas of the United States as opposed to a larger city council or city commission; its members are typically called &quot;alderman&quot;. The term is sometimes used instead of city council, but it can also refer to an executive board independent of the council, or to what is essentially an upper house of a bicameral legislature (as it was in New York City until the 20th century).

In Illinois, the Illinois Municipal Code allows for the formation and existence of an aldermanic-city form of municipal government. As an example, in Chicago, the Chicago City Council is composed of fifty aldermen (not councilors). As of 2021, Chicago aldermen are legally referred to by the State of Illinois as alderpersons, though the terms alderman and aldermanic remain in common use.

Some cities such as, Ithaca, New York identify aldermen as &#x27;alderpersons&#x27;. Others, including New Haven, Connecticut, use the term &quot;alders&quot;.

Historically the term could also refer to local municipal judges in small legal proceedings (as in Pennsylvania and Delaware). Pennsylvania&#x27;s aldermen were phased out in the early 20th century.

<text>.fm is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Federated States of Micronesia, an independent island nation located in the Pacific Ocean.

== Registration ==
Except for reserved names like .com.fm, .net.fm, .org.fm and others, any person in the world can register a .fm domain for a fee, much of the income from which goes to the government and people of the islands. 

On March 29, 2018, .fm began allowing registration of emoji domains.

== Domain hack ==
The domain name is popular (and thus economically valuable) for FM radio stations and streaming audio websites (other similar ccTLDs are .am, .tv, .cd, .dj and .mu); a notable example is Last.fm, a social music website.

<text>.am is the internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Armenia. The Armenia Network Information Centre is managed by the Internet Society of Armenia and is headquartered in Yerevan.

== Regulation ==
The registry for .am is operated by ISOC-AM, the local chapter of the Internet Society.

Regulatory notes:
* Any person in the world can register a .am, .com.am, .net.am, .org.am domain for a fee.
* Each domain name is subject to review. Generally, each review takes about 2 or 3 working days.
* Armenian law prohibits its domain names from being used for spam, pornography, or terrorism sites.
* The AM-NIC was moved over to IPv6 address compatibility in line with the global DNS.
* Unicode compatible names will not be instituted at AM-NIC until all issues related to IPv6 are resolved.

== Usage in domain hacks ==
Domains within the .am ccTLD enjoy popularity due to the connection to AM radio (similar to the .fm and .tv ccTLDs), and the ability to form English words ending in &quot;am&quot; — e.g. the mobile photo sharing service Instagram uses the Armenian domain name Instagr.am. The live video streaming service Stre.am uses the TLD to form their operative keyword, &quot;Stream&quot;. American music artist and producer will.i.am uses the domain for his website. Such unconventional usage of TLDs in domain names are called domain hacks.

==Second top-level domain==

In 2014, a new Armenian top-level domain name was added, intended for Armenian language domain names. The TLD is .հայ (“hy”), from the ethnonym for Armenian. It launched in 2016.

==Partnerships==
Armenia is a member of the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries and RIPE NCC.

<text>Symbolics Document Examiner is a powerful and early hypertext system developed at Symbolics (a manufacturer of high-end workstations) by Janet Walker in 1985. The Symbolics Document Examiner was first used for a hypertext implementation of the Symbolics manual in the sixth release of the Genera operating system, and was well liked, winning an award from the Society for Technical Documentation.

==History==

The Symbolics manual was an 8,000-page document that was represented in a 10,000-node &quot;hyperdocument&quot; containing 23,000 links in all. The entire manual required 10 MB of storage space - a significant amount in 1985, even on the Lisp machines Symbolics sold. The Symbolics Document Examiner used a hierarchical structure, which differed from other experimental hypertext systems; it apparently was partially inspired by an even earlier hypertext system, the precursor to Texinfo which originated with Emacs.

Symbolics Document Examiner users could add bookmarks, which allowed returning to specific items easier; this method was later incorporated in graphical web browsers. The system also supported on-line substring searching. The biggest drawback to the Symbolics Document Examiner was that users could not make changes to any information or to a document&#x27;s navigation.

The authoring environment for the Document Examiner was Symbolics Concordia. With Symbolics Concordia it was possible to edit all documentation.

<text>.cd is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was created in 1997 as a replacement for the .zr (Zaire) ccTLD, which was phased out and eventually deleted in 2001.

Except for reserved names like .com.cd, .net.cd, .org.cd, and others, any person in the world can register a .cd domain for a fee. 

Until 2011, the registry was managed by nic.cd. It was then delegated to the Société Congolaise des Postes et Télécommunications (SCPT).

==.zr==
.zr is the former Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Zaire. When Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1997, .zr was phased out and .cd took its place. In 2001, .zr was deleted.

<doc id="286945" wikidata="Q748913" url="?curid=286945" title="USS Harry S. Truman">
<text>USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; (CVN-75) is the eighth of the United States Navy, and is named after the 33rd President of the United States, Harry S. Truman. She is homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia.

&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; was launched on 7 September 1996 by Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, Virginia, and commissioned on 25 July 1998 with Captain Thomas Otterbein in command. President Bill Clinton was the keynote speaker, and other notable attendees and speakers included Missouri Representative Ike Skelton, Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton.

&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; was initially the flagship of Carrier Group Two and, beginning 1 October 2004, of Carrier Strike Group Ten.

Beginning in 2001, the &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; Carrier Battle Group participated in Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Deny Flight, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Summer Pulse &#x27;04, and NATO Operation Medshark/Majestic Eagle &#x27;04.

In the first half of 2016, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;, as flagship of Carrier Strike Group 8, carried out an eight-month air operation deployment against ISIL from the Eastern Mediterranean as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The ship has been the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 8 since June 2014.

==Description==
&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; (also known as &quot;HST&quot; within the Navy) is long and wide, and is as high as a 24-story building, at . The supercarrier can accommodate around 90 aircraft and has a flight deck in size, using four elevators that are each to move planes between the flight deck and the hangar bay. With a combat load, &quot;HST&quot; displaces almost 97,000 tons and can accommodate 6,250 crewmembers.

The warship uses two Mark II stockless anchors that came from and weigh 30 tons each, with each link of the anchor chain weighing . She is equipped with three 20 mm Phalanx CIWS mounts and two Sea Sparrow SAM launchers.

&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; cost over $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars to construct.

===Propulsion===
Two Westinghouse A4W nuclear reactors are used for propulsion, which means that the ship is capable of steaming more than three million miles before refueling. The ship has four five-bladed propellers that weigh each and can drive the ship at speeds over .

===Awards===
&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; has been the recipient of numerous awards recognizing the ship&#x27;s excellence. They include
*Battenberg Cup 2003
*Battle &quot;E&quot; in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2014
*Dorie P. Miller Memorial Award for Food Service in 2002 and 2004
*Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award, an honor given to the most battle-ready ship in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet 2004 and 2009
*Ney Award in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2005
*Admiral Stan Arthur Award, 2004

===Ship&#x27;s seal and battle flag===

The oval seal was designed by the ship&#x27;s pre-commissioning crew and is primarily blue and gold. According to the ship&#x27;s history webpage, the coat of arms &quot;characterizes the global on-station capability of the ship and the United States Navy&quot; and &quot;Truman&#x27;s name forms the shape of a forward-deployed aircraft carrier prepared to uphold and protect American interests&quot;. The three flags near the bottom represent the letters &quot;HST&quot;. The 33 gold stars surrounding the seal represent Truman&#x27;s position as the 33rd President.

The &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; battle flag was also designed by the ship&#x27;s crew, and is a variation of the guidons carried by the companies of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment of the 35th Infantry Division, such as Battery D, the battery under the command of then-Army Capt. Harry Truman during World War I. It consists of crossed cannons on a scarlet background with the phrase &quot;Give &#x27;em hell&quot;, a reference to Truman&#x27;s 1948 re-election campaign.

==Ship history==
===Pre-commissioning and construction===
Her keel was laid by Newport News Shipbuilding on 29 November 1993 and the ship was christened on 7 September 1996. &quot;HST&quot; was authorized and laid down as , but her name was changed in February 1995 at the direction of then-Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton.

Three Newport News ship workers died during construction when a pump room filled with methane and hydrogen sulfide gases during a sewage leak on 12 July 1997. They are commemorated by a brass plaque in the tunnel off Hangar Bay No. 1. The ship was christened on 7 September 1996, launched 13 September 1996, and the crew began moving aboard from contract housing in Newport News in January 1998. The ship successfully completed builder&#x27;s sea trial on 11 June 1998 after a short delay due to noise issues in one of the reactor closure heads. The ship was officially accepted by the Navy on 30 June 1998 and was commissioned on 25 July 1998 at Naval Station Norfolk.

===1998–1999===
In August 1998, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; left port for the first time to conduct certifications to test her ability to recover and launch aircraft successfully. That was followed by numerous sea trials that challenged the ship and her crew with various training exercises.

===2000–2001===
On 28 November 2000, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; began her maiden deployment with Carrier Air Wing 3 (CVW-3) on board.

On 26 December 2000, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; transited the Suez Canal &quot;in support of Operation Southern Watch&quot; with Carrier Air Wing Three flying 869 combat sorties, including a strike on Iraqi integrated air defense system sites, in a sanctioned response to Iraqi surface-to-air missile fire against United Nations Security Council coalition forces. Combat operations ended on 27 April. Almost six months later and after of traveling, she returned to the U.S. on 23 May. She then entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, for her first planned incremental availability (PIA) on 5 September 2001.

Despite plans to cross the equator and visit South Africa, diplomatic issues caused her, instead, to transit the Suez Canal, stopping in Portsmouth, England, prior to returning home on 18 April 2005.

On 1 September 2005, in response to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; set sail for the devastated U.S. Gulf Coast. She arrived in the Gulf of Mexico on 4 September and served as the flagship for the naval task force. While the ship&#x27;s strike group (Carrier Strike Group 10) commander, Rear Adm. Joseph Kilkenny, was appointed deputy commander of Joint Task Force Gulf Coast (also known as JTF Katrina and Rita), the ship remained anchored in the gulf and provided desalinated water for the relief effort via helicopter (the actual command hub for the JTF was ). The carrier also provided support to JRB New Orleans in the form of aviation boatswain&#x27;s mates and cooks to keep that station in operation. &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; returned to home port in October 2005 after five weeks of relief efforts.

The ship was awarded her fourth Battle E award for the East Coast (for 2008) in early 2009. Jimmy Buffett visited the ship and performed a concert on 28 January.

===2009===
In February, &quot;HST&quot; completed a nearly seven-month PIA at the NNSY in Portsmouth, Virginia.

On 5 August, EA-18G Growlers from Electronic Attack Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) and Electronic Attack Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) completed their first at-sea carrier-arrested landing (trap) aboard &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;.

&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; entered a docked PIA at NNSY in late March.

On 28 February, the aircraft carrier began her dry-docking PIA maintenance and yard overhaul period at NNSY in Portsmouth (&quot;pictured&quot;). During this maintenance cycle, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; received a new main mast, an upgrade in her close-in weapons systems, and the installation of the automated digital network system, which provides the carrier with enhanced communications and cooperative engagement capabilities to assess possible threats. &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; was expected to complete this DPIA yard overhaul in early 2012 and begin preparations for her sixth overseas deployment. Also, her berthing spaces were also upgraded, installing 2,500 racks, replacing 46,000 square feet of deck and painting 106,000 square feet of spaces.

On 21 December, Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh visited USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; stationed near the Yemeni island of Berim. On 26 December while transiting the Strait of Hormuz, several unguided rockets fired by Iran landed about away from &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;, which was traveling with the destroyer &quot;Bulkeley&quot; and the . Iran had announced over maritime radio it was carrying out tests &quot;only 23 minutes before&quot; and was criticized by the U.S. Central Command for &quot;Firing weapons so close to passing coalition ships and commercial traffic within an internationally recognized maritime traffic lane.&quot;

On 29 December, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; began launching strikes against the Islamic State group. By mid-April 2016, aircraft of Carrier Air Wing Seven operating from the carrier had dropped 1,118 pieces of ordnance in operations against the group, surpassing a record of 1,085 pieces that was set by aircraft assigned to in 2015.

===2016===
On 12 January, an unarmed Iranian drone flew directly over &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; in international waters and took &quot;precise&quot; photos, according to state television in the Islamic Republic. In the first half of 2016, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;, as flagship of Carrier Strike Group 8, carried out an eight-month air operation deployment against ISIL from the Eastern Mediterranean as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. On 3 June, F/A-18 Hornets launched from &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; conducted air strikes against ISIS targets from the eastern Mediterranean.

===2019===
On 27 February, the Pentagon announced that &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;″s midlife refueling and overhaul, tentatively scheduled for 2024, may be cancelled and the ship instead retired early as a cost-saving measure. The likelihood of the ship actually being decommissioned more than 20 years ahead of schedule was uncertain, as this would have left the carrier fleet at 10 ships, one below the legally mandated level. The nominated chief of naval operations told Congress he supports &quot;to forgo&quot; the $ 3.5 billion overhaul scheduled for &quot;HST&quot;. Congress prevented the Navy from taking the same action with sister ship in 2016, as well as the White House, as President Donald Trump had promised to increase the carrier fleet to 12.

On 1 May, President Trump announced he overrode the decision to decommission USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;.

In late August, a malfunction of the ship&#x27;s electrical distribution system was announced as the cause that would prevent her scheduled deployment.

=== 2022 ===

In January 2022, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; and her strike group came under command of NATO&#x27;s Naval Striking and Support Forces for the first time since the Cold War, for a 10-day exercise patrolling the Mediterranean. From 17 to 23 May, &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; and Carrier Strike Group 8 took part in the NATO vigilance activity, Neptune Shield 2022.
On 8 July, an F/A-18E Super Hornet of Carrier Air Wing One was blown overboard into the Mediterranean Sea. The carrier had encountered unexpected heavy weather while conducting a replenishment-at-sea. One sailor received minor injuries. On 8 August 2022, the United States Sixth Fleet announced the lost aircraft had been recovered from a depth of using a remotely operated CURV-21 recovery vehicle. On 8 August, &quot;The Aviationist&quot; reported that based on a photo sent to the outlet, taken at the Port of Augusta, Sicily, they were able to identify the involved aircraft as the aircraft with modex &quot;205&quot;, part of Strike Fighter Squadron 211 (VFA-211). The aircraft was loaded aboard Military Sealift Command roll-on/roll-off ship at the Port of Augusta on 16 August to be transported back to the United States.

&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 12 September. On 21 November, the Navy accepted Auxiliary Personnel Lighter 68 (APL68), with around 600 berths, saying it would support the impending &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; carrier repair cycle.

=== 2025 ===
&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; was involved in a collision with the Panamanian-flagged merchant vessel &quot;Besiktas-M&quot; at approximately 11:46 p.m. local time on 12 February, while operating in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt, in the Mediterranean Sea. The collision did not endanger the aircraft carrier with no reports of flooding or injuries. An investigation into the collision was launched. One week later the Truman&#x27;s captain, Captain Dave Snowden, was relieved of command.

<doc id="286947" wikidata="Q609408" url="?curid=286947" title="Self-organization">
<text>Self-organization, also called spontaneous order in the social sciences, is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system. The process can be spontaneous when sufficient energy is available, not needing control by any external agent. It is often triggered by seemingly random fluctuations, amplified by positive feedback. The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, distributed over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically robust and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation. Chaos theory discusses self-organization in terms of islands of predictability in a sea of chaotic unpredictability.

Self-organization occurs in many physical, chemical, biological, robotic, and cognitive systems. Examples of self-organization include crystallization, thermal convection of fluids, chemical oscillation, animal swarming, neural circuits, and black markets.

== Overview ==
Self-organization is realized in the physics of non-equilibrium processes, and in chemical reactions, where it is often characterized as self-assembly. The concept has proven useful in biology, from the molecular to the ecosystem level. Cited examples of self-organizing behavior also appear in the literature of many other disciplines, both in the natural sciences and in the social sciences (such as economics or anthropology). Self-organization has also been observed in mathematical systems such as cellular automata. Self-organization is an example of the related concept of emergence.

Self-organization relies on four basic ingredients:
# strong dynamical non-linearity, often (though not necessarily) involving positive and negative feedback
# balance of exploitation and exploration
# multiple interactions among components 
# availability of energy (to overcome the natural tendency toward entropy, or loss of free energy)

==Principles==
The cybernetician William Ross Ashby formulated the original principle of self-organization in 1947. It states that any deterministic dynamic system automatically evolves towards a state of equilibrium that can be described in terms of an attractor in a basin of surrounding states. Once there, the further evolution of the system is constrained to remain in the attractor. This constraint implies a form of mutual dependency or coordination between its constituent components or subsystems. In Ashby&#x27;s terms, each subsystem has adapted to the environment formed by all other subsystems.

The cybernetician Heinz von Foerster formulated the principle of &quot;order from noise&quot; in 1960. It notes that self-organization is facilitated by random perturbations (&quot;noise&quot;) that let the system explore a variety of states in its state space. This increases the chance that the system will arrive into the basin of a &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;deep&quot; attractor, from which it then quickly enters the attractor itself. The biophysicist Henri Atlan developed this concept by proposing the principle of &quot;complexity from noise&quot; () first in the 1972 book &quot;L&#x27;organisation biologique et la théorie de l&#x27;information&quot; and then in the 1979 book &quot;Entre le cristal et la fumée&quot;. The physicist and chemist Ilya Prigogine formulated a similar principle as &quot;order through fluctuations&quot; or &quot;order out of chaos&quot;. It is applied in the method of simulated annealing for problem solving and machine learning.

==History==
The idea that the dynamics of a system can lead to an increase in its organization has a long history. The ancient atomists such as Democritus and Lucretius believed that a designing intelligence is unnecessary to create order in nature, arguing that given enough time and space and matter, order emerges by itself.

The philosopher René Descartes presents self-organization hypothetically in the fifth part of his 1637 &quot;Discourse on Method&quot;. He elaborated on the idea in his unpublished work &quot;The World&quot;.

Immanuel Kant used the term &quot;self-organizing&quot; in his 1790 &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;, where he argued that teleology is a meaningful concept only if there exists such an entity whose parts or &quot;organs&quot; are simultaneously ends and means. Such a system of organs must be able to behave as if it has a mind of its own, that is, it is capable of governing itself.

Sadi Carnot (1796–1832) and Rudolf Clausius (1822–1888) discovered the second law of thermodynamics in the 19th century. It states that total entropy, sometimes understood as disorder, will always increase over time in an isolated system. This means that a system cannot spontaneously increase its order without an external relationship that decreases order elsewhere in the system (e.g. through consuming the low-entropy energy of a battery and diffusing high-entropy heat).

18th-century thinkers had sought to understand the &quot;universal laws of form&quot; to explain the observed forms of living organisms. This idea became associated with Lamarckism and fell into disrepute until the early 20th century, when D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) attempted to revive it.

The psychiatrist and engineer W. Ross Ashby introduced the term &quot;self-organizing&quot; to contemporary science in 1947. It was taken up by the cyberneticians Heinz von Foerster, Gordon Pask, Stafford Beer; and von Foerster organized a conference on &quot;The Principles of Self-Organization&quot; at the University of Illinois&#x27; Allerton Park in June, 1960 which led to a series of conferences on Self-Organizing Systems. Norbert Wiener took up the idea in the second edition of his &quot;Cybernetics: or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine&quot; (1961).

Self-organization was associated with general systems theory in the 1960s, but did not become commonplace in the scientific literature until physicists Hermann Haken et al. and complex systems researchers adopted it in a greater picture from cosmology Erich Jantsch, chemistry with dissipative system, biology and sociology as autopoiesis to system thinking in the following 1980s (Santa Fe Institute) and 1990s (complex adaptive system), until our days with the disruptive emerging technologies profounded by a rhizomatic network theory. 

Around 2008–2009, a concept of guided self-organization started to take shape. This approach aims to regulate self-organization for specific purposes, so that a dynamical system may reach specific attractors or outcomes. The regulation constrains a self-organizing process within a complex system by restricting local interactions between the system components, rather than following an explicit control mechanism or a global design blueprint. The desired outcomes, such as increases in the resultant internal structure and/or functionality, are achieved by combining task-independent global objectives with task-dependent constraints on local interactions.

==By field==
===Physics===

The many self-organizing phenomena in physics include phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking such as spontaneous magnetization and crystal growth in classical physics, and the laser, superconductivity and Bose–Einstein condensation in quantum physics. Self-organization is found in self-organized criticality in dynamical systems, in tribology, in spin foam systems, and in loop quantum gravity, 
in plasma,
in river basins and deltas, in dendritic solidification (snow flakes), in capillary imbibition and in turbulent structure.

===Chemistry===
Self-organization in chemistry includes drying-induced self-assembly, molecular self-assembly, reaction–diffusion systems and oscillating reactions, autocatalytic networks, liquid crystals, grid complexes, colloidal crystals, self-assembled monolayers, micelles, microphase separation of block copolymers, and Langmuir–Blodgett films.

===Biology===

Self-organization in biology can be observed in spontaneous folding of proteins and other biomacromolecules, self-assembly of lipid bilayer membranes, pattern formation and morphogenesis in developmental biology, the coordination of human movement, eusocial behavior in insects (bees, ants, termites) and mammals, and flocking behavior in birds and fish.

The mathematical biologist Stuart Kauffman and other structuralists have suggested that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, this does not take into account the essential role of energy in driving biochemical reactions in cells. The systems of reactions in any cell are self-catalyzing, but not simply self-organizing, as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy. Self-organization is not an alternative to natural selection, but it constrains what evolution can do and provides mechanisms such as the self-assembly of membranes which evolution then exploits.

The evolution of order in living systems and the generation of order in certain non-living systems was proposed to obey a common fundamental principal called “the Darwinian dynamic” that was formulated by first considering how microscopic order is generated in simple non-biological systems that are far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Consideration was then extended to short, replicating RNA molecules assumed to be similar to the earliest forms of life in the RNA world. It was shown that the underlying order-generating processes of self-organization in the non-biological systems and in replicating RNA are basically similar.

===Cosmology===
In his 1995 conference paper &quot;Cosmology as a problem in critical phenomena&quot; Lee Smolin said that several cosmological objects or phenomena, such as spiral galaxies, galaxy formation processes in general, early structure formation, quantum gravity and the large scale structure of the universe might be the result of or have involved certain degree of self-organization. He argues that self-organized systems are often critical systems, with structure spreading out in space and time over every available scale, as shown for example by Per Bak and his collaborators. Therefore, because the distribution of matter in the universe is more or less scale invariant over many orders of magnitude, ideas and strategies developed in the study of self-organized systems could be helpful in tackling certain unsolved problems in cosmology and astrophysics.

===Computer science===
Phenomena from mathematics and computer science such as cellular automata, random graphs, and some instances of evolutionary computation and artificial life exhibit features of self-organization. In swarm robotics, self-organization is used to produce emergent behavior. In particular the theory of random graphs has been used as a justification for self-organization as a general principle of complex systems. In the field of multi-agent systems, understanding how to engineer systems that are capable of presenting self-organized behavior is an active research area. Optimization algorithms can be considered self-organizing because they aim to find the optimal solution to a problem. If the solution is considered as a state of the iterative system, the optimal solution is the selected, converged structure of the system. Self-organizing networks include small-world networks self-stabilization and scale-free networks. These emerge from bottom-up interactions, unlike top-down hierarchical networks within organizations, which are not self-organizing. Cloud computing systems have been argued to be inherently self-organizing, but while they have some autonomy, they are not self-managing as they do not have the goal of reducing their own complexity.

===Cybernetics===
Norbert Wiener regarded the automatic serial identification of a black box and its subsequent reproduction as self-organization in cybernetics. The importance of phase locking or the &quot;attraction of frequencies&quot;, as he called it, is discussed in the 2nd edition of his &quot;&quot;. K. Eric Drexler sees self-replication as a key step in nano and universal assembly. By contrast, the four concurrently connected galvanometers of W. Ross Ashby&#x27;s Homeostat hunt, when perturbed, to converge on one of many possible stable states. Ashby used his state counting measure of variety to describe stable states and produced the &quot;Good Regulator&quot; theorem which requires internal models for self-organized endurance and stability (e.g. Nyquist stability criterion). Warren McCulloch proposed &quot;Redundancy of Potential Command&quot; as characteristic of the organization of the brain and human nervous system and the necessary condition for self-organization. Heinz von Foerster proposed Redundancy, &quot;R&quot;=1 − &quot;H&quot;/&quot;H&quot;max, where &quot;H&quot; is entropy. In essence this states that unused potential communication bandwidth is a measure of self-organization.

In the 1970s Stafford Beer considered self-organization necessary for autonomy in persisting and living systems. He applied his viable system model to management. It consists of five parts: the monitoring of performance of the survival processes (1), their management by recursive application of regulation (2), homeostatic operational control (3) and development (4) which produce maintenance of identity (5) under environmental perturbation. Focus is prioritized by an alerting &quot;algedonic loop&quot; feedback: a sensitivity to both pain and pleasure produced from under-performance or over-performance relative to a standard capability.

In the 1990s Gordon Pask argued that von Foerster&#x27;s H and Hmax were not independent, but interacted via countably infinite recursive concurrent spin processes which he called concepts. His strict definition of concept &quot;a procedure to bring about a relation&quot; permitted his theorem &quot;Like concepts repel, unlike concepts attract&quot; to state a general spin-based principle of self-organization. His edict, an exclusion principle, &quot;There are No Doppelgangers&quot; means no two concepts can be the same. After sufficient time, all concepts attract and coalesce as pink noise. The theory applies to all organizationally closed or homeostatic processes that produce enduring and coherent products which evolve, learn and adapt.

===Sociology===

The self-organizing behavior of social animals and the self-organization of simple mathematical structures both suggest that self-organization should be expected in human society. Tell-tale signs of self-organization are usually statistical properties shared with self-organizing physical systems. Examples such as critical mass, herd behavior, groupthink and others, abound in sociology, economics, behavioral finance and anthropology.
Spontaneous order can be influenced by arousal.

In social theory, the concept of self-referentiality has been introduced as a sociological application of self-organization theory by Niklas Luhmann (1984). For Luhmann the elements of a social system are self-producing communications, i.e. a communication produces further communications and hence a social system can reproduce itself as long as there is dynamic communication. For Luhmann, human beings are sensors in the environment of the system. Luhmann developed an evolutionary theory of society and its subsystems, using functional analyses and systems theory.

===Economics===
The market economy is sometimes said to be self-organizing. Paul Krugman has written on the role that market self-organization plays in the business cycle in his book &quot;The Self Organizing Economy&quot;. Friedrich Hayek coined the term &quot;catallaxy&quot; to describe a &quot;self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation&quot;, in regards to the spontaneous order of the free market economy. Neo-classical economists hold that imposing central planning usually makes the self-organized economic system less efficient. On the other end of the spectrum, economists consider that market failures are so significant that self-organization produces bad results and that the state should direct production and pricing. Most economists adopt an intermediate position and recommend a mixture of market economy and command economy characteristics (sometimes called a mixed economy). When applied to economics, the concept of self-organization can quickly become ideologically imbued.

===Learning===
Enabling others to &quot;learn how to learn&quot; is often taken to mean instructing them how to submit to being taught. Self-organized learning (SOL) denies that &quot;the expert knows best&quot; or that there is ever &quot;the one best method&quot;, insisting instead on &quot;the construction of personally significant, relevant and viable meaning&quot; to be tested experientially by the learner. This may be collaborative, and more rewarding personally. It is seen as a lifelong process, not limited to specific learning environments (home, school, university) or under the control of authorities such as parents and professors. It needs to be tested, and intermittently revised, through the personal experience of the learner. It need not be restricted by either consciousness or language. Fritjof Capra argued that it is poorly recognized within psychology and education. It may be related to cybernetics as it involves a negative feedback control loop, or to systems theory. It can be conducted as a learning conversation or dialog between learners or within one person.

===Transportation===
The self-organizing behavior of drivers in traffic flow determines almost all the spatiotemporal behavior of traffic, such as traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck, highway capacity, and the emergence of moving traffic jams. These self-organizing effects are explained by Boris Kerner&#x27;s three-phase traffic theory.

===Linguistics===
Order appears spontaneously in the evolution of language as individual and population behavior interacts with biological evolution.

===Research===
Self-organized funding allocation (SOFA) is a method of distributing funding for scientific research. In this system, each researcher is allocated an equal amount of funding, and is required to anonymously allocate a fraction of their funds to the research of others. Proponents of SOFA argue that it would result in similar distribution of funding as the present grant system, but with less overhead. In 2016, a test pilot of SOFA began in the Netherlands.

==Criticism==
Heinz Pagels, in a 1985 review of Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers&#x27;s book &quot;Order Out of Chaos&quot; in &quot;Physics Today&quot;, appeals to authority:

Of course, Blumenfeld does not answer the further question of how those program-like structures emerge in the first place. His explanation leads directly to infinite regress.

In theology, Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; assumes a teleological created universe in rejecting the idea that something can be a self-sufficient cause of its own organization:

<text>Adobe Authorware (previously Macromedia Authorware, originally Authorware) was an elearning authoring tool with its own interpreted, flowchart-based, graphical programming language. Authorware was used for creating interactive elearning programs that could integrate a range of multimedia content, particularly electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) applications. The flowchart model differentiated Authorware from other authoring tools, such as Adobe Flash and Adobe Director, which rely on a visual stage, time-line and script structure.

== History ==
Authorware was originally produced by Authorware Inc., founded in 1987 by Dr Michael Allen. Allen had contributed to the development of the PLATO computer-assisted instruction system during the 1970s that was developed jointly by the University of Illinois and Control Data Corporation. CDC, where Allen was Director of Advanced Instructional Systems R&amp;D, invested heavily in the development of an expansive library of interactive &quot;courseware&quot; to run on the PLATO system.

PLATO courseware was developed in a unique programming language called TUTOR, which provided structures unique to learning interactions, such as answer judging and branching. TUTOR programmers were able to build powerful scripted systems that included simulations and games. However, despite the intent to create a special-purpose programming language usable by educators, and the decades of work that went into it, the TUTOR language was not easy to learn.

Authorware started as a system aimed at addressing the problems in TUTOR. Originally titled &quot;Course of Action&quot; (CoA), it was a Macintosh-only program, but produced runtime programs for both the Mac and DOS. Authorware came later and produced DOS runtime versions until the release of the first Microsoft Windows version.

Authorware used a visual interface with icons, representing essential components of the interactive learning experience. &quot;Authors&quot; placed icons along a “flowline” to create a sequence of events. Icons represented such components as Display—put something on the screen, Question—ask the learner for a response, Calc—perform a calculation, read data, and/or store data, and Animate—move something around on the screen. By simply placing the icons in sequence and adjusting their properties, authors could instantly see the structure of program they were creating and, most importantly, run it to see what learners would see. On-screen changes were easy to make, even while the program was running.

Authorware became a rapid success in the marketplace, obtaining more than 80% of the market in about three years. Authorware Inc. merged with MacroMind/Paracomp in 1992 to form Macromedia. In December 2005, Adobe and Macromedia merged, under the Adobe Systems name. The most recent version of Authorware is 7.02; version 7 was released in 2003. The Authorware player has some issues with Internet Explorer 7 and later under Windows Vista due to &quot;Protected mode&quot; as well as runtime errors due to a bug in Authorware&#x27;s implementation of ReadURL() Javascript function.

It was generally known in the Authorware development community that version 8.0 was in production prior to the merger between the two companies, with 4 beta versions released to external testing shortly before the merger was completed. Among several other features intended for the new version, the ability to publish to Flash&#x27;s SWF (ShockWave Flash) was at the top of the list. Once production shifted to Adobe&#x27;s off-shore development facility in Bangalore, India, the free-flow of information that had been enjoyed between Macromedia&#x27;s engineering team and its beta testers was curtailed. On Friday, 3 August 2007, after several years of keeping the development community in limbo, Adobe finally announced its plans to discontinue development of Authorware.

== Usage and features ==
Authorware&#x27;s distinctive style revolved around a central icon: the Interaction Icon. The structure of the authoring environment encouraged rich interaction; complex user feed-back was not only possible but somewhat suggested by the software, rather than suggesting the usual media diffusion. This Interaction Icon allowed various forms of user feedback (move object to, along a line, click an object or hot-spot; plus the usual text-entry, keypress, etc.)

The original strength in education of Authorware could be linked to its roots in pedagogical models based on constructivist views.

Authorware programs start by creating a &quot;flowline&quot;, which is a flowchart showing the structure of the developer&#x27;s program. The developer can add and manage text, graphics, animation, sound and video; develop interactivity and add navigational elements such as links, buttons, and menus. Macromedia Flash and Macromedia Director movies can also be integrated into an Authorware project. &quot;Xtra Extensions&quot; (or &quot;Xtras&quot;) could also be used to extend the functionality of Authorware, which is similar to HyperCard&#x27;s XCMDs. Authorware&#x27;s power can be even better utilized with the use of variables, functions and expressions. Authorware could interpret both its built-in proprietary scripting language and JavaScript version 1.5.

Authorware programs could be distributed as stand-alone executable files, or over the web which required a proprietary Authorware Web Player. Adobe also distributed free stand-alone players for Mac and Windows.

=== Use in eLearning ===
Authorware was particularly well suited to eLearning content, as it included highly customizable templates for Computer-based training and web-based training, including learning assessment tools. Working with these templates, businesses and schools could rapidly assemble multimedia training materials without needing to hire a full-fledged programmer. Intuitively named dialog boxes took care of input and output. The flow chart model made the re-use of lesson elements straightforward. Being both AICC- and SCORM-compliant, Authorware could be used to deliver content via any Learning Management System that supported AICC or SCORM.

=== Legacy ===
In Adobe&#x27;s lineup of authoring tools, Adobe Captivate eventually became the flagship product. Authorware was officially discontinued in 2007. The final release, in 2003, was version 7.0.2.

<text>BPM is the call sign of the official short-wave time signal service of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, broadcasting from CAS&#x27;s National Time Service Center in Pucheng County, Shaanxi at , roughly 70 km northeast of Lintong, along with NTSC&#x27;s long-wave time signal BPL on 100 kHz.

BPM is broadcast at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 MHz, the same frequencies as WWV and WWVH, following the schedule listed below:
== Transmission format ==


BPM transmits different signals on a half-hour schedule, modulated with 1 kHz audio tones to provide second and minute ticks:
BPM is idiosyncratic in that it transmits UT1 time between minutes 25 through to 29 and 55 through to 59, which creates an odd click-beep effect when heard below a stronger time signal station such as WWV especially when UT1 seconds are halfway between UTC seconds, close to a leap-second event.

<text>Mainland is defined as &quot;relating to or forming the main part of a country or continent, not including the islands around it [regardless of status under territorial jurisdiction by an entity].&quot; The term is often politically, economically and/or demographically more significant than politically associated remote territories, such as exclaves or oceanic islands situated outside the continental shelf.

In geography, &quot;mainland&quot; can denote the continental part of any polity or the main island within an island nation. In geopolitics, &quot;mainland&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like metropole as an antonym to overseas territories. In the sense of &quot;&quot;, mainland is the opposite of . In some language a separate concept of &quot;mainland&quot; is missing and is replaced with a &quot;continental portion&quot;.

The term is relative: in Tasmania, continental Australia is the mainland, while to residents of Flinders Island, the main island of Tasmania is also &quot;the mainland&quot;, though the geological Australian continent includes all the former plus the island of New Guinea and all the smaller islands (e.g. the Torres Strait Islands) in between.

=== Internal ===
&quot;This list denotes prominent usages of the term &quot;mainland&quot; to distinguish between distinct regions within a single country based on an &quot;islands-to-mainland&quot; relationship.

=== Internal (disputed) ===
&quot;This list denotes prominent internal usages of the term &quot;mainland&quot; that are disputed.&quot;

* Mainland Taiwan, as opposed to Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu and other islands of Taiwan
** The cause of the dispute is Taiwan&#x27;s uncertain sovereignty.

Politically, Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu are &quot;de facto&quot; top-level subdivisions within Taiwan, classified as counties.
* Mainland Ukraine, as opposed to Crimea, which is nonetheless geographically part of the European mainland.
** The cause of this dispute is the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. From a Russian perspective, Russia is the mainland to Crimea.

=== Irredentist ===
&quot;This list denotes prominent usages of the term &quot;mainland&quot; to distinguish between distinct regions within an irredentist region&quot;

*The relationship between the &quot;de facto&quot; independent state of Republic of China (ROC; commonly called Taiwan) and the PRC as that of an island to its mainland. This is done in order to tacitly support the PRC&#x27;s territorial claim to Taiwan. This is highly controversial among supporters of Taiwanese independence. Within Taiwan, Pan-Blue politicians who support the ROC&#x27;s constitutional territorial claim to the Chinese mainland have popularised this phrase as well.
* Mainland Greece as opposed to the Greek part of Cyprus

<text>Canadian content (abbreviated CanCon, cancon or can-con; ) refers to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) requirements, derived from the Broadcasting Act of Canada, that radio and television broadcasters (including cable and satellite specialty channels, and since the passing of the &quot;Online Streaming Act&quot;, Internet-based video services) must produce and broadcast a certain percentage of content that was at least partly written, produced, presented, or otherwise contributed to by persons from Canada. CanCon also refers to that content itself, and, more generally, to cultural and creative content that is Canadian in nature.

Current Canadian content percentages are as follows: radio airplay is 35% (with partial exceptions for some specialty formats such as classical). Some stations are required to air a higher percentage based on their &quot;promise
of performance&quot; information during their license submission. Broadcast television is 55% cancon yearly or 50% daily (CBC has a 60% CanCon quota; some specialty or multicultural formats have lower percentages).

The loss of the protective Canadian content quota requirements is one of the concerns of those opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Canada entered into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral free trade agreement, in October 2012.

==Origins==
In enforcing the &quot; Broadcasting Act&quot;, the CRTC is obligated to ensure that &quot;each element of the Canadian broadcasting system shall contribute in an appropriate manner to the creation and presentation of Canadian programming&quot;, and that every broadcast undertaking &quot;[makes] maximum use, and in no case less than predominant use, of Canadian creative and other resources in the creation and presentation of programming&quot;.

==Radio==
===Music radio===

For music, the Canadian content requirements are referred to as the MAPL system, referring to the &quot;music&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;, &quot;performance&quot; and &quot;lyrics&quot;.

====Criteria====
To qualify as Canadian content a musical selection must generally fulfil at least two of the following conditions (one if recorded prior to January 1972):

*M (music) — the music is composed entirely by a Canadian
*A (artist) — the music is, or the lyrics are, performed principally by a Canadian
*P (performance) — the musical selection consists of a performance that is:
**Recorded wholly in Canada, or
**Performed wholly in Canada and broadcast live in Canada.
*L (lyrics) — the lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian
For the purposes of MAPL, a &quot;Canadian&quot; refers to a citizen, permanent resident, someone whose &quot;ordinary place of residence&quot; has been in Canada prior to their contribution to the musical selection, or someone who is a CRTC licensee.

A musical selection may also qualify as Canadian content if it:

* Is an instrumental performance of a composition by a Canadian.
* Is a &quot;performance of a musical composition that a Canadian has composed for instruments only.&quot;
* Was performed live or recorded after September 1, 1991, meets the criteria for either artist or performance, and a Canadian receives at least half of the credit for music and lyrics.
Some stations – especially those playing formats where there may be a limited number of Canadian recordings suitable for airplay, such as classical, jazz or oldies, may be allowed by the CRTC to meet Canadian content targets as low as 20 per cent. Stations in Windsor, Ontario, are also permitted to meet lower Canadian content targets, due to Windsor&#x27;s proximity to the Metro Detroit media market in the United States. Community radio and campus-based community radio stations often choose to meet higher Canadian content levels than commercial broadcasters, because of their mandate to support independent and underground and provide content not readily available on commercial radio or the CBC; however, this is a voluntary commitment made by these stations rather than a core CRTC requirement, and CanCon requirements may be lower for campus and community stations as they often air large quantities of category 3 music.

On satellite radio services, Canadian content regulation is applied in aggregate over the whole subscription package. Sirius XM Canada produces channels focused on Canadian music, talk, and spoken word programming (such as Canada Talks, The Verge, and Just for Laughs Radio), and carries the CBC&#x27;s main national networks (CBC Radio One and Ici Radio-Canada Première). All of these channels are incorporated into the overall lineup of the U.S. Sirius XM Radio service. The CBC also produced channels carried on the service, such as CBC Radio 3, but these channels were quietly dropped from Sirius XM in 2022 in favour of making them exclusive to the CBC&#x27;s internet radio platform CBC Music, which does not require any subscription.

====History====
Following an extensive public hearing process organized by the CRTC, the MAPL system, created by Stan Klees (co-creator of the Juno Award), was adopted in 1971 to define and identify Canadian content in pieces of music for the purposes of increasing exposure of Canadian music on Canadian radio through content regulations governing a percentage (25%) of airplay to be devoted to Canadian music. The percentage was increased to 30% in the 1980s, and to 35% effective January 3, 1999. However, most new commercial radio stations licensed since 1999 have been licensed at 40%.

Before the MAPL system was established in 1971, Canadian music was regarded with indifference by Canadian radio, and during the 1960s, Canadian radio was dominated by British or American acts. This was a major hurdle for Canadian musicians, since they could not gain attention in their home country without having a hit single in the United States or Europe first. Even after MAPL was implemented in the early 1970s, some radio stations were criticized for ghettoizing their Canadian content to dedicated program blocks, in off-peak listening hours such as early mornings or after midnight, during which the music played would be almost entirely Canadian — thus having the effect of significantly reducing how many Canadian songs would actually have to be played during peak listening times. These program blocks became mockingly known as &quot;beaver hours,&quot; featuring Canadian songs selected from the &quot;beaver bin.&quot; This practice is now reduced by CRTC regulations stipulating that CanCon percentages must be met between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., rather than allowing a station to save all their Canadian content for off-peak hours.

Artists who were active in the early CanCon era in the 1970s and 1980s have noted that their music was often dismissed by Canadian audiences as inferior product, propped up by quotas rather than quality, if they were unable to replicate their Canadian success internationally. Yet, at the same time, artists who did break through internationally also ran the risk of becoming dismissed by Canadian audiences as no longer truly Canadian.

By the 1980s, there were a range CanCon requirements depending on the radio band (AM or FM) and music programming format. AM radio required 30% of the music broadcast in a day be Canadian, and that these selections be &quot;reasonably distributed throughout the [6:00 am to midnight] broadcast day&quot;. Five percent of all records had to be two-count Canadian. FM radio had different requirements; the CRTC&#x27;s Peter G. Fleming explained in 1985 that &quot;perceiving AM as low brow and FM as high brow [the CRTC] wanted to ensure the status quo&quot;. Hit music was limited on FM radio by restricting a single song to 3 plays per day and a playlist to only 50% top-40 hits. FM stations had to commit to play a certain format and each of these FM formats had a different CanCon quotas (e.g. The &quot;Pop And Rock Softer&quot; stations required 10% for easy listening and 20% for adult contemporary, album-oriented rock stations were also at 20% and country at 30%).

The 1991 half credit for music and lyrics provision was added after Canadian Bryan Adams&#x27; album &quot;Waking Up the Neighbours&quot; did not qualify as Canadian as Adams co-wrote both the music and the lyrics with South African producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, and he did not primarily record the album in Canada, and therefore only fulfilled one of the criteria fully. It was noted that if Adams had written all the lyrics, and Lange all the music (or vice versa), the collaboration would have counted as Canadian content. As a result, under CRTC regulations of the time, none of the album&#x27;s songs were considered Canadian content. 

In December 2022, the CRTC announced a proposal to update the MAPL system to account for changes in the music industry and reduce regulatory burden. The proposal would remove the &quot;performance&quot; condition entirely, and only require lyrics and music to be principally (at least 50%) written or composed by a Canadian to qualify as Canadian content.

===Talk radio and American syndicated programming===
Unlike music radio, the rules on talk radio are more ambiguous. The vast majority of Canadian commercial English-language talk radio stations operate with local talk for most of the daylight hours, with the exception of two nationally syndicated Canadian talk show hosts: news/talk personality Charles Adler and sports talk host Bob McCown. The lone restriction is that the station must have a working studio within the region it broadcasts, which prohibits the use of entirely satellite-operated stations (which are commonplace in the United States).

Syndicated programming from the United States invariably airs after 7:00 pm local time in virtually all markets, and usually features non-political programs such as &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. More political American shows, although the now defunct CFBN aired Dennis Miller and the &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot; on tape delay in the evenings for a few months, from April through November 2007, when CFBN stopped broadcasting over the air, and &quot;The Phil Hendrie Show&quot; aired for many years on CKTB, even during the period when it focused on political content. Miller also aired on CHAM for two years from 2008 to 2010. No rule prevents American political talk shows from being aired on Canadian radio stations; such programs are simply not carried because their focus on American politics limits their relevance to Canadian radio audiences, especially given the high rights fees top American hosts such as Rush Limbaugh charge their affiliates.

As in the United States in the 1980s, the trend for AM stations in Canada in the 1990s was to apply for an FM broadcasting license or move away from music in favour of talk radio formats. (Since the late 2000s, AM radio in North America has been declining as stations have shut down and moved to FM.) The total amount of Canadian-produced content declined as broadcasters could license syndicated radio programs produced in the U.S., while the Cancon regulations were conceived to apply to music only, and not to spoken-word programming. This became particularly controversial in 1998 when stations in Toronto and Montreal started airing &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; from New York City during prime daytime hours. Stern was forced off the air not because of Canadian content, but because the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council reprimanded the stations broadcasting Stern numerous times for Stern&#x27;s comments, which prompted the two stations to drop him in short order. Stern would later move exclusively to satellite radio.

American shows that combine talk and music, such as Blair Garner, Elvis Duran, Delilah and John Tesh, usually have special playlists for airing in Canada to assist in meeting Canadian content requirements. Because of the different requirements, American syndicated oldies programs are widely popular in Canada, such as &quot;American Gold&quot;, Wolfman Jack, and &quot;M. G. Kelly&#x27;s American Hit List&quot;. These shows usually do not substitute Canadian songs, due in part to a fairly large library of Canadian musicians already in rotation in the format (such as The Guess Who, Gordon Lightfoot, Paul Anka, Terry Jacks or R. Dean Taylor). In other formats, an American syndicated program sometimes is supplemented with an all-Canadian program; for instance, CKMX will broadcast &quot;Country Countdown USA&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Grand Ole Opry Weekend&quot; along with the Canadian syndicated programs &quot;Canadian Country Spotlight&quot; and Hugh McLennan&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of the West&quot;, the last of which is also carried by several U.S. stations. American syndicated series are usually played in &quot;off peak&quot; and weekend hours.

A notable exception to the majority-Canadian spoken word programming came in 2012 when Astral Media introduced CKSL and CHAM, two stations in southern Ontario, as full-time affiliates of 24/7 Comedy Radio, a service of the U.S.-based Cumulus Media Networks. CHAM meets its studio requirement by maintaining a locally based interstitial host.

==Film and television==

To an even greater extent than on radio, Canadian television programming has been a perennially difficult proposition for the broadcast industry, particularly dramatic programming in prime-time. It is much more economical for Canadian stations to buy the Canadian rights to an American prime-time series than to finance a new homemade production. Perhaps more importantly, given the reach of the major U.S. broadcast networks in Canada, it is virtually impossible to delay or modify a U.S. program&#x27;s broadcast schedule, as regularly occurs in other foreign markets, to weed out failures or to otherwise accommodate homegrown programming.

In English Canada, presently only the public network, CBC Television, devotes the vast majority of its prime time schedule to Canadian content, having dropped U.S. network series in the mid-1990s. The French-language industry, centered in Quebec, similarly places a larger emphasis on original productions, as they have historically been more profitable than dubs of imported English-language programming, and to prioritize the province&#x27;s insular &quot;star system&quot; of local talent. The English commercial networks (CTV, Global and Citytv), conversely, rely on news and information programs for the bulk of their Canadian content while running mostly American network series, but do still commission some domestic productions for prime time broadcasts.

Some have suggested that Canadian content minimums be enacted for movie theatres, in order to improve the visibility and commercial viability of Canadian film, although none have ever been put in place. Most film festivals in Canada devote at least a portion of their schedules to Canadian films, although this is by choice rather than government regulation; a few film festivals are devoted exclusively to Canadian films, although most screen a mix of Canadian and international films. However, as movie-based premium television services such as Crave, Super Channel, Hollywood Suite and Super Écran operate on television and thus must follow Canadian content regulations, they do acquire and program Canadian films; this often still represents a Canadian film&#x27;s best opportunity to attract an audience beyond the film festival circuit.

===Regulations===

The CRTC presently requires that at least 55% of all programming aired annually by broadcast television stations, and at least 50% of programming aired daily from 6:00 pm to midnight, must be Canadian content. In May 2011, the annual CanCon requirement for private television broadcasters was lowered from 60% to 55% yearly. The CBC remains subject to the 60% quota. 

As part of its current &quot;group-based&quot; approach to the licensing of broadcast and discretionary specialty channels owned by the largest private broadcasting groups (such as Bell Media, Corus, and Rogers), the CRTC requires that at least 30% of a group&#x27;s revenue (which is aggregated across all of a group&#x27;s television services, based on their individual revenue and historical expenditure mandates) must be spent on Canadian programming expenditures (CPEs). CPEs can be reallocated between a group&#x27;s individual services, and up to 25% of CPEs for local stations can be allocated from a discretionary service. All services must also invest 5% of their revenue towards the production of &quot;programs of national interest&quot; (PNI), which include comedy, drama, long-form documentaries, children&#x27;s programming, and qualifying awards presentations honouring Canadian creative talent. In 2017, the CRTC instituted a further requirement that 75% of the PNI expenditure must fund productions by independent companies. The CRTC also added credits on CPE for the involvement of producers from Indigenous (50%) and official language minority communities (25%; French outside of Quebec, and English within Quebec).

Historically, much of these requirements have been fulfilled by lower-cost non-scripted programming, including networked talk shows and entertainment news programs, local newscasts and public affairs programming, and reruns of Canadian-produced library programs. Further complicating matters for Canadian content is the existence of simultaneous substitution, a regulation that allows over-the-air broadcasters to require the substitution of feeds from American broadcast channels on local multichannel television providers if they are airing the same programming in simulcast, thus protecting their exclusive rights to earn revenue off such programming whenever it is broadcast in Canada. Therefore, Canadian networks have made significant effort to import popular American series to take advantage of the rule, which in turn crowds out Canadian programming to less-desirable time slots.

Over the years the CRTC has tried a number of strategies intended to increase the success of Canadian programming, including expenditure requirements and time credits for productions with specific requirements. In 1999, the CRTC mandated that stations owned by the largest private groups air at least eight hours of Canadian &quot;priority programming&quot; per-week between the hours of 7 and 11  p.m.; priority programming included scripted programs, documentaries, entertainment news, and variety programs. This was replaced in 2010 with the current licensing framework, which places a larger focus on overall investments into Canadian content and the similar concept of &quot;programs of national interest&quot;, as opposed to scheduling and quantity.

=== Criteria ===
What is considered Canadian content is determined by either the CRTC, or the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO) for film and television productions that are seeking its tax credit. The CRTC&#x27;s requirements for a television program to be considered Canadian content include that:

* The producer of the program must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, and hold &quot;full responsibility&quot; in overseeing development, creative and financial control. The producer must also receive a remuneration that exceeds the aggregated remuneration of all foreign producer-related positions.
* The production must employ a minimum number of Canadian citizens or permanent residents in key creative positions, as determined by a points system. 
** The director or screenwriter for live-action productions, or the scriptwriter or storyboard supervisor for animated productions, and at least one of the two highest-paid lead performers, must be Canadian.
** For animated works, the key animation must be performed in Canada.
** Non-Canadians may not be credited as a producer, co-producer, line producer, or production manager
* At least 75% of all costs incurred for production services, as well as 75% of all costs incurred in post-production, must be for services provided in Canada.
* The program must fall within a CRTC-defined program category.

===Examples===

Early Canadian programming was often produced merely to fill content requirements, and featured exceedingly low budgets, rushed production schedules, poor writing and little in the way of production values, and as a result did not attract much of an audience. One Canadian series, &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot;, is sometimes claimed as one of the worst television shows ever produced. However, even given these limitations, some productions managed to rise above the mediocre – both &quot;SCTV&quot; (originally on Global) and &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot; (CHCH) grew from local low-budget productions with a limited audience to large production companies with a North American audience. &quot;SCTV&quot; notably lampooned the Cancon rules, as well a request by the CBC for a filler segment featuring distinctively Canadian content, by developing the characters of Bob and Doug McKenzie—a caricature of stereotypical Canadians played by cast members Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, and their recurring sketch &quot;The Great White North&quot;. Bob and Doug would become the program&#x27;s most popular characters, and spawned spin-offs such as comedy albums, commercials, the feature film &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, and the animated series &quot;Bob &amp; Doug&quot;.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, distinctly Canadian drama series such as CBC&#x27;s &quot;Street Legal&quot; or CTV&#x27;s &quot;E.N.G.&quot; consistently drew hundreds of thousands of viewers each week. In the latter part of the 1990s and the early 2000s, Global&#x27;s &quot;Traders&quot; and the CBC dramas &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; and &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; completed long runs, buoyed by critical approval if not overwhelming viewer success (though they have since became mainstays of both Canadian and American syndication). As for CTV, after short-lived runs of planned &quot;flagship&quot; drama series such as &quot;The City&quot;, &quot;The Associates&quot; and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, the network later found ratings success with series such as &quot;Corner Gas&quot; (a sitcom set at an eponymous gas station in rural Saskatchewan, filmed in the town of Rouleau), &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, and &quot;Motive&quot;. The CBC dramedy &quot;This Is Wonderland&quot; was a moderate success with a loyal fan base, but was nonetheless cancelled in 2006 after three seasons. Specialty channels also naturally produce Canadian content, some of which, most notably Showcase&#x27;s mockumentary series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, have been able to generate a strong mass appeal.

To complement their airings of American or British versions, Canadian networks have also produced local versions of unscripted television formats, including reality television series such as &quot;The Amazing Race Canada&quot;, &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, &quot;MasterChef Canada&quot;, and &quot;The Traitors Canada&quot; (CTV), &quot;The Great Canadian Baking Show&quot; (CBC), &quot;Big Brother Canada&quot; (Global), &quot;The Bachelor Canada&quot; and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (Citytv), and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; (Crave).

Canadian networks have sometimes fulfilled Cancon requirements by commissioning series filmed in Canada, but intended to be sold to broadcasters in larger foreign markets such as the United States and United Kingdom, such as CTV&#x27;s &quot;Saving Hope&quot;, &quot;Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and&quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot;, and Global&#x27;s &quot;Wild Card&quot; and &quot;Rookie Blue.&quot; International co-productions such as &quot;Orphan Black&quot; (Space and BBC America), &quot;Copper&quot; (Showcase and BBC America), &quot;Killjoys&quot; (Space and Syfy), &quot;The Tudors&quot; (CBC, Showtime, BBC and TV3), and the early seasons of the current incarnation of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (which was partially funded by the CBC) are also common.

A few Canadian drama series, including &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;Motive&quot;, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, and &quot;Saving Hope&quot;, have also been picked up by American networks and aired in prime time, although the majority of Canadian TV series which have aired in the United States have done so either in syndication, on cable channels, or on minor networks such as The CW and Ion Television. &quot;SCTV&quot; aired in a late night slot on NBC in the early 1980s. CBS aired &quot;Crimetime After Primetime&quot;, a late-night block of crime dramas in the late 1980s and early 1990s which included a number of Canadian series, including &quot;Night Heat&quot;, &quot;Hot Shots&quot;, &quot;Adderly&quot;, &quot;Forever Knight&quot; and &quot;Diamonds&quot;, and later aired &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; in a late-night slot as well. &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; was also a success, being imported into the United States via PBS member stations. That show&#x27;s cast often did pledge drive specials and received strong viewer support on PBS stations in the northern part of the United States, such as Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New Hampshire and New York.

The CBC sitcom &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; was co-produced with U.S. cable network Pop as its first original scripted series, but its later addition to the streaming service Netflix helped to bolster wider public awareness and critical acclaim of the series in the United States and worldwide. This culminated at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2020 following its final season, where &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; became the first series to sweep all seven major awards in their respective genre in the same year, and Dan Levy became the first to win awards for acting, directing, producing, and writing in the same year.

Canadian commercial television networks schedule a large percentage of their Canadian productions to air in the summer season; although traditionally a season of low viewership, this practice has actually been beneficial for Canadian television productions, influenced by widespread viewer preference for new programming over off-season repeats, as well as an increased chance of gaining a lucrative sale to one of the big four American networks—a revenue stream which is generally unavailable during the fall and winter television seasons.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television in the United States provided a major exception, with NBC importing the CTV medical drama &quot;Transplant&quot; (which premiered at midseason in Canada) for its fall primetime lineup, filling the timeslot normally filled by its own medical drama &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; (whose premiere was deferred to 2021). NBC subsequently picked up another Canadian medical drama from Global, &quot;Nurses&quot;, and ordered the second season of &quot;Transplant&quot; for a mid-season premiere in 2022. The third season would also be picked up by NBC, with its U.S. premiere held back to fall due to the WGA and SAG–AFTRA strikes.

==== Children&#x27;s programming ====
Canadian studios have had a significant presence in the children&#x27;s television market, the domestic studio Nelvana has had interests in both children&#x27;s television and publishing, and was acquired by Canadian broadcaster Corus Entertainment in 2000. In the 1990s, Nelvana made several major deals for educational programming with U.S. broadcasters such as CBS and PBS Kids (taking advantage of new U.S. mandates for educational programming), with many of them being adaptations of children&#x27;s books.

The Montreal-based studio CINAR was well known for producing and distributing animated series with tie-ins for the educational market, such as &quot;Arthur—&quot;which was distributed on U.S. public television by Boston&#x27;s PBS station WGBH. The company collapsed in 2001 following an accounting scandal, and had also faced allegations that it paid American writers to write for its shows under the names of Canadian citizens, while continuing to accept Canadian federal tax credits. The company was later purchased in 2004 by former Nelvana executives, and renamed Cookie Jar Group. The company was in turn acquired by Halifax-based DHX Media (now WildBrain) in 2012, which made it the largest independent owner of children&#x27;s television content in the world.

==Trans-Pacific Partnership==
There is concern about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Provisions of the TPP in terms of CanCon. In October 2012, Canada formally became a TPP negotiating participant. In order to enter into the TPP agreement, Canada had to accept the terms agreed upon by the nine original signatory countries: Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Peru, United States, and Vietnam. According to MP Don Davies, Canada had no veto power over these terms and accepted the &quot;existing unbracketed text, sight unseen and without input.&quot;

In September 2012, the International Intellectual Property Alliance, a U.S. private sector coalition representing over 3,200 U.S. producers and distributors of copyright protected materials, sent a submission to the U.S. Trade Representative&#x27;s office requesting that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement &quot;be comprehensive in scope, strictly avoiding any sectoral carveouts that preclude the application of free trade disciplines. We note that several market access barriers [in] Canada involve, for example, content quota requirements for television, radio, cable television, direct-to-home broadcast services, specialty television, and satellite radio services.&quot;

After the replacement of the TPP with the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2018, it was reported that Canada had secured an exemption from a clause in the agreement that prohibits discriminatory rules on foreign audio-video services in order to ask services to financially support the creation of Canadian content.

==Theatre==
In 1971, a group of Canadian playwrights issued the Gaspé Manifesto as a call for at least one-half of the programming at publicly subsidized theatres to be Canadian content. The numerical goal was not achieved, but the following years saw an increase in Canadian content stage productions.

== Reception ==
University of Ottawa professor Michael Geist has criticized the current requirements for film and television production to qualify as Canadian content as being outdated, citing that its requirements being largely dependent on Canadian involvement in specific roles (such as the producer, lead actors, directors, screenwriters, and composers) has led to situations where productions filmed in Canada, using Canadian personnel and talent, or adapted from works by Canadians (such as &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;) may not necessarily qualify as &quot;Canadian content&quot;—instead being a &quot;foreign location and service production&quot; (FLSP) that uses Canadian resources. Geist noted in some cases that these productions were &quot;frequently indistinguishable&quot; from certified Canadian content, such as &quot;All or Nothing: Toronto Maple Leafs (&quot;which was filmed by Canadian crews, narrated by Canadian actor Will Arnett, and followed a Canadian sports franchise), and films such as &quot;The Decline&quot; and &quot;Turning Red&quot; (which both include a number of Canadian actors, personnel in prominent roles, and are set in Canadian locations). He also pointed out that &quot;Gotta Love Trump&quot;—a Canadian-produced documentary on U.S. president Donald Trump—was able to receive the CAVCO certification despite only featuring one Canadian citizen as an interview subject.

An initial white label release, &quot;Steppin&quot;, caught attention by Passion records label owner Les McCutcheon and Northern Soul DJ Kev Roberts. The band&#x27;s name was created by them and derived from the name of a record store in Soho, London called &quot;Record Shack&quot;.

Shakatak scored a number of chart entries, including two Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, &quot;Night Birds&quot; (1982) and &quot;Down on the Street&quot; (1984), plus a further 12 entries in the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot;. The group is still active and popular throughout the world, particularly in Japan and the Far East, and generally produce a new album every two years on JVC Records.

From their first release in August 1980 (the Bill Sharpe composition &quot;Steppin&#x27;&quot; on the Polydor record label), and their first 1981 album, &quot;Drivin&#x27; Hard&quot;, the band&#x27;s singles and albums have entered the charts regularly.

==Career==
It was the release of the 1981 single &quot;Easier Said Than Done&quot; that gave the band the radio exposure needed for their first top-twenty hit. This record introduced their instrumental-unison vocal sound to a much wider audience, and the track stayed in the UK Singles Chart for seventeen weeks. The follow-up, &quot;Night Birds&quot; (1982), was their first single to reach the top ten and it also peaked in Australia at number 92. The album of the same name gave Shakatak their first gold album, entering at number four and remaining in the charts for twenty-eight weeks. Jill Saward (formerly of Fusion Orchestra, Brandy and Citizen Gang) became their sole lead singer to make Shakatak&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Down on the Street&quot; (1984). 

The band gained a huge popularity in Japan, were they released a series of largely instrumental albums such as &quot;Da Makani&quot; (1988) exclusively for the Japanese market. &quot;Manic &amp; Cool&quot;, featuring the night club and chart hit &quot;Mr Manic &amp; Sister Cool&quot; was released internationally in 1988.

In the 1990s, the band achieved success in the US when their 1992 album &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; went to No 1 in the contemporary jazz charts. The 1997 album &quot;Full Circle&quot; expanded their sound with hip hop-beats.

Still active, the band has released and number of albums in the 2000s and celebrated their thirtieth anniversary year in 2010, marking the occasion with the release of the album &quot;Across the World&quot; the following year.

==Independent projects==
Bassist George Anderson released his second solo album, &quot;Expressions&quot;, on 3 September 2012 through Secret Records. Coming three years after his first 2009 album &quot;Positivity&quot;, this album again had Anderson writing, arranging and producing all of the tracks. The albums &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (10 March 2017) and &quot;Songs From Tomorrow&quot; (5 March 2021) followed, again through Secret Records.

Keyboardist Bill Sharpe worked with American jazz pianist Don Grusin on a joint project called &quot;Geography&quot; released in 2007. Sharpe&#x27;s second collaboration with Grusin, &quot;Trans Atlantica&quot;, was released on 3 September 2012. It was also issued through Secret Records, and included &quot;Geography&quot; as a special 2-CD package. On 23 February 2024 Leee John and Bill Sharpe released the album &quot;Intimate Glow&quot;.

Drummer Roger Odell has released three albums with his band Roger Odell&#x27;s Beatifik: &quot;The Blue Window&quot; (2000, Passion Jazz), &quot;Intrigue&quot; (15 November 2015, Secret Records) and &quot;The Long Drive Home&quot; (2019, Secret Records as Beatifik). These albums feature Jacqui Hicks (lead vocals), saxophonist Mornington Lockett as well as Roger&#x27;s wife Larraine Odell (vocals) and son Jamie Odell a.k.a. Jimpster (keyboards, vocals, producer).

<text>The Canon Cat is a task-dedicated microcomputer released by Canon Inc. in 1987 for . Its appearance resembles dedicated word processors of the late 1970s to early 1980s, but it is far more powerful, and has many unique ideas for data manipulation.

The system is primarily the creation of Jef Raskin who originated the Macintosh project at Apple. After leaving the company in 1982 and founding Information Appliance, Inc., he began designing a new computer closer to his original vision of an inexpensive, utilitarian &quot;people&#x27;s computer&quot;. Information Appliance first developed the SwyftCard for the Apple II, then licensed it to Canon as the Cat. &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1987 described the Cat as &quot;a spiritual heir to the Macintosh&quot;.

==Overview==
The Canon Cat uses a text-based user interface, without any pointer, mouse, icons, or graphics. All data are seen as a long &quot;stream&quot; of text broken into several pages. Instead of using a traditional command-line interface or menu system, the Cat uses its special keyboard, with commands activated by holding down a &quot;Use Front&quot; key and pressing another key. Special &quot;Leap keys&quot; are held down to allow the user incremental search for strings of characters.

The hardware consists of a 9-inch (229 mm) black-and-white monitor (80 x 24 character display, 672 x 344 resolution), a single 3½-inch 256 KB floppy disk drive, and an IBM Selectric–compatible keyboard. It uses a Motorola 68000 CPU (like the Macintosh) running at 5 MHz, has 256 KB of RAM, and an internal 300/1200 bit/s modem. Setup and user preference data are stored in 8 KB of non-volatile RAM with battery backup. The array of I/O interfaces encompasses one Centronics parallel port, one RS-232C serial port (DB-25), and two RJ11 telephone jacks for the modem loop. The total weight is .

A range of application software is built into 256 KB of ROM: a standard office suite, telecommunications, a 90,000-word spelling dictionary, and user programming toolchains for Forth and assembly language.

Graphics routines are in ROM, and connectors for a mouse or other pointing device are never used.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 said &quot;The Cat is perfect for someone who needs industrial-strength editing and record keeping but doesn&#x27;t require a full-blown computer system ... It&#x27;s as close to perfect integration, on a small scale, as I&#x27;ve encountered to date&quot;.

==Legacy==
Archy, originally called The Humane Environment, was a project initiated by Raskin in 2005 with similar principles to the Canon Cat.

<doc id="286976" wikidata="Q58958" url="?curid=286976" title="Sanderling">
<text>The sanderling (Calidris alba) is a small wading bird. The name derives from Old English &quot;sand-yrðling&quot;, &quot;sand-ploughman&quot;. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific, &quot;alba&quot;, is Latin for &quot;white&quot;.

It is a circumpolar Arctic breeder, and is a long-distance migrant, wintering south to South America, South Europe, Africa, and Australia. It is highly gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches.

It is somewhat unlike other sandpipers in appearance, which has led to the suggestion that it should be placed into a monotypic genus &quot;Crocethia&quot;. A more recent review (Thomas &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004) indicates, however, that the sanderling is a fairly typical &quot;stint&quot; or small sandpiper and should be separated from the large knots with its closest relatives in a distinct genus.

This bird is similar in size to a dunlin, but stouter, with a thick bill. It shows a strong white wingbar in flight, and runs along the sandy beaches it prefers with a characteristic &quot;bicycling&quot; action of its legs, stopping frequently to pick small food items. It eats small crabs and other small invertebrates. In spring, birds migrating north from South America consume large numbers of horseshoe crab eggs in the Delaware Bay area.

In spring, the birds arrive on the High Arctic breeding grounds (see map), where they lay 3–4 eggs in a ground scrape. On the nesting grounds, these birds mainly eat insects and some plant material.

The sanderling was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name &quot;Trynga alba&quot;.

The sanderling is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Description==
The sanderling is a small plump sandpiper, in length. Its weight ranges from . The winter bird is very pale, almost white apart from a dark shoulder patch. This is the source of the specific name, &quot;alba&quot;, which is the Latin for &quot;white&quot;. Later in the summer, the face and throat become brick-red. The juvenile bird is spangled black and white, and shows much more contrast than the adult.

If its size is misjudged, a sanderling in breeding plumage can be mistaken for some varieties of stint, or a sanderling in winter plumage can be mistaken for a dunlin or red knot. It can be told from other small wading birds, given good views, by its lack of a hind toe. Its behavior is also distinctive.

== Distribution, habitat and migration ==

The sanderling breeds in the High Arctic areas of North America, Europe and Asia. In North America, it breeds in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Nunavut, Greenland (and to a lesser extent Alaska). In Eurasia, it breeds in Spitsbergen and areas of northern Russia from the Taymyr Peninsula to the New Siberian Islands. In the northern winter, it has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution across the world&#x27;s marine coasts. It is a complete migrant, travelling between from its breeding grounds to its wintering sites. Birds that travel further also arrive later and leave sooner. Most adults leave the breeding grounds in July and early August, whereas juvenile birds leave in late August and early September. The northward migration begins in March at the southern end of their winter distribution.

The breeding habitat of the sanderling is coastal tundra north of July isotherm. The species typically chooses nesting sites on dry stony areas near wet areas, from above sea level to . During the winter and its migration, it is most commonly found on coastal sandy beaches, but also occurs on tidal sand flats, mud flats and the shores of lakes and rivers. More infrequently, it may occur on rocky shores.

===Subspecies===

The sanderling consists of two subspecies:

*&quot;C. a. alba&quot;, , breeds on Ellesmere Island, north &amp; east Greenland, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and the Taymyr Peninsula
*&quot;C. a. rubida&quot;, , breeds in northeast Siberia, Alaska and northern Canada

==Behaviour==

===Feeding behaviour===

Sanderlings feed on invertebrate prey buried in the sand in the upper intertidal zone. In North America, this diet largely consists of the isopods &quot;Excirolana linguifrons&quot;, &quot;Excirolana kincaidii&quot;, and the mole crab, &quot;Emerita analoga&quot;. When the tide is out, these crustaceans live in burrows some way beneath the surface. When the tide comes in, they move into the upper layers of sand and feed on the plankton and detritus that washes over them with each wave. They then burrow rapidly down again as the water retreats. They leave no marks on the surface, so the sanderlings hunt for them by plunging their beaks into the sand at random, consuming whatever they find. Their bills can penetrate only and as the water swirls around and retreats, the sand is softer; this makes it easier for the birds&#x27; beaks to penetrate further. In the spring, when much breeding activity is taking place in the benthic community, there may be as many as 4000 invertebrates per square metre, but their average size is smaller than later in the year. The birds appear to rush madly around at the edge of the surf, but in reality they are maximising their chances of catching as many prey animals as possible when they are at their most vulnerable near the surface.

===Breeding behaviour===
At breeding time sanderlings are territorial, with the male aggressively defending its territory. They may either form monogamous pairs or polyandrous (one female and two male) pairings.

<text>Edward Murray Burleson (December 15, 1798 – December 26, 1851) was the third vice president of the Republic of Texas. After Texas was annexed to the United States, he served in the State Senate. Prior to his government service in Texas, he was a commander of Texian Army forces during the Texas Revolution. Before moving to Texas, he served in militias in Alabama, Missouri, and Tennessee, and fought in the War of 1812. Burleson was the soldier who was given Santa Anna&#x27;s sword when he surrendered.

==Early life==
Edward Burleson was born in North Carolina on December 15, 1798 in Buncombe County, North Carolina. He was the son of James B. Burleson, a company captain in the volunteer American army in the War of 1812 and later a participant in the Texas Revolution, as a Captain under his son&#x27;s command. Edward learned of life in the field as an aide to his father, who could neither read nor write. Aaron Burleson, his grandfather, had fought as a minuteman in the Revolutionary War. He was a second cousin of Baylor University president Rufus Columbus Burleson.
The Burleson family were ancestrally from Wales.

Burleson became known as the &quot;Old Indian Fighter&quot;, and was also a veteran of the War of 1812 where he had served in the Missouri and Texas militias. In October 1835 he was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Texas army and served under Stephen F. Austin in the opening stages of the Texas Revolution. During the Siege of Béxar, Burleson served as the second-in-command to Gen. Austin, and in November 1835 he was elected Major General of Texas Volunteers and took command of the volunteer army besieging San Antonio de Béxar and received the surrender of Mexican general Martín Perfecto de Cos. In March, he was appointed a Colonel of Texas Regulars and led the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Runaway Scrape and at the Battle of San Jacinto.

With the capture of Antonio López de Santa Anna at San Jacinto, the Mexican general rode double into Sam Houston&#x27;s camp on the horse of Joel Walter Robison, a soldier in most of the revolutionary battles and later a member of the Texas House of Representatives from Fayette County.

Burleson continued to serve in the Republic of Texas army after the war and was eventually promoted brigadier general of Texas Regulars.

His brother Jacob was killed and mutilated in a battle with Comanches in 1839.

==Political service==
On account of his military credentials, Burleson was elected to the Texas Senate in September 1838, as a local representative for Bastrop, Gonzales, and Fayette Counties.

He served as vice-president of the Republic of Texas in President Sam Houston&#x27;s second term from 1841 to 1844. He was a presidential candidate in the Texas presidential election of 1844, but he was defeated by Anson Jones.

He served under Sam Houston, and they got along very well.

Burleson was also involved in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), after Texas was annexed by the U.S.

The location of his grave is in what later became the Texas State Cemetery, in Austin.

==Private life==

Edward Burleson married Sarah Griffen Owen on April 25, 1816, in Madison County, Alabama.

In May 1830, Burleson arrived at San Felipe de Austin as a prospective settler. After scouting the land around the upper Colorado River, Burleson submitted an application to be a colonist. He then returned to Tennessee, where the rest of his family was living at the time, and brought them to Texas. Upon their arrival, Burleson and his family settled near the fledgling community of Bastrop. In the ensuing years, Burleson would become heavily involved with local affairs affecting Bastrop, Gonzales, and Fayette Counties, as he was elected to the Texas Senate in September 1838.

<doc id="286987" wikidata="Q12350404" url="?curid=286987" title="Stint">
<text>A stint is one of several very small waders in the paraphyletic &quot;Calidris&quot; assemblage – often separated in &quot;Erolia&quot; – which in North America are known as peeps. They are scolopacid waders much similar in ecomorphology to their distant relatives, the charadriid plovers.

Some of these birds are difficult to identify because of the similarity between species, and various breeding, non-breeding, juvenile, and moulting plumages. In addition, some plovers are also similarly patterned, especially in winter. With a few exceptions, stints usually have a fairly stereotypical color pattern, being brownish above and lighter – usually white – on much of the underside. They often have a lighter supercilium above brownish cheeks.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Calidris&quot; is not monophyletic in its traditional delimitations and should be restricted to the stout red knot and its allies. The genus &quot;Erolia&quot; was often used for the stints ever since it was proposed by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. However, the type species of &quot;Erolia&quot; is the curlew sandpiper, which is not traditionally included among the stints.

No firm consensus has been reached on the curlew sandpiper&#x27;s phylogenetic status (i.e., what its closest relatives are) and hence &quot;Erolia&quot; cannot be exactly delimited at present. This notwithstanding, the stints together with a few slightly more distinct calidrids would indeed warrant separation as a distinct genus. The sanderling, sometimes placed in &quot;Crocethia&quot;, is among these and it may be that this genus name would apply.

The species usually considered stints/peeps are:
* Semipalmated sandpiper, &quot;Calidris pusilla&quot; or &quot;Erolia pusilla&quot;
* Western sandpiper, &quot;Calidris mauri&quot; or &quot;Erolia mauri&quot;
* Red-necked stint, &quot;Calidris ruficollis&quot; or &quot;Erolia ruficollis&quot;
* Little stint, &quot;Calidris minuta&quot; or &quot;Erolia minuta&quot;
* Temminck&#x27;s stint, &quot;Calidris temminckii&quot; or &quot;Erolia temminckii&quot;
* Long-toed stint, &quot;Calidris subminuta&quot; or &quot;Erolia subminuta&quot;
* Least sandpiper, &quot;Calidris minutilla&quot; or &quot;Erolia minutilla&quot;
* White-rumped sandpiper, &quot;Calidris fuscicollis&quot; or &quot;Erolia fuscicollis&quot;
* Baird&#x27;s sandpiper, &quot;Calidris bairdii&quot; or &quot;Erolia bairdii&quot;

It is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) branch of the Department of Commerce, and is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, within the Washington metropolitan area. The agency was known as the United States Weather Bureau from 1891 until it adopted its current name in 1970.

The NWS performs its primary task through a collection of national and regional centers, and 122 local Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs). As the NWS is an agency of the U.S. federal government, most of its products are in the public domain and available free of charge.

==History==

===1870–1899===
Calls for the creation of a government weather bureau began as early as 1844, when the electrical telegraph was introduced. In 1869, Cleveland Abbe, then director of the Cincinnati Observatory, began developing and issuing public weather forecasts (which he called &quot;probabilities&quot;) using daily weather observations collected simultaneously and sent via telegraph by a network of observers. This effort was undertaken in cooperation with the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and Western Union, which he convinced to back the collection of such information. Meanwhile, Increase A. Lapham of Wisconsin lobbied Congress to create a storm warning service, having witnessed the destructive power of storms in the Great Lakes region. Representative Halbert E. Paine introduced a bill authorizing the secretary of war to establish such a service. On February 9, 1870, the first official weather service of the United States was established through a joint resolution of Congress signed by President Ulysses S. Grant with a mission to &quot;provide for taking meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the States and Territories... and for giving notice on the northern (Great) Lakes and on the seacoast by magnetic telegraph and marine signals, of the approach and force of storms.&quot; The agency was placed under the secretary of war as Congress felt &quot;military discipline would probably secure the greatest promptness, regularity, and accuracy in the required observations.&quot; Within the Department of War, it was assigned to the U.S. Army Signal Service under the chief signal officer, Brigadier General Albert J. Myer. Myer gave the National Weather Service its first name: The Division of Telegrams and Reports for the Benefit of Commerce.

In November 1870, Myer hired Lapham as the first civilian assistant to the new service, but Lapham left less than two years later. Abbe joined as the second civilian assistant to Myer in January 1871 and began developing a system for national forecasts, based on his work in Cincinnati, which he began issuing the following month. Throughout his career with the weather service, which lasted 45 years, Abbe urged continued research in meteorology to provide a scientific basis for forecasting. While a debate went on between the Signal Service and Congress over whether the forecasting of weather conditions should be handled by civilian agencies or the Signal Service&#x27;s existing forecast office, a Congressional committee was formed to oversee the matter, recommending that the office&#x27;s operations be transferred to the Department of War following a two-year investigation.

The agency first became a civilian enterprise in 1891, when it became part of the Department of Agriculture and its name officially became the U.S. Weather Bureau. Under the oversight of that branch, the Bureau began issuing flood warnings and fire weather forecasts, and issued the first daily national surface weather maps; it also established a network to distribute warnings for tropical cyclones as well as a data exchange service that relayed European weather analysis to the Bureau and vice versa.

===20th century===
The first Weather Bureau radiosonde was launched in Massachusetts in 1937, which prompted a switch from routine aircraft observation to radiosondes within two years. The Bureau prohibited the word &quot;tornado&quot; from being used in any of its weather products out of concern for inciting panic (a move contradicted in its intentions by the high death tolls in past tornado outbreaks due to the lack of advanced warning) until 1938, when it began disseminating tornado warnings exclusively to emergency management personnel.

The Bureau would in 1940 be moved to the Department of Commerce. In 1941, Margaret Smagorinsky (née Knoepfel) was hired as the Weather Bureau&#x27;s first female statistician. On July 12, 1950, Bureau chief Francis W. Reichelderfer officially lifted the agency&#x27;s ban on public tornado alerts in a Circular Letter, noting to all first order stations that &quot;Weather Bureau employees should avoid statements that can be interpreted as a negation of the Bureau&#x27;s willingness or ability to make tornado forecasts&quot;, and that a &quot;good probability of verification&quot; exist when issuing such forecasts due to the difficulty in accurately predicting tornadic activity. However, it would not be until it faced criticism for continuing to refuse to provide public tornado warnings and preventing the release of the USAF Severe Weather Warning Center&#x27;s tornado forecasts (pioneered in 1948 by Air Force Capt. Robert C. Miller and Major Ernest Fawbush) beyond military personnel that the Bureau issued its first experimental public tornado forecasts in March 1952. In 1957, the Bureau began using radars for short-term forecasting of local storms and hydrological events, using modified versions of those used by Navy aircraft to create the WSR-57 (Weather Surveillance Radar, 1957), with a network of WSR systems being deployed nationwide through the early 1960s; some of the radars were upgraded to WSR-74 models beginning in 1974.

In August 1966, the Weather Bureau became part of the Environmental Science Services Administration when that agency was formed. The Environmental Science Services Administration was renamed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on October 1, 1970, with the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act. At this time, the Weather Bureau became the National Weather Service. 
At the beginning of the 1980s the NWS used the same radar equipment as in the 1950s, and teletype for communication. In 1983, NOAA administrator John V. Byrne proposed to auction off all of the weather satellites, to repurchase data from private buyers, outsourcing weather observation stations, NOAA Weather Radio and computerized surface analysis to private companies but the proposal failed in a Congressional vote.

NEXRAD (Next Generation Radar), a system of Doppler radars deployed to improve the detection and warning time of severe local storms, replaced the WSR-57 and WSR-74 systems between 1988 and 1997.

==Forecast sub-organizations==
The NWS, through a variety of sub-organizations, issues different forecasts to users, including the general public. Although, throughout history, text forecasts have been the means of product dissemination, the NWS has been using more forecast products of a digital, gridded, image or other modern format. Each of the 122 Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) send their graphical forecasts to a national server to be compiled in the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD). The NDFD is a collection of common weather observations used by organizations and the public, including precipitation amount, temperature, and cloud cover among other parameters. In addition to viewing gridded weather data via the internet, users can download and use the individual grids using a &quot;GRIB2 decoder&quot; which can output data as shapefiles, netCDF, GrADS, float files, and comma-separated value files. Specific points in the digital database can be accessed using an XML SOAP service.

===Fire weather===
The National Weather Service issues many products relating to wildfires daily. For example, a Fire Weather Forecast, which have a forecast period covering up to seven days, is issued by local WFOs daily, with updates as needed. The forecasts contain weather information relevant to fire control and smoke management for the next 12 to 48 hours, such as wind direction and speed, and precipitation. The appropriate crews use this information to plan for staffing and equipment levels, the ability to conduct scheduled controlled burns, and assess the daily fire danger. Once per day, NWS meteorologists issue a coded fire weather forecast for specific United States Forest Service observation sites that are then input into the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS). This computer model outputs the daily fire danger that is then conveyed to the public in one of five ratings: low, moderate, high, very high, or extreme.

The local Weather Forecast Offices of the NWS also, under a prescribed set of criteria, issue Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings as needed, in addition to issuing the daily fire weather forecasts for the local service area. These products alert the public and other agencies to conditions which create the potential for extreme fires. On the national level, the NWS Storm Prediction Center issues fire weather analyses for days one and two of the forecast period that provide supportive information to the local WFO forecasts regarding particular critical elements of fire weather conditions. These include large-scale areas that may experience critical fire weather conditions including the occurrence of &quot;dry thunderstorms&quot;, which usually occur in the western U.S., and are not accompanied by any rain due to it evaporating before reaching the surface.

State and federal forestry officials sometimes request a forecast from a WFO for a specific location called a &quot;spot forecast&quot;, which are used to determine whether it will be safe to ignite a prescribed burn and how to situate crews during the controlling phase. Officials send in a request, usually during the early morning, containing the position coordinates of the proposed burn, the ignition time, and other pertinent information. The WFO composes a short-term fire weather forecast for the location and sends it back to the officials, usually within an hour of receiving the request.

The NWS assists officials at the scene of large wildfires or other disasters, including HAZMAT incidents, by providing on-site support through Incident Meteorologists (IMET). IMETs are NWS forecasters specially trained to work with Incident Management Teams during severe wildfire outbreaks or other disasters requiring on-site weather support. IMETs travel quickly to the incident site and then assemble a mobile weather center capable of providing continuous meteorological support for the duration of the incident. The kit includes a cell phone, a laptop computer, and communications equipment, used for gathering and displaying weather data such as satellite imagery or numerical forecast model output. Remote weather stations are also used to gather specific data for the point of interest, and often receive direct support from the local WFO during such crises. IMETs, approximately 70 to 80 of which are employed nationally, can be deployed anywhere a disaster strikes and must be capable of working long hours for weeks at a time in remote locations under rough conditions.

=== Aviation ===
The NWS supports the aviation community through the production of several forecasts. Each area&#x27;s WFO has responsibility for the issuance of Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs) for airports in their jurisdiction. TAFs are concise, coded 24-hour forecasts (30-hour forecasts for certain airports) for a specific airport, which are issued every six hours with amendments as needed. As opposed to a public weather forecast, a TAF only addresses weather elements critical to aviation; these include wind, visibility, cloud cover and wind shear.

== Field offices ==

===Weather Forecast Offices===

The National Weather Service operates 122 local offices, known as Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs), to issue products specific to those areas. Each WFO maintains a specific area of responsibility spanning multiple counties, parishes or other jurisdictions within the United States – which, in some areas, cover multiple states – or individual possessions; the local offices handle responsibility of composing and disseminating forecasts and weather alerts to areas within their region of service. Some of the products that are only issued by the WFOs are severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings, flood, flash flood, and winter weather watches and warnings, some aviation products, and local forecast grids. The forecasts issued by a WFO are available on their individual pages within the Weather.gov website, which can be accessed through either forecast landing pages (which identify the office that disseminates the weather data) or via the alert map featured on the main page of the National Weather Service website.
=== River Forecast Centers ===
Daily river forecasts are issued by the thirteen River Forecast Centers (RFCs) using hydrologic models based on rainfall, soil characteristics, precipitation forecasts, and several other variables. The first such center was founded on September 23, 1946. Some RFCs, especially those in mountainous regions, also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts. These forecasts are used by a wide range of users, including those in agriculture, hydroelectric dam operation, and water supply resources.

=== Center Weather Service Units ===
Twenty-one NWS Center Weather Service Units (CWSUs) are collocated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). Their main responsibility is to provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the Traffic Management Units and control room supervisors. Special emphasis is given to weather conditions that could be hazardous to aviation or impede the flow of air traffic in the National Airspace System. Besides scheduled and unscheduled briefings for decision-makers in the ARTCC and other FAA facilities, CWSU meteorologists also issue two unscheduled products. The Center Weather Advisory (CWA) is an aviation weather warning for thunderstorms, icing, turbulence, and low cloud ceilings and visibilities. The Meteorological Impact Statement (MIS) is a two- to 12-hour forecast that outlines weather conditions expected to impact ARTCC operations.

===National Centers for Environmental Prediction===
====Aviation Weather Center====
The Aviation Weather Center (AWC), located in Kansas City, Missouri, is a central aviation support facility operated by the National Weather Service, which issues two primary products:
* AIRMET (Airmen&#x27;s Meteorological Information) – Information on icing, turbulence, mountain obscuration, low-level wind shear, instrument meteorological conditions, and strong surface winds.
* SIGMETs (Significant Meteorological Information) – Issued for significant weather that may affect an airport of flight path in an area:
** Convective – Issued for an area of thunderstorms affecting an area of or greater, a line of thunderstorms at least long, or severe or embedded thunderstorms affecting any area that are expected to last 30 minutes or longer.
** Non-convective – Issued for severe turbulence over a area, severe icing over a , or instrument meteorological conditions over a area due to dust, sand, or volcanic ash.

====Storm Prediction Center====
The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) in Norman, Oklahoma issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches in cooperation with local WFOs which are responsible for delineating jurisdictions affected by the issued watch, and SPC also issues mesoscale discussions focused upon possible convective activity. SPC compiles reports of severe hail, wind, or tornadoes issued by local WFOs each day when thunderstorms producing such phenomena occur in a given area, and formats the data into text and graphical products. It also provides forecasts on convective activity through day eight of the forecast period (most prominently, the threat of severe thunderstorms, the risk of which is assessed through a tiered system conveyed among six categories – general thunderstorms, marginal, slight, enhanced, moderate, or high – based mainly on the expected number of storm reports and regional coverage of thunderstorm activity over a given forecast day), and is responsible for issuing fire weather outlooks, which support local WFOs in the determination of the need for Red Flag Warnings.

====Weather Prediction Center====
The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland provides guidance for future precipitation amounts and areas where excessive rainfall is likely, while local NWS offices are responsible for issuing Flood Watches, Flash Flood Watches, Flood Warnings, Flash Flood Warnings, and Flood Advisories for their local County Warning Area, as well as the official rainfall forecast for areas within their warning area of responsibility. These products can and do emphasize different hydrologic issues depending on geographic area, land use, time of year, as well as other meteorological and non-meteorological factors (for example, during the early spring or late winter a Flood Warning can be issued for an ice jam that occurs on a river, while in the summer a Flood Warning will most likely be issued for excessive rainfall).

In recent years, the NWS has enhanced its dissemination of hydrologic information through the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS). The AHPS allows anyone to view near real-time observation and forecast data for rivers, lakes and streams. The service also enables the NWS to provide long-range probabilistic information which can be used for long-range planning decisions.

====Ocean Prediction Center====

The National Weather Service Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) in College Park, Maryland issues marine products for areas that are within the national waters of the United States. NWS national centers or Weather Forecast Offices issue several marine products:
* Coastal Waters Forecast (CWF) – a text product issued by all coastal WFOs to explicitly state expected weather conditions within their marine forecast area of responsibility through day five; it also addresses expected wave heights.
* Offshore Waters Forecast (OFF) – a text product issued by the OPC that provides forecast and warning information to mariners who travel on the oceanic waters adjacent to the U.S. coastal waters through day five. 
* NAVTEX forecast – a text forecast issued by the OPC (combining data from the Coastal Waters and Offshore Waters Forecasts) designed to accommodate broadcast restrictions of U.S. Coast Guard NAVTEX transmitters. 
* High Seas Forecast (HSF) – routine text product issued every six hours by OPC to provide warning and forecast information to mariners who travel on the oceanic waters.

====National Hurricane Center====
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), respectively based in Miami, Florida and Honolulu, Hawaii, are responsible for monitoring tropical weather in the Atlantic, and central and eastern Pacific Oceans. In addition to releasing routine outlooks and discussions, the guidance center initiates advisories and discussions on individual tropical cyclones, as needed. If a tropical cyclone threatens the United States or its territories, individual WFOs begin issuing statements detailing the expected effects within their local area of responsibility. The NHC and CPHC issue products including tropical cyclone advisories, forecasts, and formation predictions, and warnings for the areas in the Atlantic and parts of the Pacific.

====Climate Prediction Center====
The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) in College Park, Maryland is responsible for all of the NWS&#x27;s climate-related forecasts. Their mission is to &quot;serve the public by assessing and forecasting the impacts of short-term climate variability, emphasizing enhanced risks of weather-related extreme events, for use in mitigating losses and maximizing economic gains.&quot; Their products cover time scales from a week to seasons, extending into the future as far as technically feasible, and cover the land, the ocean and the atmosphere, extending into the stratosphere. Most of the products issued by the center cover the Contiguous U.S. and Alaska.

Additionally, Weather Forecast Offices issue daily and monthly climate reports for official climate stations within their area of responsibility. These generally include recorded highs, lows and other information (including historical temperature extremes, fifty-year temperature and precipitation averages, and degree days). This information is considered preliminary until certified by the National Climatic Data Center.

==== Space Weather Prediction Center ====

The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), located in Boulder, Colorado, is responsible for monitoring and issuing forecasts, alerts, and warnings related to solar activity that may affect terrestrial activities. In particular, SWPC is concerned with how events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), geomagnetic storms, solar flares, and other phenomena can impact electric power transmission, GPS systems, HF radio and satellite communications, as well as other potential impacts.

SWPC also issues aurora forecasts for both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

==Data acquisition==

===Surface observations===
The primary network of surface weather observation stations in the United States is composed of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS). The ASOS program is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), automatic weather station(AWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). ASOS stations are designed to support weather forecast activities and aviation operations and, at the same time, support the needs of the meteorological, hydrological, and climatological research communities. ASOS was especially designed for the safety of the aviation community, therefore the sites are almost always located near airport runways. The system transmits routine hourly observations along with special observations when conditions exceed aviation weather thresholds (e.g. conditions change from visual meteorological conditions to instrument meteorological conditions). The basic weather elements observed are: sky condition, visibility, present weather, obstructions to vision, pressure, temperature, dew point, wind direction and speed, precipitation accumulation, and selected significant remarks. The coded observations are issued as METARs and look similar to this:
 METAR KNXX 121155Z 03018G29KT 1/4SM +TSSN FG VV002 M05/M07 A2957 RMK PK WND 01029/1143 SLP026
 SNINCR 2/10 RCRNR T2 SET 6///// 7//// 4/010 T10561067 11022 21056 55001 PWINO PNO FZRANO

Getting more information on the atmosphere, more frequently, and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings. Due to the large installation and operating costs associated with ASOS, the stations are widely spaced. Therefore, the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP), a network of approximately 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers, provides much of the meteorological and climatological data to the country. The program, which was established in 1890 under the Organic Act, currently has a twofold mission:
* Provide observational meteorological data, usually consisting of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals, required to define the climate of the United States and to help measure long-term climate changes.
* Provide observational meteorological data in near real-time to support forecast, warning and other public service programs of the NWS.

The National Weather Service also maintains connections with privately operated mesonets such as the Citizen Weather Observer Program for data collection, in part, through the Meteorological Assimilated Data Ingest System (MADIS). Funding is also provided to the CoCoRaHS volunteer weather observer network through parent agency NOAA.

===Marine observations===

NWS forecasters need frequent, high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced. These observations are especially critical to the output of numerical weather models because large bodies of water have a profound impact on the weather. Other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities. To help meet these needs, the NWS&#x27;s National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) in Hancock County, Mississippi operates a network of about 90 buoys and 60 land-based coastal observing systems (C-MAN). The stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy and some C-MAN stations measure sea surface temperature, and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. All stations report on an hourly basis.

Supplemental weather observations are acquired through the United States Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) program. It is organized for the purpose of obtaining weather and oceanographic observations from transiting ships. An international program under World Meteorological Organization (WMO) marine auspices, the VOS has 49 countries as participants. The United States program is the largest in the world, with nearly 1,000 vessels. Observations are taken by deck officers, coded in a special format known as the &quot;ships synoptic code&quot;, and transmitted in real-time to the NWS. They are then distributed on national and international circuits for use by meteorologists in weather forecasting, by oceanographers, ship routing services, fishermen, and many others. The observations are then forwarded for use by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina.

===Upper air observations===
Upper air weather data is essential for weather forecasting and research. The NWS operates 92 radiosonde locations in North America and ten sites in the Caribbean. A small, expendable instrument package is suspended below a wide balloon filled with hydrogen or helium, then released daily at or shortly after 1100 and 2300 UTC, respectively. As the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters/minute (1,000 ft/min), sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. These sensors are linked to a battery-powered radio transmitter that sends the sensor measurements to a ground receiver. By tracking the position of the radiosonde in flight, information on wind speed and direction aloft is also obtained. The flight can last longer than two hours, and during this time the radiosonde can ascend above and drift more than from the release point. When the balloon has expanded beyond its elastic limit and bursts (about in diameter), a small parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde, minimizing the danger to lives and property. Data obtained during the flights is coded and disseminated, at which point it can be plotted on a Skew-T or Stuve diagram for analysis. In recent years, the National Weather Service has begun incorporating data from AMDAR in its numerical models (however, the raw data is not available to the public).

==Event-driven products==
The National Weather Service has developed a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of hazardous weather:
* Outlook – Hazardous Weather Outlooks are issued daily by individual Weather Forecast Offices to address potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur over the next seven days. The outlook will include information about the potential of convective thunderstorm activity (including the potential for severe thunderstorms), heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, and extremes of heat or cold. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, including notification to storm spotter groups and local emergency management agencies on the recommendation of activation during severe weather situations in areas prone to such events. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Severe Weather Outlook.
* Advisory – An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. Advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings, that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life or property.
* Watch – A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their safety plans in motion can do so in advance if a forecasted event should occur. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible, but not imminent. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and monitor various avenues that provide NOAA-disseminated data to listen for later information and possible warnings, especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.
* Warning – A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.
* Special Weather Statement (or Significant Weather Advisory) – A special weather statement is issued when something rare or unusual is occurring. These are usually triggered by sudden changes in meteorological conditions. The statements are to be taken as warnings for residents of a specific area. Significant Weather Advisories are often issued for storms not severe enough for Severe Thunderstorm Warnings, but for strong winds and small hail. The warning generally states that an area might be at risk for a slight weather danger, though not all weather statements are warnings. Other times, statements describe informative facts about a weather system (such as local snowfall).

===Weather warnings and advisories===

Short-fused weather warnings and advisories issued by local NWS forecast offices are generally less than in area. Warnings for severe local storms are intended to be issued preceding the arrival of severe weather at a particular locale by one hour or less; the NWS also issues warnings and advisories for various hydrological and non-hydrological events including floods, non-thunderstorm high winds, winter storms, intense heat or cold, fire weather and marine hazards, which vary in timepsan depending on the weather situation (inland and coastal warnings for tropical cyclones are issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), a guidance center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The NWS defines a warning as a &quot;hazardous weather or hydrologic event [that] is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring&quot; and an advisory as &quot;[highlighting] special weather conditions that are less serious than a warning [...] for events that may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, [..] could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.&quot; In earnest, they indicate that hazardous weather conditions are occurring that may pose a risk to life and property, and are intended to direct the general public to take immediate action and heed safety precautions; it also has the side purpose of directing emergency management personnel to be on standby in case the weather situation leads to property damage or casualties. Severe thunderstorm and flood warnings indicate that organized severe thunderstorms or flooding are occurring, whereas tornado warnings are issued if a storm is indicated to be producing an observed tornado or exhibits strong, low-level rotation.

The process of issuing a warning or advisory begins with observations of a hydrological or extreme weather event that is either occurring at present (through radar imagery, reports from local television and radio stations, or ground observations by local law enforcement, civil defense officials, media outlets or storm spotters) or is forecast to occur within 12 to 24 hours. If after collaboration a warning or advisory is deemed necessary, the Weather Forecast Office will generate a bulletin product via the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) and then disseminate the alert through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to NOAA satellites, and on NOAA Weather Radio.

The product outlines the alert type, the issuing WFO, the sections of government subdivisions (counties, parishes, boroughs or independent cities) covered by the alert, and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone). Some products – particularly for severe thunderstorm, tornado and flood warnings – include a tag requesting Emergency Alert System activation to trigger public alert messages via television, radio stations, NOAA Weather Radio, and smartphone apps and messaging services. For local storm events, the warning or advisory product also outlines a meteorological summary of the most recent storm location or local storm report issued prior to the product&#x27;s issuance (including the approximate area in statute miles and estimated speed and direction), associated hazards, impacts, municipalities and designated land areas (and, if applicable, highway mile markers) covered by the alert, and boilerplate action messages informing the public of safety precautions they need to take or advising them to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office. A statement may be issued as a follow-up message to a warning, watch, or emergency, which may update, extend, or cancel the previously issued product or be used as a notification of significant weather for which no type of alert is currently in effect for a given location or is expected to be in effect.

In situations where a forecaster indicates a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather with an ongoing local weather event, enhanced wording may be used to note the heightened threat by a significant local storm event. In April 2012, the NWS introduced the Impact Based Warning system at its Weather Forecast Offices in Wichita and Topeka, Kansas, and Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City/Pleasant Hill, Missouri; the pilot project – which would expand to 80 Weather Forecast Offices overseen by the Central, Eastern, Southern and Western Region Headquarters by the spring of 2015 – incorporate message tags within the main body of the product describing the source of the hazard report, damage potential, and if applicable, radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes or the possibility of a tornado; hazards are also summarized at the close of the product text (describing estimated maximum hail size and wind gusts, and if applicable, if a storm has the potential to produce a tornado or in the event of a tornado warning, the basis of the warning or its damage threat). The wording &quot;Particularly Dangerous Situation&quot; (PDS), which originated by the Storm Prediction Center for use in tornado watch products during expected high-end severe weather outbreaks, is subjectively issued. It is occasionally issued with tornado warnings, normally if a large tornado capable of producing EF3 to EF5 damage or staying on the ground for long-duration – sometimes uninterrupted – paths has been reported (although a tornado emergency may be issued in such cases if the tornado is expected to track into a densely populated area). PDS warnings for other alerts occur with even less frequency, and their criteria varies depending on the alert type to which the wording is applied.

Until September 30, 2007, local offices of the National Weather Service issued warnings for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash flooding and marine hazards using geopolitical boundaries. The implementation of storm-based warnings on October 1, 2007, saw alerts for these meteorological or hydrological threats be delineated by polygonal shapes in map-based weather hazard products, which outline the specified sections of government sub-jurisdictions that the warning covers, based on the projected path of a storm as determined by Doppler radar at the time of the warning&#x27;s issuance; however, entire counties/parishes may sometimes be included in the warning polygon, especially if they encompass a small geographical area. Warnings can be expanded, contracted (by removing jurisdictions where SPC and NWS forecasters no longer consider there to be a viable threat of severe weather, in which case, the storm-based warning may take on a trapezoidal representation in map-based watch products) or canceled before their set time of expiration by local NWS offices.

The NWS also releases Experimental Severe Weather Impact products for use on social media accounts maintained by local forecast offices as well as the Enhanced Data Display (EDD), an experimental pilot project created by the Charleston, West Virginia office&#x27;s WeatherReady Nation initiative. The product provides a graphical depiction of short-fuse warnings and watches (specifically, tornado and severe thunderstorm watches and warnings, and flash flood warnings), showing a map of the warning area (outlined as a red polygon) and locations (including communities and interstate highways) that will be impacted. For severe thunderstorm, tornado and flash flood warnings, the estimated population count of the warned area and approximate totals of public schools and hospitals within the warning area as well as the maximum forecast intensity of hail size, wind gusts and potential tornadoes; tornado warnings referenced in the impact product also denote whether the warning was issued based on radar indication or ground confirmation.

==Product dissemination==
NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR), promoted as &quot;The Voice of the National Weather Service&quot;, is a special radio system that transmits uninterrupted weather watches, warnings and forecasts 24 hours a day directly from a nearby NWS office, with the broadcasts covering across 95–97% of the United States&#x27; population. The system – which is owned and operated by the NWS – consists of 1,030 transmitters, covering all 50 states; adjacent coastal waters; Puerto Rico; the U.S. Virgin Islands; and the U.S. Pacific Territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. NWR requires a scanner or special radio receiver capable of picking up the signal. Individual NWR stations broadcast any one of seven allocated frequencies centered on 162 MHz (known collectively as &quot;weather band&quot;) in the marine VHF radio band. In recent years, national emergency response agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security have begun to take advantage of NWR&#x27;s ability to efficiently reach a large portion of the U.S. population. When necessary, the system can also be used (in conjunction with the Emergency Alert System) to broadcast civil, natural and technological emergency and disaster alerts and information, in addition to those related to weather – hence the addition of the phrasing &quot;All Hazards&quot; to the name.

The NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS) is a satellite data collection and dissemination system operated by the National Weather Service, which was established in October 2000. Its purpose is to provide state and federal government, commercial users, media and private citizens with timely delivery of meteorological, hydrological, climatological and geophysical information. All products in the NWWS data stream are prioritized, with weather and hydrologic warnings receiving the highest priority (watches are next in priority). NWWS delivers severe weather and storm warnings to users in ten seconds or less from the time of their issuance, making it the fastest delivery system available. Products are broadcast to users via the AMC-4 satellite.

The Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) is a system designed to provide the emergency management community with access to a set of NWS warnings, watches, forecasts and other products at no recurring cost. It can receive data via radio, internet, or a dedicated satellite dish, depending on the needs and capabilities of the user.

NOAAPORT is a one-way broadcast communication system which provides NOAA environmental data and information in near real-time to NOAA and external users. This broadcast service is implemented by a commercial provider of satellite communications utilizing C band.

The agency&#x27;s online service, Weather.gov, is a data rich website operated by the NWS that serves as a portal to hundreds of thousands of webpages and more than 300 different NWS websites. Through its homepage, users can access local forecasts by entering a place name in the main forecast search bar, view a rapidly updated map of active watches and warnings, and select areas related to graphical forecasts, national maps, radar displays, river and air quality data, satellite images and climate information. Also offered are XML data feeds of active watches and warnings, ASOS observations and digital forecasts for 5x5 kilometer (3 x 3 mile) grids. All of NWS local weather forecast offices operate their own region-tailored web pages, which provide access to current products and other information specific to the office&#x27;s local area of responsibility. Weather.gov superseded the Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN), the agency&#x27;s early internet service which provided NWS data from the 1990s through the mid-2000s.

==Technology==
The WSR-88D Doppler weather radar system, also called NEXRAD, was developed by the National Weather Service during the mid-1980s, and fully deployed throughout the majority of the United States by 1997. There are 158 such radar sites in operation in the U.S., its various territorial possessions and selected overseas locations. This technology, because of its high resolution and ability to detect intra-cloud motions, is now the cornerstone of the agency&#x27;s severe weather warning operations.

National Weather Service meteorologists use an advanced information processing, display and telecommunications system, the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), to complete their work. These workstations allow them to easily view a multitude of weather and hydrologic information, as well as compose and disseminate products. The NWS Environmental Modeling Center was one of the early users of the ESMF common modeling infrastructure. The Global Forecast System (GFS) is one of the applications that is built on the framework.

In 2016, the NWS significantly increased the computational power of its supercomputers, spending $44 million on two new supercomputers from Cray and IBM. This was driven by relatively lower accuracy of NWS&#x27; Global Forecast System (GFS) numerical weather prediction model, compared to other global weather models. This was most notable in the GFS model incorrectly predicting Hurricane Sandy turning out to sea until four days before landfall; while the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts&#x27; model predicted landfall correctly at seven days. The new supercomputers increased computational processing power from 776 teraflops to 5.78 petaflops.

==Privatization and dismantling attempts==
While respected as one of the premier weather organizations in the world, the National Weather Service has been perceived by some conservatives since the early 2000s as competing unfairly with the private sector. National Weather Service forecasts and data, being works of the federal government, are in the public domain and thus available to anyone for free under United States law. From time to time, the situation receives official review to ascertain if a leaner, more efficient approach may be had by some degree of privatization.

===Aborted Byrne proposal, 1983===
In 1983, the Reagan administration and NOAA administrator John V. Byrne announced a proposal to sell all of the agency&#x27;s weather satellites at auction with the intent to repurchase the weather data from private contractors that would acquire the satellites. Under the proposal, 30% of NOAA&#x27;s workforce would be reviewed for potential layoffs, and certain specialty forecasts of agricultural and economic importance would be eliminated. NOAA also proposed outsourcing weather observation stations, NOAA Weather Radio, and computerized surface analysis to private companies. The proposal was met with negative reactions among the public, members of Congress, and consumer advocacy groups (including most notably, Ralph Nader), objecting to the possibility of weather information intended for the public domain being sold to private entities that would profit from the sale of the data. The proposal to sell the satellite network failed in a Congressional vote, while other aspects of the proposal to dismantle portions of NOAA&#x27;s agencies were eventually scuttled.

===Failed Santorum proposal, 2005===
In 2005, Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum introduced the National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005, a bill which would have prohibited the NWS from freely distributing weather data. The bill was widely criticized by users of the NWS&#x27;s services, especially by emergency management officials relying on the National Weather Service for information during fires, flooding, or severe weather. Groups such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association condemned the bill&#x27;s restrictions on weather forecasting as threatening the safety of air traffic, noting that 40% of all aviation accidents are at least partially weather-related. The bill attracted no cosponsors, and died in committee during the 2005 Congressional session.

==Accuracy problems==
Critics such as University of Washington professor Cliff Mass have claimed that NWS forecasts are not as accurate as they could be, and that this has resulted in inaccurate daily weather forecasts and dangerously bad predictions concerning the location and intensity of extreme weather events like blizzards and hurricanes. In 2016, the British Met Office, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and the Northwest Regional Modeling Consortium in Seattle have been cited as producing more accurate predictions in certain circumstances. According to critics, causes include:
* Lack of sufficient computing power to run simulations known to be better (including higher-resolution simulations and &quot;ensemble&quot; forecasts where multiple runs tweak variables slightly to detect low-confidence simulations)
* Not using techniques shown to improve accuracy by recent academic research
* Not assimilating data from all available sources, such as TAMDAR data from commercial airliners. (Due to budget cuts, this could not be purchased from Panasonic Weather Solutions on an ongoing basis.)
* Lack of updated equipment on weather satellites
* Lack of focus on a small number of high-quality models compared to the Met Office and the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System
* Organizational stovepiping and turf wars
* Resistance to change by powerful employee unions

The Next Generation Global Prediction System project at NWS aims to address some of these criticisms by running a unified high-quality model that takes advantage of more recent research results.
In 2016, the NOAA announced to develop The Next Generation Global Prediction System.

==Directors==
The following is a list of the organization leaders of the National Weather Service and its predecessors, United States Weather Bureau and the Division of Telegrams and Reports for the Benefit of Commerce, since 1870. Those leaders are called directors for the Weather Service while those same persons were called chiefs for the Weather Bureau.

<text>Oblique Strategies (subtitled Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas) is a card-based method for promoting creativity jointly created by musician/artist Brian Eno and multimedia artist Peter Schmidt, first published in 1975. Physically, it takes the form of a deck of printed cards in a black box. Each card offers a challenging constraint intended to help artists (particularly musicians) break creative blocks by encouraging lateral thinking.

== Origin and history ==
In 1970, Peter Schmidt created &quot;The Thoughts Behind the Thoughts&quot;, a box containing 55 sentences letterpress printed onto disused prints that accumulated in his studio, which is still in Eno&#x27;s possession. Eno, who had known Schmidt since the late 1960s, had been pursuing a similar project himself, which he had handwritten onto a number of bamboo cards and given the name &quot;Oblique Strategies&quot; in 1974. There was a significant overlap between the two projects, and so, in late 1974, Schmidt and Eno combined them into a single pack of cards and offered them for general sale. The set went through three limited edition printings before Schmidt suddenly died in early 1980, after which the card decks became rather rare and expensive. Sixteen years later software pioneer Peter Norton convinced Eno to let him create a fourth edition as Christmas gifts for his friends (not for sale, although they occasionally come up at auction). Eno&#x27;s decision to revisit the cards and his collaboration with Norton in revising them is described in detail in his 1996 book &quot;A Year with Swollen Appendices&quot;. With public interest in the cards undiminished, in 2001 Eno once again produced a new set of Oblique Strategies cards. The number and content of the cards vary according to the edition. In May 2013 a limited edition of 500 boxes, in burgundy rather than black, was issued.

The story of Oblique Strategies, along with the content of all the cards, exhaustive history and commentary, is documented in a website widely acknowledged as the authoritative source and put together by musician and educator Gregory Alan Taylor.

The text of Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;The Thoughts Behind the Thoughts&quot; was published by Mindmade Books in 2012.

== Design and use ==
Each card contains a gnomic suggestion, aphorism or remark which can be used to break a deadlock or dilemma situation. A few are specific to music composition; others are more general. For example:
* Use an old idea.
* State the problem in words as clearly as possible.
* Only one element of each kind.
* What would your closest friend do?
* What to increase? What to reduce?
* Are there sections? Consider transitions.
* Try faking it!
* Honour thy error as a hidden intention.
* Ask your body.
* Work at a different speed.

From the introduction to the 2001 edition:
== Cultural impact ==
References to Oblique Strategies exist in popular culture, notably in the film &quot;Slacker&quot;, in which a character offers passers-by cards from a deck. Strategies mentioned include &quot;Honor thy error as a hidden intention&quot;, &quot;Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify&quot;, &quot;Not building a wall; making a brick&quot;, &quot;Repetition is a form of change&quot;, and one which came to be seen as a summary of the film&#x27;s ethos (though it was not part of the official set of Oblique Strategies), &quot;Withdrawing in disgust is not the same thing as apathy.&quot; This line was quoted in the 1994 song &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; by R.E.M., who also mentioned Oblique Strategies in their 1998 song &quot;Diminished&quot; from the album &quot;Up&quot;. The Oblique Strategies are also referenced in comic 1018, &quot;Oblique Angles&quot;, of popular web comic &quot;Questionable Content&quot;.

Other musicians inspired by Oblique Strategies include the British band Coldplay, said to have used the cards when recording their 2008 Brian Eno-produced album &quot;Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends&quot; and French band Phoenix, who used the cards when recording their 2009 album &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix&quot;. German musician/composer Blixa Bargeld has a similar navigation system, called Dave. In response to their song &quot;Brian Eno&quot;, from their album &quot;Congratulations&quot;, MGMT has said they had a deck of Oblique Strategies in the studio, but they &quot;don&#x27;t know if [they] used them correctly.&quot; The band Bauhaus have used the cards for the composition of their songs. The B-52&#x27;s used them in the studio when recording their first album.

They were most famously used by Eno during the recording of David Bowie&#x27;s Berlin triptych of albums (&quot;Low, &quot;Heroes&quot;, Lodger&quot;). Stories suggest they were used during the recording of instrumentals on &quot;Heroes&quot; such as &quot;Sense of Doubt&quot; and were used more extensively on &quot;Lodger&quot; (&quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, &quot;Red Money&quot;). They were used again on Bowie&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Outside&quot;, which Eno was involved with as a writer, producer and musician. Carlos Alomar, who worked with Eno and Bowie on all these albums, was a fan of using the cards, later saying &quot;at the Center for Performing Arts at the Stevens Institute of Technology, where I teach, on the wall are Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies cards. And when my students get a mental block, I immediately direct them to that wall.&quot;

The Oblique Strategies cards deck is featured in Italian comics artist Igort&#x27;s work &quot;Japanese Notebooks: A Journey to the Empire of Signs&quot; (Chronicle Books, 2017; original Italian edition: &quot;Quaderni giapponesi. Un viaggio nell&#x27;impero dei segni&quot;, Cononino Press, 2015).

The football club A.S. Velasca used the Oblique Strategies during an official football match. These Football Times referred to the club, founded by French visual artist Wolfgang Natlacen, by the german word Gesamtkunstwerk, which means &quot;total work of art.&quot;

<text>The Free German Youth (; FDJ) is a youth movement in Germany. Formerly, it was the official youth wing of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

The organization was meant for young adults, both male and female, between the ages of 14 and 25 and comprised about 75% of the young adult population of former East Germany. In 1981–1982, this meant 2.3 million members. After joining the Thälmann Pioneers, which was for school children between ages 6 to 13, East German youths would usually join the FDJ.

The FDJ was intended to be the &quot;reliable assistant and fighting reserve of the Worker&#x27;s Party&quot;, while Socialist Unity Party of Germany was a member of the National Front and had representatives in the People&#x27;s Chamber. The political and ideological goal of the FDJ was to influence every aspect of life of young people in the GDR, distribute Marxist–Leninist teachings and promote communist behavior. Membership in the FDJ was nominally voluntary. However, those who did not join lost access to organized holidays, and found it difficult (if not impossible) to be admitted to universities, pursue chosen careers, etc. The majority of youths who refused to join did so for religious reasons.

While the movement was intended to promote the Marxist-Leninist ideology among the young adults of East Germany, it did not concentrate on this to the exclusion of other activities. It arranged thousands of holidays for young adults through its &quot;Jugendtourist&quot; agency and ran discos and open-air rock concerts. The Festival of Political Songs was an officially sponsored event from 1970 to 1990.

==History==
=== Establishment in 1946 in the Soviet Occupation Zone ===
The FDJ had its origins in the months following the end of the Second World War and it was formally founded on 7 March 1946 under the leadership of a youthful Erich Honecker. The FDJ was initially developed by the communists as ostensibly a non-political, &#x27;national&#x27; youth organisation, which would function in all four zones of occupied Germany. The FDJ was conceived to be a &#x27;free&#x27; and &#x27;democratic&#x27; united youth organisation, where young antifascists would cooperate in order to rebuild their homeland under the name of the &#x27;Free German Youth&#x27; (&quot;Freie Deutsche Jugend&quot;). The name of the organisation was inspired by the &#x27;Free German Youth&#x27; movements formed by young German antifascists in Prague, Paris and London, before the Second World War. Talk of socialism or that the FDJ was to be disproportionately composed of German communists were absent from the FDJ&#x27;s initial conception.
Open to those between the ages of 14 and 25, the FDJ was crucial to preparing young East Germans for mature adult life along an officially approved route of school, vocational training, and entry into the party and officeholding. The FDJ was responsible for the socialist indoctrination of the rising generation of young East Germans. FDJ members were expected to participate in the &#x27;school year&#x27;, an ideological programme, which aimed to develop a significant group of well-trained cadres suitable for future employment in the SED apparatus. The FDJ were willing to overlook previous allegiance to Nazism and offer opportunities for career and social advancement to young adults in exchange for genuine commitment to the FDJ and its ideals on political, working, educational and leisure rights. Additionally, the FDJ aimed to increase the productivity of young East German workers through sponsored &#x27;youth brigades&#x27;, during the 1940s.

As the sole official representative of East German youth, the FDJ&#x27;s main objective was to win over the hearts and minds of young East Germans to socialism, through the Marxist–Leninist ideals of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). During the 1940s, an emphasis on providing a &#x27;happy youth life&#x27; for young East Germans increasingly made the FDJ attractive to the youths. Organised activities, including sports and dance events, &#x27;social evenings&#x27; (&quot;Heimabende&quot;), concerts, hikes and trips to the cinema, among other activities, aimed to provide leisure for young East Germans without the means to otherwise engage in pastimes. In 1946 and 1947, the responsibility of organising leisure activities predominantly rested with local FDJ groups, existing in towns and villages.

The FDJ also possessed its own publishing house (&quot;Verlag Neues Leben&quot;) and ran a number of newspapers; a daily newspaper (&quot;Junge Welt&quot;), a journal for FDJ functionaries (&quot;Junge Generation&quot;) and a student newspaper (&quot;FORUM&quot;). Starting in 1952, the FDJ also began publishing two Sorbian language magazines, &quot;Chorhoj Měra&quot; and &quot;Plomjo&quot;, for Sorbian members.

=== The FDJ in the GDR ===
The FDJ increasingly developed into an instrument of communist rule and became a member of the &#x27;democratic bloc&#x27; in 1950. However, the FDJ&#x27;s focus of &#x27;happy youth life&#x27;, which had characterised the 1940s, was increasingly marginalised following Walter Ulbricht&#x27;s emphasis of the &#x27;accelerated construction of socialism&#x27; at the 4th Parliament and a radicalisation of SED policy in July 1952. In turn, a more severe anti-religious agenda, whose aim was to obstruct the Church youths&#x27; work, grew within the FDJ, ultimately reaching a high point in mid-April 1953 when the FDJ newspaper &quot;Junge Welt&quot; reported on details of the &#x27;criminal&#x27; activities of the &#x27;illegal&#x27; &quot;Junge Gemeinden&quot;. FDJ gangs were sent to church meetings to heckle those inside and school tribunals interrogated or expelled students who refused to join the FDJ for religious reasons.

As an affiliated organisation of the SED party and government, the FDJ became targets of demonstrators in the lead up to the 1953 Uprising. Growing popular unrest caused members of the FDJ to flee to the West. By 1953, the FDJ was in a state of turmoil with many members and officials joining in with the strikes and demonstrations.

On 25 April 1957, at the 16th session of the FDJ, the central council declared the FDJ as an official &#x27;socialist&#x27; youth organisation. The FDJ was the GDR&#x27;s second most important mass organisation, after the FDGB. The FDJ established a political directive that, in theory, made it an omnipresent force in all aspects of &#x27;youth life&#x27; in the GDR. FDJ organisations were found in all areas of East German society, albeit in widely varying numbers, from schools and universities, collective farms, shops and residential areas to the army and the secret police. As the only officially approved youth organisation, the FDJ quickly developed a huge bureaucratic apparatus and acquired generous financial support from state resources.

The FDJ served as a general training ground for functionaries of the SED, the economy and the government. As the sole official representative of GDR youth, the FDJ was vital to the upbringing of young people as socialist personalities. Measures were employed in an attempt to encourage a sense of community spirit of working for a large whole and a better future. According to official prescription, this involved raising them to accept socialist ideals, to acquire a high level of knowledge and vocational skills, to participate actively in official economic and social programmes, to commit themselves to the cause of peace, and to participate in the military training programmes.

In 1952, there was an attempt to militarise the FDJ through the creation of a paramilitary service. On 17 August 1961 the FDJ issued a &#x27;Call to Arms&#x27; in a further attempt to encourage young men to join the armed forces. In schools, the Hans-Beimler contests provided a form of military sports education for pupils in the eighth grade. Military education and training received an added impetus by the FDJ in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of the breakdown of détente between the superpowers.

The FDJ exercised significant influence over the selection process of universities. Membership and participation within the FDJ were definitive criteria during the allocation of university places. Alongside the Thälmann Pioneers, the FDJ was involved in controlling and disciplining rebellious students through denunciation and spying.

After the construction of the Berlin Wall, the FDJ were involved in obstructing the flow of western media into the GDR. FDJ units were dispatched among local communities, who chanted the names of known listeners to western programmes or stuck posters on their doors. FDJ members also demanded that license holders dismantled TV aerials that pointed westwards, which even led to FDJ members climbing onto the roofs and sawing off offending antennae.

During the SED&#x27;s reforms on youth policy in the 1960s, Ulbricht attacked the FDJ&#x27;s unimaginative approach to young people, instead advocating a measure of relaxation of the rigid controls imposed on young people in the FDJ. The focus on providing leisure activities for East German youth returned and the organisation of major cultural events by the FDJ, such as the &#x27;German meeting&#x27; (&quot;Deutschlandtreffen&quot;) increased, ultimately reaching a highpoint at the 1964 festival on the public holiday of Whitsuntide. Thousands of young East and West Germans gathered in East Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere where they danced, listened to jazz and rock music and exchanged views on political and personal matters. In 1965, the FDJ held a musicians&#x27; talent competition across the GDR with the final to occur in Berlin although the event ultimately degenerated into a scene of chaos. By the 1970s, well-organised mass parades and mass demonstrations on the occasion of public holidays such as May Day in which members of the FDJ would actively participate, marching in uniform and carrying official banners became a common occurrence.

The FDJ possessed additional measures to mobilise young East German people. The FDJ aimed to make physical culture and sport a form of popular mass activity. The &#x27;Joint Sports Programme&#x27; organised by the FDJ, the DTSB, and the FDGB, encouraged not only physical relaxation but also the competitive spirit of participation. The children&#x27;s &quot;Spartakiads&quot;, also organised by the FDJ, alongside the Thälman Pioneers and other mass organisations, were staged in the schools, localities and districts biannually at regional and national level in order to stimulate a high level of performance and help sports functionaries to identify talented youths who could benefit from further development in East German sports schools and training centres.

Another objective of the FDJ was to ensure that individual students experienced holiday camp or carried out some activity during their holidays in a pupils&#x27; brigade. Holiday trips for hundreds of thousands of young adults were arranged annually by the FDJ&#x27;s tourist agency, &quot;Jugendtourist&quot;. Free-time activities were organised as part of the &#x27;Young Talents&#x27; movement and in the tens of thousands of youth clubs and discos. By 1983 about one million of the GDR&#x27;s 2.2 million pupils attended a holiday camp and 110,000 pupils over the age of fourteen engaged in &#x27;voluntary productive work&#x27; in a FDJ&#x27;s pupils&#x27; brigade in their home area.

=== The FDJ in West Germany ===
In October 1947 the &#x27;Berlin-FDJ&#x27; was legalised by the Allies. However, the &#x27;West-FDJ&#x27; enjoyed little success in a hostile political environment. The FDJ&#x27;s existence alongside three other youth organisations in the Allied Occupation Zone weakened the presence of the FDJ in Berlin in comparison to the five &quot;Länder&quot; (states) of the Soviet Occupation Zone, where the FDJ had been established more than eighteen months earlier. In November 1948, only 3 per cent of the city&#x27;s youth population were FDJ members in comparison to an average of 17 per cent of 14- to 25-year-olds in the East German &quot;Länder&quot;. The weakened presence of the &#x27;West-FDJ&#x27; dashed the SED&#x27;s hopes for a monopoly control over youth politics in Germany. On 26 June 1951 the &#x27;West-FDJ&#x27; was banned, although this ban did not extend to West Berlin on account of its quadripartite division. After a protracted legal battle, the ban came into effect in 1954 when the FDJ&#x27;s appeal was rejected by the West Germany&#x27;s constitutional court.

In 1952, Phillip Müller, a member of the FDJ, was shot by the North Rhine-Westphalia Police during a demonstration in Essen against West German re-armament. Afterwards, large numbers of the FDJ&#x27;s membership were imprisoned.

==Structure==

=== Democratic Centralism ===
The FDJ&#x27;s basic organizational structures were established at the 3rd Parliament in Leipzig in June 1949. Just like the SED and mass organizations in the GDR, the FDJ was grounded on the principle of democratic centralism, a principle first introduced by Lenin to bring order and discipline to the Bolshevik Party during the Russian Revolution. Accordingly, the FDJ was run on a strictly hierarchical and centralized basis. Each organizational unit was directly subordinate to the next-highest organizational body and instructions issued by the central FDJ leadership were binding for all lower-level organizations.

=== Central Council ===
The highest organ of the FDJ was its Parliament, which convened once every three or four years during the 1950s and 1960s. It was only during these conventions that major alterations to the FDJ&#x27;s statute could be made. In the interim period, the Central Council (ZR) guided the FDJ affairs, assuming a similar role to that of the SED&#x27;s Central Committee (ZK). ZR members were elected by the Parliament and met in sessions (&quot;Tagungen&quot;) held three or four times a year. The ZR&#x27;s tasks included issuing resolutions on all aspects of the FDJ&#x27;s work, confirming the candidates selected to take up the FDJ&#x27;s seats in the East German parliament (the Volkskammer or &#x27;People&#x27;s Chamber&#x27;), and overseeing the youth organization&#x27;s finances.

=== ZR Secretariat ===
The real executive power, however, lay in the hands of the ZR Secretariat, perhaps the FDJ&#x27;s nearest equivalent to the SED Politburo. Elected by the Central Council, the ZR Secretariat shaped most of the political and organisational direction of the FDJ. It was responsible for cadre selection within the organization and directly instructed the Bezirk (regional) leaderships. Weekly meetings of the secretariat, generally chaired by the FDJ first secretary, were attended by the various ZR secretaries, each of whom responsible for a certain area of FDJ work (such as higher education or international affairs).

The ZR Büro was, in theory, the fourth central leadership organ of the FDJ. It was created at the 3rd Parliament in 1949. It incorporated a wider range of youth representatives, including the leader of the government department for &#x27;youth questions&#x27; and representatives of the bloc parties such as the CDU and the LDPD (23). However, it had no real power and was little more than an adjunct to the far more important ZR secretariat.

=== Bezirk and Kreis ===
The sub-structure below the FDJ&#x27;s highest echelons, consisted of three main bodies organised in strictly hierarchical level: &quot;Bezirk&quot; (regional) leadership organizations, &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) leadership organizations, and &#x27;basic units&#x27; (&quot;Grundeinheiten&quot;). At both &quot;Bezirk&quot; and &quot;Kreis&quot; level, the leadership structures essentially replicated those in place at the highest level. The &#x27;delegates&#x27; conference&#x27; (&quot;Delegiertenkonferenz&quot;) was the lower-level equivalent to the FDJ Parliament, meeting twice every five years at &quot;Bezirk&quot; level and once every two years in the districts. The &quot;Bezirk&quot; and &quot;Kreis&quot; secretariats constituted the real seats of decision-making power at regional and district level respectively. The &quot;Kreis&quot; secretariat was the key organization linking the last of the full-time functionaries to the &#x27;grass roots&#x27; of the youth organization, as represented by the basic unit, which constituted the FDJ&#x27;s &#x27;nerve centre&#x27; in schools, universities, factories, farms, and residential areas. It was responsible for organizing the monthly &#x27;membership meetings&#x27; of local FDJ members, where organizational and (less frequently) political issues were discussed.

=== Basic Units ===
In most cases, the basic units were subdivided into the smallest organizational division of all, the &#x27;group&#x27; (which might consist, for example, of the FDJ members in a certain class at a school or in a particular work brigade in a factory). In the case of the larger basic units (those with more than 100 members), specialized intermediary bodies—&quot;Abteilungsorganisationen&quot; (&#x27;branch organizations&#x27;)—were inserted into the organizational hierarchy, serving as a bridge to the FDJ groups below them. At these lower levels of the youth organization, only a small minority of functionaries—such as the first secretaries of some of the larger basic units—were full-time. The vast majority were volunteers drawn, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, from the ranks of &#x27;ordinary&#x27; FDJ members. By the early fifties, the FDJ&#x27;s transition to a &#x27;party youth organization&#x27; was—on paper at least—almost complete.

== Demise ==

=== &quot;Die Wende&quot; ===
At the end of November 1989, the FDJ leadership led by Eberhard Aurich was dismissed by the 13th session of the Central Council. At the end of January 1990, during the XIII Parliament the FDJ gave itself a new statute, defining itself as a &quot;left federation&quot; which stood for an independent GDR as a &quot;socialist alternative on German soil&quot;, and no longer as a &quot;helper and combat reserve of the party&quot;. The &quot;Junge Welt&quot; later spoke of a &quot;failure of the organisation&quot; because &quot;the concentrated presence of former full-time officials&quot; prevented a &quot;radical break with the old FDJ&quot;. After the Peaceful Revolution in the GDR, from November 1989 to November 1990, the number of members dropped from 2.3 million to 22,000. The FDJ contested the only multiparty election in East Germany in March 1990, as part of the &quot;Alternative Jugendliste&quot; (Alternative Youth List), an electoral list consisting of four leftwing youth organizations. However the list only gained 14,615 votes (0.12%) and no seats.

=== After unification ===
After German reunification in October 1990, the FDJ quickly lost nearly all of its remaining membership, shrinking in mid-1991 to 7,000 members and in 1994 to a maximum of 300 members, dwindling further in 2003 to about 150. The 7,500 full-time employees of the FDJ were all released by the end of 1991 and the remaining staff handled the FDJ facilities and structures. The assets of the FDJ were placed under the administration of the &quot;Treuhandanstalt&quot;. Its youth clubs and vacation resorts were redistributed, closed, or sold. The reformed SED, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), founded its own new youth organization, the &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft Junge GenossInnen&quot;, and no longer recognized the FDJ.

However, the FDJ continues to maintain a titular existence to this day. It has reverted to a strict Marxist–Leninist political line, which is exemplified by a positive reading of East German history and the rejection of the federal republic and its annexation of the GDR. The FDJ remains independent, but cooperates with political groups such as the KPD (Ost) and the &quot;Arbeiterbund für den Wiederaufbau der KPD&quot; (Workers&#x27; Union for the Reconstruction of the KPD). Currently, the FDJ has its headquarters in the office section of the Karl-Liebknecht-Haus.

The former newspaper of the FDJ, the &quot;Junge Welt&quot;, still exists as a small Marxist newspaper, but is now independent from the FDJ.
The present newspaper of the FDJ is named the &quot;Fanfare&quot;, and it is published irregularly.

<text>Charles Edmund Lazar Horman (May 15, 1942 – September 19, 1973) was an American journalist and documentary filmmaker. He was executed in Chile in the days following the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état led by General Augusto Pinochet, which overthrew the socialist president Salvador Allende. Horman&#x27;s death was the subject of the 1982 Costa-Gavras film &quot;Missing&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor John Shea.

In June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that U.S. authorities had played a &quot;fundamental&quot; role in Horman&#x27;s murder. In January 2015, two former Chilean intelligence officials were sentenced in Chile for the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi.

== Biography ==

Horman was born in New York City, the son of Elizabeth Horman and Edmund Horman. An only child, he attended the Allen-Stevenson School, where he was a top student in English as well as an excellent cellist; he graduated in 1957. He then graduated cum laude (top 15%) from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1960 and summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1964, where he was President of &quot;Pendulum&quot; literary magazine. Working as filmmaker at King TV in Portland Oregon, Charles created the short documentary &quot;Napalm&quot;, which won a Grand Prize at the Cracow Film Festival in 1967.

Upon returning to New York City, Charles wrote articles as an investigative journalist for magazines in the United States such as &quot;Commentary&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, and newspapers, including &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. In 1967–68, he worked as a reporter for &quot;INNOVATION&quot; magazine.

Charles protested against the Vietnam War at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and was honorably discharged from the Air National Guard in 1969.

In December 1971, Charles and his wife, Joyce, left New York on a journey that eventually led them to Chile. The pair studied Spanish in Cuernavaca, Mexico at the Ivan Illich school for a month, before proceeding southward through Central America.

In Panama, they sold their camper and flew to Medellin, Colombia. They arrived in Santiago in the late spring of 1972 and settled temporarily in Santiago, where Charles worked as a freelance writer.

On September 16, 1973, six days after the military coup, Horman was detained by Chilean soldiers and taken to the National Stadium in Santiago, which had been converted into an &quot;ad hoc&quot; prison camp. Prisoners were interrogated and tortured, and many were executed. For close to a month after Horman&#x27;s death, the whereabouts of his body were purportedly unknown to American officials. However, it was later determined that he had been executed on September 19 and his remains buried inside a wall in the national stadium, after which the body was transferred to a morgue in the Chilean capital. A second American journalist, Frank Teruggi, met a similar fate.

At the time of the military coup, Horman had been in the resort town of Viña del Mar near the port of Valparaíso, a key base for American and Chilean coup plotters. U.S. officials speculated at the time that Horman had been a victim of &quot;Chilean paranoia,&quot; but did nothing to intervene. It is unlikely that Horman would have been killed without the knowledge or permission of the CIA, according to papers released in 1999 under the Freedom of Information Act. Efforts to determine his fate were initially met with resistance and duplicity by U.S. embassy officials in Santiago.

Joyce and Edmund Horman donated their extensive files related to their pursuit of justice to the Benson Latin American Collection at The University of Texas - Austin. The collection includes biographical files, correspondence, Freedom of Information Act request documents, press clippings, and case files from Joyce Horman&#x27;s lawsuit against Henry Kissinger.

== Book, film, and television depictions of the case ==

The Horman case was made into the Hollywood movie &quot;Missing&quot; (1982), directed by Greek filmmaker Costa-Gavras. It starred Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek as Horman&#x27;s father and wife, who attempt to discover what had happened to Charles. Horman himself was portrayed by John Shea. In the film, Horman is depicted as having spoken with several U.S. operatives who assisted the Chilean military government. The movie alleges that Horman&#x27;s discovery of U.S. complicity in the coup led to his secret arrest, disappearance and execution.
American complicity in the Chilean coup was later confirmed in documents declassified during the Clinton administration.
The movie was based on a book first published in 1978 under the title &quot;The Execution Of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice,&quot; and written by Thomas Hauser; this book was later republished under the title &quot;Missing&quot; in 1982.

When the movie was released by Universal Studios, Nathaniel Davis, the United States Ambassador to Chile from 1971 to 1973, filed a US$150 million libel suit against the director and the studio, despite not having been named directly in the movie (he had been named in the book). A court eventually dismissed Davis&#x27;s suit. The movie was removed from the market during the lawsuit but re-released upon its dismissal.

In season 10 of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, the season finale &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot; was based on this murder.

== U.S. State Department memo ==

For many years thereafter, the U.S. government steadfastly maintained its ignorance of the affair. However, in October 1999, Washington finally released a document admitting that CIA agents may have played an unintentional role in his death. The State Department memo, dated August 25, 1976, was declassified on October 8, 1999, together with 1,100 other documents released by various U.S. agencies, which dealt primarily with the years leading up to the military coup.

Written by three State Department functionaries — Rudy Fimbres, R.S. Driscolle and W.V. Robertson — and addressed to Harry Schlaudeman, a high-ranking official in the department&#x27;s Latin American division, the August document described the Horman case as &quot;bothersome,&quot; given reports in the press and Congressional investigations alleging that the affair had involved &quot;negligence on our part, or worse, complicity in Horman&#x27;s death.&quot; The State Department, the memo declared, had the responsibility to &quot;categorically refute such innuendoes in defense of U.S. officials.&quot; It went on, however, to acknowledge that these &quot;innuendoes&quot; were well founded.

The three State Department officials said they had evidence that &quot;The GOC [Government of Chile] sought Horman and felt threatened enough to order his immediate execution. The GOC might have believed this American could be killed without negative fall-out from the USG [US Government].&quot;

The report went on to declare that circumstantial evidence indicated &quot;U.S. intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in Horman&#x27;s death. At best, it was limited to providing or confirming information that had helped motivate his murder by the GOC. At worst, U.S. intelligence was aware the GOC saw Horman in a rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing to discourage the logical outcome of GOC paranoia.&quot;

After the release of the State Department memo, Horman&#x27;s widow Joyce described it as &quot;close to a smoking pistol.&quot; The same memo had been released to the Horman family more than twenty years earlier, but the above-mentioned paragraphs had been blacked out by the State Department. The latest version still contains blacked-out passages for reasons of &quot;national security,&quot; but it reveals more.

Several other documents released in 1999 revealed that a Chilean intelligence officer claimed an agent of the CIA was present when a Chilean general made the decision to execute Horman because he &quot;knew too much.&quot;

== Chilean investigation ==

In 2001, Chilean judge Juan Guzmán Tapia opened an investigation into Charles Horman&#x27;s death. Among five Americans who gave evidence was Joyce Horman, who had filed a criminal suit against Augusto Pinochet the previous December. The investigation included a four-hour re-enactment of the scene in the Estadio Nacional where Horman was killed, one of 10,000 who suffered there.

The judge also considered extradition proceedings against former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger after receiving no cooperation from him nor from Nathaniel Davis in the wake of requests from the Supreme Court of Chile. &quot;At the time of his death, Horman was investigating the murder of René Schneider, the Commander-in-Chief in the Chilean army whose support for Allende and the constitution was seen as an obstacle to the coup.&quot;

On November 29, 2011, a Chilean court indicted Pedro Espinoza, Rafael González Verdugo and Ray E. Davis. Espinoza was a general in the Chilean army and Verdugo, a Chilean intelligence officer. Davis was a retired U.S. military officer who headed the U.S. military group in Chile in September 1973. Davis was charged with complicity in Horman&#x27;s murder; he had driven Horman from Vina del Mar, in the coastal area where the coup was launched, to Santiago during the coup. On October 17, 2012, Chile&#x27;s Supreme Court approved a request to seek Davis&#x27;s extradition from the United States. As of September 11, 2013, the U.S. had not yet been served with the request. It was later revealed that Davis had been living secretly in Chile and had died in a Santiago nursing home in 2013.

In 2015, the court sentenced Espinoza and Verdugo to prison for 7 years and 2 years, respectively. However, Chile&#x27;s Supreme Court reviewed the case in 2016 and increased the sentences to 15 years and 3 years, respectively. In addition, the two were ordered to pay $196,000 to Horman&#x27;s widow and $151,000 to Teruggi&#x27;s sister.

==Relevant characters in the case==

For 30 years, the predominant theory surrounding the execution of Horman and Teruggi was that the order was given by General Augusto Lutz during his period as head of the Directorate of Army Intelligence (Spanish: Dirección de Inteligencia del Ejército or DINE), also known as the Army Intelligence Service (Spanish: Servicio de Inteligencia Militar, or SIM). In 2003, judge Juan Guzmán was removed from the case after which it was assigned to judge Jorge Zepeda. Zepeda&#x27;s opinion represented a break with the previous investigation. His view was that Department II (Intelligence) of the General Staff of the National Defense (Spanish: Estado Mayor de la Defensa Nacional, or EMDN) would have been the organization responsible for Horman&#x27;s death. This theory has been questioned from various standpoints.

===Augusto Lutz===
Since the 1970s, the Lutz-Herrera family has insisted that Lutz could not have been involved in the murder of opponents of the Chilean dictatorship, given his opposition to the Pinochet regime. They claim that his death was precisely caused by his opposition to Pinochet and DINA.

Researchers, including Patricia Verdugo (&quot;Interferencia secreta&quot;), Ignacio González Camus (&quot;El día que murió Allende&quot;), Mónica González (&quot;La conjura: los mil y un días del golpe&quot;), and Ascanio Cavallo, Manuel Salazar, and Óscar Sepúlveda (&quot;La historia oculta del régimen militar&quot;), who have examined the coup d&#x27;état conspiracy, argue that General Lutz was not assigned any role in it. After the coup, Lutz interceded on behalf of various detainees, as well as others he had helped to free. Lutz did not last more than a month as Director of Army Intelligence; by the following year, he was found dead in mysterious circumstances.

Judge Zepeda&#x27;s ruling noted that &quot;the decision to execute Charles Horman, a foreign detainee, was made by Department II of the EMDN.&quot;

===Pedro Espinoza===
Judge Zepeda named Pedro Espinoza, DINA&#x27;s Vice-Director, as the individual responsible for ordering the execution of Charles Horman; however, critics said no evidence was provided to show that the murder had been committed at the National Stadium or that Espinoza was there at the time of the murder. None of the thousands of detainees held at the stadium gave testimony (in this or in other cases) stating that they had seen or heard about Espinoza being there; many said they had seen Jorge Espinoza, the Army colonel in charge of the stadium.

Peter Kornbluh, a researcher linked to the Horman Foundation and the director of the National Security Archive&#x27;s Chile Documentation Project, has stated that &quot;the details of his death and why he was killed are still murky&quot; and that although the judge quoted several declassified documents in his ruling, “none of them tie Davis or Espinoza to the crimes”, adding that, &quot;the judge will have to present concrete evidence&quot;. Even Punto Final, a newspaper linked to the Revolutionary Left Movement (Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionario, MIR), regretted that in his ruling, Zepeda did not reveal the exact role that Espinoza played in the murders of Horman and Frank Teruggi or what his functions had been at the time.

The weekly newspaper El Siglo, the official organ of the Central Committee of the Chilean Communist Party, called the judgment a disaster and implied that Pedro Espinoza&#x27;s imputation was a smoke screen designed to cover up the search for the truth. “Judge Zepeda&#x27;s ruling provides no justice to the victims, nor does it provide the truth to their relatives and to the community&quot;.

On December 30, 2011, a Court of Appeals upheld the ruling, with the dissenting judge stating that no link had been shown to connect Espinoza to the crime. In January 2015, Espinoza was sentenced to serve seven years for Hormann&#x27;s murder. His sentence would later increased to 15 years by the Supreme Court of Chile in July 2016.

===Rafael González===
From 1954 until the coup d&#x27;état of September 11, 1973, González worked as an agent in Department II (Intelligence) at the General Staff of the National Defense (Spanish: Estado Mayor de la Defensa Nacional, or EMDN). While there, he sought to counteract the CIA&#x27;s attempts to sabotage the Chilean economy. This included dismantling the CIA&#x27;s espionage networks associated with Project Camelot in Chile in 1968. At the request of Allende&#x27;s Minister of Defense, González acted as an advisor to the Director of Police Investigations, Dr. Eduardo Paredes, from March to September 1971. As a cover for his work as a secret agent, González posed as a civil servant in Corfo.
Due to the accuracy of González&#x27;s reports, the head of the EMDN&#x27;s intelligence service scheduled an appointment with the Undersecretary of the Interior, Daniel Vergara, in December 1972, where he pointed out that if certain key changes were not made to improve the country&#x27;s economic situation, such as removing Pedro Vuskovic from Corfo and replacing him with José Cademartori, there would be a coup d&#x27;état in September 1973”.

González&#x27;s opposition to the abuses of the new authorities was clear from the start of the dictatorship. As one newspaper noted, “After the coup, he saved dozens of Unidad Popular supporters from being unjustly dismissed from their jobs, imprisoned or from certain death, including journalist Carlos Jorquera, who was saved on 11 September from suffering the fate of his comrades at Peldehue”, all of whom were assassinated on September 12 in the Regimiento Tacna on the orders of Gen. Herman Brady, Head of the Army&#x27;s Second Division in Santiago, Commanding officer of the capital&#x27;s garrison and military judge of Santiago, making him the sole decider of the fate of all detainees. González&#x27;s testimony has helped clarify the facts relating to the death of those who resisted the coup in Moneda Palace.&quot;
On September 11, at Moneda Palace, Gen. Javier Palacios gave Rafael González a direct order to execute Allende&#x27;s press secretary, journalist Carlos Jorquera. However, González refused. Jorquera has recounted that &quot;a military man recognized me but didn&#x27;t obey the order to kill me then and there. I owe him my life [...] Years later, when Aylwin won, we met. We gave each other a big embrace and until today he remains one of my best friends: this man is the former member of the General Staff of the National Defence, Rafael González, who was later dismissed from his institution and had to go into exile&quot;. After the coup, Gen. Palacios was appointed Vice President of Corfo. In retaliation for having disobeyed the order to execute Jorquera, González was dismissed from his government posting in Corfo. In his memoirs, former senator Alberto Jerez Horta recounts that despite the dire human rights circumstances surrounding him, González continued to save the lives of people who were persecuted by the dictatorship: “Rafael himself made sure that files on Guillermo Sáez Pardo, Juan Ibáñez Elgueta, Héctor Ortega Fuentes and Carlos Morales Salazar were incinerated in the boiler at the Air Force Hospital, thereby saving them from danger&quot;.

In April 1974, Vice-Admiral Patricio Carvajal dismissed Rafael González from the EMDN, accusing him of having informed the Interior Minister, Gen. Óscar Bonilla, about the serious human rights violations taking place in Regimiento Tejas Verdes, San Antonio, under commanding officer Col. Manuel Contreras, chief of the newly created DINA. In April 1974, González was reassigned to the Chilean Air Force (FACH) and remained inactive; he did not take part in any repressive activities. After visiting Tejas Verdes and witnessing the inhumane conditions of the prisoners, Gen. Bonilla ordered Col. Contreras&#x27; arrest. However, Pinochet canceled the order, and shortly thereafter, Bonilla died in a mysterious helicopter accident. The French technicians sent by the helicopter manufacturing company to investigate the accident also died under dubious circumstances. Pinochet assigned Gen. Herman Brady to Bonilla&#x27;s posting in the Ministry of Defense.

While investigating a complaint of embezzlement at the FACH, Rafael González was fired without explanation by FACH on September 2, 1975, marking an end to his career as an intelligence agent. Tipped off by the Vice-Director of the Intelligence Service (SICAR), Col. Pablo Navarrete, that an order had been given by the newly created Air Force Directorate of Intelligence (DIFA) to eliminate him, González sought political asylum at the Italian Chancery with the help of Octavio Abarca, a former Regional Secretary of the Chilean Community Party. However, due to opposition from General Gustavo Leigh and Col Contreras, his application to leave Chile for Italy was not approved until three years later when DINA was dismantled and Leigh sacked as Commander in Chief of FACH. From September 3, 1975, to May 13, 1978, Gonzalez remained in the Italian Chancery in Santiago under the protection of Father Baldo Santi, then President of CARITAS Chile, who acted on express instructions from Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez.

While at the Italian Chancery, González revealed to CBS and &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalists that he had seen Charles Horman inside the Ministry of Defense building one week after the coup. This became the starting point of the investigation into Horman&#x27;s death, for American and Chilean authorities could no longer claim ignorance of the facts. Granted asylum in Spain in 1978, González was contacted by former socialist senator Erich Schnake on behalf of Charles Horman&#x27;s father, Edmund, who invited him to the United States to provide testimony in a lawsuit against Henry Kissinger, the CIA and the U.S. State Department. Joyce Horman, Charles&#x27; widow, told CNN that Rafael González&#x27;s testimony was the only thing that allowed the family to bring its case to court against them.

Following the prosecutions in the Horman case, Rafael González created a blog (&quot;Justicia para Horman, justicia para González&quot;) where he recounted his professional career as an intelligence agent (1954-1975) and commented on Judge Jorge Zepeda&#x27;s rulings, calling them a judicial farce that denied justice to the Horman family, left the real culprits unpunished and impugned him in a crime in which he was not involved. Despite his, González was one of only two to be convicted for a crime related to Hormann&#x27;s murder and was sentenced in January 2015 to two years of police supervision after it was determined that he was an accomplice. His sentence would be increased to three years by the Supreme Court of Chile in July 2016.

===Patricio Carvajal===
During the trial, several high-ranking officers of the Chilean Navy, whose names had been kept in the dark for decades, were mentioned in connection to the death of the American journalist. They were: Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, Corvette Captain Raúl Monsalve and Navy Captain Ariel González. In their statements, the latter two (Carvajal committed suicide in 1994) claimed they were innocent and accused the Chilean Army of being involved.

Prior to the coup, Carvajal had been the Chief of the EMDN. In that capacity, he had ordered an investigation of the “foreign radicals” working for Chile Films, Charles Horman&#x27;s company, between May and June 1973. In all likelihood, that order was given to the Chief of Department II of EMDN, Ariel González.

On March 21, 1974, Carvajal ordered Rafael González to assist the U.S. Vice-consul in Chile, James Anderson, in the search for Charles Horman&#x27;s remains for repatriation to the United States. Gonzalez has stated that by ordering him to “look for them”, they could lay blame on him afterwards and cover up the American and Chilean personnel involved in the murder since Chilean and American authorities already knew the whereabouts of Horman&#x27;s remains: they had lain in a corner of the General Cemetery (Cementerio General) since October 18, 1973, one month after Horman&#x27;s death. This was the day the U.S. Consul General Frederick Purdy officially informed Horman&#x27;s father (Edmund) and widow (Joyce) while they were declaring a &quot;missing person report&quot; with Police Inspector Mario Rojas Chávez at the headquarters of the Investigations Police (Policía de Investigaciones).

In April 1977, Carvajal was decorated by dictator Francisco Franco. Following Spain&#x27;s return to democracy, Carvajal served for two consecutive terms (1988-1989 and 1989–1993) as a member of the Supreme Tribunal of the right-wing party Independent Democratic Union (Spanish: UDI).

===James Anderson===
James Anderson was a CIA agent who operated under cover as a U.S. Vice-consul. Together with John S. Hall, another CIA agent who posed under cover as a Consular Associate, they pretended to assist the Horman family in their quest for the truth. Anderson pleaded complete ignorance about Horman when he told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on September 17, 2000, that neither the U.S. Consulate nor the CIA were even aware that Horman and Teruggi were in Chile until they were reported missing.

===Ariel González===
A captain in the Chilean Navy, he played a key role in the coup conspiracy by falsely informing the Admiralty on September 9 that the army had confirmed its participation in the coup; accompanied by Admiral Sergio Huidobro, he convinced Pinochet to join the coup by threatening to lead the marine forces from Valparaíso to the capital himself if the former did not do so.

After the coup and as chief of EMDN intelligence, he organized the enforcement of “new interrogation techniques” (torture) in cooperation with Brazilian intelligence agents.

In 1973, U.S. authorities sought information about the Horman case from Vice Admiral Ismael Huerta, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, the Minister of Defense, and reportedly Pinochet himself through U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Davis. González, who was then chief of EMDN intelligence and Carvajal&#x27;s subordinate (both naval officers), declared that he did not know anything about the Horman case until 2004. However, his account was questioned and found to be implausible. Researcher Jonathan Haslam notes that according to the son-in-law of Gen. William Westmoreland (commanding officer of American forces in Vietnam between 1964 and 1968), Vernon Walters (Deputy Director of CIA between 1972 and 1976) operated in Chile through Ariel González.

In the thirteen years in which Zepeda presided over the judicial inquiry on Charles Horman&#x27;s murder, González was never interrogated by the judge and assigned no responsibility for the crime.

===Raúl Monsalve===
On September 11, 1973, Corvette Captain Raúl Monsalve was posted at the General Staff of the Navy (Spanish: Estado Mayor General de la Armada, or EMGA) as a liaison officer with the U.S. Military Group (almost all of whom were U.S. Navy officers linked to the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA). The head of the U.S. group was Captain Ray Davis. Monsalve had been working for years as a liaison with the CIA, to the extent that the U.S. Embassy described him in a report as the &quot;most pro-American&quot; officer of the Chilean Navy, as revealed by research carried out by Universidad Arcis and published in the journal &quot;Estudios Político Militares: Programa de Estudios Fuerzas Armadas y Sociedad&quot;.

After the coup, Monsalve maintained contact with the CIA. His name appears in Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s archive of files written and compiled by Gerd Seewald, a collaborator of the notorious sect leader and child sex offender Paul Schäfer; on some occasions, Monsalve visited Albert Schreiber (a leader in Schafer&#x27;s sect); on others, as on November 31, 1975, he was accompanied by American intelligence agents.

Monsalve also participated in the persecution and extermination of dissidents, according to Juan R. Muñoz Alarcón, the so-called &quot;hooded man of the National Stadium&quot; who declared in testimony before the Vicariate of Solidarity (Vicaría de la Solidaridad) that he had worked for Monsalve and that Monsalve had taken him to the stadium.

Monsalve has also been identified by subordinates in the Navy intelligence as the officer who gave the order to arrest and eliminate Arnoldo Camú, the security chief of the Unidad Popular party, an incident that took place around the time Horman was arrested and murdered.

When Charles Horman asked Ray Davis if he would take him and his friend Terry Simon to Santiago on September 15, 1973, Davis reportedly contacted Monsalve to provide &quot;safe passage&quot;; he also briefed him on Horman&#x27;s political background.

Neither Raúl Monsalve nor Ariel González were questioned by Jorge Zepeda during the judge&#x27;s investigation; subsequently, they were not charged as authors, accomplices or accessories after the fact. Critics have said this is a particularly striking omission in the case of Ariel González, since Zepeda himself ruled that Department II (Intelligence) of EMDN, of which Gonzalez was the head, was the unit responsible for planning and carrying out Charles Horman&#x27;s death.

===Ray E. Davis===
Shortly after the September 11 coup, Charles Horman and Terry Simon had asked Ray Davis to provide safe passage to Santiago. Davis subsequently contacted his cohort in the Chilean Navy, Raúl Monsalve, a move that served only to alert authorities to Horman&#x27;s whereabouts.

To the detriment of the case, Davis was never deposed before Judge Zepeda.

Eight years after having prosecuted Rafael González, Zepeda sought an order for U.S. authorities to extradite Davis in 2011. The Chilean Supreme Court subsequently approved the extradition request in October 2012. However, a year later, a report in the Associated Press revealed that Davis had in fact been secretly living in Chile all along and had died there on April 30, 2013, aged 88. This prompted criticism from Joyce Horman, who called it an &quot;extraordinarily frustrating&quot; turn of events, while Peter Kornbluh pointed out how unbelievable it was that Zepeda was “working to get Davis extradited and he was literally less than a couple of miles down the road&quot;.

===Jorge Zepeda Arancibia===
Jorge Zepeda&#x27;s handling of the investigation has come under severe criticism over the years. Among other things, Judge Zepeda is faulted for not investigating the absence of evidence when assigning responsibilities in the crime; for neglecting to investigate the role of the Chilean Navy in the incident; for failing to determine the place of death; and for issuing contradictory information, insinuating on the one hand that the murder did not occur at the National Stadium, and suggesting on the other that Horman had indeed died there. Another criticism is his decision not to summon for questioning Chilean Army Major Carlos Meirelles Muller, who had been in charge of the Foreign Aliens section of the detention camp. As one critic noted, &quot;Regardless of whether Horman was or was not kept under arrest at the Stadium and whether the major in question did or did not have influence over the fate of foreign detainees, the least one could have expected was an interrogation of the person who was formally in charge of them. Such an inquest is now impossible; Meirelles died in 2011&quot;.

The inconsistencies of Zepeda&#x27;s line of reasoning with regard to the crime have also attracted attention: firstly, despite concluding that &quot;the decision to execute Charles Horman [...] was taken by Department II of the General Staff of the National Defense&quot;, headed by Navy Captain Ariel González Cornejo, the judge chose not to prosecute Gonzalez as either an accomplice or an accessory after the fact.

Secondly, he affirmed that Horman was arrested during a routine inspection in 1973; however, elsewhere he stated that Horman&#x27;s arrest was due to intelligence information provided by then CNI Director Gen. Hugo Salas Wenzel.

With regard to Frank Teruggi, the other American killed after the coup, Zepeda wrongly associated his activities in Chile with those of Horman&#x27;s Chile Films, despite the fact that Teruggi and Horman had never met.

Zepeda&#x27;s rulings in other cases involving human rights abuses committed during the Pinochet regime have proved controversial. In a December 4, 2015, verdict on the death of former Minister of the Interior and Minister of Defense José Toha due to torture, Zepeda sentenced two Chilean Air Force officers, Ramón Cáceres Jorquera and Sergio Contreras Mejías, to three years. However, he allowed the men to serve their terms outside of prison.

Zepeda&#x27;s most controversial rulings relate to human rights violations, including torture and killing, committed in Colonia Dignidad. Agrupación de Familiares de Ejecutados Políticos (Association of Relatives of People Executed for Political Reasons) has stated that Zepeda refused to make public Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s files for years due to &quot;reasons of National Security&quot;. According to Colectivo Londres 38, these documents remained under judicial seal for nine years, with no reason given as to why. This &quot;contributed to the concealing of information about how repression took place, restricted further knowledge of the truth about the crimes and paved the way for persistent impunity.&quot;

In the case of Colonia Dignidad, the president of the Agrupación de Familiares de Ejecutados Políticos, Alicia Lira, declared that &quot;as an association, we have a negative opinion about judge Zepeda, because he has hampered the judicial process” 

Hernán Fernández, a defense attorney representing the victims of Colonia Dignidad resident and convicted child sex offender Paul Schäfer, declared in an interview with La Nación in 2006 that judge Zepeda &quot;gave guaranteed impunity to the delinquents&quot; when he quashed the prosecution of Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s leaders by illegal association, the original felony from which all others were derived. This &quot;enabled many leaders to flee to Germany, from where they cannot be extradited according to the constitution of that country.&quot; Colonia Dignidad is the same cult that was visited by Corvette Captain Raúl Monsalve, to whom Zepeda also granted impunity.

Amidst mounting criticism from victims&#x27; groups, Zepeda informed them in late 2013 that he would consider releasing information in the files. However, misleading signals were sent about the number of files involved, their relevance, and the existence (or not) of an intelligence report on the file cards, prompting journalist Luis Narváez to complain that &quot;everything [about it was] confusing.&quot;

Following a campaign organized by Londres 38 and other human rights groups, and pressure from representatives of the Chilean Congress, Zepeda finally released 407 files to the relatives of executed and disappeared detainees in 2014. This left more than 38,000 others under seal. Critics speculated that the remaining files could contain information about those who provided support for Colonia Dignidad, from congressional representatives, judges, companies, state services, police, armed forces, and many others who conducted business with the colony, buying and reselling its products, including arms, ammunition and dangerous chemicals, and involving themselves in illegal adoptions and money laundering.

Zepeda had also denied a request by the National Human Rights Institute (Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos, or INDH) to obtain a copy of a report on the files the judge had himself ordered the Police Intelligence (Jipol) to conduct in 2005. Once the police had begun to make progress on the report, they were ordered to stop; all parties in the various Colonia Dignidad trials taking place at the time, including their lawyers, were denied access to it. INDH sought a court order to reverse Zepeda&#x27;s decision. Following a public outcry, the press began an investigation into the files. 45,612 were discovered in total, all of which were handed over to human rights groups 

In 2014, Asociación por la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos Colonia Dignidad, Casa de la Conferencia de Wannsee (Alemania) and Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos (Chile) organized the First International Seminar on Colonia Dignidad entitled &quot;Colonia Dignidad: dialogues on truth, justice and memory&quot;. This led to the publication in 2015 of the book &quot;Colonia Dignidad: verdad, justicia y memoria&quot;. The book documents the crimes committed in Colonia Dignidad and their decades-long cover up by the judicial system and other branches of the state. In the chapter &quot;The files of Colonia Dignidad: difficulties of access, quality of sources of information and future projections&quot;, journalist Luis Narváez presents a detailed account of Zepeda&#x27;s interventions in the Colonia Dignidad cases, describing his modus operandi as &quot;secretive&quot;, always with the same court clerk and the same pair of Jipol staff members: Inspectors Jaime Carbone and Alberto Torres, both of them retired police officers. Although several of Colonia Dignidad cases have been closed, Zepeda has kept notebooks containing relevant parts of the investigations secret.

According to Narváez, Zepeda&#x27;s reaction to the discovery of the files, which had been made by two police officers in 2005, shocked everyone: &quot;he ordered the two officers to be detained at the police station under suspicion of obstruction of justice&quot; and prevented the squad investigating human rights violations from analyzing the files. Instead, he ordered them to be taken to the central office of Jipol, where Carbone and Torres worked. In 2007, Narváez formally requested access to the files; Zepeda refused the request. Later, once the case had been closed, Narváez requested access to the dossier; this was also denied. As late as 2015, &quot;the documentation [was] still inside the Jipol&#x27;s vault&quot;.

In addition to denying information to lawyers, the press and victims&#x27; relatives, Zepeda has also been resistant to having the files&#x27; contents available to other judges. When Supreme Court President Sergio Muñoz proposed the creation of a software system that would allow all judges to look up the dossiers, thereby optimizing resources, saving time and avoiding unnecessary duplication, Zepeda vehemently opposed the plan, arguing that it &quot;threatened each tribunal&#x27;s independence.&quot;

Participants in the Colonia Dignidad seminar made several recommendations regarding the slow pace of judicial investigations into Colonia Dignidad. In a statement, they stated that &quot;Judge Zepeda has monopolized the judicial investigations over most of Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s crimes. For almost 10 years, he has led these investigations in a slow and non-transparent manner, without achieving satisfactory results.&quot; They also criticized the judge&#x27;s failure to order the digging up of every site in Colonia Dignidad that witnesses had previously identified.

The participants also released a petition: 

In 2015, Zepeda was appointed President of the Court of Appeals. In March 2016, he absolved all those accused of the death and enforced disappearance in 1985 of American mathematician Boris Weisfeiler in Colonia Dignidad and applied the statute of limitation on the grounds that it was not a human rights crime. According to Boris&#x27;s sister Olga, Zepeda had refused to investigate the connection between Colonia Dignidad and her brother&#x27;s death. She complained that “the judge cunningly deceived us and the U.S. Embassy with his &#x27;complete&#x27; investigation”.

This was in reference to Zepeda having stated initially that he had received and read a Spanish translation of the documents the U.S. Embassy in Chile and Olga Weisfeiler had submitted as part of the proceeding. Later, he revealed that they had not in fact been translated, so he had not been able to read them. As a result, Zepeda informed the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture (the Valech Commission) that the Weisfeiler case did not qualify as a human rights case; subsequently, the Commission did not include it in its final report. In March 2016, however, as justification for applying the statute of limitations and absolving all those accused, Zepeda claimed that it was the Valech Commission that had refused to categorize it as a human rights case. In response, the U.S. Government, through its Ambassador in Chile, Mike Hammer, issued a press release stating that &quot;the recent court ruling absolving the eight accused parties over a statute of limitations is a frustrating setback&quot; but that the U.S. Embassy in Chile would go on supporting the Weisfeiler family in its search for truth and justice.

Boris Weisfeiler made remarkable contributions to the theory of algebraic groups and enjoyed a well-deserved reputation in his field. In response to Zepeda&#x27;s ruling, the Mathematical Society of Chile (Somachi) issued a public statement criticizing the verdict and called for a reopening of the case. They were joined by the American Mathematical Society and the Committee of Concerned Scientists.

<doc id="287004" wikidata="Q7051418" url="?curid=287004" title="Norm Abram">
<text>Norm Abram (born October 3, 1949) is an American carpenter, writer, and television host best known for his work on the PBS television programs &quot;This Old House&quot; and &quot;The New Yankee Workshop&quot;. He is a Master carpenter and has published several books and articles about the craft.

==Early life and education==
Abram was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and raised in Milford, Massachusetts, where he attended high school. His father was a carpenter, who taught his son many of his practical skills. Norm first worked on a client&#x27;s site at the age of 9, helping his father install hardwood floors. He worked with his father during summer vacations in high school and college.

Abram initially studied mechanical engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he became a brother of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. He found theoretical engineering courses to be uninteresting, and switched to studying business administration. He realized that he enjoyed practical hands-on work, and left UMass just short of finishing a degree.

==Career==

===Early career===
After leaving college, Abram worked for three years for a multimillion-dollar New England–based construction firm, and was rapidly promoted to a position as a site supervisor. In 1976, Abram went into business for himself, founding the general contracting firm Integrated Structures Inc. and operating it until 1989. His first major independent project was building a general store on Nantucket.

===&quot;This Old House&quot;===

In 1979, Norm Abram took a construction job building a small barn/garage/toolshed/workshop in the backyard of television producer Russell Morash, who had produced Julia Child&#x27;s popular cooking program &quot;The French Chef&quot; for WGBH-TV in Boston. Impressed by Abram&#x27;s small scrap pile and efficient work habits, Morash invited Abram to help with the renovation of a rundown Victorian house in Dorchester. A WGBH camera crew recorded the process for the first &quot;This Old House&quot; project, hosted by Bob Vila. Morash then asked Abram to appear as a regular on &quot;This Old House&quot;, and Abram became a fixture on the show.

On May 19, 2022, it was announced that after 43 years, Abram would retire from the show. A one hour special titled &quot;The House that Norm Built&quot; aired online and on PBS stations on October 3, 2022, surveying his career with the program.
===&quot;The New Yankee Workshop&quot;===
In 1988, Morash planned to launch a spinoff of &quot;This Old House&quot; called &quot;The New Yankee Workshop&quot;, featuring Abram. They needed a convenient place to videotape, and used the shop in the small building that Abram built in 1979 in Morash&#x27;s backyard. The shop&#x27;s layout and equipment were expanded and adapted to match Abram&#x27;s preferences, in a space measuring . &quot;The New Yankee Workshop&quot; was first aired in 1989 with Abram as the host. The program showcased furniture or other projects and emphasized classic, elegant designs, made using a combination of simple handtools and newer power tools and equipment. The show aired for 21 seasons on PBS, then was suspended indefinitely as Abram decided to focus on other projects.

===Other projects===
Abram is on the board of trustees of Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. He delivered the 2001 commencement speech at the North Bennet Street School in Boston, which is renowned for its commitment to teaching craftsmanship. He has also contributed to efforts to train younger students in the building trades, such as the Generation NEXT apprenticeship program.

Abram also voiced himself in the &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; episode &quot;Normadeus&quot;, where he was kidnapped by the villainous Lobe and forced to make a special wooden weapon for him. He also appeared on &quot;Between the Lions&quot; and twice on &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;; and starred in a series of Foot Locker commercials titled &quot;House of Hoops&quot;. Abram appeared on &quot;Fetch! With Ruff Ruffman&quot; in the episode &quot;This Old... Lemonade Stand&quot;. He also appeared in the 2010 &quot;Ace of Cakes&quot; episode &quot;Indy, Ice and Improv&quot;.

==Presentation style==
Norm Abram is well known for his soft spoken, calm manner of explaining precise, efficient woodworking techniques. He is usually seen wearing a plaid shirt, a style that has become his trademark. He begins his shows with a reminder about personal safety, specifically highlighting the importance of wearing safety glasses.

Abram emphasizes the importance of focusing attention when performing dangerous operations, such as cutting with a power saw. He avoids working when rushed, tired, distracted, or after drinking even small amounts of alcohol. He advises against misusing tools or failing to sharpen them properly. He is not afraid to talk to himself in the shop, reviewing carefully the next steps before he undertakes them.

==Awards and recognition==
The American Academy of Ophthalmology awarded Norm Abram its EyeSmart Distinguished Service Award on April 23, 2009. The award was presented for &quot;his steadfast commitment to safety and the prevention of eye injuries&quot;.

In 2018 Abram was selected for the Ken Burns Lifetime Achievement Award by the filmmaker who, with Old Sturbridge Village, gives the award to &quot;individual[s] who [have] made a significant impact on the arts through a project that is relevant to the history Old Sturbridge Village works to preserve&quot;.

On June 18, the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences honored Norm along with “This Old House” with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 49th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards.

==Personal life==
Norm Abram has lived with his wife, Elise (a skilled potter), in a custom modified classic two story Colonial, timber framed home that he built in Carlisle, Massachusetts, with the assistance of his father and other professionals. He wrote his book &quot;Norm Abram&#x27;s New House&quot; (1995) based on his experiences planning and building the house.

More recently, he bought a new old house in Rhode Island near the coast, where he plans to build a new woodworking shop, and he is also interested in learning shipbuilding.

His fondness for plaid shirts is well-known and at times parodied, a prime example being the character Al Borland from &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, portrayed by Richard Karn.

Abram and his wife enjoy cooking and entertaining, visiting museums and art galleries, boating, kayaking, and fishing.

Abram was previously married to Laura Cone (divorced in 1996), with whom he has a daughter, Lindsey.

==Books and other publications==
Norm Abram has authored eight books about carpentry:

Abram also serves on the editorial board of &quot;This Old House&quot; magazine, published by This Old House Ventures, Inc., also authoring the popular column, &quot;Norm&#x27;s Notebook&quot;.

<text>Konstantinos &quot;Kostas&quot; Gavras (; born 12 February 1933), known professionally as Costa-Gavras, is a Greek-French film director, screenwriter, and producer who lives and works in France. He is known for political films, such as the political thriller &quot;Z&quot; (1969), which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and &quot;Missing&quot; (1982), for which he won the Palme d&#x27;Or and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Most of his films have been made in French, but six of them were made in English, including &quot;Hanna K.&quot;.

==Early life==
Costa-Gavras was born in Loutra Iraias, Arcadia. His family spent the Second World War in a village in the Peloponnese, and moved to Athens after the war. His father had been a member of the Pro-Soviet branch of the Greek Resistance, and was imprisoned during the Greek Civil War. His father&#x27;s Communist Party membership made it impossible for Costa-Gavras to attend university in Greece or to be granted a visa to the United States, so after high school he settled in France, where he began studying literature at the Sorbonne in 1951.

==Early career==
In 1956, he abandoned his university studies to study film at the French national film school, IDHEC. After film school, he apprenticed under Yves Allégret, and became an assistant director for Jean Giono and René Clair. After several further appointments as first assistant director, he directed his first feature film, &quot;Compartiment Tueurs&quot;, in 1965.

==Selected films==
His 1967 film &quot;Shock Troops&quot; (&quot;Un homme de trop&quot;) was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival.

In &quot;Z&quot; (1969), an investigating judge, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant, tries to uncover the truth about the murder of a prominent leftist politician, played by Yves Montand, while government officials and the military attempt to cover up their roles. The film is a fictionalised account of the events surrounding the assassination of Greek politician Grigoris Lambrakis in 1963. It had additional resonance because, at the time of its release, Greece had been ruled for two years by the &quot;Regime of the Colonels&quot;. &quot;Z&quot; won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Costa-Gavras and co-writer Jorge Semprún won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Film Screenplay.

&quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot; (&quot;The Confession&quot;, 1970) follows the path of Artur London, a Czechoslovakian communist minister falsely arrested and tried for treason and espionage in the Slánský &#x27;show trial&#x27; in 1952.

&quot;State of Siege&quot; (1972) takes place in Uruguay under the civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay in the early 1970s. In a plot loosely based on the case of US police official and alleged torture expert Dan Mitrione, an American embassy official (played by Yves Montand) is kidnapped by the Tupamaros, a radical leftist urban guerilla group, which interrogates him in order to reveal the details of secret American support for repressive regimes in Latin America.

&quot;Missing,&quot; originally released in 1982 and based on the book &quot;The Execution Of Charles Horman&quot;, concerns an American journalist, Charles Horman (played by John Shea in the film), who disappeared in the 1973 coup d&#x27;état led by General Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Horman&#x27;s father, played by Jack Lemmon, and wife, played by Sissy Spacek, search in vain to determine his fate. Nathaniel Davis, US ambassador to Chile from 1971 to 1973, a version of whose character had been portrayed in the movie (under a different name), filed a US$150 million libel suit, &quot;Davis v. Costa-Gavras&quot;, 619 F. Supp. 1372 (1985), against the studio and the director, which was eventually dismissed. The film won an Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation and the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival (with Yılmaz Güney&#x27;s movie &quot;Yol&quot;). 

&quot;Betrayed&quot; (1988) is roughly based upon the terrorist activities of American neo-Nazi and white supremacist Robert Mathews and his group The Order.

In &quot;Music Box&quot; (1989), a respected Hungarian immigrant (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is accused of having commanded an Anti-Semitic death squad during World War II. His daughter, a Chicago defence attorney played by Jessica Lange, agrees to defend him at his denaturalization hearing. The film is inspired by the arrest and trial of Ukrainian immigrant John Demjanjuk and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas&#x27; realisation that his father had been a member of the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party. The film won the Golden Bear at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.

&quot;La Petite Apocalypse&quot; (1993) was entered into the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;Amen.&quot; (2003), was based in part on the highly controversial 1963 play, &quot;Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel&quot; (&quot;The Deputy, a Christian Tragedy&quot;), by Rolf Hochhuth. The film plot alleges that Pope Pius XII was aware of the plight of the Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, but failed to take public action to publicise or condemn the Holocaust. Gavras won César Award for Best Writing for this film.

He was president of the Cinémathèque Française from 1982 to 1987, and again since 2007.

==Political-commercial film==

Costa-Gavras is known for merging controversial political issues with the entertainment value of commercial cinema. Law and justice, oppression, legal/illegal violence, and torture are common subjects in his work, especially relevant to his earlier films. Costa-Gavras is an expert of the &quot;statement&quot; picture. In most cases, the targets of Costa-Gavras&#x27;s work have been right wing or far right movements and regimes, including the Greek military in &quot;Z&quot;, and right-wing dictatorships that ruled much of Latin America during the height of the Cold War, as in &quot;State of Siege&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;.

In a broader sense, this emphasis continues with &quot;Amen.&quot; given its focus on the conservative leadership of the Catholic Church during the 1940s. In this political context, &quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot; (&quot;The Confession&quot;) provides the exception, dealing as it does with oppression on the part of a Communist regime during the Stalinist period.

==Issues and style==
Costa-Gavras has brought attention to international issues, some urgent, others merely problematic, and he has done this in the tradition of cinematic story-telling. &quot;Z&quot; (1969), one of his most well-known works, is an account of the undermining in the 1960s of democratic government in Greece, his homeland and place of birth. The format, however, is a mystery-thriller combination that transforms an uncomfortable history into a fast-paced story. This is a clear example of how he pours politics into plot, &quot;bringing epic conflicts into the sort of personal conflicts we are accustomed to seeing on screen.&quot;

His accounts of corruption propagated, in their essence, by European and American powers (&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;State of Siege&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;) highlight problems buried deep in the structures of these societies, problems which he deems not everyone is comfortable addressing. The approach he adopted in &quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot; also &quot;subtly invited the audience to a critical look focused on structural issues, delving this time into the opposite Communist bloc.&quot;

Until 2019&#x27;s &quot;Adults in the Room&quot;, Costa-Gavras had never worked in Greece or made a film in the Greek language.

==Influences==
When Costa-Gavras asked about some of his biggest cinematic influences, he replied: 
He also listed René Clément, Jacques Demy, and Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; as an influence on his filmmaking.

==Legacy and influence==
Costa-Gavras films have been a significant influence on political cinema. Wade Major of the Directors Guild of America mentioned that, &quot;With films like Z and Missing, Costa-Gavras almost single-handedly created the modern political thriller&quot;. When German Director Wim Wenders paid tribute to him in 2018 at the 31st European Film Awards in Seville, Spain, Wenders called him &quot;One of the greatest filmmakers of our time.&quot; 

He has influenced directors such as Oliver Stone, William Friedkin, Steven Soderbergh, Rachid Bouchareb, Mathieu Kassovitz, and Ben Affleck. 

Stone mentioned that Costa-Gavras &quot;was certainly one of my earliest role models, ... I was a film student at NYU when &quot;Z&quot; came out, which we studied. Costa actually came over with Yves Montand for a screening and was such a hero to us. He was in the tradition of Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; and was the man in that moment ... it was a European moment.&quot;

The American filmmaker William Friedkin listed &quot;Z&quot; as one of his favorite films and mentioned the film&#x27;s influence on him when directing his film &quot;The French Connection&quot;: &quot;After I saw &quot;Z&quot;, I realized how I could shoot &quot;The French Connection&quot;. Because he [Costa-Gavras] shot &#x27;Z&#x27; like a documentary. It was a fiction film but it was made like it was actually happening. Like the camera didn&#x27;t know what was gonna happen next. And that is an induced technique. It looks like he happened upon the scene and captured what was going on as you do in a documentary. My first films were documentaries too. So I understood what he was doing but I never thought you could do that in a feature at that time until I saw &quot;Z&quot;.&quot;

The American filmmaker Steven Soderbergh listed &quot;Z&quot; as an inspiration on his film &quot;Traffic&quot; and even stated that he &quot;wanted to make it like [Costa-Gavras&#x27;s] &quot;Z&quot;&quot;. In 2020, Costa Gavras wrote the preface to the book &quot;Opération Condor&quot;, by French writer and journalist Pablo Daniel Magee.

The French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz listed Costa-Gavras films (such as &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;The Confession&quot;) as influential to his work.

The French filmmaker Rachid Bouchareb listed &quot;Z&quot; as an influence on his film &quot;Outside the Law&quot;.

The American actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck listed Costa-Gavras&#x27;s films as influences for his film &quot;Argo&quot;.

In the television show “Chuck”, season 3 episode 3 “Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte” featured the fictional leader Alejandro Goya who was looking to convert his nation of “Costa Gravis” from communism to democratic. Alejandro’s wife and one of his body guards attempt to undermine this effort, seemingly a reference to Costa-Gravis’ movie “Z”.

==Accolades==
Costa-Gavras&#x27;s debut film, &quot;Compartiment Tueurs&quot;, won National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for the Edgar Award for Best Screenplay in 1967.

The film &quot;Z&quot; was the first film to be nominated for both the Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film. It won the latter, as well as the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. &quot;Z&quot; was also the first foreign-language film to win the Best Film award from the New York Film Critics Circle. Gavras won the Best Director award as well.

Costa-Gavras has received an honorary doctorate from the Film School of the Aristotle University in 2013.

He was interviewed extensively by &quot;The Times&quot; cultural correspondent Melinda Camber Porter and was featured prominently in her book &quot;Through Parisian Eyes: Reflections on Contemporary French Arts and Culture&quot; (1993, Da Capo Press).

Costa-Gavras received the Magritte Honorary Award in 2013. He was the first filmmaker to receive the Catalonia International Prize (2017).

==Personal life==
His daughter Julie Gavras and his sons Romain Gavras and Alexandre Gavras are also directors. He is the first cousin of Penelope Spheeris, Jimmie Spheeris and Chris Spheeris.

In 2009, Costa-Gavras signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.
He argued that &quot;the crime could not be considered rape because the teenage girl was 13 years old but looked 25&quot;.

<doc id="287010" wikidata="Q376444" url="?curid=287010" title="Kaizen">
<text>is a concept referring to business activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. Kaizen also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain. Kaizen aims to eliminate waste and redundancies. Kaizen may also be referred to as zero investment improvement (ZII) due to its utilization of existing resources.

After being introduced by an American, Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way. It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside of business and productivity.

== History ==
In 1947, Edwards Deming, an American statistician, went to Japan to help enhance their production processes. He stressed that quality should be prioritized at every stage of production, achieved through statistical process control. Deming is particularly recognized for his PDCA cycle—Plan, Do, Check, Act—which advises stopping production when deviations occur to identify and resolve issues before continuing. During his time in Japan, he trained hundreds of engineers, managers and executives in his approach. 

Deming developed his concepts into what he termed &quot;total quality management,&quot; which eventually laid the groundwork for Toyota&#x27;s Toyota Production System focused on just-in-time manufacturing.

== Overview ==
The Japanese word means &#x27;improvement&#x27; or &#x27;change for better&#x27; (from 改 kai - change, revision; and 善 zen - virtue, goodness) without the inherent meaning of either &#x27;continuous&#x27; or &#x27;philosophy&#x27; in Japanese dictionaries or in everyday use. The word refers to any improvement, one-time or continuous, large or small, in the same sense as the English word &quot;improvement&quot;. However, given the common practice in Japan of labeling industrial or business improvement techniques with the word &quot;kaizen&quot;, particularly the practices spearheaded by Toyota, the word &quot;kaizen&quot; in English is typically applied to measures for implementing &quot;continuous&quot; improvement, especially those with a &quot;Japanese philosophy&quot;. The discussion below focuses on such interpretations of the word, as frequently used in the context of modern management discussions. Two kaizen approaches have been distinguished:

===Point kaizen===
 is one of the most commonly implemented types of kaizen. It happens very quickly and usually without much planning. As soon as something is found broken or incorrect, quick and immediate measures are taken to correct the issues. They are typically done at the individual level. Although these measures are generally small, isolated and easy to implement, they can have a significant impact.

In some cases, it is also possible that the positive effects of point kaizen in one area can reduce or eliminate benefits of point kaizen in some other area.

Examples of point kaizen include a shop inspection by a supervisor who finds broken materials or other small issues, and then asks the owner of the shop to perform a quick kaizen (5S) to rectify those issues, or a line worker who notices a potential improvement in efficiency by placing the materials needed in another order or closer to the production line in order to minimize downtime.

=== System kaizen ===
System kaizen is accomplished in an organized manner and is devised to address system-level problems in an organization or any production factory.

It is an upper-level strategic planning method for a short period of time.

===Line kaizen===
Line kaizen refers to communication of improvements between the upstream and downstream of a process. This can be extended in several ways.

=== Plane kaizen ===
This is the next upper level of line kaizen, in that several lines are connected together. In modern terminologies, this can also be described as a value stream, where instead of traditional departments, the organization is structured into product lines or families and value streams. It can be visualized as changes or improvements made to one line being implemented to multiple other lines or processes.

=== Cube kaizen ===
Cube kaizen describes the situation where all the points of the planes are connected to each other and no point is disjointed from any other. This would resemble a situation where Lean has spread across the entire organization. Improvements are made up and down through the plane, or upstream or downstream, including the complete organization, suppliers and customers. This might require some changes in the standard business processes as well.

== Application ==
=== The 5S movement ===
The 5S are primarily aimed at the workshop workplaces, whereby the workplace is understood as the place where the value-adding processes in the company take place.
;Seiri
: Create order: remove everything that is not necessary from your workspace!
;Seiton
: Love of order: organize things and keep them in their proper place!
;Seiso
: Cleanliness: keep your workplace clean!
;Seiketsu
: Personal sense of order: make 5S a habit by setting standards!
;Shitsuke
: Discipline: make cleanliness and order your personal concern!

=== The 7M checklist (Ishikawa diagram) ===
These are the seven most important factors that must be checked again and again:
# Man
# Machine
# Material
# Method
# Milieu/environment
# Management
# Measurability
The original 5M method was expanded to include the last two factors, as the influence of management in the system and measurability are of a certain scope. (See also the Ishikawa diagram as a graphical representation of the 7Ms).

=== The 7W checklist ===
The 7W checklist possibly goes back to Cicero as an original tool for rhetoric:

# What is to be done?
# Who does it?
# Why do it?
# How is it done?
# When is it done?
# Where should it be done?
# Why is it not done differently?

Related to the 7W questionnaire is the principle of &quot;Go to the source&quot; (Genchi Genbutsu). This means asking &quot;Why?&quot; 5 times in the event of undesirable results or errors in order to find a solution. Furthermore, managers should get an idea of the situation on site, for example a production process, and not make decisions from afar.

The W questions are used in a wide variety of areas, for example when analyzing texts, as an aid in defining projects as well as in work analysis and, as a result, in defining work content.

In the field of quality management, this principle is used in failure mode and effects analysis to identify potential weaknesses.

=== The three Mu ===
The three Mu form the basis for the loss philosophy of the Toyota Production System (TPS). In the context of this loss philosophy, the three Mu are seen as negative focal points of the loss potential and should therefore be avoided.

; Muda
: Waste, see the seven Muda
; Mura
: Deviations in the processes (also imbalance)
; Muri
: Overloading of employees and machines

=== The seven Muda ===
The seven types of waste (seven Muda) as typical sources of loss.

The waste itself (Muda) is the obvious cause of losses. A distinction is made between seven types of waste that occur almost everywhere in the company.

; Muda due to overproduction
: Produce more than necessary.
; Muda due to waiting time
: Inactive hands of an employee. Process timing not optimized.
; Muda due to unnecessary transportation
: Movement of materials or products does not add value.
; Muda due to production of faulty parts
: Defective products disrupt the production flow and require expensive rework.
; Muda due to excessive storage
: Finished and semi-finished products, vendor parts and materials stored as inventory do not add value.
; Muda due to unnecessary movement
: Awkward, unergonomic and unnecessary movements consume time, lead to fatigue and increase the risk of injury.
; Muda due to an unfavorable manufacturing process
: The additional equipment of products or services with features that are neither desired nor paid for by the customer.

=== Just-in-Time (JIT) ===
* This principle is a logistics-oriented decentralized organization and control concept that aims to supply and dispose of materials for production on demand and thus ensures the precise delivery of raw materials or products of the required quality in the desired quantity (and packaging) to the desired location at the time they are actually needed. This eliminates storage costs; the remaining administrative effort can be reduced to a relative minimum.
* An enhancement of &quot;just-in-time&quot; is the so-called &quot;just in sequence&quot; (JIS). Based on the JIT principle, the products are also delivered to the customer in the correct sequence.

JIT is now standard throughout the automotive industry. It is used, for example, for interior parts (seats, airbags, steering wheels, dashboards) or painted parts. The generally higher transportation and handling costs caused by JIT or JIS are offset by savings in inventory, storage or floor space costs.

=== Total Productive Maintenance ===
* Constant monitoring of the production lines
* Attempt to continuously improve the lines
* Elimination of waste of any kind

For more information, see the article Total productive maintenance.

== Benefits and tradeoffs ==
Kaizen is a daily process, the purpose of which goes beyond simple productivity improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work (&quot;muri&quot;), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. In all, the process suggests a humanized approach to workers and to increasing productivity: &quot;The idea is to nurture the company&#x27;s people as much as it is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities.&quot; Successful implementation requires &quot;the participation of workers in the improvement.&quot;
People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. Kaizen is most commonly associated with manufacturing operations, as at Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing environments. The format for kaizen can be individual, suggestion system, small group, or large group. At Toyota, it is usually a local improvement within a workstation or local area and involves a small group in improving their own work environment and productivity. This group is often guided through the kaizen process by a line supervisor; sometimes this is the line supervisor&#x27;s key role. Kaizen on a broad, cross-departmental scale in companies generates total quality management and frees human efforts through improving productivity using machines and computing power.

While kaizen (at Toyota) usually delivers small improvements, the culture of continual aligned small improvements and standardization yields large results in terms of overall improvement in productivity. This philosophy differs from the &quot;command and control&quot; improvement programs (e.g., Business Process Improvement) of the mid-20th century. Kaizen methodology includes making changes and monitoring results, then adjusting. Large-scale pre-planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments, which can be rapidly adapted as new improvements are suggested.

In modern usage, it is designed to address a particular issue over the course of a week and is referred to as a &quot;kaizen blitz&quot; or &quot;kaizen event&quot;. These are limited in scope, and issues that arise from them are typically used in later blitzes. A person who makes a large contribution in the successful implementation of kaizen during kaizen events is awarded the title of &quot;Zenkai&quot;. In the 21st century, business consultants in various countries have engaged in widespread adoption and sharing of the kaizen framework as a way to help their clients restructure and refocus their business processes.

==History==

The small-step work improvement approach was developed in the USA under Training Within Industry program (TWI Job Methods). Instead of encouraging large, radical changes to achieve desired goals, these methods recommended that organizations introduce small improvements, preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day. The major reason was that during WWII there was neither time nor resources for large and innovative changes in the production of war equipment. The essence of the approach came down to improving the use of the existing workforce and technologies.

As part of the aid to allied nations after the war, not directly including the Marshall Plan after World War II, American occupation forces brought in experts to help with the rebuilding of Japanese industry while the Civil Communications Section (CCS) developed a management training program that taught statistical control methods as part of the overall material. Homer Sarasohn and Charles Protzman developed and taught this course in 1949–1950. Sarasohn recommended W. Edwards Deming for further training in statistical methods.

The Economic and Scientific Section (ESS) group was also tasked with improving Japanese management skills and Edgar McVoy was instrumental in bringing Lowell Mellen to Japan to properly install the Training Within Industry (TWI) programs in 1951. The ESS group had a training film to introduce TWI&#x27;s three &quot;J&quot; programs: Job Instruction, Job Methods and Job Relations. Titled &quot;Improvement in Four Steps&quot; (), it thus introduced kaizen to Japan.

For the pioneering, introduction, and implementation of kaizen in Japan, the Emperor of Japan awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure to Dr. Deming in 1960. Subsequently, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) instituted the annual Deming Prizes for achievement in quality and dependability of products. On October 18, 1989, JUSE awarded the Deming Prize to Florida Power &amp; Light Co. (FPL), based in the US, for its exceptional accomplishments in process and quality-control management, making it the first company outside Japan to win the Deming Prize.

Kaoru Ishikawa took up this concept to define how continuous improvement or kaizen can be applied to processes, as long as all the variables of the process are known.

== Implementation ==
The Toyota Production System is known for kaizen, where all line personnel are expected to stop their moving production line in case of any abnormality, and, along with their supervisor, suggest an improvement to resolve the abnormality which may initiate a kaizen. This feature is called Jidoka or &quot;autonomation&quot;.
The cycle of kaizen activity can be defined as: Plan → Do → Check → Act. This is also known as the Shewhart cycle, Deming cycle, or PDCA.

Another technique used in conjunction with PDCA is the five whys, which is a form of root cause analysis in which the user asks a series of five &quot;why&quot; questions about a failure that has occurred, basing each subsequent question on the answer to the previous. There are normally a series of causes stemming from one root cause, and they can be visualized using fishbone diagrams or tables. The five whys can be used as a foundational tool in personal improvement.

Masaaki Imai made the term famous in his book &quot;Kaizen: The Key to Japan&#x27;s Competitive Success&quot;.

In the &quot;Toyota Way Fieldbook&quot;, Liker and Meier discuss the kaizen blitz and kaizen burst (or kaizen event) approaches to continuous improvement. A kaizen blitz, or rapid improvement, is a focused activity on a particular process or activity. The basic concept is to identify and quickly remove waste. Another approach is that of the kaizen burst, a specific kaizen activity on a particular process in the value stream.

In the 1990s, Professor Iwao Kobayashi published his book &quot;20 Keys to Workplace Improvement&quot; and created a practical, step-by-step improvement framework called &quot;the 20 Keys&quot;. He identified 20 operations focus areas which should be improved to attain holistic and sustainable change. He went further and identified the five levels of implementation for each of these 20 focus areas. Four of the focus areas are called Foundation Keys. According to the 20 Keys, these foundation keys should be launched ahead of the others in order to form a strong constitution in the company. The four foundation keys are:
* Key 1 – Cleaning and Organizing to Make Work Easy, which is based on the 5S methodology.
* Key 2 – Goal Alignment/Rationalizing the System
* Key 3 – Small Group Activities
* Key 4 – Leading and Site Technology

<doc id="287013" wikidata="Q65126" url="?curid=287013" title="Gregor Gysi">
<text>Gregor Florian Gysi (; born 16 January 1948) is a German attorney, former president of the Party of the European Left and a prominent politician of The Left () political party.

He belonged to the reformist wing of the governing Socialist Unity Party of Germany at the time of the pro-democracy transition inspired by then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He has strongly denied allegations that he used to assist the Stasi, the East German secret police. He was the last leader of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and led the effort that transformed it into the post-Communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), forerunner of The Left.

==Family background==
Gysi was born in Berlin-Lichtenberg in East Berlin, Soviet Zone of Germany. His father was Klaus Gysi, a high-ranking official in East Germany who served as the Minister of Culture from 1966 to 1973. His mother, Irene Olga Lydia Gysi (&quot;née&quot; Lessing; 1912–2007), was the sister of political activist Gottfried Lessing, who was married to British writer and Nobel laureate Doris Lessing during his exile in Southern Rhodesia. The surname &quot;Gysi&quot; is of Swiss-German origin. He is of partial Jewish ancestry; his paternal grandmother was Jewish, as was one of his maternal great-grandfathers. One of his maternal great-grandmothers was Russian. His sister, Gabriele, is an actress who left East Germany in 1985. Today, she is chief dramaturge at the Volksbühne in Berlin. 

==Career==
===Pre-1989===
Gysi&#x27;s political career began in the then-ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) of East Germany, to which he was admitted in 1967. In 1971 he became a licensed attorney, and during the 1970s and 1980s defended several prominent dissidents, including Rudolf Bahro, Robert Havemann, Ulrike Poppe, and Bärbel Bohley.

In addition to his legal work, Gysi emerged as one of East Germany&#x27;s leading Gorbachev-inspired political reformists within the SED, especially towards the end of the 1980s. In 1989, he and a group of lawyers presented a counter-draft to the government&#x27;s Travel Bill, which authorised mass public demonstrations. This led to a mass rally on East-Berlin&#x27;s Alexanderplatz on 4 November in which he spoke and called for reforms, including free elections. In December 1989, he became a member of a special SED party session investigating official corruption and abuse of power.

===Fall of Communism===
In an interview conducted in 2011, Gysi recalled that in late 1989 he had become the attorney for several of the people who were arrested in the first early public protests. As such he became known to leading figures in the Artistic and Cultural unions and was contacted by a group of actresses about the legality of a large demonstration. He recalls having examined the laws and advising them that they could apply for such a permit from the police and the worst outcome would be that their request could be denied, but they would not be breaking any law or doing anything illegal. He further recalls assisting the group in requesting and completing the appropriate forms and paperwork required for such a permit. 

In December 1989, Egon Krenz, the last Communist leader of East Germany, resigned all of his posts. Gysi was elected as the party&#x27;s chairman. He did not, however, become the leader of East Germany; the SED had abandoned its monopoly of power on 1 December. In his first speech, Gysi admitted that the SED had brought the country to ruin, repudiating everything it had done since 1949. He declared that the party needed to adopt a new form of socialism.

To that end, he immediately set about transforming the SED into a democratic socialist party. Before the year was out, the last hardliners in the SED leadership had either resigned or been pushed out. On 16 December, the SED was renamed the Socialist Unity Party – Party of Democratic Socialism (SED-PDS), it later became simply the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). Gysi remained as party chairman, and in March 1990 was elected to the Volkskammer in the first free election of that body, serving there until it was dissolved upon German reunification on 3 October 1990.

===Post-unification===
In the first post-reunification all-German elections, he was elected to the Bundestag from Berlin&#x27;s Hellersdorf–Marzahn constituency, and served there until 2000. He remained chairman of the PDS through 1998, and then from 1998 to 2000 served as chairman of the party&#x27;s parliamentary group.

In 1992, it was alleged Gysi was an informer (&quot;Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter&quot;, IM) of East Germany&#x27;s Ministry for State Security (the Stasi). He denied these allegations, and the matter was largely dropped due to his parliamentary immunity. In 1995, the Hamburg state court ruled in Gysi&#x27;s favour in a complaint against Bärbel Bohley, Gysi&#x27;s former client, who had accused him of Stasi collaboration. However, the allegations were raised again in 1996, and this time the Bundestag voted to revoke his immunity and proceed with an investigation.

In 1998, the Bundestag&#x27;s immunity committee concluded that Gysi had been a collaborator with the Stasi from 1978 to 1989 under the name &quot;IM Notar&quot;, and fined him 8,000 Deutsche Mark. However, both the Free Democratic Party and his own PDS disputed the verdict, and Gysi appealed against the finding. Despite the affair, he retained his seat in the Bundestag in the 1998 elections.

In 2000, he resigned as chairman of the PDS&#x27;s parliamentary group, but continued as an active member of the party. Following the victory of a &quot;Red-red&quot; (SPD-PDS) coalition in the 2001 Berlin state election, he was elected Senator for Economics, Labour, and Women&#x27;s Issues and Deputy Mayor. He emphasised practical issues and advocated the reinstitution of some of what he sees as the better aspects of East Germany&#x27;s system, such as extended child-care hours and a longer school day. After a scandal involving his use of airline &quot;bonus miles&quot; he had acquired on trips as a Bundestag member, he resigned on 31 July 2002 from the Berlin city government. The resignation was a blow to his public &quot;can-do&quot; image, but he has recovered from that to some extent in the wake of increasing public opposition to a number of new policies of the federal government, like the Hartz reforms lowering unemployment benefits to the levels of mere subsistence welfare, which he strongly opposes.

In late-2004, he survived brain surgery and a heart attack. Formerly a heavy smoker, Gysi quit smoking as a result of surviving the heart attack.

Gysi remained the PDS&#x27;s undisputed front man in many people&#x27;s minds and continued to appear in public. In May 2005, when Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder planned to call an early election in September, many prominent PDS leaders including chair Lothar Bisky called on Gysi to front their campaign. He was a lead candidate of the PDS, and returned to the Bundestag as the member for Berlin-Treptow-Köpenick. The PDS fought the election in an alliance with the new western-based ElectoralAlternative Labour and Social Justice (WASG), under the new name Left Party.PDS, with Gysi at times sharing a platform with WASG&#x27;s Oskar Lafontaine, former finance minister (in the first months of the Schröder government) and formerly party leader of the SPD. In June 2007, the PDS and WASG formally merged to form a united party called The Left.

In 2014, Gysi wrote his analysis on the contemporary Ukraine crisis in the &quot;Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs&quot;, where he described similarities between the United States and Russia in their transgressions of international law. Gysi calls for &quot;a new Ostpolitik&quot; to prevent war and promote &quot;democracy and freedom in Russia&quot;. In 2015, Gysi was one of the leading supporters of Greece during the Greek government-debt crisis. He described the current German government as &quot;blackmailers&quot;.

Gysi is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations. This is due to his belief in the need for &quot;functioning and democratically legitimate global politics.&quot;

In the 2021 German federal elections Gysi once more won his constituency of Berlin-Treptow-Köpenick. While the Left came up short of the five percent electoral threshold, his win, together with those of Gesine Lötzsch in Berlin-Lichtenberg and Sören Pellmann in Leipzig II, qualified the party for list seats proportional to its vote. Under longstanding German law, a party can bypass the electoral threshold by winning three constituency seats.

== Media activities ==
Gysi is one of the most present politicians in German entertainment media. He regularly appears on political entertainment talk shows and is host of conversation programs himself.

In 2019, Gregor Gysi stated to the Bundestag administration that he had received fees for almost 90 lectures, discussions and conversations. On average he has one appearance per week. He also earns money from jobs as lawyer and book publishing.

==Controversies==
===Stasi informant &quot;IM Notar&quot;===
Gysi continues to deny allegations, which first surfaced in 1992, that he was a Stasi informant (&quot;inoffizieller Mitarbeiter&quot;). Invited in 2017 to spell out who, other than himself, &quot;IM Notar&quot; could possibly be, he replied that he had a strong suspicion, backed by a huge amount of information, adding pointedly that whenever the allegations that he himself was &quot;IM Notar&quot; have come before a court, he has &quot;always won&quot;. In the absence of certain proof, he is not prepared to disclose the identity of the true &quot;IM Notar&quot;.

===&quot;Toiletgate&quot; (2014)===
In November 2014, after being invited by Inge Höger and Annette Groth, also members of The Left () to talk with them in the Bundestag, journalists Max Blumenthal and David Sheen learned that Gysi tried to cancel the meetings on the grounds that Blumenthal and Sheen held radical views from which he wished to dissociate the party.

Gysi fled, followed by the two men and other parliamentary members down a parliament corridor and into a bathroom in an incident referred to as &quot;toiletgate&quot;. After this event, Blumenthal and Sheen were banned from ever setting foot in the Bundestag again.

===Comments on Germans and Immigration (2015)===
In a 2015 interview, Gysi stated that &quot;Every year more Germans die than are born. Fortunately, this is due to the fact that the Nazis do not reproduce particularly well and therefore, we depend on immigrants from other countries.&quot; The comparison of all Germans to Nazis and the statement that it was good that Germans had a declining birth rate generated significant criticism from the public.

<text>The bin packing problem is an optimization problem, in which items of different sizes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers, each of a fixed given capacity, in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. The problem has many applications, such as filling up containers, loading trucks with weight capacity constraints, creating file backups in media, splitting a network prefix into multiple subnets, and technology mapping in FPGA semiconductor chip design.

Computationally, the problem is NP-hard, and the corresponding decision problem, deciding if items can fit into a specified number of bins, is NP-complete. Despite its worst-case hardness, optimal solutions to very large instances of the problem can be produced with sophisticated algorithms. In addition, many approximation algorithms exist. For example, the first fit algorithm provides a fast but often non-optimal solution, involving placing each item into the first bin in which it will fit. It requires &quot;Θ&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of items to be packed. The algorithm can be made much more effective by first sorting the list of items into decreasing order (sometimes known as the first-fit decreasing algorithm), although this still does not guarantee an optimal solution and for longer lists may increase the running time of the algorithm. It is known, however, that there always exists at least one ordering of items that allows first-fit to produce an optimal solution.

There are many variations of this problem, such as 2D packing, linear packing, packing by weight, packing by cost, and so on. The bin packing problem can also be seen as a special case of the cutting stock problem. When the number of bins is restricted to 1 and each item is characterized by both a volume and a value, the problem of maximizing the value of items that can fit in the bin is known as the knapsack problem.

A variant of bin packing that occurs in practice is when items can share space when packed into a bin. Specifically, a set of items could occupy less space when packed together than the sum of their individual sizes. This variant is known as VM packing since when virtual machines (VMs) are packed in a server, their total memory requirement could decrease due to pages shared by the VMs that need only be stored once. If items can share space in arbitrary ways, the bin packing problem is hard to even approximate. However, if space sharing fits into a hierarchy, as is the case with memory sharing in virtual machines, the bin packing problem can be efficiently approximated.

Another variant of bin packing of interest in practice is the so-called online bin packing. Here the items of different volume are supposed to arrive sequentially, and the decision maker has to decide whether to select and pack the currently observed item, or else to let it pass. Each decision is without recall. In contrast, offline bin packing allows rearranging the items in the hope of achieving a better packing once additional items arrive. This of course requires additional storage for holding the items to be rearranged.

==Formal statement==
In &quot;Computers and Intractability&quot; Garey and Johnson list the bin packing problem under the reference [SR1]. They define its decision variant as follows.

Instance: Finite set formula_1 of items, a size formula_2 for each formula_3, a positive integer bin capacity formula_4, and a positive integer formula_5.

Question: Is there a partition of formula_1 into disjoint sets formula_7 such that the sum of the sizes of the items in each formula_8 is formula_4 or less?

Note that in the literature often an equivalent notation is used, where formula_10 and formula_11 for each formula_3. Furthermore, research is mostly interested in the optimization variant, which asks for the smallest possible value of formula_5. A solution is &quot;optimal&quot; if it has minimal formula_5. The formula_5-value for an optimal solution for a set of items formula_1 is denoted by formula_17 or just formula_18 if the set of items is clear from the context.

A possible integer linear programming formulation of the problem is:

where formula_19 if bin formula_20 is used and formula_21 if item formula_22 is put into bin formula_20.

== Hardness of bin packing ==
The bin packing problem is strongly NP-complete. This can be proven by reducing the strongly NP-complete 3-partition problem to bin packing.

Furthermore, there can be no approximation algorithm with absolute approximation ratio smaller than formula_24 unless formula_25. This can be proven by a reduction from the partition problem: given an instance of Partition where the sum of all input numbers is formula_26, construct an instance of bin-packing in which the bin size is . If there exists an equal partition of the inputs, then the optimal packing needs 2 bins; therefore, every algorithm with an approximation ratio smaller than must return less than 3 bins, which must be 2 bins. In contrast, if there is no equal partition of the inputs, then the optimal packing needs at least 3 bins.

On the other hand, bin packing is solvable in pseudo-polynomial time for any fixed number of bins , and solvable in polynomial time for any fixed bin capacity .

== Approximation algorithms for bin packing ==
To measure the performance of an approximation algorithm there are two approximation ratios considered in the literature. For a given list of items formula_27 the number formula_28 denotes the number of bins used when algorithm formula_29 is applied to list formula_27, while formula_31 denotes the optimum number for this list. The absolute worst-case performance ratio formula_32 for an algorithm formula_29 is defined as

: formula_34

On the other hand, the asymptotic worst-case ratio formula_35 is defined as

: formula_36

Equivalently, formula_35 is the smallest number such that there exists some constant &quot;K,&quot; such that for all lists &quot;L:&quot;

: formula_38.

Additionally, one can restrict the lists to those for which all items have a size of at most formula_39. For such lists, the bounded size performance ratios are denoted as formula_40 and formula_41.

Approximation algorithms for bin packing can be classified into two categories:

# Online heuristics, that consider the items in a given order and place them one by one inside the bins. These heuristics are also applicable to the offline version of this problem.
# Offline heuristics, that modify the given list of items e.g. by sorting the items by size. These algorithms are no longer applicable to the online variant of this problem. However, they have an improved approximation guarantee while maintaining the advantage of their small time-complexity. A sub-category of offline heuristics is asymptotic approximation schemes. These algorithms have an approximation guarantee of the form formula_42 for some constant that may depend on formula_43. For an arbitrarily large formula_31 these algorithms get arbitrarily close to formula_31. However, this comes at the cost of a (drastically) increased time complexity compared to the heuristical approaches.

== Online heuristics ==
In the online version of the bin packing problem, the items arrive one after another and the (irreversible) decision where to place an item has to be made before knowing the next item or even if there will be another one. A diverse set of offline and online heuristics for bin-packing have been studied by David S. Johnson on his Ph.D. thesis.

=== Single-class algorithms ===
There are many simple algorithms that use the following general scheme:
* For each item in the input list:
*# If the item fits into one of the currently open bins, then put it in one of these bins;
*# Otherwise, open a new bin and put the new item in it.

The algorithms differ in the criterion by which they choose the open bin for the new item in step 1 (see the linked pages for more information):

* Next Fit (NF) always keeps a single open bin. When the new item does not fit into it, it closes the current bin and opens a new bin. Its advantage is that it is a bounded-space algorithm since it only needs to keep a single open bin in memory. Its disadvantage is that its asymptotic approximation ratio is 2. In particular, formula_46, and for each formula_47 there exists a list such that formula_48 and formula_49. Its asymptotic approximation ratio can be somewhat improved based on the item sizes: formula_50 for all formula_51 and formula_52 for all formula_53. For each algorithm that is an AnyFit-algorithm it holds that formula_54.
* Next-k-Fit (NkF) is a variant of Next-Fit, but instead of keeping only one bin open, the algorithm keeps the last bins open and chooses the first bin in which the item fits. Therefore, it is called a &quot;k-bounded space&quot; algorithm. For formula_55 the NkF delivers results that are improved compared to the results of NF, however, increasing to constant values larger than improves the algorithm no further in its worst-case behavior. If algorithm is an AlmostAnyFit-algorithm and formula_56 then formula_57.
* First-Fit (FF) keeps all bins open, in the order in which they were opened. It attempts to place each new item into the &quot;first&quot; bin in which it fits. Its approximation ratio is formula_58, and there is a family of input lists for which formula_59 matches this bound.
* Best-Fit (BF), too, keeps all bins open, but attempts to place each new item into the bin with the &quot;maximum&quot; load in which it fits. Its approximation ratio is identical to that of FF, that is: formula_60, and there is a family of input lists for which formula_61 matches this bound.
*Worst-Fit (WF) attempts to place each new item into the bin with the &quot;minimum&quot; load. It can behave as badly as Next-Fit, and will do so on the worst-case list for that formula_62. Furthermore, it holds that formula_63. Since WF is an AnyFit-algorithm, there exists an AnyFit-algorithm such that formula_64.
* Almost Worst-Fit (AWF) attempts to place each new item inside the &quot;second most empty&quot; open bin (or emptiest bin if there are two such bins). If it does not fit, it tries the most empty one. It has an asymptotic worst-case ratio of formula_65.
In order to generalize these results, Johnson introduced two classes of online heuristics called &quot;any-fit algorithm&quot; and &quot;almost-any-fit&quot; algorithm:
* In an AnyFit (AF) algorithm, if the current nonempty bins are &quot;B&quot;1...,&quot;Bj&quot;, then the current item will not be packed into &quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot;+1 unless it does not fit in any of &quot;B&quot;1...,&quot;Bj&quot;. The FF, WF, BF and AWF algorithms satisfy this condition. Johnson proved that, for any AnyFit algorithm A and any formula_39:
*:formula_67.
* In an AlmostAnyFit (AAF) algorithm, if the current nonempty bins are &quot;B&quot;1...,&quot;Bj&quot;, and of these bins, &quot;Bk&quot; is the unique bin with the smallest load, then the current item will not be packed into &quot;Bk&quot;, unless it does not fit into any of the bins to its left. The FF, BF and AWF algorithms satisfy this condition, but WF does not. Johnson proved that, for any AAF algorithm A and any :
*:formula_68 In particular: formula_69.

=== Refined algorithms ===
Better approximation ratios are possible with heuristics that are not AnyFit. These heuristics usually keep several classes of open bins, devoted to items of different size ranges (see the linked pages for more information):

* Refined-first-fit bin packing (RFF) partitions the item sizes into four ranges: formula_70, formula_71, formula_72, and formula_73. Similarly, the bins are categorized into four classes. The next item formula_74 is first assigned to its corresponding class. Inside that class, it is assigned to a bin using first-fit. Note that this algorithm is not an Any-Fit algorithm since it may open a new bin despite the fact that the current item fits inside an open bin. This algorithm was first presented by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, who proved that it has an approximation guarantee of formula_75 and presented a family of lists formula_76 with formula_77 for formula_78.
* Harmonic-k partitions the interval of sizes formula_79 based on a Harmonic progression into formula_80 pieces formula_81 for formula_82 and formula_83 such that formula_84. This algorithm was first described by Lee and Lee. It has a time complexity of formula_85 and at each step, there are at most open bins that can be potentially used to place items, i.e., it is a -bounded space algorithm. For formula_86, its approximation ratio satisfies formula_87, and it is asymptotically tight.
* Refined-harmonic combines ideas from Harmonic-k with ideas from Refined-First-Fit. It places the items larger than formula_88 similar as in Refined-First-Fit, while the smaller items are placed using Harmonic-k. The intuition for this strategy is to reduce the huge waste for bins containing pieces that are just larger than formula_89. This algorithm was first described by Lee and Lee. They proved that for formula_90 it holds that formula_91.

=== General lower bounds for online algorithms ===
Yao proved in 1980 that there can be no online algorithm with an asymptotic competitive ratio smaller than formula_24. Brown and Liang improved this bound to . Afterward, this bound was improved to by Vliet. In 2012, this lower bound was again improved by Békési and Galambos to formula_93.

=== Comparison table ===
== Offline algorithms ==
In the offline version of bin packing, the algorithm can see all the items before starting to place them into bins. This allows to attain improved approximation ratios.

=== Multiplicative approximation ===
The simplest technique used by offline approximation schemes is the following:

* Ordering the input list by descending size;
* Run an online algorithm on the ordered list.

Johnson proved that any AnyFit scheme A that runs on a list ordered by descending size has an asymptotic approximation ratio offormula_94.Some methods in this family are (see the linked pages for more information):

* First-fit-decreasing (FFD) orders the items by descending size, then calls First-Fit. Its approximation ratio is formula_95, and this is tight.
* Next-fit-decreasing (NFD) orders the items by descending size, then calls Next-Fit. Its approximate ratio is slightly less than 1.7 in the worst case. It has also been analyzed probabilistically. Next-Fit packs a list and its inverse into the same number of bins. Therefore, Next-Fit-Increasing has the same performance as Next-Fit-Decreasing.
* Modified first-fit-decreasing (MFFD), improves on FFD for items larger than half a bin by classifying items by size into four size classes large, medium, small, and tiny, corresponding to items with size &gt; 1/2 bin, &gt; 1/3 bin, &gt; 1/6 bin, and smaller items respectively. Its approximation guarantee is formula_96.
Fernandez de la Vega and Lueker presented a PTAS for bin packing. For every formula_97, their algorithm finds a solution with size at most formula_98 and runs in time formula_99, where formula_100 denotes a function only dependent on formula_43. For this algorithm, they invented the method of &quot;adaptive input rounding&quot;: the input numbers are grouped and rounded up to the value of the maximum in each group. This yields an instance with a small number of different sizes, which can be solved exactly using the configuration linear program.

=== Additive approximation ===
The Karmarkar-Karp bin packing algorithm finds a solution with size at most formula_102, and runs in time polynomial in (the polynomial has a high degree, at least 8).

Rothvoss presented an algorithm that generates a solution with at most formula_103 bins.

Hoberg and Rothvoss improved this algorithm to generate a solution with at most formula_104 bins. The algorithm is randomized, and its running-time is polynomial in .

=== Comparison table ===
=== Exact algorithms ===
Martello and Toth developed an exact algorithm for the 1-dimensional bin-packing problem, called MTP. A faster alternative is the Bin Completion algorithm proposed by Korf in 2002 and later improved.

A further improvement was presented by Schreiber and Korf in 2013. The new Improved Bin Completion algorithm is shown to be up to five orders of magnitude faster than Bin Completion on non-trivial problems with 100 items, and outperforms the BCP (branch-and-cut-and-price) algorithm by Belov and Scheithauer on problems that have fewer than 20 bins as the optimal solution. Which algorithm performs best depends on problem properties like the number of items, the optimal number of bins, unused space in the optimal solution and value precision.

=== Small number of different sizes ===
A special case of bin packing is when there is a small number &quot;d&quot; of different item sizes. There can be many different items of each size. This case is also called &quot;high-multiplicity bin packing&quot;, and It admits more efficient algorithms than the general problem.

== Bin-packing with fragmentation ==
Bin-packing with fragmentation or fragmentable object bin-packing is a variant of the bin packing problem in which it is allowed to break items into parts and put each part separately on a different bin. Breaking items into parts may allow for improving the overall performance, for example, minimizing the number of total bin. Moreover, the computational problem of finding an optimal schedule may become easier, as some of the optimization variables become continuous. On the other hand, breaking items apart might be costly. The problem was first introduced by Mandal, Chakrabary and Ghose.

=== Variants ===
The problem has two main variants.

# In the first variant, called bin-packing with size-increasing fragmentation (BP-SIF), each item may be fragmented; overhead units are added to the size of every fragment.
# In the second variant, called bin-packing with size-preserving fragmentation (BP-SPF) each item has a size and a cost; fragmenting an item increases its cost but does not change its size.

=== Computational complexity ===
Mandal, Chakrabary and Ghose proved that BP-SPF is NP-hard.

Menakerman and Rom showed that BP-SIF and BP-SPF are both strongly NP-hard. Despite the hardness, they present several algorithms and investigate their performance. Their algorithms use classic algorithms for bin-packing, like next-fit and first-fit decreasing, as a basis for their algorithms.

Bertazzi, Golden and Wang introduced a variant of BP-SIF with formula_105 split rule: an item is allowed to be split in only one way according to its size. It is useful for the vehicle routing problem for example. In their paper, they provide the worst-case performance bound of the variant.

Shachnai, Tamir and Yehezkeli developed approximation schemes for BP-SIF and BP-SPF; a dual PTAS (a PTAS for the dual version of the problem), an asymptotic PTAS called APTAS, and a dual asymptotic FPTAS called AFPTAS for both versions.

Ekici introduced a variant of BP-SPF in which some items are in conflict, and it is forbidden to pack fragments of conflicted items into the same bin. They proved that this variant, too, is NP-hard.

Cassazza and Ceselli introduced a variant with no cost and no overhead, and the number of bins is fixed. However, the number of fragmentations should be minimized. They present mathematical programming algorithms for both exact and approximate solutions.

=== Related problems ===
The problem of fractional knapsack with penalties was introduced by Malaguti, Monaci, Paronuzzi and Pferschy. They developed an FPTAS and a dynamic program for the problem, and they showed an extensive computational study comparing the performance of their models. See also: Fractional job scheduling.

== Performance with divisible item sizes ==
An important special case of bin packing is that the item sizes form a &quot;divisible sequence&quot; (also called &quot;factored&quot;). A special case of divisible item sizes occurs in memory allocation in computer systems, where the item sizes are all powers of 2. If the item sizes are divisible, then some of the heuristic algorithms for bin packing find an optimal solution.

== Cardinality constraints on the bins ==
There is a variant of bin packing in which there are cardinality constraints on the bins: each bin can contain at most &quot;k&quot; items, for some fixed integer &quot;k&quot;.

* Krause, Shen and Schwetman introduce this problem as a variant of optimal job scheduling: a computer has some &quot;k&quot; processors. There are some &quot;n&quot; jobs that take unit time (1), but have different memory requirements. Each time-unit is considered a single bin. The goal is to use as few bins (=time units) as possible, while ensuring that in each bin, at most &quot;k&quot; jobs run. They present several heuristic algorithms that find a solution with at most formula_106 bins.
* Kellerer and Pferschy present an algorithm with run-time formula_107, that finds a solution with at most formula_108 bins. Their algorithm performs a binary search for OPT. For every searched value &quot;m&quot;, it tries to pack the items into 3&quot;m&quot;/2 bins.

== Non-additive functions ==
There are various ways to extend the bin-packing model to more general cost and load functions:

* Anily, Bramel and Simchi-Levi study a setting where the cost of a bin is a concave function of the number of items in the bin. The objective is to minimize the total &quot;cost&quot; rather than the number of bins. They show that next-fit-increasing bin packing attains an absolute worst-case approximation ratio of at most 7/4, and an asymptotic worst-case ratio of 1.691 for any concave and monotone cost function.
* Cohen, Keller, Mirrokni and Zadimoghaddam study a setting where the size of the items is not known in advance, but it is a random variable. This is particularly common in cloud computing environments. While there is an upper bound on the amount of resources a certain user needs, most users use much less than the capacity. Therefore, the cloud manager may gain a lot by slight overcommitment. This induces a variant of bin packing with chance constraints: the probability that the sum of sizes in each bin is at most &quot;B&quot; should be at least &quot;p&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is a fixed constant (standard bin packing corresponds to &quot;p&quot;=1). They show that, under mild assumptions, this problem is equivalent to a &quot;submodular bin packing&quot; problem, in which the &quot;load&quot; in each bin is not equal to the sum of items, but to a certain submodular function of it.

== Related problems ==
In the bin packing problem, the &quot;size&quot; of the bins is fixed and their &quot;number&quot; can be enlarged (but should be as small as possible).

In contrast, in the multiway number partitioning problem, the &quot;number&quot; of bins is fixed and their &quot;size&quot; can be enlarged. The objective is to find a partition in which the bin sizes are as nearly equal is possible (in the variant called multiprocessor scheduling problem or minimum makespan problem, the goal is specifically to minimize the size of the largest bin).

In the inverse bin packing problem, both the number of bins and their sizes are fixed, but the item sizes can be changed. The objective is to achieve the minimum perturbation to the item size vector so that all the items can be packed into the prescribed number of bins.

In the maximum resource bin packing problem, the goal is to &quot;maximize&quot; the number of bins used, such that, for some ordering of the bins, no item in a later bin fits in an earlier bin. In a dual problem, the number of bins is fixed, and the goal is to minimize the total number or the total size of items placed into the bins, such that no remaining item fits into an unfilled bin.

In the bin covering problem, the bin size is bounded &quot;from below&quot;: the goal is to &quot;maximize&quot; the number of bins used such that the total size in each bin is at least a given threshold.

In the fair indivisible chore allocation problem (a variant of fair item allocation), the items represent chores, and there are different people each of whom attributes a different difficulty-value to each chore. The goal is to allocate to each person a set of chores with an upper bound on its total difficulty-value (thus, each person corresponds to a bin). Many techniques from bin packing are used in this problem too.

In the guillotine cutting problem, both the items and the &quot;bins&quot; are two-dimensional rectangles rather than one-dimensional numbers, and the items have to be cut from the bin using end-to-end cuts.

In the selfish bin packing problem, each item is a player who wants to minimize its cost.

There is also a variant of bin packing in which the cost that should be minimized is not the number of bins, but rather a certain concave function of the number of items in each bin.

Other variants are two-dimensional bin packing, three-dimensional bin packing, bin packing with delivery,

<doc id="287016" wikidata="Q704472" url="?curid=287016" title="Marsilius of Inghen">
<text>Marsilius of Inghen (c. 1340 – 20 August 1396) was a medieval Dutch Scholastic philosopher who studied with Albert of Saxony and Nicole Oresme under Jean Buridan. He was Magister at the University of Paris as well as at the University of Heidelberg from 1386 to 1396.

==Life==
He was born near Nijmegen. Details about his family and early life are not well known, the first known date of his biography being 27 September 1362. On that day he gave his Magister Artium lecture at the University of Paris. There, he received his masters of arts, then took up work and was rector in 1367 and 1371. Aside from his philosophical and logical studies, he also studied theology, in which subject his lectures enjoyed large popularity. In 1378, Marsilius was the delegate of University of Paris for the Pope Urban VI in Tivoli.

After 1379 the name of Marsilius of Inghen was not mentioned anymore in the recordings of the University of Paris. He was probably driven out of the university because of a schism. In 1383 Marsilius and Albert of Saxony went to spread the nominalist doctrine at . In 1386, Marsiluis became the first rector of the University of Heidelberg, which he founded with the help of Rupert I, Elector Palatine. He was, furthermore, the first theologian to receive a doctorate from the university.

In 1386 Marsilius became Magister at the University of Heidelberg, of which he was rector nine times altogether: From 1386, the year of the foundation of the university, to 1392 and still from June 23 up to his death. From 1389 to 1390 he was responsible for transferring the university register to Rome. Afterwards he took up again the study of theology. Deceased just months later, Marsilius of Inghen was buried in the Church of Peter (Heidelberger Peterskirche) at Heidelberg.

==Philosophy==

===Overview===
In logic, he was an Aristotelian nominalist; in natural philosophy, an empiricist. He applied a synthesis of the new 14th century physics of Buridan, Thomas Bradwardine and Oresme in his commentaries on Aristotle. Both his theological and philosophical works are characterized by a logico-semantical approach in which he followed Buridan, combined with an eclectic use of older theories, sometimes more Aristotelian and sometimes more Neoplatonist; this fact that renders narrow the label &quot;Ockhamist&quot; often applied to Marsilius.

===Nominalism===
Marsilius of Inghen is most well known for his work in nominalism. Though no one called themselves nominalists in the 14th century, he is considered one of the movement&#x27;s &quot;forefathers.&quot; In his nominalist philosophy he accepted the basic nominalist foundation, namely that universals are only existent within the mind, and outside the mind there are only individuals. He advocated that human knowledge can be derived from a foundation of sensory knowledge. However, to Marsilius, metaphysical knowledge was the greatest obtainable form of knowledge. This is due to its ability to grasp the most highly universal propositions.

===The object of scientific knowledge===
From his beliefs in nominalism in conjunction with his Aristotelian influences follows his reasoning on the object of scientific knowledge. Marsilius claims such an object must be singular and conform to Aristotle&#x27;s requirement that such an object must be a necessary universal. Therefore, given Marsilius’ acceptance of the basic nominalist foundation—that is, universals are only in the mind—objects of science are predicates which exist in the mind and describe the individuals in the world outside of the mind.

===Natural philosophy===
As already mentioned, he accepted that knowledge is made evident via sensory knowledge, i.e. he was an empiricist. However, he also accepted a priori truths to be an acceptable source of scientific knowledge. Also noteworthy is Marsilius’ theory behind impetus. Following in the footsteps of Buridan, Marsilius rejected the Aristotelian theory and claimed that such forces are the transfer of some property from that which did the affecting into the affected object.

In his &quot;Questions on the Eight Books of the Physics&quot;, Marsilius cites ancient experiments with the clepsydra as proof that &quot;nature abhors a vacuum.&quot;

==Theology==
Marsilius began studies of theology at the University of Paris in 1366, though, the majority of his theological study took place during his time at the University of Heidelberg. His overall theological philosophy was influenced by Adam Wodeham, Gregory of Rimini, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventure. However, he does not wholly follow their thinking and holds original ideas in the subject.

In considering the creation of the world by God Marsilius held that God did not create the world as eternal, and that such means of creation was not contrary to God&#x27;s perfection. Concerning Marsilius’ other specific theological thought, he believed his natural philosophy lead to both some true knowledge of God, as well as an impediment towards complete true knowledge of God. Human&#x27;s natural capacities, according to Marsilius, are sufficient to derive the truth of proposition asserting God&#x27;s existence, God having a will, and God having knowledge. Natural capacities, although achieving that much, are unable to reach the truth of propositions asserting God&#x27;s omnipotence, God&#x27;s free will, and God&#x27;s ability to create ex nihilo. Hence, Marsilius thought that using nothing but one&#x27;s natural capacities in trying to find true knowledge of God will actually lead to the negation of God&#x27;s omnipotence, free will, and ability to create ex nihilo. Not only this, but use of logic in general regarding theological study was something Marsilius didn&#x27;t wholly accept. In order for one to reach such knowledge of God one must use Christian faith. This faith is the only means to reach the knowledge of God which natural capacities cannot obtain. In this sense, Marsilius advocated that natural human knowledge is such that it is limited in its capability to comprehend the divine, but still aides the search for such knowledge.

Also crucial to his theological studies are his thoughts regarding a version of divine simplicity—of which he was highly influenced by Wodeham. Even though human knowledge seems to abstract various properties or parts of God, such extrapolations are merely existent in human conceptions of God. God truly has only one essence and is one singular unity according to Marsilius.

==Influence==
Following Marsilius’ death, his works became rather well known. Marsilius was revered as one of the greatest nominalists of his time, alongside Ockham and Buridan. His extensive questions and commentaries on Aristotle (including commentaries on De Generatione et Corruptione, De Anima, Metaphysics, Physics, and Ethics) became textbooks for students throughout various universities. Moreover, his theology became widely read and influential in Spanish theology. He was influential on Central European philosophy of later centuries, both through his own philosophy and by the way he stimulated reform of university programmes. In the 16th century there were still references to a &quot;Marsilian way&quot; in logic and physics.

<doc id="287017" wikidata="Q17895" url="?curid=287017" title="Palmerston, Northern Territory">
<text>Palmerston is a planned satellite city of Darwin, the capital and largest city of Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory. The city is situated approximately 20 kilometres from Darwin and 10 kilometres from Howard Springs and the surrounding rural areas. Palmerston had a population of 33,695 at the 2016 census, making it the second largest city in the Northern Territory. According to the 2021 census, the population grew to 37,247 people.

There are eighteen suburbs in Palmerston, ten of which are close to the Palmerston city centre. Palmerston is mostly residential with two light industrial areas in the north of the city.

==History==

===1864–1911===
Palmerston was the name chosen in 1864 for the capital of the Northern Territory by the South Australian Government, which was then responsible for its administration, in recognition of Lord Palmerston, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1855. The first site, as chosen by Boyle Travers Finniss at Escape Cliffs near the mouth of the Adelaide River, on the coast of Adam Bay on the western side of the Cape Hotham peninsula in 1864, was abandoned in 1867 and a second laid out by Surveyor-General George Goyder near Port Darwin in 1869. The town was officially renamed Darwin in April 1911 after responsibility for the Northern Territory passed to the Commonwealth of Australia and was officially gazetted as the City of Darwin in 1959.

===1971–present===
The land for a new satellite city of Darwin was acquired in 1971 by the Australian Government after concerns of under-supply of residential land in Darwin. The site was selected as the land was adjacent to existing transportation corridors. The decision to proceed with the development was made in 1980 and for the third time, the name of Palmerston was selected for the new city. Planning and development was managed by the Palmerston Development Authority.

Development of Palmerston began during the early 1980s. Suburbs of Palmerston were built in stages. The first suburbs built were Gray and Driver, followed by Moulden, then Woodroffe and Marlow Lagoon. The urban area continued to grow throughout the 1990s, with the new suburbs of Bakewell, Rosebery and Durack. The population growth of Palmerston continues to be the highest in the Northern Territory.

The population increased by almost 8,000 people between 1991 and 2001 to a total of 21,000 people. Palmerston&#x27;s population growth is expected to continue and reach over 40,000 people by 2023.

In 1995/1996 the construction commenced on 5 new Palmerston suburbs, Rosebery, Bakewell, Durack, Gunn, and Farrar. These were developed in stages. In 2000 the Palmerston Town Council sought and obtained a change in the name of the municipality to City of Palmerston.

Since then, other suburbs have been registered and remain in various stages of development, including Archer (2001), Bellamack (2001), Johnston (2007), Zuccoli (2007) and Mitchell (2007).

== Landmarks ==
The major landmark in Palmerston is the Power and Water Corporation&#x27;s water storage tank, which supplies the city with fresh potable water. Formerly, the city had a large escarpment in the heart of the city, with extensive walking paths and a small creek, but the area has since been converted into an open grassy area; the community space known as Goyder Square.

==Geography==

Palmerston is located between the outer industrial areas of Darwin and the rural areas of Howard Springs, 20 kilometres (13 mi) southeast of Darwin, and is situated in the local government area of the City of Palmerston.

The urban area of Palmerston extends from the Stuart Highway in the north and east and the East Arm inlet to the west and south.

===Regions and suburbs===

The City of Palmerston initially consisted of the Palmerston Town (CBD), as well as suburbs of Driver and Gray. These were followed by Moulden and Woodroffe after development in those areas commenced in 1983. Also included in the City of Palmerston are the semi-rural suburb of Marlow Lagoon, the suburb of Archer and the industrial zones of Yarrawonga and Pinelands. Further developments have occurred leading to the creation of the suburbs of Rosebery, Bakewell, Gunn, Durack and more recently Farrar, Bellamack, Johnston, Zuccoli and Mitchell. The newer suburbs are located on the south-east side of the existing city.

===Climate===
Palmerston has a tropical savannah climate (Aw) like Darwin with distinct wet and dry seasons. The dry season runs from May to September. In the coolest months of June and July, daily temperature range is 19 to 35 °C. The wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March when thunderstorms are common and humidity is regularly over 80 per cent.

==Demographics==
As of the 2016 Census, there were 33,695 people in Palmerston. The median age of persons in Palmerston was 28 years. 18.9% of the population of Palmerston were children aged between 5–14 years, and 47.1% were persons aged 25–54 years. 74.8 per cent of Palmerston&#x27;s population are Australian born; the biggest overseas birthplaces were England (692 or 2.9 per cent), New Zealand (437 or 1.9 per cent), the Philippines (278 or 1.2 per cent), Papua New Guinea (144 or 0.6 per cent) and East Timor (116 or 0.5 per cent).

The 2006 Census found the most inhabitants in Palmerston practice &#x27;no religion&#x27; (6,106 or 25.9 per cent), Catholicism (5,263 or 22.3 per cent), Anglican (3,561 or 15.1 per cent), Uniting Church (1,205 or 5.1 per cent) and Presbyterian and Reformed (419 or 1.8 per cent).

Palmerston&#x27;s population represents one quarter of the combined Palmerston-Darwin total population, and represents 11.7% of the Northern Territory&#x27;s population.

=== Population growth ===
Palmerston is one of the fastest-growing cities in Australia. Palmerston recorded the fastest increase of population of all the local government areas in the Northern Territory. Palmerston increased by 1,300 people, growing by 5 per cent. The fastest growth occurred within Palmerston which includes the suburbs of Farrar, Rosebery, Marlow Lagoon and Gunn and Palmerston City.

==Government==

The Palmerston region is covered by the Local Government Area of the City of Palmerston. The council was created in 1985. The council chambers are located in the Palmerston City Centre.

The Palmerston City Council (Incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the City of Palmerston which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The City of Palmerston has governed Palmerston since 1985. It is governed by a seven-member council comprising the mayor, deputy mayor and five aldermen. Unlike Darwin, the city is not divided into wards and all councillors are elected at-large. The current mayor of Palmerston is Athina Pascoe-Bell, who was elected in the local government election on 24 March 2018.

In territory politics, Palmerston is split between five Legislative Assembly districts. The districts of Blain, Brennan and Drysdale are entirely within the city. The district of Spillett is located mostly within Palmerston, but its area reaches up to eastern Darwin. The mostly rural district of Nelson spills into the city. Historically, Palmerston has been a bastion of conservatism, with Country Liberal Party candidates usually winning by wide margins. Labor never came remotely close to winning seats in Palmerston until 2005, when that year&#x27;s massive Labor landslide saw Labor take Brennan and Drysdale off the CLP. However, those seats reverted to form in the 2008 election.At the 2016 general election, however, Labor took Brennan and Drysdale off the CLP, while Blain fell to then-independent Terry Mills, a former CLP Chief Minister. The CLP, however, gained victories in Brennan and Nelson, while Labor retained Drysdale and Mills lost his seat of Blain to Labor&#x27;s Mark Turner at the 2020 election. Currently, Palmerston is represented by two Labor members and two CLP members.

In federal politics, most of Palmerston&#x27;s suburbs are located in the House of Representatives division shared with Darwin – the Division of Solomon, with the remaining suburbs in the city&#x27;s outskirts located within the Division of Lingiari.

The current members for the Division of Solomon and Lingiari are Labor members Luke Gosling and Warren Snowdon, respectively.

<doc id="287047" wikidata="Q273708" url="?curid=287047" title="François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)">
<text>François de La Rochefoucauld, 2nd [[Duke of La Rochefoucauld]], Prince de Marcillac (; ; 15 September 1613 – 17 March 1680) was an accomplished French moralist of the era of French Classical literature and author of &quot;Maximes&quot; and &quot;Memoirs&quot;, the only two works of his dense literary &quot;œuvre&quot; published. His &quot;Maximes&quot; portrays the callous nature of human conduct, with a cynical attitude towards putative virtue and avowals of affection, friendship, love, and loyalty. Leonard Tancock regards &quot;Maximes&quot; as &quot;one of the most deeply felt, most intensely lived texts in French literature&quot;, with his &quot;experience, his likes and dislikes, sufferings and petty spites ... crystallized into absolute truths.&quot;

Born in Paris in 1613, at a time when the royal court was vacillating between aiding the nobility and threatening it, he was considered an exemplar of the accomplished seventeenth-century nobleman. Until 1650, he bore the title of &quot;Prince de Marcillac&quot;. His great-grandfather François III, count de La Rochefoucauld, was killed in the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, being a Huguenot.

==Early life: 1613–1629==
François de La Rochefoucauld was born on September 15, 1613, at Rue des Petits Champs, in Paris&#x27;s 1st arrondissement neighborhood. La Rochefoucauld was given the education of a nobleman of his era, which concentrated on military exercises, hunting, court etiquette, elegance of expression and comportment, and a knowledge of the world. He was married at the age of fourteen to Andrée de Vivonne. Belonging to one of the most illustrious families of the French nobility, the young La Rochefoucauld, then prince of Marcillac, succeeded at the age of 16 (1 May 1629) to his uncle Benjamin de La Rochefoucauld, count of Estissac, as camp master of the Estissac regiment.

==Military career==
He joined the army the following year and almost immediately established himself as a public figure. He fought bravely in the annual campaigns, though his actions were never formally recognised.

Under the patronage of Madame de Chevreuse, whom he met at this time, the first of the three celebrated women who influenced his life, he joined the service of Queen Anne of Austria. In one of Madame de Chevreuse&#x27;s quarrels with Cardinal Richelieu and her husband, a scheme apparently was conceived by which La Rochefoucauld was to carry her off to Brussels on horseback. Other cabals against Richelieu once resulted in La Rochefoucauld being sentenced to eight days in the Bastille, and he was occasionally required to leave the Court, exiled to his father&#x27;s estates. In the power vacuum following Richelieu&#x27;s death in 1642, La Rochefoucauld, among others, took an active role in urging the queen and Condé to act together against Gaston, Duke of Orléans. However, the growing reputation of Mazarin impeded the ambition of the plotters, and La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s 1645 liaison with Duchess of Longueville made him irrevocably a &quot;frondeur&quot; (aristocratic rebel). He was a conspicuous figure in the 1649 siege of Paris, fought in many of the frequent military engagements, and was seriously wounded at the siege of Mardyke.

In the second &quot;Fronde&quot;, La Rochefoucauld allied himself with Condé. He used the occasion of his father&#x27;s funeral in 1650 to urge the attending provincial nobility to help him attack the royalist garrison of Saumur. In the battle of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, in 1652, he was shot through the head. It was feared that he would lose his sight, but he recovered after a year&#x27;s convalescence.

For some years thereafter, he retired to his country estate of Verteuil. Although his fortune had been much reduced, in time he was able to restore it somewhat, thanks chiefly to the fidelity of Gourville, who had been in his service and who, passing into the service of Mazarin and of Condé, had acquired both wealth and influence. La Rochefoucauld did not return to court life until just before Mazarin&#x27;s death, when Louis XIV was about to assume absolute power, and the aristocratic anarchy of the Fronde was over. He wrote his memoirs during this time, as did many of his prominent contemporaries.

==&quot;Salon&quot; participation==
Somewhat earlier, La Rochefoucauld had taken his place in the salon of Madeleine de Souvré, marquise de Sablé, a member of the Marquise de Rambouillet &quot;côterie&quot;, and the founder of a kind of successor to it, whose special literary work was the writing of &quot;Sentences&quot; and &quot;Maximes&quot;. In 1662, the Dutch firm House of Elzevir surreptitiously published what purported to be his memoirs, which brought him both trouble and fame. Many of his old friends were offended. These memoirs were not a faithful copy of what he had written, and while he hastened to deny their authenticity, this was not generally believed.

Three years later, in 1665, he anonymously published the &quot;Maximes&quot; (maxims), which established his position among the men of letters of the time. At about the same date, his friendship with Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, Comtesse de La Fayette, began, which lasted for the rest of his life. The glimpses which we have of him henceforward are chiefly from the letters of Madame de Sévigné, and though they show him suffering from gout, are on the whole pleasant ones.

He had a circle of devoted friends and was recognized as a top-ranking moralist and man of letters. His son, the Prince de Marcillac, to whom he gave his titles and honors in 1671, enjoyed a considerable position at court. But above all La Rochefoucauld was recognized by his contemporaries, including the king, as an exemplar of the older &quot;noblesse&quot;, the nobility that existed under the great monarch before the brilliance of his reign faded.
This reputation he has retained to the present day.

La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s ethical views have given rise to attacks upon his works by pious moralists of later eras. Like his contemporaries, he saw politics as a chessboard for powerful players, rather than as a struggle of ideologies or a means for achieving broad social goals. He appears to have been unusually scrupulous in his personal conduct, and his lack of success in the aristocratic struggles arose more from this than from anything else.

He died in Paris on 17 March 1680.

==Literary works==

His importance as a social and historical figure is overshadowed by his towering stature in French literature. His literary work consists of three parts—his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, the &quot;Maximes&quot;, and his letters.

The &quot;Memoirs&quot; are of high interest and literary merit. A book purporting to be La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s memoirs was published in the Dutch Republic whence, despite the author&#x27;s protest, it continued to be reprinted for some thirty years. It has now been proved to have been pieced together from the work of half a dozen men, with scarcely a third of it being La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s. Some years after La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s death, a new recension appeared, still largely adulterated but with some errors corrected. This work went unchallenged for more than a century. Only in 1817 did anything like a genuine, if still imperfect, edition appear.

However, the pithy, elegant &quot;Maximes&quot; (maxims) had no such fate. The author made frequent alterations and additions to them during his life and a few were added after his death. It is usual now to publish them in their totality of 504. The majority consist of just two or three lines, and hardly any exceed half a page. La Rochefoucauld reflects on the conduct and motives of mankind, from the point of view of a man of the world who intends not to sugar-coat his observations. In fact, in his introduction, he advises,

==Physical appearance==
La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s literary debut was his self-portrait: &quot;Portrait de La Rochefoucauld fait par lui-même&quot;, published in collection compiled in salon of Mademoiselle de Montpensier: &quot;Recueil des Portraits et éloges en vers et en prose&quot;.
==Marriage==

On 20 January 1628, at Mirebeau-sur-Bèze, he married Andrée de Vivonne (1612–1670) only daughter and heiress of André de Vivonne, Baron of la Chataigneraie, Grand Falconer of France and Marie Antoinette de Loménie.

==Influence==
Nearly all the great French critics of the 19th century wrote to some extent about La Rochefoucauld.

Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche greatly admired La Rochefoucauld and was influenced not only by his ethics, but also his style.

The editions of La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s &quot;Maximes&quot; (as the full title runs, &quot;Réflexions ou sentences et maximes morales&quot;) published in his lifetime bear the dates 1665 (&quot;editio princeps&quot;), 1666, 1671, 1675, 1678.

Previous editions were superseded by that of Jean Désiré Louis Gilbert and Jules Gourdault (1868–1883), in the series &quot;Grands Écrivains de la France&quot;, 3 vols.

A separate edition of the &quot;Maximes&quot; is the so-called &quot;Édition des bibliophiles&quot; (1870). See also the English translation of &quot;The Moral Maxims and Reflections of the Duke De La Rochefoucauld&quot; by George H. Powell (1903).

<doc id="287061" wikidata="Q199451" url="?curid=287061" title="Pagoda">
<text>A pagoda is a tiered tower with multiple eaves common to Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal, India, China, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other parts of Asia. Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most often Buddhist, but sometimes Taoist, and were often located in or near viharas. The pagoda traces its origins to the stupa, while its design was developed in ancient India. Chinese pagodas () are a traditional part of Chinese architecture. In addition to religious use, since ancient times Chinese pagodas have been praised for the spectacular views they offer, and many classical poems attest to the joy of scaling pagodas.

The oldest and tallest pagodas were built of wood, but most that survived were built of brick or stone. Some pagodas are solid with no interior. Hollow pagodas have no higher floors or rooms, but the interior often contains an altar or a smaller pagoda, as well as a series of staircases for the visitor to climb to see the view from an opening on one side of each tier. Most have between three and 13 tiers (almost always an odd number) and the classic gradual tiered eaves.

In some countries, the term may refer to other religious structures. In Vietnam and Cambodia, due to French translation, the English term &quot;pagoda&quot; is a more generic term referring to a place of worship, although &quot;pagoda&quot; is not an accurate word to describe a Buddhist vihāra. The architectural structure of the stupa has spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms specific to each region. Many Philippine bell towers are highly influenced by pagodas through Chinese workers hired by the Spaniards.
==Etymology==
One proposed etymology is from a South Chinese pronunciation of the term for an eight-cornered tower, , and reinforced by the name of a famous pagoda encountered by many early European visitors to China, the &quot;Pázhōu tǎ&quot; (), standing just south of Guangzhou at Whampoa Anchorage. Another proposed etymology is Persian &quot;butkada&quot;, from &quot;but&quot;, &quot;idol&quot; and &quot;kada&quot;, &quot;temple, dwelling.&quot;

Yet another etymology is from the Sinhala word &quot;dāgaba&quot;, derived from Sanskrit &quot;dhātugarbha&quot; or Pali &quot;dhātugabbha&quot;: &quot;relic womb/chamber&quot; or &quot;reliquary shrine&quot;, i.e. a stupa, by way of Portuguese.

==History==

The origin of the pagoda can be traced to the stupa (3rd century BCE). The stupa, a dome shaped monument, was used as a commemorative monument to house sacred relics and writings. In East Asia, the architecture of Chinese towers and Chinese pavilions blended into pagoda architecture, eventually also spreading to Southeast Asia. Their construction was popularized by the efforts of Buddhist missionaries, pilgrims, rulers, and ordinary devotees to honor Buddhist relics.

Japan has a total of 22 five-storied timber pagodas constructed before 1850.

===China===

The earliest styles of Chinese pagodas were square-base and circular-base, with octagonal-base towers emerging in the 5th–10th centuries. The highest Chinese pagoda from the pre-modern age is the Liaodi Pagoda of Kaiyuan Monastery, Dingxian, Hebei, completed in the year 1055 AD under Emperor Renzong of Song and standing at a total height of 84 m (275 ft). Although it no longer stands, the tallest pre-modern pagoda in Chinese history was the of Chang&#x27;an, built by Emperor Yang of Sui, and possibly the short-lived 6th century Yongning Pagoda (永宁宝塔) of Luoyang at roughly 137 metres. The tallest pre-modern pagoda still standing is the Liaodi Pagoda. In April 2007 a new wooden pagoda Tianning Temple of Changzhou was opened to the public, the tallest in China, standing 154 m (505 ft).

==Symbolism and geomancy==

Chinese iconography is noticeable in Chinese and other East Asian pagoda architectures. Also prominent is Buddhist iconography such as the image of the Shakyamuni and Gautama Buddha in the &quot;abhaya mudra.&quot; In an article on Buddhist elements in Han dynasty art, Wu Hung suggests that in these temples, Buddhist symbolism was fused with native Chinese traditions into a unique system of symbolism.

Some believed reverence at pagodas could bring luck to students taking the Chinese civil service examinations. When a pagoda of Yihuang County in Fuzhou collapsed in 1210, local inhabitants believed the disaster correlated with the recent failure of many exam candidates in the prefectural examinations The pagoda was rebuilt in 1223 and had a list inscribed on it of the recently successful examination candidates, in hopes that it would reverse the trend and win the county supernatural favor.

==Architecture==

Pagodas come in many different sizes, with taller ones often attracting lightning strikes, inspiring a tradition that the finial decoration of the top of the structure can seize demons. Today many pagodas have been fitted with wires making the finial into a lightning rod.

Wooden pagodas possess certain characteristics thought to resist earthquake damage. These include the friction damping and
sliding effect of the complex wooden dougong joints, the structural isolation of floors, the effects of wide eaves analogous to a balancing toy, and the Shinbashira phenomenon that the center column is bolted to the rest of the superstructure.

Pagodas traditionally have an odd number of levels, a notable exception being the eighteenth-century orientalist pagoda designed by Sir William Chambers at Kew Gardens in London.

The pagodas in Himalayas are derived from Newari architecture, very different from Chinese and Japanese styles.

==Construction materials==

===Wood===

During the Southern and Northern dynasties, pagodas were mostly built of wood, as were other ancient Chinese structures. Wooden pagodas are resistant to earthquakes, and no Japanese pagoda has been destroyed by an earthquake, but they are prone to fire, natural rot, and insect infestation.

Examples of wooden pagodas:
*White Horse Pagoda at White Horse Temple, Luoyang
*Futuci Pagoda in Xuzhou, built in the Three Kingdoms period (–265)
*Many of the pagodas in &quot;Stories About Buddhist Temples in Luoyang&quot;, a Northern Wei text

The literature of subsequent eras also provides evidence of the domination of wooden pagoda construction. The famous Tang dynasty poet, Du Mu, once wrote:
The oldest standing fully wooden pagoda in China today is the Pagoda of Fugong Temple in Ying County, Shanxi, built in the 11th century during the Song/Liao dynasty (see Song architecture).

===Transition to brick and stone===

During the Northern Wei and Sui dynasties (386–618) experiments began with the construction of brick and stone pagodas. Even at the end of the Sui, however, wood was still the most common material. For example, Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty (reigned 581–604) once issued a decree for all counties and prefectures to build pagodas to a set of standard designs, however since they were all built of wood none have survived. Only the Songyue Pagoda has survived, a circular-based pagoda built out of brick in 523 AD.

====Brick====
The earliest extant brick pagoda is the 40-metre-tall Songyue Pagoda in Dengfeng Country, Henan. This curved, circle-based pagoda was built in 523 during the Northern Wei dynasty, and has survived for 15 centuries. Much like the later pagodas found during the following Tang dynasty, this temple featured tiers of eaves encircling its frame, as well as a spire crowning the top. Its walls are 2.5 m thick, with a ground floor diameter of 10.6 m. Another early brick pagoda is the Sui dynasty Guoqing Pagoda built in 597.

====Stone====
The earliest large-scale stone pagoda is a Four Gates Pagoda at Licheng, Shandong, built in 611 during the Sui dynasty. Like the Songyue Pagoda, it also features a spire at its top, and is built in the pavilion style.

====Brick and stone====
One of the earliest brick and stone pagodas was a three-storey construction built in the (first) Jin dynasty (266–420), by Wang Jun of Xiangyang. However, it is now destroyed.

Brick and stone went on to dominate Tang, Song, Liao and Jin dynasty pagoda construction. An example is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (652 AD), built during the early Tang dynasty. The Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing has been one of the most famous brick and stone pagoda in China throughout history.
The Zhou dynasty started making the ancient pagodas about 3,500 years ago.
==De-emphasis over time==

Pagodas, in keeping with the tradition of the White Horse Temple, were generally placed in the center of temples until the Sui and Tang dynasties. During the Tang, the importance of the main hall was elevated and the pagoda was moved beside the hall, or out of the temple compound altogether. In the early Tang, Daoxuan wrote a &quot;Standard Design for Buddhist Temple Construction&quot; in which the main hall replaced the pagoda as the center of the temple.

The design of temples was also influenced by the use of traditional Chinese residences as shrines, after they were philanthropically donated by the wealthy or the pious. In such pre-configured spaces, building a central pagoda might not have been either desirable or possible.

In the Song dynasty (960–1279), the Chan (Zen) sect developed a new &#x27;seven part structure&#x27; for temples. The seven parts—the Buddha hall, dharma hall, monks&#x27; quarters, depository, gate, pure land hall and toilet facilities—completely exclude pagodas, and can be seen to represent the final triumph of the traditional Chinese palace/courtyard system over the original central-pagoda tradition established 1000 years earlier by the White Horse Temple in 67. Although they were built outside of the main temple itself, large pagodas in the tradition of the past were still built. This includes the two Ming dynasty pagodas of Famen Temple and the Chongwen Pagoda in Jingyang of Shaanxi.

A prominent, later example of converting a palace to a temple is Beijing&#x27;s Yonghe Temple, which was the residence of Yongzheng Emperor before he ascended the throne. It was donated for use as a lamasery after his death in 1735.

==Styles of eras==

===Han dynasty===
Examples of Han dynasty era tower architecture predating Buddhist influence and the full-fledged Chinese pagoda can be seen in the four pictures below. Michael Loewe writes that during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) period, multi-storied towers were erected for religious purposes, as astronomical observatories, as watchtowers, or as ornate buildings that were believed to attract the favor of spirits, deities, and immortals.
===Sui and Tang===
Pagodas built during the Sui and Tang dynasty usually had a square base, with a few exceptions such as the Daqin Pagoda:
===Dali kingdom===
===Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan===
Pagodas of the Five Dynasties, Northern and Southern Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties incorporated many new styles, with a greater emphasis on hexagonal and octagonal bases for pagodas:
===Ming and Qing===
Pagodas in the Ming and Qing dynasties generally inherited the styles of previous eras, although there were some minor variations:

<text>In Buddhism, a stupa (, ) is a mound-like or hemispherical structure containing relics (such as &quot;śarīra&quot; – typically the remains of Buddhist monks or nuns) that is used as a place of meditation.

Circumambulation, or &quot;pradakhshina&quot;, has been an important ritual and devotional practice in Buddhism since the earliest times, and stupas always have a &quot;pradakhshina&quot; path around them. The original South Asian form is a large solid dome above a tholobate, or drum, with vertical sides, which usually sits on a square base. There is no access to the inside of the structure. In large stupas, there may be walkways for circumambulation on top of the base as well as on the ground below it. Large stupas have, or had, &quot;vedikā&quot; railings outside the path around the base, often highly decorated with sculpture, especially at the torana gateways, of which there are usually four. At the top of the dome is a thin vertical element, with one or more horizontal discs spreading from it. These were &quot;chatra&quot;s, symbolic umbrellas, and have not survived, if not restored. The Great Stupa at Sanchi, Madhya Pradesh, is the most famous and best-preserved early stupa in India.

Apart from very large stupas, designed to attract pilgrims, there were large numbers of smaller stupas in a whole range of sizes, which typically had much taller drums, relative to the height of the dome. Small votive stupas paid for by pilgrims might be less than a metre high, and laid out in rows by the hundred, as at Ratnagiri, Odisha, India.

The principal design of the stupa may have been influenced by the &quot;shikharas&quot; seen on Hindu temples. As Buddhism spread across Asia, stupas were stylistically altered into other structural forms used for the same purposes, like the pagodas of East Asian Buddhism or the chortens of Tibetan Buddhism. In Southeast Asia, various different elongated shapes of dome evolved, leading to high, thin spires. A related architectural term is a &quot;chaitya&quot;, which is a prayer hall or temple containing a stupa.

==Description and history==


Stupas may have originated as pre-Buddhist tumuli in which śramaṇas were buried in a seated position, called caitya.

In early Buddhist inscriptions in India, &quot;stupa&quot; and &quot;caitya&quot; appear to be almost interchangeable, though &quot;caitya&quot; has a broader meaning, and unlike &quot;stupa&quot; does not define an architectural form. In pre-Buddhist India, &quot;caitya&quot; was a term for a shrine, sanctuary, or holy place in the landscape, generally outdoors, inhabited by, or sacred to, a particular deity. In the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, near the end of his life, the Buddha remarks to Ananda how beautiful are the various &quot;caitya&quot; around Vaishali. In later times and in other countries, cetiya/caitya implies the presence of important relics. Both words have forms prefixed by &quot;maha&quot; for &quot;great&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, or &quot;important&quot;, but scholars find the difference between a &quot;mahastupa&quot; and a &quot;stupa&quot;, or &quot;mahacetiya&quot; and &quot;cetiya&quot;, hard to pin down.

Some authors have suggested that stupas were derived from a wider cultural tradition from the Mediterranean to the Ganges Valley and can be related to the conical mounds on circular bases from the 8th century BCE that are found in Phrygia (tomb of Midas, 8th c. BCE), Lydia (tomb of Alyattes, 6th c. BCE), or in Phoenicia (tombs of Amrit, 5th c. BCE). Some authors suggest stupas emerged from megalithic mound burials with chambers, which likely represent proto-stupas.

Archaeologists in India have observed that a number of early Buddhist stupas or burials are found in the vicinity of much older, pre-historic burials, including megalithic burial sites. This includes sites associated with the Indus Valley Civilization, where broken Indus-era pottery was incorporated into later Buddhist burials. Scholars have noted structural and functional features of the stupa (including its general mound shape and the practice of surrounding stupas with a stone, relic chamber, or wooden railing) with both pre-Mauryan-era cairn and pre-historic megalithic &quot;round mound&quot; burials with chambers found in India, which likely represent a &quot;proto-stupa&quot;. In Dholavira, an archeological site associated with the Indus Valley Civilization, there are several large and high &quot;hemispherical monuments&quot; of tumulus with brick-masonry found with burial chambers inside. Among them, Tumulus-1 and Tumulus-2 mounds were excavated. They consist of a deep and wide rock-cut chamber, surrounded on the ground by a massive circular mud-brick structure made in two tiers, and filled in and topped with earth to form a domical shape. There is also evidence of plastering on the exterior of Tumulus-1, bearing a 10-
mm-thick plaster of pinkish-white clay over brick masonry. These forms of hemispherical monuments or tumulus of brick-masonry with similar layouts may have been inspirations for later stupas. Some stupas not believed to have been looted have been found empty when excavated, as have some pre-historic cairn sites, and animal bones are suspected to have occasionally been deposited at both types of sites.

===Mounds for the relics of the Buddha (5th century BCE)===


Religious buildings in the form of the Buddhist stupa, a dome-shaped structure, started to be used in India as commemorative monuments associated with storing sacred relics of the Buddha. After his parinirvana, Buddha&#x27;s remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight mounds, with two further mounds encasing the urn and the embers.

According to some early Buddhist sources, the Buddha himself had suggested this treatment, and when asked what a stupa was, had demonstrated the basic design: he folded his robe on the ground, placed his begging bowl upside down on it, with his staff above that.

The relics of the Buddha were spread between eight stupas, in Rajagriha, Vaishali, Kapilavastu, Allakappa, Ramagrama, Pava, Kushinagar, and Vethapida. Lars Fogelin has stated that the Relic Stupa of Vaishali  is likely the earliest archaeologically known stupa.

Guard rails—consisting of posts, crossbars, and a coping—became a feature of safety surrounding a stupa. The Buddha had left instructions about how to pay homage to the stupas: &quot;And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart, will reap benefits for a long time&quot;. This practice would lead to the decoration of the stupas with stone sculptures of flower garlands in the Classical period.

===Expansion under Ashoka (250 BCE)===
According to Buddhist tradition, Emperor Ashoka (rule: 273–232 BCE) recovered the relics of the Buddha from the earlier stupas (except from the Ramagrama stupa), and erected 84,000 stupas to distribute the relics across India. In effect, many stupas are thought to date originally from the time of Ashoka, such as Sanchi or Kesariya, where he also erected pillars with his inscriptions, and possibly Bharhut, Amaravati, or Dharmarajika. Ashoka also established the Pillars of Ashoka throughout his realm, generally next to Buddhist stupas.

The first known appearance of the word &quot;stupa&quot; is from an inscribed dedication by Ashoka on the Nigali Sagar pillar (spelled in Pali in the Brahmi script as 𑀣𑀼𑀩𑁂 &quot;thube&quot; ).

===Decorated stupas (from 125 BCE)===
Stupas were soon to be richly decorated with sculptural reliefs, following the first attempts at Sanchi Stupa No.2 (125 BCE). Full-fledged sculptural decorations and scenes of the life of the Buddha would soon follow at Bharhut (115 BCE), Bodh Gaya (60 BCE), Mathura (125–60 BCE), again at Sanchi for the elevation of the toranas (1st century BCE/CE), and then Amaravati (1st–2nd century CE). The decorative embellishment of stupas also underwent considerable development in the northwest, in the area of Gandhara, with instances such as the Butkara Stupa (&quot;monumentalized&quot; with Hellenistic decorative elements from the 2nd century BCE) or the Loriyan Tangai stupas (2nd century CE).

===Development in Gandhara (3rd century BCE–5th century CE)===


The stupa underwent major evolutions in the area of Gandhara. Since Buddhism spread to Central Asia, China, and ultimately Korea and Japan through Gandhara, the stylistic evolution of the Gandharan stupa was very influential in the later development of the stupa (and related artistic or architectural forms) in these areas. The Gandhara stupa followed several steps, generally moving towards more and more elevation and addition of decorative elements, leading eventually to the development of the pagoda tower. The main stupa types are, in chronological order:

# The Dharmarajika Stupa, with a near-Indian design of a semi-hemispheric stupa almost directly on the ground surface, probably dated to the 3rd century BCE. Similar stupas are the Butkara Stupa, the Manikyala stupa, or the Chakpat stupa.
# The Saidu Sharif Stupa, pillared and quincunxial, with a flight of stairs to a dome elevated on a square platform. Many Gandhara miniatures represent this type (1st century CE).
# The Loriyan Tangai stupa, with an elongated shape and many narrative reliefs, in many ways the classic Gandharan stupa (2nd century CE).
# The near-pyramidal Jaulian stupa (2nd century CE).
# The cruciform type, as in the Bhamala Stupa, with flights of stairs in the four cardinal directions (4th century CE).
# The towering design of the second Kanishka Stupa (4th–5th century CE).

====Origin of the pyramidal temple====
It is thought that the temple in the shape of a truncated pyramid may have derived from the design of the stepped stupas that developed in Gandhara. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is one such example, formed of a succession of steps with niches containing Buddha images, alternating with Greco-Roman pillars. The structure is crowned by the shape of a hemispherical stupa topped by finials, forming a logical elongation of the stepped Gandharan stupas such as those seen in Jaulian.

Although the current structure of the Mahabdhodi Temple dates to the Gupta period (5th century CE), the &quot;Plaque of Mahabhodi Temple&quot;, discovered in Kumrahar and dated to 150–200 CE, based on its dated Kharoshthi inscriptions and combined finds of Huvishka coins, suggests that the pyramidal structure already existed in the 2nd century CE. This is confirmed by archaeological excavations in Bodh Gaya.

This truncated pyramid design also marked the evolution from the aniconic stupa dedicated to the cult of relics, to the iconic temple with multiple images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. This design was influential in the development of later Hindu temples.

===Expansion in Asia===
====Asian stupas====

Stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it became prominent as a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. The Indian gateway arches, &quot;torana&quot;, reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism. Some scholars hold that &quot;torii&quot; derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of Sanchi (3rd century BCE–11th century CE). In Tibet, the stupa became the chorten, and the pagoda in East Asia. The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, &quot;stupa&quot; is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or Southeast Asia, while &quot;pagoda&quot; refers to a building in East Asia that can be entered and that may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as &quot;pagodas&quot;.

Stupas were built in Sri Lanka soon after Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura converted to Buddhism. The first was the Thuparamaya. Later, many more were built over the years, including the Jetavanaramaya in Anuradhapura.

====Development of the pagoda====
The Asian words for pagoda (&quot;tā&quot; in Chinese, &quot;t&#x27;ap&quot; in Korean, &quot;tháp&quot; in Vietnamese, &quot;tō&quot; in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the Pali word for stupa, &quot;thupa&quot;, with the Sanskrit pronunciation being &quot;stupa&quot;. In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second Kanishka Stupa (4th century), is thought to be the precursor of the tower stupas in Turkestan and the Chinese pagodas such as Songyue Pagoda (523 CE).

==Notable stupas==
The earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE. Some of the oldest known examples of stupas are found in Vaishali, Kushinagar, Piprahwa, Ramgram, Sanchi, Sarnath, Amaravati, and Bharhut.

With the top of its spire reaching in height, Phra Pathommachedi in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand is the tallest extant stupa in the world. The Swat Valley hosts a well-preserved stupa at Shingardar near Ghalegay; another stupa is located near Barikot and Dharmarajika-Taxila in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, the ancient city of Anuradhapura includes some of the tallest, most ancient, and best-preserved stupas in the world, such as Ruwanwelisaya.

The most elaborate stupa is the 8th-century Borobudur monument in Java, Indonesia. The upper rounded terrace, with rows of bell-shaped stupas, contain Buddha images symbolizing Arūpajhāna, the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas-relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of Gautama Buddha. Borobudur&#x27;s unique and significant architecture has been acknowledged by UNESCO as the largest Buddhist monument in the world. It is also the world&#x27;s largest Buddhist temple as well as one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.

A Jain stupa was excavated at Mathura in the 19th century.

The Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, is one of the largest stupas in the world.

===European stupas===
The Benalmádena Stupa is the tallest stupa in Europe. It is high and was inaugurated on 5 October 2003, the final project of Buddhist master Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche. Lopon Tsechu built his first stupa at Karma Guen near Málaga, in 1994, a symbol of peace and prosperity for Spain. He went on to build 16 more stupas in Europe before his death in 2003.

A stupa was built on the ground of the Kalachakra Kalapa Centre in southwest Styria, Austria, between 2000 and 2002.

A stupa based on the bell-shaped stupas at Borobudur is located at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, near Hemel Hempstead, in the UK.

===Types of stupas===
Built for a variety of reasons, Buddhist stupas are classified, based on form and function, into five types:
* Relic stupa, in which the relics or remains of the Buddha, his disciples, and lay saints are interred
* Object stupa, in which the items interred are objects that belonged to the Buddha or his disciples, such as a begging bowls or robes, or important Buddhist scriptures.
* Commemorative stupa, built to commemorate events in the lives of Buddha or his disciples
* Symbolic stupa, to symbolise aspects of Buddhist theology. For example, Borobudur is considered to be the symbol of &quot;the Three Worlds (&quot;dhatu&quot;) and the spiritual stages (&quot;bhumi&quot;) in a Mahayana &quot;bodhisattva&#x27;s&quot; character&quot;.
* Votive stupa, constructed to commemorate visits or to gain spiritual benefits, usually at the site of prominent stupas that are regularly visited.

==Symbolism==
&quot;The shape of the stupa represents the Buddha, crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion throne. His crown is the top of the spire; his head is the square at the spire&#x27;s base; his body is the vase shape; his legs are the four steps of the lower terrace; and the base is his throne.&quot;

===Five purified elements===
Although not described in any Tibetan text on stupa symbolism, the stupa may represent the five purified elements, according to Buddhism:
* The square base represents Earth.
* The hemispherical dome/vase represents water.
* The conical spire represents fire.
* The upper lotus parasol and the crescent moon represent air.
* The sun and the dissolving point represent wisdom.

==Construction==
To build a stupa, Dharma transmission and ceremonies known to a Buddhist teacher are necessary. The type of stupa to be constructed in a certain area is decided together with the teacher assisting in the construction. Sometimes the type chosen is directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.


===Treasury===
All stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called &quot;tsatsa&quot;s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. The creation of the &quot;tsatsa&quot;s is itself a ceremony. Mantras written on paper are made into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas. One layer of &quot;tsatsa&quot;s is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus-created new surface, another layer of &quot;tsatsa&quot;s is made, and so on, until the entire space of the treasury is full.

The number of &quot;tsatsa&quot;s required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the &quot;tsats&quot;a. For example, the Kalachakra stupa in southern Spain contains approximately 14,000 &quot;tsatsa&quot;s.

Jewellery and other &quot;precious&quot; objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price. It is believed that the more objects are placed in the stupa, the stronger its energy.

===Tree of Life===
An important element in every stupa is the &quot;Tree of Life&quot;. This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa. It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way, the stupa is charged and starts to function.

===Benefits===
Building a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive karmic imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action are said to result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits also result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one&#x27;s wishes are quickly fulfilled. On the absolute level, one will also be able to quickly reach enlightenment, the goal of Buddhism.

Destroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to murder. Such an action is said to create massive negative karmic imprints, leading to serious future problems. It is said this action leaves the mind in a state of paranoia after death has occurred, leading to unfortunate rebirths.

==Tibetan stupas==

Stupas in Tibet and Tibetan-influenced regions of the Himalayas, such as Bhutan, are usually called &quot;chorten&quot; in English, reflecting the term in the Tibetan language. There are eight different shapes of chortens in Tibetan Buddhism, each referring to a major event in the Buddha&#x27;s life. Chortens are often made as a set, placed in a row. The Tibetan set differs slightly (by two events) from the Indian set of Eight Great Events in the Life of Buddha.

===Lotus Blossom Stupa===
Also known as &quot;Stupa of Heaped Lotuses&quot;, or &quot;Birth of the Sugata Stupa&quot;, this stupa refers to the birth of Gautama Buddha. &quot;At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions&quot; (east, south, west, and north). In each direction, lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the brahmaviharas: love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.

===Enlightenment Stupa===
Also known as the &quot;Stupa of the Conquest of Mara&quot;, this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old Buddha&#x27;s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.

===Stupa of Many Doors===
This stupa is also known as the &quot;Stupa of Many Gates&quot;. After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near Sarnath. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the Four Noble Truths, the Six Pāramitās, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Twelve Nidānas.

===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===
At 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the Tuṣita Heaven, where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness, he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in Sankassa in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side, containing a triple ladder, or steps.

===Stupa of Great Miracles===
Also known as the &quot;Stupa of Conquest of the Tirthikas&quot;, this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered &quot;maras&quot; and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the Lichavi kingdom to commemorate the event.

===Stupa of Reconciliation===
This stupa commemorates the Buddha&#x27;s resolution of a dispute among the &quot;sangha&quot;. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of Magadha, where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.

===Stupa of Complete Victory===
This stupa commemorates Buddha&#x27;s successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.
===Stupa of Nirvana===
This stupa refers to the &quot;parinirvana&quot;, or death of the Buddha, when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.

==Kalachakra stupa==
A ninth kind of stupa exists, the Kalachakra stupa. Its symbolism is not connected to events in the Buddha&#x27;s life but instead to the symbolism of the Kalachakra Tantra, created to protect against negative energies.

<text>Don Estelle (22 May 1933 – 2 August 2003) was an English actor and singer, best known as Gunner &quot;Lofty&quot; Sugden in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;.

==Early life==
Born Ronald Edwards in Crumpsall, Manchester (historically part of Lancashire), he was brought up in a house on Russell Street in the area. During the Second World War, at the age of eight, he was evacuated to Darwen, Lancashire to escape the Manchester Blitz. It was there he found his voice as a boy soprano at the local Holy Trinity Parish Church, and on returning home after the war, he continued singing at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Crumpsall. He later joined a charity group, the Manchester Kentucky Minstrels, and with them, performed &quot;Granada&quot; in the 1954 talent show &quot;What Makes a Star?&quot; at BBC Radio&#x27;s northern studios in Manchester.

==Career==
Estelle gained experience by singing one song 12 times a week in the show &quot;The Backyard Kids&quot; at the Hulme Hippodrome in Manchester. He met the actor Windsor Davies in 1962 at the Garrick Theatre in London and the two men formed an act which toured theatres and clubs for four years. Estelle had small roles in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (playing a Pickfords removals man in one 1969, episode and an ARP warden called Gerald in three more in 1970). He eventually gained the role of Gunner &quot;Lofty&quot; Sugden in the sitcom &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot, Mum&quot;, which was first broadcast in January 1974 and ran until September 1981, reuniting him with Davies, whose sergeant major character often mocked Lofty in the storylines. The character was given the ironic nickname of Lofty because of Estelle&#x27;s stature.

Estelle had a powerful tenor voice, and achieved a number-one hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1975 with a semi-comic version of &quot;Whispering Grass&quot;, followed by a cover of &quot;Paper Doll&quot; which reached number 41, and a top ten LP, &quot;Sing Lofty&quot; (1976), all three recorded with Windsor Davies. Estelle also acted in the films &quot;Not Now, Comrade&quot; (1976) and &quot;A Private Function&quot; (1984), in addition to &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; (1985) alongside Melvyn Hayes, who also appeared in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;.

In the first series of &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, he made brief appearances in two episodes as Little Don, the keeper of the Roundabout Zoo, a zoo on a traffic island. In 2001, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Linda Smith&#x27;s A Brief History of Timewasting&quot; as Little Don of the East End Art Mafia.

In his autobiography, &quot;Sing, Lofty: Thoughts Of A Gemini&quot; (1999), Estelle was extremely bitter about modern-day entertainment producers, describing them as being &quot;tight-crutched, white-trousered morons&quot;. According to his obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;in recent years Estelle cut a slightly sorry figure, dressed in his &#x27;Lofty&#x27; outfit, setting out a stall of his tapes and singing to passers-by in shopping centres.&quot; He appeared as a &quot;dirty old man&quot; in the promotional video for &quot;The Sun&quot; Page Three Girl Jo Hicks&#x27;s single &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; in 2001 (based on the theme from &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;). Estelle produced a duo recording with Sir Cyril Smith, by then the former MP for Rochdale. The six-track CD, which included &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot;, was available by mail order in 1999.

== Final years ==
Estelle briefly moved to Christchurch, New Zealand, where he spent countless hours working with jazz/blues pianist Malcolm Bishop. According to Bishop, &quot;Lofty was clearly looking for someone to pass the figurative baton on to. He was extremely generous with time, his resources, and a shortbread that he loved made for him by a local friend. On the evening before Don returned to the UK I sat with him in his living room until after 4 am as he so passionately encouraged and advised me in my own career. Even though we had discussed business for after his return to New Zealand, part way through the evening I realised this would be the last time I would see my friend.

Beyond reuniting with family and friends, the reasons for Estelle&#x27;s UK visit were twofold. The BBC was filming a documentary on the history of British comedy and had requested interviews. He also needed a liver transplant, but he became too weak for doctors to operate. Estelle returned to the UK weeks before his death. He died in Rochdale Infirmary on 2 August 2003, and was buried in Rochdale with the oversized pith helmet he wore as Gunner &quot;Lofty&quot; Sugden. He was survived by his second wife, Elizabeth.

<doc id="287070" wikidata="Q243045" url="?curid=287070" title="Camilla Collett">
<text>Jacobine Camilla Collett (née Wergeland; 23 January 1813 – 6 March 1895) was a Norwegian writer, often referred to as the first Norwegian feminist. She was also the younger sister of Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland, and is recognized as being one of the first contributors to realism in Norwegian literature. Her younger brother was Major General Joseph Frantz Oscar Wergeland. She became an honorary member of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights when the association was founded in 1884.

== Life ==
Camilla was born in Kristiansand, Norway, the daughter of Nicolai Wergeland, a noted theologian, politician, and composer in his time, and Alette née Thaulow. Her brother, was the writer Henrik Wergeland. When Camilla was four, her family moved to Eidsvoll, where her father was made parish priest. Camilla grew up in a literary family, and she became a young diarist, in part because she found life in Eidsvoll dull. She spent most of her teenage years at a finishing school in Christiansfeld in Denmark.

During a visit to Kristiania she met and fell in love with the poet Johan Sebastian Welhaven, who was also her brother Henrik&#x27;s literary nemesis. Relations between the three were complicated and in time became legendary in Norwegian Romanticism. Collett was philosophically aligned with the Welhaven side of the debate, and her relationship with her brother may have been uneasy for some time. But there are indications that Camilla carried some resentment toward her father and brother over their opposition to her relationship with Welhaven. She also suffered from health problems during, and in the summer of 1834 her father took her to Paris to regain strength and recover her health.

In any event, her relationship with Welhaven eventually ended, and in 1841 she married Peter Jonas Collett, a prominent politician, literary critic, and member of the &quot;Intelligenspartiet&quot; (the Intelligence party). It was by all accounts a marriage born out of love and he was a supportive and understanding husband with whom Camilla could discuss any topic. She started writing for publication after she married Collett.
Her most famous work is her only novel, &quot;Amtmandens Døtre&quot; (The District Governor&#x27;s Daughters) which was published anonymously in two separate parts in 1854 and 1855. The book is considered one of the first political and social realism novels in Norway and deals with the difficulties of being a woman in a patriarchical society in general and forced marriages specifically. It is believed that her personal experiences in life, specifically her relationship with Welhaven, influenced the book. After this book, she wrote very little fiction, but did continue to write essays, polemics, and her memoirs.

Her literary models included female writers such as Rahel Varnhagen and George Sand, as well as Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Theodor Mundt. Her style represented a departure from her contemporaries, in that she preferred a more casual, natural tone.

In 1851, after ten years of marriage, her husband died suddenly. This left Camilla to raise four young sons. She was forced to sell her house and never managed to buy a new one again. Her three eldest sons were sent to be raised by relatives. She struggled with personal financial problems for the rest of her life. She died in Kristiania (Oslo) on 6 March 1895.

==Writing style and influences==

Collett was raised in a house that admired the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which would be a major influence on both Collett and her brother, Nicolai. At the beginning of writing &quot;Amtmandens Døtre&quot;, she found inspiration from George Sand, though she felt Sand&#x27;s ideas were too radical. In the novel, she discusses how young women and girls are deprived of training and education that will encourage them better life success, but she does not argue that women should pursue life and success independent of being married. Collett suggests that for the four daughters, marriage based on love and respect is the ultimate opportunity for a successful life. The book is considered to be &quot;sharply critical&quot; of the concepts of forced marriage and marriage that takes place for the sake of social conventions and popularity. She supports the idea of romantic love, and the freedom of women to make their own relationship choice(s), through personal emancipation.

The older Collett got, the more radical her own views became, becoming increasingly polemic. She supported social and political change to further women&#x27;s roles in society, and the articles that she published were published anonymously, but eventually published in a book of collected works. A stigma was attached to the idea of a woman writing the content and sharing the ideas she shared publicly, and this affected her career and her emotional state. Collett channeled this frustration into her writing, where she often examined that stigma. After the writing of &quot;Amtmandens Døtre&quot;, she focused largely on reviews and essays about literature, many of which solidified Collett as the first feminist literary critic in Norway. In these essays and opinion pieces, she declared the need for a new image for women and discarded the idea of women being reticent, and self-sacrificing in their lives.

Her work was cited by her contemporaries such as Henrik Ibsen.

<text>&quot;Monsieur&quot; Gaston, Duke of Orléans (Gaston Jean Baptiste; 24 April 1608 – 2 February 1660), was the third son of King Henry IV of France and his second wife, Marie de&#x27; Medici. As a son of the king, he was born a . He later acquired the title Duke of Orléans, by which he was generally known during his adulthood. As the eldest surviving brother of King Louis XIII, he was known at court by the traditional honorific Monsieur.

==Early life==
 Gaston Jean Baptiste was born at the Palace of Fontainebleau on 24 April 1608 and at birth was given the title of Duke of Anjou. As a child, he was raised under the supervision of the royal governess Françoise de Montglat. In 1626, at the time of his marriage to the young Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, he received in appanage (with their respective titles) the duchies of Orléans and Chartres, and the county of Blois. He had nominal command of the army which besieged La Rochelle in 1628, having already entered upon a course of political intrigue that would occupy the remainder of his life. He was the heir presumptive to the throne of France from the death of his brother Monsieur d&#x27;Orléans in 1611 until the birth of his elder brother&#x27;s first son in 1638.

On two occasions, he had to leave France for conspiring against the government of his brother and his Prime Minister Cardinal Richelieu. After waging an unsuccessful war in Languedoc leading to the Battle of Castelnaudary in 1632, he took refuge in Flanders. Reconciled with his brother Louis XIII, he plotted against Richelieu in 1635, fled from the country again, and then submitted to the King and the Cardinal.

Soon afterwards, the same process repeated itself. Orléans conspired with the marquis de Cinq-Mars to attempt Richelieu&#x27;s assassination, and then deserted his unfortunate accomplice (1642). In 1643, upon the death of Louis XIII, Gaston became lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and fought against Spain on the northern frontiers of France. He was created duc d&#x27;Alençon in 1646. During the wars of the Fronde (1648–1653), he demonstrated no particular loyalty to the crown and passed with great facility from one side to the other.

==Marriages==
 Gaston first married on 6 August 1626, at Nantes to Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, daughter and heiress of Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier. They had a daughter, Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier (29 May 1627 – 5 April 1693), called &quot;Mademoiselle de Montpensier&quot;, but later being best known as the &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot;.

Marie de Bourbon died six days after giving birth (4 June 1627), leaving her daughter the last of the line of the Montpensier line of the House of Bourbon.

While taking refuge from the wrath of Cardinal Richelieu in Lorraine, Gaston fell in love at first sight with Marguerite of Lorraine, the sister of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine. But as France and Lorraine were then enemies, he was refused the king&#x27;s permission to marry a sister of its duke. Nonetheless, Gaston fled again to Lorraine and, in a secret ceremony in the presence of her family at Nancy during the night of 2 – 3 January 1632, Gaston took the princess Marguerite as his wife. Because he had not obtained the prior permission of his elder brother, the king – one of his many acts of defiance – the couple could not appear at the French court and the marriage was kept secret.

But in November of that year, Henri II, Duke of Montmorency, on his way to the scaffold, betrayed Gaston, his former co-conspirator, and Louis XIII and Richelieu learnt of the elopement. The king had his brother&#x27;s marriage declared null and void by the Parlement of Paris in September 1634 and, despite the protest of Pope Urban VIII, the Assembly of the French clergy held in September 1635 that a &quot;prince du sang&quot; could enter matrimony only with permission of the king – consistent with French sovereignty and custom. Although Marguerite and Gaston had re-celebrated their marriage before the Archbishop of Malines, a French emissary persuaded the Pope not to protest the matter publicly, and Gaston formally accepted the annulment of his marriage. It was not until Louis XIII was on his deathbed in May 1643 that he accepted his brother&#x27;s plea for forgiveness and authorized his marriage to Marguerite, whereupon the couple undertook nuptials for the third time in July 1643 before the Archbishop of Paris at Meudon, and the Duke and Duchess of Orléans were finally received at court.

By right of her marriage, Marguerite became known as &quot;Madame&quot; at court. After the death of his mother in 1642, Gaston was bequeathed the Luxembourg Palace, which became the couple&#x27;s Parisian residence under the name &quot;Palais Orléans&quot; once they were restored to royal favour. They also sojourned at the Château de Blois, in the Loire Valley, where their first child was born in 1645.

Marguerite and Gaston d&#x27;Orléans had five children, of whom three daughters survived into adulthood:
*Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans (28 July 1645 – 17 September 1721) married Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and had issue-but line died out. 
*Élisabeth Marguerite d&#x27;Orléans (26 December 1646 – 17 March 1696) married Louis Joseph of Lorraine, Duke of Guise and had issue-but line died out. 
*Françoise Madeleine d&#x27;Orléans (13 October 1648 – 14 January 1664) married Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy but died childless. 
*Jean Gaston d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Valois (17 August 1650 – 10 August 1652) died in infancy. 
*Marie Anne d&#x27;Orléans (9 November 1652 – 17 August 1656) died in infancy.

Gaston had an illegitimate daughter by Marie Porcher:
*Marie &quot;bâtarde&quot; d&#x27;Orléans (1 January 1631, Paris – ?).

He also had an illegitimate son by Louise-Roger de La Marbelière:
*Louis &quot;bâtard&quot; d&#x27;Orléans, chevalier de Charny, (13 January 1638, Joué les Tours – 1692, Spain), later General under the service of Spain.

==Later life==
After the death of Gaston&#x27;s brother Louis XIII in 1643, his nephew Philippe, brother of the new king Louis XIV, became the new &quot;Monsieur&quot;. To differentiate the older &quot;Monsieur&quot; from the younger, Gaston, the uncle, was called &quot;Le Grand Monsieur&quot; and Philippe, the nephew, was called &quot;Le Petit Monsieur&quot;.

After the Fronde, Gaston was exiled by Cardinal Mazarin to Blois in 1652, and remained there until his death. All of his Orléans titles then went to his nephew, now the only &quot;Monsieur&quot;.

<text>Manfred Eigen (; 9 May 1927 – 6 February 2019) was a German biophysical chemist who won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work on measuring fast chemical reactions.

Eigen&#x27;s research helped solve major problems in physical chemistry and aided in the understanding of chemical processes that occur in living organisms.

In later years, he explored the biochemical roots of life and evolution. He worked to install a multidisciplinary program at the Max Planck Institute to study the underpinnings of life at the molecular level. His work was hailed for creating a new scientific and technological discipline: evolutionary biotechnology.

==Education and early life==
Eigen was born on 9 May 1927 in Bochum, the son of Ernst and Hedwig (Feld) Eigen, a chamber musician. As a child he developed a deep passion for music, and studied piano.

World War II interrupted his formal education. At age fifteen he was drafted into service in a German antiaircraft unit. He was captured by the Americans toward the end of the war. He managed to escape (he said later that escape was relatively easy), and walked hundreds of miles across defeated Germany, arriving in Göttingen in 1945. He lacked the necessary documentation for acceptance to university, but was admitted after he demonstrated his knowledge in an exam. He entered the university&#x27;s first postwar class.

Eigen desired to study physics, but since returning soldiers who were enrolled previously received priority, he enrolled in Geophysics. He earned an undergraduate degree and began graduate study in natural sciences. One of his advisors was Werner Heisenberg, the noted proponent of the uncertainty principle. He received his doctorate in 1951.

==Career and research==
Eigen received his Ph.D. at the University of Göttingen in 1951 under supervision of Arnold Eucken. In 1964 he presented the results of his research at a meeting of the Faraday Society in London. His findings demonstrated for the first time that it was possible to determine the rates of chemical reactions that occurred during time intervals as brief as a nanosecond.

Beginning in 1953 Eigen worked at the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry in Göttingen, becoming its director in 1964 and joining it with the Max Planck Institute for Spectroscopy to become the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. He was an honorary professor of the Braunschweig University of Technology. From 1982 to 1993, Eigen was president of the German National Merit Foundation. Eigen was a member of the Board of Sponsors of &quot;The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

In 1967, Eigen was awarded, along with Ronald George Wreyford Norrish and George Porter, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They were cited for their studies of extremely fast chemical reactions induced in response to very short pulses of energy.

In addition, Eigen&#x27;s name is linked with the theory of quasispecies, the error threshold, error catastrophe, Eigen&#x27;s paradox, and the chemical hypercycle, the cyclic linkage of reaction cycles as an explanation for the self-organization of prebiotic systems, which he described with Peter Schuster in 1977.

Eigen founded two biotechnology companies, &quot;Evotec&quot; and &quot;Direvo&quot;.

In 1981, Eigen became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

Eigen was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences even though he was an atheist. He died on 6 February 2019 at the age of 91.

==Personal life==
Eigen was married to Elfriede Müller. The union produced two children, a boy and a girl. He later married Ruthild Winkler-Oswatitsch, a longtime scientific partner.

==Honours and awards==
Eigen won numerous awards for his research including:
* Otto Hahn Prize (1962)
* Elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1964)
* Elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences (1966)
* Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1967), shared with Ronald George Wreyford Norrish and George Porter, for his studies on the kinetics of extremely fast running chemical reactions with relaxation methods 
* Elected a member of the American Philosophical Society (1968) 
* Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (now the Russian Academy of Sciences) (1976)
* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1973
* Pour le Mérite (1973)
* Faraday Lectureship Prize from the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1977

<text>An expatriate (often shortened to expat) is a person who resides outside their country of citizenship.

The term often refers to a professional, skilled worker, or student from an affluent country. However, it may also refer to retirees, artists and other individuals who have chosen to live outside their native country.

The International Organization for Migration of the United Nations defines the term as &#x27;a person who voluntarily renounces his or her nationality&#x27;. Historically, it also referred to exiles.

The UAE is the country with the highest percentage of expatriates in the world after the Vatican City, with expatriates in the United Arab Emirates representing 88% of the population.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;expatriate&quot; comes from the Latin words and .

==Semantics ==
Dictionary definitions for the current meaning of the word include:

:Expatriate:
:* &#x27;A person who lives outside their native country&#x27; (Oxford), or
:* &#x27;living in a foreign land&#x27; (Webster&#x27;s).

These definitions contrast with those of other words with the same meaning, such as:
:Migrant:
:* &#x27;A person who moves from one place to another in order to find work or better living conditions&#x27; (Oxford), or
:* &#x27;one that migrates: such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops&#x27; (Webster&#x27;s);
::::::or
:Immigrant
:* &#x27;A person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country&#x27; (Oxford), or
:* &#x27;one that immigrates: such as a person who comes to a country to take up permanent residence (Webster&#x27;s).

The varying use of these terms for different groups of foreigners can be seen as implying nuances about wealth, intended length of stay, perceived motives for moving, nationality, and even race. This has caused controversy, with some commentators asserting that the traditional use of the word &quot;expat&quot; has had racist connotations.

An older usage of the word &quot;expatriate&quot; referred to an exile. Alternatively, when used as a verbal noun, &quot;expatriation&quot; can mean the act of someone renouncing allegiance to their native country, as in the preamble to the United States Expatriation Act of 1868 which states: &#x27;the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&#x27;.

Some neologisms have been coined, including:
* &quot;dispatriate&quot;, an expatriate who intentionally distances themselves from their nation of origin;
*&quot;flexpatriate&quot;, an employee who often travels internationally for business (see &quot;Business expatriates&quot; below);
* &quot;&quot;, an employee sent from a foreign subsidiary to work in the country where a company has its headquarters;
* &quot;rex-pat&quot;, a repeat expatriate, often someone who has chosen to return to a foreign country after completing a work assignment;
* &quot;&quot;, an expatriate with the goal of short or long term sexual relationships (expatriate + sex tourist).

The term &quot;expatriate&quot; is sometimes misspelled as &quot;ex-patriot&quot;, which author Anu Garg has characterised as an example of an eggcorn.

In Canada someone who resides in a different province on a temporary basis while continuing to hold their home province&#x27;s residency is colloquially called an &quot;interprovincial expat&quot; as opposed to an &quot;interprovincial migrant&quot; who changes their residency and usually is intending to move permanently. For example British Columbia and Alberta allow each others residents to attend post secondary in the other province while retaining their home province&#x27;s residency.

==History==
===Types of expat community===

In the 19th century, travel became easier by way of steamship or train. People could more readily choose to live for several years in a foreign country, or be sent there by employers. The table below aims to show significant examples of expatriate communities which have developed since that time:


During the 1930s, Nazi Germany revoked the citizenship of many opponents, such as Albert Einstein, Oskar Maria Graf, Willy Brandt and Thomas Mann, often expatriating entire families.

Students who study in another country are not referred to as expatriates.

===Worldwide distribution of expats===
The number of expatriates in the world is difficult to determine, since there is no governmental census. Market research company Finaccord estimated the number to be 66.2 million in 2017.

In 2013, the United Nations estimated that 232 million people, or 3.2% of the world population, lived outside their home country.

As of 2019, according to the United Nations, the number of international migrants globally reached an estimated 272 million, or 3.5% of the world population.

==Business expatriates==
Some multinational corporations send employees to foreign countries to work in branch offices or subsidiaries. Expatriate employees allow a parent company to more closely control its foreign subsidiaries. They can also improve global coordination.

A 2007 study found the key drivers for expatriates to pursue international careers were: breadth of responsibilities, nature of the international environment (risk and challenge), high levels of autonomy of international posts, and cultural differences (rethinking old ways).

However, expatriate professionals and independent expatriate hires are often more expensive than local employees. Expatriate salaries are usually augmented with allowances to compensate for a higher cost of living or hardships associated with a foreign posting. Other expenses may need to be paid, such as health care, housing, or fees at an international school. There is also the cost of moving a family and their belongings. Another problem can be government restrictions in the foreign country.

Spouses may have trouble adjusting due to culture shock, loss of their usual social network, interruptions to their own career, and helping children cope with a new school. These are chief reasons given for foreign assignments ending early. However, a spouse can also act as a source of support for an expatriate professional. Families with children help to bridge the language and culture aspect of the host and home country, while the spouse plays a critical role in balancing the families integration into the culture. Some corporations have begun to include spouses earlier when making decisions about a foreign posting, and offer coaching or adjustment training before a family departs. Research suggests that tailoring pre-departure cross-cultural training and its specific relevance positively influence the fulfilment of expectations in expatriates&#x27; adjustment. According to the 2012 Global Relocation Trends Survey Report, 88 per cent of spouses resist a proposed move. The most common reasons for refusing an assignment are family concerns and the spouse&#x27;s career.

&quot;Expatriate failure&quot; is a term which has been coined for an employee returning prematurely to their home country, or resigning. About 7% of expatriates return early, but this figure does not include those who perform poorly while on assignment or resign entirely from a company. When asked the cost of a premature expatriate&#x27;s return, a survey of 57 multinational companies reported an average cost of about US$225,000.

=== Reasons and motivations for expatriation ===
People move abroad for many different reasons. An understanding of what makes people move is the first step in the expatriation process. People could be ‘pushed’ away as a reaction to specific socio-economic or political conditions in the home country, or ‘pulled’ towards a destination country because of better work opportunities/conditions. The ‘pull’ can also include personal preferences, such as climate, a better quality of life, or the fact that family/friends are living there.

For some people, moving abroad is a conscious, thoroughly planned decision, while for others it could be a ‘spur of the moment’, spontaneous decision. This decision, of course, is influenced by the individual&#x27;s geographic, socioeconomic and political environment; as well as their personal circumstances. The motivation for moving (or staying) abroad also gets adjusted with the different life changes the person experiences – for example, if they get married, have children, etc. Also, different personalities (or personality types) have diverse reactions to the challenges of adjusting to a host-country culture; and these reactions affect their motivations to continue (or not) living abroad.

In this era of international competition, it is important for companies, as well as for countries, to understand what is that motivates people to move to another country to work. Understanding expatriates&#x27; motivations for international mobility allows organisations to tailor work packages to match expatriates&#x27; expectations in order to attract and/or retain skilled workers from abroad.

===Recent trends===
Trends in recent years among business expatriates have included:
* Reluctance by employees to accept foreign assignments, due to spouses also having a career.
* Reluctance by multinational corporations to sponsor overseas assignments, due to increased sensitivity both to costs and to local cultures. It is common for an expat to cost at least three times more than a comparable local employee.
* Short-term assignments becoming more common. These are assignments of several months to a year which rarely require the expatriate family to move. They can include specific projects, technology transfer, or problem-solving tasks. In 2008, nearly two-thirds of international assignments consisted of long-term assignments (greater than one year, typically three years). In 2014, that number fell to just over half.
* &quot;Self-initiated expatriation&quot;, where individuals themselves arrange a contract to work overseas, rather than being sent by a parent company to a subsidiary. An &#x27;SIE&#x27; typically does not require as big a compensation package as does a traditional business expatriate. Also, spouses of SIEs are less reluctant to interrupt their own careers, at a time when dual-career issues are arguably shrinking the pool of willing expatriates.
* Local companies in emerging markets hiring Western managers directly.
* Commuter assignments which involve employees living in one country but travelling to another for work. This usually occurs on a weekly or biweekly rotation, with weekends spent at home.
* &quot;Flexpatriates&quot;, international business travellers who take a plethora of short trips to locations around the globe for negotiations, meetings, training and conferences. These assignments are usually of several weeks duration each. Their irregular nature can cause stress within a family.
*Consulting firm Mercer reported in 2017 that women made up only 14 per cent of the expatriate workforce globally.

The Munich-based paid expatriate networking platform InterNations conducts a survey of expat opinions and trends on a regular basis.

==Academic research==
There has been an increase in scholarly research into the field in recent years. For instance, Emerald Group Publishing in 2013 launched &quot;The Journal of Global Mobility: The home of expatriate management research&quot;.

S.K Canhilal and R.G. Shemueli suggest that successful expatriation is driven by a combination of individual, organizational, and context-related factors. Of these factors, the most significant have been outlined as: cross-cultural competences, spousal support, motivational questions, time of assignment, emotional competences, previous international experience, language fluency, social relational skills, cultural differences, and organizational recruitment and selection process.

==Literary and screen portrayals==

===Fiction===
Expatriate milieus have been the setting of many novels and short stories, often written by authors who spent years living abroad. The following is a list of notable works and authors, by approximate date of publication.

18th century : Persian Letters (French: Lettres persanes) is a literary work, published in 1721, by Montesquieu, relating the experiences of two fictional Persian noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who spend several years in France under Louis XIV and the Regency and who correspond with their respective friends staying at home.

1930s: Graham Greene was a keen traveller and another former spy, and from the 1930s to 1980s many of his novels and short stories dealt with Englishmen struggling to cope in exotic foreign places. &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; (1934), the last complete novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was about a glamorous American couple unravelling in the South of France. George Orwell drew heavily on his own experiences as a colonial policeman for his novel &quot;Burmese Days&quot; (1934). Evelyn Waugh satirised foreign correspondents in &quot;Scoop&quot; (1938).

1960s: English writer Paul Scott is best known for &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; (1965-1975) dealing with the final years of the British Empire in India. John le Carré made use of overseas settings for &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963) and many of his subsequent novels about British spies.

1970s: In &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1978), Christopher Koch portrayed the lead-up to a 1965 coup in Indonesia through the eyes of an Australian journalist and a British diplomat. &quot;A Cry in the Jungle Bar&quot; (1979) by Robert Drewe portrayed an Australian out of his depth while working for the UN in South-East Asia.

<doc id="287079" wikidata="Q273794" url="?curid=287079" title="Uttaradit province">
<text>Uttaradit (, ; Northern Thai:) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;). It lies in upper northern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from south clockwise) Phitsanulok, Sukhothai, Phrae and Nan. To the east it borders Xaignabouli of Laos. Uttaradit is 488 km north of Bangkok, and 238 km southeast of Chiang Mai.

==History==
Uttaradit means the &quot;port of the north&quot; or &quot;northern landing&quot;, as it was formerly a trade center on the Nan River.

In the Sukhothai era several city states (&quot;Mueang&quot;) subject to the king were in the area of the modern province. &quot;Mueang&quot; Fang was in modern-day Mueang Uttaradit district, &quot;Mueang&quot; Thung Yang in Laplae, and &quot;Mueang&quot; Ta Chuchok in Tron district.

During the Ayutthaya kingdom, &quot;Mueang&quot; Phichai was one of the 16 main &quot;Mueang&quot; of the Thai kingdom. In the reign of King Naresuan, the ruler of Phichai rebelled, joined by the ruler of the Sawankhalok region. Their revolt was suppressed and the inhabitants of both cities were forced to move south to Phitsanulok.

Following the fall of the city of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, Phichai was the site of several battles against the invaders. The ruler of Phichai succeeded in driving back the Burmese and was awarded the title Phraya Phichai Dap Hak - the &quot;Lord of Pichai with a Broken Sword&quot;, as he had broken one of his swords in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.

In the reign of King Rama III &quot;Mueang&quot; Phichai controlled several &quot;Mueang&quot; of northern Siam like Nan or Phrae, and even Luang Prabang and Vientiane. At the point where the Nan river became shallow a port was established. As this town grew in importance as an important trade point, in 1887 it was made a &quot;Mueang&quot; subordinate of Phichai. 1899 the center of Phichai was moved to this new location, which was renamed to Uttaradit in 1915.

==Geography==
The province is in the Nan River valley. About 45 kilometers north of the city of Uttaradit is the Queen Sirikit Dam, which created a 250 km2 artificial lake. The Phi Pan Nam Range reaches the northwest of the province.

Most of the province was once covered with teak forests, then the major product of Uttaradit. The largest teak tree in the world is found at the Ton Sak Yai Park in the Luang Prabang Range. The 1,500-year-old tree measures 9.87 m in circumference and 37 m in height. Originally it was 48.5 m high, but it was damaged in a storm. The total forest area is or 55.9 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are three national parks, along with seven other national parks, make up region 11 (Phitsanulok) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Lam Nam Nan National Park, 
* Ton Sak Yai National Park, 
* Phu Soi Dao National Park, 

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
There are a total of four wildlife sanctuaries, three of which are in region 11 (Phitsanulok) and Lam Nam Nan Fang Khwa Wildlife Sanctuary is in region 13 (Phrae) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Phu Miang–Phu Thong Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Mae Charim Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Nam Pat Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Lam Nam Nan Fang Khwa Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==Economy==
Uttaradit is largely an agricultural province. Among its best known crops are two fruits: durian and langsat. 
A durian festival is held each year around the beginning of June in Laplae District. The province is known for two varieties of durian which lack the usual, and to some people offensive, odour: &quot;Longlaplae&quot; and &quot;Linlaplae&quot;, both named after Laplae District. Durian production in Uttaradit province was estimated to be around 20,000 tonnes in 2012. The province has approximately 10,600 acres of durian orchards.

The &quot;langsat&quot; (ลางสาด) (&quot;Lansium parasiticum&quot;), for which Uttaradit is famous, and its thick-skinned sibling, &quot;longkong&quot; (ลองกอง), is a fruit that is similar in taste to the longan. A langsat festival is held each year around the middle to end of September.

==Health==
Uttaradit&#x27;s main hospital is Uttaradit Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the mondop at the temple Wat Phra Thaen Sila At, in Baan Phra Thaen in the Laplae district. The main item of worship in the temple is a laterite block, which is believed to have been used by Buddha to seek enlightenment. The mondhop is built upon this block.

The seal was first designed in 1940, later a garuda as the symbol of Thailand and the name of the province were added.

The provincial tree is the teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;). The largest teak tree in the world stands in Ton Sak Yai National Park (สักใหญ่). The tree, estimated to be more than 1,500 years old, is 37 meters high and has a circumference of 9.58 meters at its base. Although the upper part of the tree broke off in a storm, the trunk is still alive. Discovered in 1927, the giant teak tree is part of the 35 square kilometer park of mixed deciduous forest. The edible cyprinid fish &quot;Cyclocheilichthys enoplus&quot; is the provincial aquatic life.

==Transport==

Uttaradit is served by the Northern Line of the State Railway of Thailand. There are two stations in Uttaradit town: Uttaradit railway station, the main station and Sila At railway station, where it is a major centre for Northern Line operations. It does not have an airport. The nearest airport is in Phrae.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into nine districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). These are further divided into 67 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 562 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Uttaradit Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 26 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Uttaradit has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 25 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 53 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).
==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="287083" wikidata="Q231832" url="?curid=287083" title="Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier">
<text>Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier, (,  – ) known as La Grande Mademoiselle (, ), was the only daughter of Gaston d&#x27;Orléans with his first wife, Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier. One of the greatest heiresses in history, she died unmarried and childless, leaving her vast fortune to her cousin Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. After a string of proposals from various members of European ruling families, including Charles II of England, Afonso VI of Portugal, and Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy, she eventually fell in love with the courtier Antoine Nompar de Caumont and scandalised the court of France when she asked Louis XIV for permission to marry him, as such a union was viewed as a &quot;mésalliance&quot;. She is best remembered for her role in the &quot;Fronde&quot;, for bringing the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully to the king&#x27;s court, and for her &quot;Mémoires&quot;.

==Early years==

Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans was born at the Palais du Louvre in Paris on 29 May 1627. Her father was Gaston, Duke of Orléans; as the eldest surviving brother of King Louis XIII, he was known at court by the traditional honorific Monsieur. Her mother, 21-year-old Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, was the only surviving member of the Montpensier branch of the House of Bourbon. When she died five days after giving birth, she left the newborn Anne Marie, the new Duchess of Montpensier, heiress to an immense fortune which included five duchies, the Dauphinate of Auvergne, and the sovereign Principality of Dombes, found in the historical province of Burgundy.

As the eldest daughter of &quot;Monsieur&quot;, Anne Marie Louise was officially known as &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; from the time of her birth, and, because she was the granddaughter of a King of France, Henry IV, her uncle Louis XIII created for her the new title of &quot;Petite-Fille de France&quot; (&quot;Granddaughter of France&quot;).

Mademoiselle was moved from the Louvre to the Palais des Tuileries and placed under the care of Madame de Saint Georges, the governess of royal children, who taught her how to read and write. Mademoiselle always had a great sense of self-importance and when asked about her maternal grandmother Henriette Catherine de Joyeuse she replied that she was not her grandmother, because her grandmother was &quot;not a queen&quot;. She grew up in the company of Mademoiselle de Longueville, as well as the sisters of the &quot;Maréchal de Gramont&quot;.

 Mademoiselle was very close to her father Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Gaston was involved in multiple conspiracies against Louis XIII and his chief advisor Cardinal Richelieu, and generally on bad terms with the court. When Gaston fell in love with Marguerite of Lorraine, Louis XIII refused to give his brother permission to marry— France and Lorraine were enemies, and a prince of the blood and heir to the throne was not legally allowed to marry without the king&#x27;s permission. Nonetheless, Gaston secretly married Marguerite in January 1632. When Louis found out, he had the marriage annulled and the couple exiled from court.

As a child, Mademoiselle lived with her governess at the Palais des Tuileries. Gaston resided at Blois, where Mademoiselle visited him frequently. After his secret marriage, Mademoiselle did not see her father for two years. When she finally did see him again in October 1634, the seven-year-old Mademoiselle &quot;flung herself into his arms&quot;. After learning that Cardinal Richelieu, her godfather, was behind her father&#x27;s exile, Mademoiselle would sing street songs and lampoons in the presence of the cardinal himself, earning her a scolding from the cardinal.

At the birth of the future Louis XIV in September 1638, the determined Mademoiselle decided that she would marry him, calling him &quot;her little husband&quot; to the amusement of Louis XIII. Richelieu subsequently reprimanded her for her remarks. Her father on the other hand wanted her to marry Louis, Count of Soissons, a descendant of Charles, Duke of Vendôme, one of his old co-conspirators. The marriage never materialised.

When Mademoiselle&#x27;s governess, Madame de Saint Georges, died in 1643, Mademoiselle&#x27;s father chose Madame de Fiesque as her replacement. Mademoiselle was devastated at the death of her former governess and, not keen on having a new governess, was an awkward student; she later recalled that she once locked Madame de Fiesque in her room and Madame de Fiesque&#x27;s grandson in another.

On his deathbed in May 1643, Louis XIII finally accepted Gaston&#x27;s plea for forgiveness and authorized his marriage to Marguerite; the couple were married in July 1643 before the Archbishop of Paris and, as the Duke and Duchess of Orléans, were finally received at court.

Louis XIII&#x27;s death left Louis XIV (then 4 years old) as King of France, and Louis XIII&#x27;s widow Queen Anne as regent during her son&#x27;s minority. When the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III died in May 1646, Mademoiselle considered marriage to Ferdinand, but the regent, Queen Anne, under the influence of Mazarin, ignored Mademoiselle&#x27;s pleas. Louis XIV (then 8 years old) and his younger brother, Philippe, Duke of Anjou (then 6 years old) were too young to be married. Queen Anne suggested her brother, Cardinal Ferdinand of Austria, but Mademoiselle declined. The &quot;wealthiest single princess of Europe&quot; was left without suitable marriage prospects.

==Fronde==
One of the key areas of the life of Mademoiselle was her involvement in the period of French history known as the &quot;Fronde&quot;, a civil war in France marked by two distinct phases known as the &quot;Fronde Parlementaire&quot; (1648–1649) and the &quot;Fronde des nobles&quot; (1650–1653). The former was precipitated by a tax levied on judicial officers of the Parlement of Paris that was met with a refusal to pay and the emergence of Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (future &quot;Grand Condé&quot;), as a rebel figure who took the city of Paris by siege. The influence of Cardinal Mazarin was also opposed.

At the Peace of Rueil of 1 April 1649, the Fronde Parlementaire ended, and the court returned to Paris in August amid great celebration. Mademoiselle caught smallpox, but survived the illness. Having convalesced, Mademoiselle befriended Claire Clémence de Brézé, &quot;Madame la Princesse&quot;, the unwanted wife of the &quot;Grand Condé&quot;. The pair sojourned in Bordeaux, where Mademoiselle was involved in the peace which ended the siege in the city in October 1650. Her role in the matter made her look like a &quot;frondeuse&quot; in the eyes of Queen Anne.

Even in uncertain times, the possibility of a marriage between Mademoiselle and the Prince of Condé arose when Claire Clémence became critically ill with erysipelas. Mademoiselle considered the proposal, as she would still have maintained her rank as one of the most important females at court, and her father had a good relationship with Condé. These plans failed, however, when Claire Clémence recovered.

In 1652, there was another Fronde, this time involving the Princes of the Blood. Mazarin was in exile and was not recalled until October 1653. The city of Orléans, Mademoiselle&#x27;s namesake and the capital of her father&#x27;s duchy, wanted to stay neutral in the civil war; the magistrates of the city had seen what the war had done to the nearby area of Blaisons and wanted to avoid the same fate. The city requested the input of Mademoiselle&#x27;s father in order to avoid being pillaged. Gaston was undecided and Mademoiselle took it upon herself to go to Orléans to represent her father and put an end to the troubles. Travelling via Artenay, Mademoiselle was informed that the city would not receive her because she and the king were on different sides, referring to Mademoiselle&#x27;s dislike for Mazarin.

When Mademoiselle arrived at Orléans, the city gates were locked and the city refused to open them. She shouted that they should open the gates, but was ignored. An approaching boatman offered to row her to the Porte de La Faux, a gate on the river. Mademoiselle got onboard &quot;climbing like a cat&quot; and &quot;jumping over the hedge&quot; in order not to hurt herself and climbed through a gap in the gate. She entered the city and was greeted triumphantly, being carried through the streets of Orléans on a chair for all to see. She later said that she had never been &quot;in so entrancing a situation&quot;.

Staying for five weeks, she became attached, calling it &quot;my town&quot;, before returning to Paris in May 1652. Paris was once again under a state of panic on the eve of the Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine; Mademoiselle, in order to allow the Prince of Condé into the city, which was controlled by Turenne, fired from the Bastille on the army of Turenne on 2 July 1652. Mazarin remarked &quot;with that cannon, Mademoiselle has shot her husband.&quot;

==Exile==

Fearing for her life, Mademoiselle fled Paris for the safety of her residence at Saint-Fargeau. She remained in exile until 1657 when she was welcomed to the court once again. She went with Madame de Fiesque and Madame de Frontenac, wife of the future Governor General of New France.

Having never been to Saint-Fargeau before, she was unaware of the state of the building and thus stayed at a small residence in Dannery having been received by the bailiff of her estates. Convinced to return to Saint-Fargeau, she settled into her home for the next four years and soon began to improve the building under the direction of François Le Vau, brother of the renowned architect Louis Le Vau.

Le Vau redid the exteriors of Saint-Fargeau at a cost of 200,000 livres. They were lost in a fire in 1752 and suffered further damage in 1850, thus all evidence of the appearance of Mademoiselle&#x27;s residence was lost. Despite being an exile, she still visited her father at Blois. While at Saint-Fargeau, she dabbled in writing and wrote a small biography under the title of &quot;Madame de Fouquerolles&quot; despite her bad spelling and grammar. Mademoiselle looked to her financial affairs, which had been under her father&#x27;s management. Having reached her majority in 1652 it was discovered that her father had not been entirely honest with the management of her finances and that was the reason for her 800,000 livres of debt. At the same time her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Guise, tricked Mademoiselle into signing away money to her under false pretences. Her father was involved with this, which caused her relationship with Gaston to deteriorate. In 1656, hearing that her father had been excused for his various scandals, Mademoiselle herself said she would forget the bad blood caused by his financial misdemeanours and resumed her close relationship with him.

===Return to court and family life===

When her father was welcomed back to court, it paved the way for Mademoiselle. She left for Sedan, Ardennes, where the court was established in July 1657. Having not seen any of her family for some five years, she was greeted with forgiveness and the added compliment that her &quot;looks had improved&quot;, according to Queen Anne.

In a pen portrait of herself executed later the same year, she noted how she was neither &quot;fat nor thin&quot; and &quot;looked healthy; my bosom is fairly well formed; my hands and arms not beautiful, but the skin is good...&quot;. The same year, she met Christina of Sweden, who had arrived in France in July 1656. The two ladies met at Essonne where they watched a ballet together. Mademoiselle later exclaimed that Christina &quot;surprised me very much. [...] She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature&quot;.

At court, her cousins Louis XIV and Philippe, Duke of Anjou were nineteen and seventeen, respectively. Mademoiselle&#x27;s part in the Fronde had ruined her dream of becoming Louis&#x27;s consort, but the Duke of Anjou briefly courted her. Despite toying with the idea, Mademoiselle was put off by the Duke&#x27;s immaturity, saying that he always stayed near his mother as if he was &quot;like a child&quot;.

Mademoiselle fell ill in Paris during September 1657, when she bought the Château d&#x27;Eu from Mademoiselle de Guise (her maternal aunt) at the end of her illness before returning to her beloved Saint-Fargeau for Christmas.

In February 1660, Gaston died of a stroke at Blois. As his eldest daughter Mademoiselle was his principal heiress, and Gaston left her a considerable fortune that added to her already vast personal wealth. As a result of her mourning her father, Mademoiselle was only allowed to go to the formal marriage between Louis and his new spouse Maria Theresa of Austria; however, Mademoiselle did go to the proxy ceremony incognito, fooling no one. The next marriage at court was between Philippe, the Duke of Orléans, known as Monsieur, and Princess Henrietta of England (youngest child of Queen Henrietta Maria and the dead Charles I of England) on 31 March 1661. Mademoiselle was in attendance with various other members of the court.

Philippe and Henrietta formed a stormy couple. Philippe was an overt bisexual and openly lived with his male lovers at the Palais Royal, much to the dislike of Henrietta. In retaliation, she openly flirted with Louis XIV as well as seduced Philippe&#x27;s own lover the comte de Guiche. Mademoiselle was the godmother of Philippe and Henrietta&#x27;s youngest child, the Mademoiselle de Valois, born in 1670. Once again at Henrietta&#x27;s death in 1670, Louis XIV asked if Mademoiselle wanted to fill &quot;the vacant place&quot; that had been left by Henrietta, a suggestion she declined.

Mademoiselle and her younger half-sister Marguerite Louise enjoyed a close relationship. The two would go to the theatre and attend Mademoiselle&#x27;s &quot;salon&quot;.

Marguerite Louise later asked her to sort out arrangements when the Grand Prince of Tuscany proposed an alliance in 1658. Mademoiselle was asked to ensure its fulfilment, a previous proposal from the Duke of Savoy having failed.

Initially overjoyed at the prospect of marrying, Marguerite Louise&#x27;s ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered Mademoiselle no longer favoured the Tuscan match. After this, Marguerite Louise&#x27;s behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her proxy marriage did nothing to change her attitude and she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by Mademoiselle herself.

In 1663, Louis XIV again approached Mademoiselle with a possible match for her. The intended bridegroom was Alfonso VI of Portugal, who acceded to the Portuguese throne in 1656. The proud Mademoiselle ignored the idea, saying she would rather stay in France with her vast income and estates and that she did not want a husband who was rumoured to be alcoholic, impotent and paralytic. Alfonso instead married Marie Françoise of Savoy.

An angry Louis thus ordered her to return to Saint-Fargeau for having disobeyed him. This &quot;exile&quot; lasted roughly a year and during it she began to make repairs to the Château d&#x27;Eu, and started writing her memoirs. Appealing to Louis regarding her health, she was allowed to return to court, whereupon Louis proposed that she marry Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, who had previously married Mademoiselle&#x27;s younger half-sister Françoise Madeleine. Mademoiselle seemed very keen on the match, but Charles Emmanuel II was not, and he made various excuses to avoid it. This proposal was to be the last for &quot;la Grande Mademoiselle&quot;.

==Lauzun and later years==

Away from court in 1666, Mademoiselle regretted not being present at the entertainments organised at the Château de Fontainebleau in honour of Queen Marie Thérèse that summer. At the entertainments was a man called Antoine Nompar de Caumont, later Duke of Lauzun, an impoverished nobleman from Guyenne. Close to the king, he was renowned for his wit as well as his evident &quot;sex appeal&quot;, despite being &quot;the smallest man God ever made&quot;. He was also a distinguished soldier and was part of the marriage negotiations between Louis XIV and Queen Marie Thérèse. Very opinionated and &quot;louche&quot;, Lauzun once saw Mademoiselle wearing a red ribbon in her hair and declared it too &quot;youthful&quot; for her, to which the proud Mademoiselle replied &quot;people of my rank are always young&quot;.

Before long, Mademoiselle fell hopelessly in love with Lauzun. In December 1670, the most senior female at the court (behind Madame Royale, the only legitimate daughter of Louis XIV) she asked Louis XIV&#x27;s permission to marry Lauzun. Louis consented, to the astonishment of his court and much to the dislike of Queen Marie Thérèse, Monsieur and various members of the court. The Queen and Monsieur refused to sign the marriage contract. The date for the ceremony was set to occur at the Louvre on Sunday, 21 December 1670. Lauzun even asked Louis&#x27;s mistress Madame de Montespan to help convince the king to submit to the match. Mademoiselle was in high spirits later, stating that the days from 15 to 18 December 1670 were the happiest days of her life. She referred to Lauzun as &quot;Monsieur le duc de Montpensier&quot; to her friends.

The joy was not to last; under pressure from a disapproving court, Louis XIV reversed his decision, and the engagement was called off on 18 December stating that it would damage his reputation. Mademoiselle was asked to have an interview with the king and Madame de Montespan. The former informed her of his decision, to which she responded, &quot;what cruelty..!&quot; Louis replied that &quot;kings must please the public&quot; and ruined Mademoiselle&#x27;s hopes of marriage on that &quot;unhappy Thursday&quot;, as she later called it.

Mademoiselle secluded herself in her apartments and did not reappear until the beginning of 1671, when she was informed of the arrest of Lauzun without an official reason released. He was taken to the Bastille and then the Pignerol fortress, where he remained until 1681 despite making several attempts to escape.

Determined to get Lauzun freed, Mademoiselle devoted herself to his interests and approached Madame de Montespan to try to encourage the king to release him. The release came at a cost; she would have to sell two of her most profitable lands: the principality of Dombes and the County of Eu. These titles would be given to Louis Auguste de Bourbon, &quot;Légitimé de France&quot;, Duke of Maine, eldest and favourite son of Louis and Montespan. Capitulating on 2 February 1681, Mademoiselle sold the lands, both of which had a great personal attachment to her. Unknown to Mademoiselle, she was only buying Lauzun&#x27;s release and the right for him to live on her estates as an exile.

Lauzun was freed on 22 April 1681 and obliged to live quietly at Bourbon before returning to Paris, but not the court, rather at the Hôtel de Lauzun, in March 1682. Prior to the death of Queen Marie Thérèse in July 1683, the couple had been on bad terms when they again came together temporarily in their grief. Soon after the two had an interview, the last time they would ever see each other before Mademoiselle retired to her Parisian residence, the Palais du Luxembourg.

===Death and burial===

Mademoiselle fell ill on 15 March 1693 with what appears to have been stoppage of the bladder. Lauzun asked to see her, but due to her pride, Mademoiselle refused to admit him. She died at the Palais du Luxembourg in Paris on Sunday, 5 April 1693. As a &quot;Granddaughter of France&quot;, the title she treasured so much, she was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside Paris on 19 April. At her funeral, according to Saint-Simon, she was noted as being &quot;the wealthiest single princess of Europe&quot;. Lying in state, the urn containing her entrails exploded mid-ceremony, which caused chaos as people fled to avoid the smell. Eventually, the ceremony continued with the conclusion of it being &quot;[...] another jest at the expense of Mademoiselle&quot;.

<text>Myra Breckinridge is a 1968 satirical novel by Gore Vidal written in the form of a diary. Described by the critic Dennis Altman as &quot;part of a major cultural assault on the assumed norms of gender and sexuality which swept the western world in the late 1960s and early 1970s&quot;, the book&#x27;s major themes are feminism, transsexuality, American expressions of machismo and patriarchy, and deviant sexual practices, as filtered through an aggressively camp sensibility. The controversial book is also &quot;the first instance of a novel in which the main character undergoes a clinical sex-change&quot;. Set in Hollywood in the 1960s, the novel also contains candid and irreverent glimpses into the machinations within the film industry.

&quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; was dismissed by some of the era&#x27;s more conservative critics as pornographic at the time of its first publication in February 1968; nevertheless, the novel immediately became a worldwide bestseller and has since come to be considered a classic in some circles. &quot;It is tempting to argue that Vidal said more to subvert the dominant rules of sex and gender in &quot;Myra&quot; than is contained in a shelf of queer theory treatises&quot;, wrote Dennis Altman. Critic Harold Bloom cites the novel as a canonical work in his book &quot;The Western Canon&quot;. Vidal called &quot;Myra&quot; the favorite of his books, and published a sequel, &quot;Myron&quot;, in 1974.

The novel was adapted into a 1970 film of the same name, which was panned. Vidal disowned the film, calling it &quot;an awful joke&quot;.

In his 1995 memoir &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, Vidal said the voice of Myra may have been inspired by the &quot;megalomania&quot; of Anaïs Nin&#x27;s diaries. Indeed, the story is told through increasingly erratic entries in Myra&#x27;s own personal diary and recordings on events given by Buck Loner.

==Plot==
A beautiful young woman, Myra Breckinridge is a film enthusiast with a special interest in the Golden Age of Hollywood—in particular the 1940s—and the writings of film critic Parker Tyler. In her notebook, she declares her mission is to “re-create the sexes and thus save the human race from certain extinction.” She comes to the Academy for Aspiring Young Actors and Actresses in Los Angeles, owned by her deceased husband Myron&#x27;s uncle, Buck Loner, a former cowboy actor and current lecher. Myra’s purpose in visiting Buck is to claim her mother-in-law Gertrude’s share of the property, left jointly to Buck and Gertrude by their father when it was an undeveloped orange grove, and through Myron’s will transmitted to her. The property is now worth $2 million. Intending to stall her as long as possible, Buck declares his lawyers will look into the matter; in the meantime, he offers Myra work at the Academy teaching the Empathy and Posture classes.

Myra proves radically popular with the students, while soon becoming a thorn in Buck’s side. At a student’s party, after &quot;mixing gin and marijuana&quot;, Myra gets &quot;stoned out of her head&quot; and suffers visions before passing out in a bathroom. Myra attends an orgy arranged by a student. She intends only to observe but suffers a &quot;rude intrusion&quot; by a member of the band The Four Skins, from which she derives a perverse, masochistic enjoyment. 

Out of an obscure desire to be avenged on the male sex for the indignities suffered by Myron during his long period of homosexuality, Myra preys upon a student named Rusty Godowski, a muscular ex-footballer, and ultimately anally violates him with a strap on. The rape causes Rusty’s relationship with Mary-Ann, his girlfriend and fellow student (whom Myra has taken under her wing), to deteriorate. The two break up, and Rusty begins a relationship with Letitia Van Allen, a casting agent who has sex with the male clients she represents. Rusty, previously a gentle lover, has been transformed by his assault at Myra’s hands into a violent and brutish sex partner, to Letitia’s great delight. Myra’s lesbian overtures to Mary-Ann, conversely, are continually frustrated.

Meanwhile, in a meeting in Buck’s office his lawyers produce a trump card: no death certificate exists for Myron Breckinridge in New York, and if he is not dead his will has no legal bearing. At this juncture, Myra stands and reveals her vaginoplasty scars, disclosing that she and Myron are the same person and that she is thus entitled to Gertrude’s share of the property. Frightened, disgusted and sickened, Buck concedes defeat, privately commenting that if he could get away with murdering her he would.

Soon after her triumph, Myra is severely injured in a hit-and-run car accident, and while she is comatose in hospital her breast implants are removed. Upon discovering this when her plaster casts are taken off, Myra attempts suicide. The novel ends with a time-skip to three years in the future; Myra is now living as Myron and is married to Mary-Ann; the two have found moderate success in showbiz, and Myron wonders how he could ever have held such grandiose aspirations.
==Writing==
Vidal first contemplated writing &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; as a sketch for the risqué revue &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; but quickly decided to develop the story into a novel. He wrote the first draft in Rome over the course of a month. About two weeks into writing the novel, Vidal decided to make Myra transgender. The name &quot;Breckinridge&quot; was taken from Bunny Breckinridge, an associate of director Ed Wood, and a stage performer whose openly gay, flamboyantly transgressive life partly inspired Vidal&#x27;s novel.

==Analysis==
According to critic Robert F. Kiernan, &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; explores the mutability of gender-role and sexual-orientation as being social constructs established by social mores. The first novel whose main character undergoes a clinical sex-change, it was praised by Edmund Miller as &quot;a brilliantly chosen image for satire of contemporary mores.&quot; Arnie Kantrowitz called the titular character a &quot;comic surrogate [who] looks at life from both sides&quot; and &quot;wields a wicked dildo in her war against gender roles&quot;. Joseph Cady wrote that the novel &quot;skewers conventional American sexuality&quot;.

<text>Françoise Bertaut de Motteville ( – 1689) was a French memoir writer.

==Biography==
She was the daughter of Pierre Bertaut, a gentleman of the king&#x27;s chamber, and niece of the bishop-poet Jean Bertaut.

Her mother, a Spaniard, was the friend and private secretary of Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII. At the age of seven Françoise was also made a member of the queen&#x27;s household and given a pension. The influence of Richelieu, however, who wished to separate the queen from her Spanish connections, exiled mother and daughter to Normandy, where in 1639 the young girl was married to Nicolas Langlois, seigneur de Motteville, president of the &quot;Chambre des Comptes&quot; of Rouen.

He died two years later at the age of eighty-two, and in 1642 the queen summoned Mme de Motteville to court, being now her own mistress by the death of Richelieu and Louis XIII. Through all the intrigues and troubles of the Fronde Mme de Motteville preserved the honourable reputation of being devoted to her mistress without any party ties or interests.

Some letters of hers are preserved, especially a curious correspondence with Anne, Duchess of Montpensier &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot; on marriage, but her chief work is her &quot;Mémoires&quot;, which are in effect a history of Anne of Austria, written briefly till the date of Mme de Motteville&#x27;s return to court, and then with fullness. They give a faithful picture of the life of the court at that time.

The best edition of her &quot;Mémoires&quot; is that of M. F. Riaux (2nd ed., Paris, 1891, 4 vols.), containing the essay by Sainte-Beuve from vol. v. of his &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;. The &quot;Mémoires&quot; were translated into English in 1726 and again by KP Wormeley in 3 vols., 1902. For details concerning her family see &quot;Recherches sur Madame de Motteville et sur sa famille&quot;, by Charles de Beaurepaire (Rouen, 1900).

<text>The Quantel Paintbox was a dedicated computer graphics workstation for composition of broadcast television video and graphics. Produced by the British production equipment manufacturer Quantel (which, via a series of mergers, is now part of Grass Valley), its design emphasized the studio workflow efficiency required for live news production.

At a price of $250,000 () per unit, they were used primarily by large TV networks such as NBC, while in the UK, Peter Claridge&#x27;s company CAL Videographics was the first commercial company to purchase one.

Following its initial launch in 1981, the Paintbox revolutionised the production of television graphics.

== History ==
Artist Martin Holbrook worked with Quantel&#x27;s development team to develop the artist-oriented functionality and user interface, which remained virtually unchanged throughout the life of the product; their Patented pressure-sensitive pen and tablet elevated it from a computer into a real artist&#x27;s tool.

The real time, broadcast quality, 24-bit Quantel &quot;Paint Box&quot; as it was then known, was launched at NAB in Las Vegas in May 1981. The PAL &quot;DPB-7001&quot; and the NTSC &quot;DPB-7000&quot;, were literally just digital paint machines, with stencils/layers introduced nine months later, and font and text functions implemented by Pepper Howard in 1983. The hardware was readily-available off-the-shelf components, supported by Programmable Array Logic ICs which were custom-programmed by Quantel. Combining the latest hardware, custom software which had solved usable digital paint issues and an artist-friendly familiar way of creating artwork that required no computer knowledge meant that the Paintbox was an instant success. The Paintbox became the global industry standard digital studio and image manipulation tool for the next fifteen years, bringing digital art and graphics onto everyone&#x27;s TV screens.

The second generation V-Series Paintbox was released in 1989 as a modernized and more compact and affordable model; with internal hardware improvements, better tablet, upgraded keyboard and a cordless stylus. Prices started at $80,000 ().

In 1985, Quantel found a way to vastly increase the framestore capacity, enabling them to create a high resolution print quality Paintbox, which revolutionized the photo manipulation industry five years before Photoshop was introduced and led to Quantel&#x27;s high-profile lawsuit against Adobe for using the Paintbox&#x27;s patented features. In the late 1980s, Quantel filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Spaceward Graphics for creating the Matisse system, which was marketed as a cheaper version of the Paintbox. They won the case against Spaceward at the High Court in London in 1990, but lost the case against Adobe in 1997, who were able to demonstrate that Richard Shoup&#x27;s Superpaint (1973) had introduced particular features before Quantel&#x27;s Paintbox. Though Adobe didn&#x27;t yet exist as a company when Paintbox was launched, demonstrating prior use to the court meant that Quantel&#x27;s Patents became invalid and the case was thrown out by the judge in Adobe&#x27;s home state of Delaware.

A Paintbox was usually integrated into Quantel&#x27;s editing systems, especially the Quantel Henry, and later Quantel Editbox.

In contrast to the earlier DPB-7000 series machines, the V-series made extensive use of Altera CPLD and FPGA ICs, which integrated much of the complex SSI logic into a smaller number of ICs. Some versions of the V-series hardware refined the design further by moving the CPLD and FPGA logic into &quot;hard-copy&quot; ASICs, which were manufactured by Orbit Semiconductor.

In 2002, the &quot;generationQ&quot; series of products introduced the last stand-alone Paintbox and the QPaintbox software for PCs. Eventually, &quot;Paintbox&quot; became a feature of Quantel&#x27;s other, more powerful editing, media management and post-production products.

In 2005, Quantel updated their line of x86-based workstations (with Paintbox and Paintbox gQ models, and a software-only version of QPaintbox). They also released their new Quantel Editbox.

Despite becoming the industry standard TV graphics and post production computer with hundreds sold around the world, Quantel lost all its market share against cheaper systems and software. There are just fifteen V-Series models and only five original DPB versions known to still exist, one of which is being restored to working order.

== Paintbox and Art ==
Quantel invested heavily in art, employing a hundred digital artists by the late 1980s to improve and demonstrate the Paintbox features. Graphic Paintbox was used to create the posters for &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, and record covers for Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, and the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;. &quot;The Miracle&quot;, rock band Queen&#x27;s studio album, was designed by Richard Gray and created by Richard Baker.

The first company in France to buy a Paintbox, Computer Video Film, were funded by Jack Lang at the French Ministry of Culture to create the 1985 short film Six Peintres Sur Ordinateur but it was most famously used by David Hockney, who created his first digital art on a Paintbox in June 1985, then Richard Hamilton, Howard Hodgkin, Larry Rivers, Sidney Nolan and Jennifer Bartlett in 1986 to create original digital artwork for the groundbreaking 1987 BBC series &quot;Painting with Light&quot;.

Quantel also gave three Paintbox systems to three art schools in the UK in the mid-1980s, including Blackpool College where it was used extensively by artist Adrian Wilson to create digital images, including the James album cover for Gold Mother. Two of Wilson&#x27;s Paintbox pieces were included in the pioneering &quot;Art &amp; Computers&quot; exhibition at the Cleveland Art Gallery, England, September 1988 and he was sponsored by Quantel, who used his images for the cover of the Graphic Paintbox sales brochure. One recipient, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art had recently appointed the video artist Stephen Partridge as a lecturer who then established (1984) The Television Workshop to support artists and filmmakers&#x27; production and access to high-level broadcast technology. Over 400 productions were supported in this way from 1984 to 1992 until desktop video pre-empted the need. Artists and filmmakers using the workshop included Richard Morrison, Jeff Keen, Robert Cahen, Tamara Krikorian, Pictorial Heroes, Judith Goddard and many others.

The music video for Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; was created on a Bosch FGS-4000 3D animation system using a Quantel Paintbox for backgrounds and textures.

Graphics for &quot;Disney Sing-Along Songs&quot; were also created on a Paintbox.

To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Quantel in 2023, Adrian Wilson curated an exhibition of Paintbox Art for the Computer Arts Society, with the exhibition and catalogue designed by Kim Mannes-Abbot, whose image appears on the front cover of the 1994 &quot;Paintboxed!&quot; book.

<text>DSB, an abbreviation of &quot;Danske Statsbaner&quot; (, &quot;Danish State Railways&quot;), is the largest Danish train operating company, and the largest in Scandinavia. While DSB is responsible for passenger train operation on most of the Danish railways, goods transport and railway maintenance are outside its scope. DSB runs a commuter rail system, called the S-train, in the area around the Danish capital, Copenhagen, that connects the different areas and suburbs in the greater metropolitan area. Between 2010 and 2017, DSB operated trains in Sweden.

DSB was founded in 1885, when the state-owned companies &quot;De jysk-fynske Statsbaner&quot; and &quot;De sjællandske Statsbaner&quot; merged. DSB was established in 1885, after the state in 1867 under the name De Jutland-Fynske Statsbaner took over the private company Det Danske Jernbanedriftselskab and in 1880 they also took over the privately owned Zealand Railway Company. 
==History==
The first railways in Denmark were built and operated by private companies. The railways in Funen and Jutland were built by Peto and Betts who also supplied the locomotives (built by Canada Works, Birkenhead). Most of the technical staff was also recruited from Britain, notably from the Eastern Counties Railway. When Peto and Betts went into insolvency, the Danish state took over &quot;Det danske Jernbane-Driftsselskab&quot; (The Danish Railway Operating Company) as of 1 September 1867 under the name &quot;De jysk-fyenske Jernbaner&quot; (the Funen and Jutland Railways), from 1874 &quot;De danske Statsbaner i Jylland og Fyn&quot; (The Danish State Railways in Jutland and Funen). The network was extended by new construction and by acquisition of the privately operated lines from Silkeborg to Herning (1 November 1879) and from Grenaa to Randers and Aarhus (1 April 1881).

The Danish state took over &quot;Det sjællandske Jernbaneselskab&quot; (the &quot;Zealand Railway Company&quot;) on 1 January 1880, forming &quot;De sjællandske Statsbaner&quot; (the State Railways of Zealand). With the majority of railways on both sides of the Great Belt thus owned by the Danish state, it was not until 1 October 1885 that the companies of Jutland/Funen and Zealand merged into one national railway company, &quot;De danske Statsbaner&quot; (the Danish State Railways), the merger being finalised on 1 April 1893.

After the merger, new lines were constructed and a new generation of rolling stock and locomotives were introduced by chief mechanical engineer Otto Busse. After Busse&#x27;s retirement, however, DSB ceased to design its own locomotives and increasingly came to rely on outside suppliers, mainly Borsig of Berlin.

The 1930s were a decade of innovation and modernisation for DSB. New railway bridges were built across the Little Belt (1935), the Storstrøm (1937) and Oddesund (1938), eliminating the costly and time-consuming process of transfer by steam ferry. The suburban lines in and around Copenhagen were electrified for multiple-unit operation at 1,500 Volts DC (&quot;S-trains&quot;). Early experiments with Diesel propulsion led to the development of the all-purpose MO class heavy diesel-electric railcar equipped for multiple-unit operation, after World War II also fitted for push-pull operation with a driving trailer. Several classes of mainline diesel-electric locomotives were also built as prototypes by Burmeister and Wain of Copenhagen and Frichs of Aarhus, but further development was cut short by the German occupation and the consequent shortage of oil supplies, forcing DSB to rely on coal-burning steam locomotives for mainline duties.

Coinciding with the opening of the Little Belt Bridge in 1935, DSB introduced their new express train concept known as &quot;lyntog&quot; (&quot;lightning trains&quot;). These diesel-powered three- and four-coach trains, having a power car at each end with a power pack identical to that of the MO railcar series, featured a then-impressive top speed of 120 km/h as well as a high level of comfort, and they proved themselves DSB&#x27;s most commercially successful initiative of the 1930s.

World War II left DSB with a fleet of outdated and worn-out trains, and apart from a series of second-generation MO railcars and the class MT multi-purpose centercab engines built by Frichs, domestic industry was unable to provide the kind of motive power required. Instead, DSB looked to foreign suppliers.

General Motors&#x27; diesel-electric locomotives had proved themselves in the US and Canada before the war. DSB&#x27;s MV class A1A-A1A diesel locomotives, built on license from GM and delivered from NOHAB starting in 1954, were found to be very reliable and economically feasible compared to the steam locomotives, eventually putting the age of steam to an end as well as being a decisive factor in DSB&#x27;s choice of motive power for nearly three decades. They were followed by the equally successful MX class with a lower axle load for branch line services and the MZ class for heavy express services.

Based on three diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives built by Henschel and acquired by DSB, Frichs developed their own version of the class MH shunter, which replaced the steam-powered shunting engines. After the success of the Deutsche Bundesbahn&#x27;s DB Class VT 11.5 class on Trans Europ Express services, DSB acquired eleven power cars and matching intermediate cars to replace the first-generation &quot;lyntog&quot;.

The 1960s were marked by an increasingly poor economy for DSB, leading to a steady staff reduction throughout the decade. However, this was also accompanied by the appearance of new technology, notably the utilisation of electronic equipment, improving the safety and efficiency of DSB&#x27;s railway traffic. In 1972, along with the celebration of the 125th anniversary of railways in Denmark, DSB introduced a new corporate design by architect Jens Nielsen, inspired by British Rail and Canadian National Railways, with red as the dominant colour (with engine rooms of locomotives painted black), replacing the traditional maroon livery with yellow winged wheel symbols. DSB&#x27;s position was additionally strengthened by the 1973 oil crisis.

Following the lead of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, British Rail and Deutsche Bundesbahn, DSB in 1974 introduced a fixed interval timetable for its long-distance locomotive-hauled Intercity trains as well as the commuter services to and from Copenhagen. On regional services in Funen and Jutland, the prewar design MO class railcars were displaced by MR class DMUs, a licensed version of the Deutsche Bundesbahn class 628.
In 1990, after a delay of several years, the IC3 trains came into use, initially as &quot;lyntog&quot;, and in 1991 as ordinary intercity trains. The IC3 trains, being a specimen of the Flexliner type of multiple units, have a distinct appearance due to the rubber-framed ends, allowing access between trainsets when coupled together. The re-engined Flexliners are now (2014) nearing the end of their service life, but due to problems with the Ansaldo Breda built successor class IC4 they are expected to remain in service for another five to ten years.

The Great Belt Fixed Link was opened for railway traffic in 1997 (a year before road traffic), replacing DSB&#x27;s railway ferries. In 1997, infrastructural duties were branched off into a new agency under the Danish Ministry of Transport, Banestyrelsen (now: Banedanmark), leaving DSB with the task of train operation. A new design was presented on 30 April 1998, as well as the announcement of the &quot;Good Trains for All&quot; plan, seeking to replace old and less comfortable trains by 2006/2007. DSB was turned into an independent public corporation on 1 January 1999.

The goods department of DSB, DSB Gods, was merged with Railion (now DB Cargo) in 2001, and DSB now solely manages passenger rail service, including the operation of railway stations. In 2003, Arriva, in competition with DSB, won the tender for operating a number of regional railway services in Jutland: Tønder-Esbjerg, Esbjerg-Struer, Skjern-Aarhus, Struer-Langå-Aarhus and Struer-Thisted. In 2007, the Øresundståg services were hived off into a separate company, DSBFirst, but the contract was terminated in 2011 after financial problems.

DSB operated services from 2009 in Sweden. In 2010, it purchased a 50 % shareholding in German operator Vias from Frankfurt Transport Company. All the operating companies in Sweden and Germany were sold between 2013 and 2019.

==Logo history==
==Corporate structure==

DSB is an independent public state-owned corporation under the Danish Ministry of Transport and Energy. This has been the case since 1999, and is the result of a former political desire to privatise the Danish railways. Thus, DSB now operates on a for-profit basis, although it retains certain public service commitments via contracts with the Ministry of Transport and Energy. In March 2015, the ongoing privatization process was put on hold until at least 2024, as part of a broad centre-left political majority agreement on passenger rail-transport.

As of 2005, DSB employs about 9,000 people. Keld Sengeløv became president and CEO in February 2004, after a career in the DSB organization since 1997, but died from an undisclosed illness while travelling with friends in Scotland on 3 September 2006. His successor was Søren Eriksen, who was dismissed in March 2011 following the discovery of financial and contractual irregularities. He was largely exonerated in a subsequent inquiry. His successor, Jesper Lok, was announced in December 2011 and took office in April 2012, but resigned in 2014. Since 2015, former fighter pilot Flemming Jensen has been CEO for the corporation.

==Services==

As an originally state-owned company, DSB has experienced several reforms since its establishment in 1885. In particular, the large scale privatization reforms of Denmark in the 1990s, has resulted in the selling and outsourcing of many railway lines and services across the country.

DSB currently operates several types of passenger trains, varying in number of stops and motive power. Apart from the S-trains, types available for the general public include:
* Regional trains (RØ in Eastern Denmark, RV in Western Denmark; ØR in the Øresund Region)
* Inter-regional trains (IR)
* InterCity trains (IC)
* InterCityLyn (L) (express InterCity trains)
* InterCityLyn Nonstop (IL) (IntercityLyn calling at fewer stations)
* EuroCity trains (EC)

<text>Jean Bertaut (1552 – 8 June 1611), French poet, was born at Caen.

==Life==
He figures with Philippe Desportes in the disdainful couplet of Boileau on Ronsard:

&quot;&quot;Ce poëte orgueilleux, trébuché de si haut,&quot;
&quot;Rendit plus retenus Desportes et Bertaut.&quot;&quot;

He wrote light verse to celebrate the incidents of court life in the manner of Desportes, but his verse is more fantastic and fuller of conceits than his master&#x27;s. He early entered the church, and had a share in the conversion of Henry IV, a circumstance which assured his career. He was successively councillor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Grenoble, secretary to the king, almoner to Marie de&#x27; Medici, abbot of the of Aunay-sur-Odon and finally, in 1606, bishop of Sées. 

After his elevation to the bishopric he ceased to produce the light verse in which he excelled, though his scruples did not prevent him from preparing a new edition of his &quot;Recueil de quelques vers amoureux&quot; (1602) in 1606. The serious poems in which he celebrated the public events of his later years are dull and lifeless. Bertaut died at Sées on 8 June 1611. His works were edited by Adolphe Chenevière in 1891.
