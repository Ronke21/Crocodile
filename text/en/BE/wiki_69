<text>David Joel Stern (September 22, 1942 – January 1, 2020) was an American lawyer and business executive who was the commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1984 to 2014. Stern oversaw NBA basketball&#x27;s growth into one of the world&#x27;s most popular sports during the 1990s and 2000s. He is credited with developing and broadening the NBA&#x27;s audience, especially internationally by setting up training camps, playing exhibition games, and recruiting more international players. In addition, with Stern&#x27;s guidance the NBA opened 12 offices in cities outside the United States, and broadcast to over 200 territories in over 40 languages. Stern also helped found the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association and the NBA G League, the NBA&#x27;s development league. Under Stern, the NBA launched their digital presence with NBA.com, NBA TV, and NBA League Pass. He also established the NBA&#x27;s social responsibility program, NBA Cares.

Stern started with the NBA in 1966 as an outside counsel, then joined the NBA in 1978 as general counsel and became the league&#x27;s executive vice president in 1980. He became commissioner in 1984, succeeding Larry O&#x27;Brien. After 30 years, Stern retired in 2014 as the longest-tenured commissioner in the history of major North American sports leagues (though his record has since been broken). He was succeeded by Adam Silver. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and FIBA Hall of Fame. Stern was on the Rutgers University Board of Overseers, a Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center and chair of JALC&#x27;s Marketing Committee, and was a Chair Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of Columbia University. He was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Early life==
David Stern was born in Manhattan, New York City, one of three children of Anna (née Bronstein, 1918–1990) and William Stern (1918–1980), a Jewish family. He grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey, and his father ran a Jewish delicatessen in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Stern grew up a New York Knicks fan, considered Carl Braun his hero, and attended games at Madison Square Garden with his father. He played basketball briefly in adulthood before sustaining a serious right knee injury during a New York Lawyers League game.

After graduating from Teaneck High School in 1959, Stern went to Rutgers University, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and graduated in 1963 with a B.A. in history. He then attended Columbia Law School, receiving a J.D. in 1966.

==National Basketball Association==
===Early work===
After graduating from law school, Stern joined the law firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn (now Proskauer Rose), which has long represented the NBA. He was the lead attorney representing the firm in the case of &quot;Robertson v. National Basketball Association&quot;, the landmark lawsuit brought against the NBA by star player Oscar Robertson. Stern helped the league negotiate a settlement that allowed the NBA/ABA merger to proceed in return for the NBA abolishing the &quot;option&quot; clause in its uniform player contract and allowing players to become free agents for the first time.

In 1978, Stern left Proskauer Rose to become the NBA&#x27;s general counsel under Commissioner Larry O&#x27;Brien. By 1980, O&#x27;Brien promoted Stern to be the NBA&#x27;s executive vice president for business and legal affairs, which made Stern &quot;de facto&quot; in charge of marketing, television, and public relations for the league. During this time, Stern largely drove two landmark agreements with the NBA Players&#x27; Association: drug testing and team salary cap. An August 1980 report by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; had estimated that 40 to 75 percent of NBA players used cocaine. The drug testing policy dealt with the perception that the NBA had a drug problem, which it admitted, and it was cleaning it up. The NBA was the first of the major sports leagues in North America to implement a drug testing policy. The salary cap created a revenue-sharing system where owner and player were effectively partners, with players receiving 53 percent of all revenues. Both of these agreements solidified Stern&#x27;s standing inside NBA circles.

===NBA Commissioner===
On February 1, 1984, Stern became the Commissioner of the NBA, succeeding O&#x27;Brien during the league&#x27;s recovery from its darkest period. Instead of marketing the league&#x27;s teams, he changed the focus to its star players, such as Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley from the 1984 NBA draft, which was held soon after Stern took office. Jordan&#x27;s arrival, in particular, ushered in a new era of commercial bounty for the NBA. With him came his flair and talent for the game, and that brought in shoe contracts from Nike which helped to give the league even more national attention.

Stern guided the league through dwindling viewership en route to global growth. In his first year as commissioner, Stern offered Adrian Paenza, a South American basketball and soccer analyst, and the Argentina Channel 9 the rights to air weekly NBA highlights for $2,000 a year. In 1987, he started the shipping of VHS tapes from his New York office to China&#x27;s state-run television station to expand the league&#x27;s reach beyond North America. Stern pushed to allow NBA players to participate in international tournaments, contributing to the creation of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, which begat the first wave of international NBA stars.

One of the Dream Team members was Johnson. A year earlier, he announced that he was HIV-positive and retiring from basketball in a press conference with Stern sitting by his side. At the time, the public was afraid of HIV and the disease was demonized. Some people feared it could be transmitted by sweat or a handshake. Despite backlash, Stern allowed Johnson to play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game and later for the Dream Team. Having read medical literature and consulted experts, Stern helped inform league owners, players, sponsors and the public about the virus. The NBA put infection-control procedures in place; previously, players were allowed to play while bleeding.

In 1995, the NBA expanded into Canada, introducing the Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies to the league. During Stern&#x27;s tenure, a total of seven new franchises (the Hornets, Timberwolves, Heat, Magic, Grizzlies, Raptors, and Bobcats) were admitted to the NBA, bringing the number of teams in the league to 30 by 2004.

In 2000, it was revealed that the Minnesota Timberwolves had tampered with Joe Smith two years earlier by promising him a more lucrative contract in future years in exchange for signing him below market value so they could sign more players in the short-term. The NBA voided the last year of Smith&#x27;s contract, fined the franchise $3.5 million and took away the Timberwolves&#x27; next three 1st-round NBA draft picks. Although many believed that tampering is a common practice, Stern abided by arbitrator Kenneth Dam&#x27;s ruling that the Timberwolves had signed the secret agreement, and denied that the league was making an example of the Timberwolves.

Before the 2005–06 season, the NBA announced a new dress code, which banned players from wearing headphones, chains, shorts, sleeveless shirts, indoor sunglasses, T-shirts, jerseys and headgear such as baseball caps during NBA-related public appearances. Allen Iverson criticized the policy: &quot;They&#x27;re targeting guys who dress like me, guys who dress hip-hop ... I think they went way overboard.&quot; A decade later, Stern&#x27;s edict was credited with spawning a style trend among NBA stars toward high fashion.

Stern advocated a minimum age limit for NBA players. Starting with the 2006 NBA draft, players could no longer be selected straight out of high school and needed to be at least 19 years old, creating the one-and-done rule. In 2001, Stern had stated, &quot;If these kids have the ability to get a little more maturity, a little more coaching, a little bit more life experience overall, that&#x27;s good.&quot; He was criticized for his reference to the 18-year-old adults, most of whom were African American, as &quot;these kids&quot;, when other professional sports and occupations allowed 18-year-olds.

For the 2006–07 season the NBA introduced a new &quot;microfiber&quot; basketball for use in NBA games, replacing the previous style ball used since 1970. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban agreed with the need for a new ball, claiming the old style ball was inconsistent. Many of the league&#x27;s most prominent players openly expressed their dislike for the new ball, such as Shaquille O&#x27;Neal who said, &quot;Feels like one of those cheap balls that you buy at the toy store.&quot; A study, financed by Cuban, claimed that the new ball &quot;bounces 5 to 8% lower than typical leather balls when dropped from 4 feet...[and] the new ball bounces 30% more erratically.&quot;

However, Stern initially refused to go back to the original ball despite many complaints by players about the new ball. Two months into the season, the National Basketball Players Association filed a grievance related to the quality of the ball and the cuts it had caused on players&#x27; fingers. Stern acknowledged that the NBA &quot;could have done a better job&quot; with the decision and implementation, and that it would have been better to get the players&#x27; input in advance. On December 11, 2006, the NBA announced that it would in fact switch back to the leather ball starting on January 1, 2007.

In 2007, Stern injected himself in the controversy surrounding the purchase and subsequent relocation of the Seattle SuperSonics by Oklahoman Clay Bennett and his ownership group. His support for the surprising move from the nation&#x27;s 14th-largest market to the 45th was questioned by many both in the public and media. Stern&#x27;s tenure saw the relocation of six NBA franchises.

In the summer of 2011, the NBA lockout cost the league regular-season games for the second time in league history; the first occurred during the 1998–99 lockout. Those were the only times the league has lost games as a result of work stoppages. Stern was known as a relentless negotiator. During the 2011 lockout, he was accused by HBO commentator Bryant Gumbel of being &quot;some kind of modern-day plantation overseer&quot;, a reference to the division between the NBA&#x27;s primarily white owners and its predominantly black players.

On December 8, 2011, Stern vetoed a three-team trade that would have sent Chris Paul to the Lakers, Lamar Odom to the league-owned Hornets, and Pau Gasol to the Rockets for what a spokesman would only say were &quot;basketball reasons&quot;. Early reactions from around the league, fanbase, and media were all largely negative, with players taking to Twitter to express their concerns, and several noted sports journalists criticizing the decision. The deal was maligned especially because of the conflict of interest posed by the league&#x27;s ownership of one of its teams.

On October 25, 2012, Stern announced that he would step down as NBA commissioner on February 1, 2014, after 30 years in the role, longer than each of his three predecessors. He was succeeded by his deputy Adam Silver, but remained affiliated with the league with the title of commissioner emeritus.

Stern received the Olympic Order in 2012. In 2014, Stern was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2016, he became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==

Stern was married to Dianne Bock Stern, and they had two sons: Eric and Andrew. They resided in Scarsdale, New York. By the later years of his commissionership, Stern was earning a $9 million salary. He stood at .

On December 12, 2019, Stern suffered a brain hemorrhage and underwent emergency surgery. He died in Manhattan on January 1, 2020, at age 77. In remembrance of Stern, all NBA teams wore black bands on their jerseys for the remainder of the 2019–20 season. Several basketball legends and players mourned his death, including LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Kobe Bryant (who died twenty-five days later).

<doc id="287578" wikidata="Q224558" url="?curid=287578" title="Naval Air Station Whidbey Island">
<text>Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI) is a naval air station of the United States Navy located on two pieces of land near Oak Harbor, on Whidbey Island, in Island County, Washington.

The main portion of the base, Ault Field, is about three miles north of Oak Harbor. The other section, called the Seaplane base for the PBY Catalina flying boats once based there, holds most of the island&#x27;s Navy housing as well as the air station&#x27;s main Navy Exchange and DeCA Commissary. The NASWI commanding officer also has command of a satellite airfield, Naval Outlying Landing Field (NOLF) Coupeville, on central Whidbey Island at , roughly nine miles south of Ault Field. Primarily used for Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) by carrier-based jets, this field has no permanently assigned personnel.

NASWI supports the EA-18G Growler, MH-60S Seahawk, P-8 Poseidon, EP-3E ARIES, and C-40 Clipper aircraft.

==History==
=== 1940s ===
On 17 January 1941, almost 11 months before the United States entered World War II, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations asked the Commandant of the 13th Naval District to find a location to re-arm and refuel U.S. Navy patrol planes defending Puget Sound. Lake Ozette, Indian Island, Keystone Harbor, Penn Cove and Oak Harbor were considered and rejected because of mountainous terrain, bluff shore front, inaccessibility, the absence of sufficient beaches, and lee shores. Within ten days, the commanding officer of Naval Air Station Seattle recommended the site of Saratoga Passage on the shores of Crescent Harbor and Forbes Point as a base suitable for seaplane takeoffs and landings under instrument conditions. A narrow strip of land tied Oak Harbor to what is now Maylor&#x27;s Point Capehart Housing. Dredging, filling, and running water and power lines to the city were underway at the end of November when the word came to find a land plane site.

On December 8, three workers started a topographic survey of what would become Ault Field, about to the north. Construction of Ault Field started on 1 March 1942. The first plane landed there on 5 August, when Lieutenant Newton Wakefield, a former civil engineer and airline pilot, who later became the air station&#x27;s Operations Officer, brought his SNJ single-engine trainer in with little fanfare. Everyone was busy working on the still-incomplete runway.

On 21 September 1942, the air station&#x27;s first commanding officer, Captain Cyril Thomas Simard, read the orders placing the field in use as a Navy facility. U.S. Naval Air Station Whidbey Island was duly commissioned. A year later, on 25 September 1943, the land plane field was named Ault Field, in memory of Commander William B. Ault, missing in action in the previous year&#x27;s Battle of the Coral Sea. Following the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Air Traffic Control Board, an area southeast of Coupeville was approved as an auxiliary field to serve NAS Seattle. Survey work began in February 1943, and work started in March. Naval Outlying Landing Field (NOLF) Coupeville was in use by September.

At Ault Field, the earliest squadrons of aircraft were Grumman F4F Wildcats, which came aboard in 1942, followed by Grumman F6F Hellcats. Later that year, Lockheed PV-1 Venturas arrived for training. By the end of 1943, all Wildcats were gone, replaced by the Hellcat. In 1944, Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers became the predominant aircraft at Ault Field, while at the Seaplane Base, several Consolidated PBY Catalina and Martin PBM Mariner seaplanes were aboard in the summer of 1944, augmented by a few land-based Martin B-26 Marauders that arrived earlier that year to be used for towing targets.

After World War II, operations slowed and the station was placed on reduced operating status. Many naval air stations across the United States were closing because they could not meet the requirements on post-war naval aviation; runways were now the minimum standard and approach paths had to be suitable for radar-controlled approaches in any weather. Lockheed P2V Neptune patrol bombers, which arrived in the late 1940s, would eventually make up six patrol squadrons at NAS Whidbey.

===1950s===
The Korean War restored NAS Whidbey to life and expansion and construction accelerated. Throughout the early 1950s, Whidbey&#x27;s primary land based patrol aircraft was the Lockheed P2 Neptune.

During the Korean War, patrol plane activity was stepped up again with several Naval Air Reserve units being called up and redesignated as active duty squadrons. By the end of the war, there were six VP (Patrol) squadrons and two Fleet Air Support squadrons based at Whidbey. In 1955, VP-29 returned from a deployment to the Pacific and was disestablished with its crews forming the nucleus of Heavy Attack Squadron Two (VAH-2), the first heavy attack squadron on the West Coast, the &quot;heavy&quot; designation reflecting its concentration on nuclear weapons delivery. Later that year, it moved to NAS North Island in San Diego to switch to the Douglas A-3D Skywarrior.

In 1958, the Heavy Attack Squadron Six (VAH-6), moved from NAS Moffett Field, California, where they had been the Navy&#x27;s second nuclear attack squadron. As part of CVG-61/CVW-6, the squadron then made several WestPac deployments aboard the prior to transferring to CVW-8 for operations in the Mediterranean aboard the . The squadron was transferred to Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, in September 1965.

===1960s===
In the first quarter of 1960 a search and rescue (SAR) team was started at NAS Whidbey Island. Two Sikorsky HRS-2 helicopters, more commonly referred to as H-19 Chickasaws, were assigned to the SAR team soon to be replaced by two HRS-3&#x27;s. The aircrewmen assigned to SAR were initially told this would be a two-year trial period during which time it would be decided if it would be permanent. If it didn&#x27;t work it would be shut down.

In early 1965, patrol squadrons began to leave NAS Whidbey; VP-47 transferred to NAS Moffett Field and VP-17 to NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii. In July 1969, the patrol community appeared to be reviving with the delivery of the Lockheed P-3 Orion as a replacement for the venerable Lockheed P-2 Neptune, but in September 1969, VP-2 and VP-42 were deactivated.

===1970s===
On 1 March 1970, VP-1 transferred to NAS Barbers Point, ending seaplane patrol operations by active forces at NAS Whidbey Island. This also brought Fleet Air Wing Four to an end on 1 April 1970, leaving Patrol Squadron Sixty-nine (VP-69), a Naval Air Reserve squadron, as the sole remaining maritime patrol squadron at NAS Whidbey Island. Then in the 1970s and beyond, 16 Grumman A-6 Intruder squadrons were based at NAS Whidbey Island. Whidbey was now the West Coast training and operations center for these all-weather, medium attack bomber squadrons. In October 1970, Heavy Attack Squadron 10 (VAH-10) was redesignated Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129), the Navy&#x27;s first Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler squadron and the sole fleet replacement squadron for Navy and United States Marine Corps Prowler crews. With the exception of a forward deployed EA-6B squadron at NAF Atsugi, Japan and a sole Naval Air Reserve EA-6B squadron (VAQ-209) at Andrews AFB / NAF Washington, Maryland, NAS Whidbey Island supported all of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Prowler squadrons.

===1990s===
In late 1993, with the pending closures of NAS Moffett Field and NAS Barbers Point, additional P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft came aboard NAS Whidbey Island, along with the associated staffs of Commander, Patrol Wings, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMPATWINGSPAC) and Commander, Patrol Wing TEN (COMPATWING 10). With the closure of Naval Air Station Agana, Guam, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE (VQ-1) also arrived at NAS Whidbey Island in 1994 with its Lockheed EP-3E Aries II aircraft. VQ-1 was placed under the clemency of COMPATWING 10 and the wing was redesignated Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing TEN (COMPATRECONWING 10). With the disestablishment of Reserve Patrol Wing, VP-69 was also placed under COMPATRECONWING 10.

In 1997, the last Pacific-based A-6E Intruder squadron, VA-196 was disestablished after a lengthy deployment for WESTPAC 1996.

===2000s===
In January 2009, VAQ-129 accepted its first Boeing EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft which replaced the Navy&#x27;s EA-6Bs.

===2010s===
Patrol Squadron 4 (VP-4) became the first squadron at NAS Whidbey Island to convert to the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in October 2016. On October 31, 2016 the new P-8A training center at NAS Whidbey Island opened.

==Present day==
In all, there are 20 active duty U.S. Navy squadrons and three U.S Navy Reserve squadrons based at NAS Whidbey Island. The air station also maintains a search and rescue unit that flies two Sikorsky MH-60S Nighthawk helicopters, providing 24-hour day and night maritime, inland and mountainous rescue support for Department of Defense personnel and the greater Pacific Northwest community. The SAR Unit provides 15-minute alert coverage Monday through Thursday from 0800–0200 or last plane on deck, Friday 0800-2200 or last plane on deck and 30-minute alert coverage at all other times of the year. Additionally, SAR has organic SAR Medical Technicians on all missions it performs. NASWI SAR primarily serves military aircrews, but missions to help civilians in distress are often approved and executed.

Over 50 tenant commands are at NAS Whidbey Island to provide training, medical and dental, and other support services, including a United States Air Force (USAF) squadron (390th ECS) which is an administrative unit supporting USAF officers assigned to some U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler squadrons. The base also continues its longstanding role as a center of activity for Naval Air Reserve operations and training in the region.

== Demographics ==

Whidbey Island Station is also a census-designated place (CDP). The population was 1,541 at the 2010 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.30%, are water.

<doc id="287585" wikidata="Q518114" url="?curid=287585" title="Oxybenzone">
<text>Oxybenzone or benzophenone-3 or BP-3 (trade names Milestab 9, Eusolex 4360, Escalol 567, KAHSCREEN BZ-3) is an organic compound belonging to the class of aromatic ketones known as benzophenones. It takes the form of pale-yellow crystals that are readily soluble in most organic solvents. It is widely used in sunscreen formulations, plastics, toys, furniture finishes, and other products to limit UV degradation. In nature, it can be found in various flowering plants (angiosperms). The compound was first synthesised in Germany by chemists König and Kostanecki in 1906.

The use of oxybenzone as sunscreen ingredient is currently under scrutiny by the scientific community due to controversies about the molecule&#x27;s environmental impact and safety profile (see section below). As a result, sunscreens containing oxybenzone have been banned from sale in Hawaii, Palau, and Thailand.

== Structure and electronic structure ==
Being a conjugated molecule, oxybenzone absorbs light at lower energies than many aromatic molecules. As in related compounds, the hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the ketone. This interaction contributes to oxybenzone&#x27;s light-absorption properties. At low temperatures, however, it is possible to observe both the phosphorescence and the triplet-triplet absorption spectrum. At 175 K the triplet lifetime is 24 ns. The short lifetime has been attributed to a fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the oxygen of the C=O and the OH.

== Production ==
Oxybenzone is produced by the Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzoyl chloride with 3-methoxyphenol.

== Uses ==
Oxybenzone is used in plastics as an ultraviolet light absorber and stabilizer. It is used, along with other benzophenones, in sunscreens, hair sprays, and cosmetics because they help prevent potential damage from sunlight exposure. It is also found, as a stabilizer in concentrations up to 1%, in nail polishes. Oxybenzone can also be used as a photostabilizer for synthetic resins. This substance can leach from food packaging, and is widely used as photo-initiators to activate a chemical that dries ink faster. Despite its photoprotective qualities, much controversy surrounds oxybenzone because of possible negative hormonal and photoallergenic effects, leading many countries to regulate use in sunscreen products.

=== Sunscreen ===
Oxybenzone provides a broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage which includes UVB and short-wave UVA rays. As a photoprotective agent, it has an absorption profile spanning from 270 to 350 nm with absorption peaks at 288 and 350 nm. 

Due to toxicity and environmental concerns, the percentage of sunscreen products on the market containing oxybenzone in the USA dropped to 13% in 2023 from 60% in 2019. Some brands market their sunscreens as &quot;oxybenzone free&quot; due to the generally negative perception of benzophenones by both the consuming public and scientific researchers.

== Safety ==

=== &quot;In vivo&quot; studies ===
The incidence of oxybenzone causing skin eruptions is extremely uncommon, however, oxybenzone has been associated with rare allergic reactions triggered by sun exposure. In a study of 82 patients with photoallergic contact dermatitis, just over one quarter showed photoallergic reactions to oxybenzone. Evidence points to oxybenzone having contact allergen effects. Oxybenzone is allegedly the most common allergen found in sunscreens.

In a 2008 study of participants ages 6 and up, oxybenzone was detected in 96.8% of urine samples. Humans can absorb anywhere from 0.4% to 8.7% of oxybenzone after one topical application of sunscreen, as measured in urine excretions. This number can increase after multiple applications over the same period of time. Because oxybenzone is the least lipophilic of the three most common UV filters, it is the least likely to end up trapped in the stratum corneum and the most likely to be absorbed and metabolized.

When applied topically, UV filters, such as oxybenzone, are absorbed through the skin, metabolized, and excreted primarily through the urine. The method of biotransformation, the process by which a foreign compound is chemically transformed to form a metabolite, was determined by Okereke and colleagues through oral and dermal administration of oxybenzone to rats. The scientists analyzed blood, urine, feces, and tissue samples and found three metabolites: 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB), 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (DHMB) and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). To form DHB the methoxy functional group undergoes O-dealkylation; to form THB the same ring is hydroxylated. Ring B in oxybenzone is hydroxylated to form DHMB.

A study done in 2004 measured the levels of oxybenzone and its metabolites in urine. After topical application to human volunteers, results revealed that up to 1% of the applied dose was found in the urine. The major metabolite detected was DHB and very small amounts of THB were found. By utilizing the Ames test in &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; strains, DHB was determined to be nonmutagenic. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) noted in their recommendations for future study that, &quot;While research indicates that some topical drugs can be absorbed into the body through the skin, this does not mean these drugs are unsafe.&quot; Oxybenzone can also occur as a natural product.

== Environmental effects ==
Studies have shown possible links between oxybenzone exposure and mortality in coral larvae, coral bleaching, and to genetic damage in marine invertebrates. However, some of these studies have been criticised for not having control groups or representing real-world conditions. Nevertheless, these have led to the ban of oxybenzone-containing sunscreen in many areas such as Palau, Hawaii, nature reserves in Mexico, Bonaire, the Marshall Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Thailand&#x27;s marine natural parks, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Aruba.

==Health and environmental regulation==
=== Aruba ===
Aruba banned the use of oxybenzone in sunscreens due to environmental concerns in 2019.

=== Australia ===
As of 2023, the maximum concentration of oxybenzone in a sunscreen cannot exceed 10% according to the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration).

=== Bonaire ===
As of 2019 Bonaire banned oxybenzone due to coral toxicity concerns, with regards to coral larvae

=== Canada ===
Revised as of 2012, Health Canada allows oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 6%.

=== European Union ===
The European Food Safety Authority categorises All the benzophenones, such as oxybenzone, as persistent, bio-accumulative, toxic, and a possible human carcinogen and endocrine disruptor. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Commission concluded that it poses a significant risk to consumers as a contact allergenic potential. It is allowed in face, hand, and lip products up to 6%, in body products up to 2.2%, and in other formulations up to 0.5%.

=== Japan ===
Revised as of 2001, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare notification allows oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 5%.

=== Mexico ===
Nature Reserves across Mexico have banned the usage of sunscreens containing Oxybenzone

=== Palau ===
The Palau government has signed a law that restricts the sale and use of sunscreen and skincare products that contain oxybenzone, and nine other chemicals. The ban came into force in 2020.

=== Sweden ===
The Swedish Research Council has determined that sunscreens with oxybenzone are unsuitable for use in young children, because children under the age of two years have not fully developed the enzymes that are believed to break it down. No regulations have come of this study yet.

=== Thailand ===
Thailand has prohibited sunscreens containing chemicals harmful to corals, including oxybenzone, in all its marine national parks. This decision was driven by evidence highlighting the detrimental effects of certain sunscreen ingredients on coral larvae, reproduction, and inducing reef bleaching. Violators face fines up to 100,000 baht (£2,100), although enforcement methods remain unspecified.

=== United States ===

In 2021 the U.S. FDA changed their classification of oxybenzone and no longer regard it as GRASE (Generally Recognised As Safe and Effective) due to the lack of safety data to support the classification.

The Hawaii State Legislature has legislated oxybenzone as illegal for use in sunscreens and personal care products since 2021 due to its environmental effects, such as mortality in developing coral, coral bleaching, genetic damage to coral, and other marine organisms.

Key West has also banned the sale of sunscreens that contain the ingredients oxybenzone (and octinoxate). The ban was to be effective as of January 1, 2021. However, this legislation was superseded by the Florida State Legislature by Senate Bill 172, which prohibits local governments from regulating over-the-counter proprietary drugs and cosmetics (such as sunscreen containing oxybenzone and octinoxate). The statute became effective July 1, 2020.

<text>Hot swapping is the replacement or addition of components to a computer system without stopping, shutting down, or rebooting the system; hot plugging describes the addition of components only. Components which have such functionality are said to be &quot;hot-swappable&quot; or &quot;hot-pluggable&quot;; likewise, components which do not are &quot;cold-swappable&quot; or &quot;cold-pluggable&quot;.

Most desktop computer hardware, such as CPUs and memory, are only cold-pluggable. However, it is common for mid to high-end servers and mainframes to feature hot-swappable capability for hardware components, such as CPU, memory, PCIe, SATA and SAS drives.

An example of hot swapping is the express ability to pull a Universal Serial Bus (USB) peripheral device, such as a thumb drive, external hard disk drive (HDD), mouse, keyboard, or printer out of a computer&#x27;s USB slot or peripheral hub without ejecting it first. 

Most smartphones and tablets with tray-loading holders can interchange SIM cards without powering down the system.

Dedicated digital cameras and camcorders usually have readily accessible memory card and battery compartments for quick changing with only minimal interruption of operation. Batteries can be cycled through by recharging reserve batteries externally while unused. Many cameras and camcorders feature an internal memory to allow capturing when no memory card is inserted.

==Rationale==
Hot swapping is used whenever it is desirable to change the configuration or repair a working system without interrupting its operation. It may simply be for convenience of avoiding the delay and nuisance of shutting down and then restarting complex equipment or because it is essential for equipment, such as a server, to be continuously active.

Hot swapping may be used to add or remove peripherals or components, to allow a device to synchronize data with a computer, and to replace faulty modules without interrupting equipment operation. A machine may have dual power supplies, each adequate to power the machine; a faulty one may be hot-swapped. Important cards such as disk controllers or host adapters may be designed with redundant paths in order for these to be replaceable in case of failure without necessitating interruption of associated computer system operation.

==System considerations==
Machines that support hot swapping need to be able to modify their operation for the changed configuration, either automatically on detecting the change, or by user intervention. All electrical and mechanical connections associated with hot-swapping must be designed so that neither the equipment nor the user can be harmed while hot-swapping. Other components in the system must be designed so that the removal of a hot-swappable component does not interrupt operation.

=== Mechanical design ===
Protective covering plates, shields, or bezels may be used on either the removable components or the main device itself to prevent operator contact with live powered circuitry, to provide antistatic protection for components being added or removed, or to prevent the removable components from accidentally touching and shorting out the powered components in the operating device.

Additional guide slots, pins, notches, or holes may be used to aid in proper insertion of a component between other live components, while mechanical engagement latches, handles, or levers may be used to assist in proper insertion and removal of devices that either require large amounts of force to connect or disconnect, or to assist in the proper mating and holding together of power and communications connectors.

=== Variations ===
There are two slightly differing meanings of the term &quot;hot swapping&quot;. It may refer only to the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while the system software may have to be notified by the user of the event in order to cope with it. Examples include PCMCIA, RS-232 and lower-end SCSI devices.

Some implementations require a component shutdown procedure prior to removal. This simplifies the design, but such devices are not robust in the case of component failure. If a component is removed while it is being used, the operations to that device fail and the user is responsible for retrying if necessary, although this is not usually considered to be a problem.

More complex implementations may recommend but do not require that the component be shut down, with sufficient redundancy in the system to allow operation to continue if a component is removed without being shut down. In these systems hot swap is normally used for regular maintenance to the computer, or to replace a broken component.

==Connectors==

Most modern hot-swap methods use a specialized connector with staggered pins, so that certain pins are certain to be connected before others. Most staggered-pin designs have ground pins longer than the others, ensuring that no sensitive circuitry is connected before there is a reliable system ground. The other pins may all be the same length, but in some cases three pin lengths are used so that the incoming device is grounded first, data lines connected second, and power applied third, in rapid succession as the device is inserted. Pins of the same nominal length do not necessarily make contact at exactly the same time due to mechanical tolerances, and angling of the connector when inserted.

At one time staggered pins were thought to be an expensive solution, but many contemporary connector families now come with staggered pins as standard; for example, they are used on all modern serial SCSI disk-drives. Specialized hot-plug power connector pins are now commercially available with repeatable DC current interruption ratings of up to 16 A. Printed circuit boards are made with staggered edge-fingers for direct hot-plugging into a backplane connector.

Although the speed of plugging cannot be controlled precisely, practical considerations will provide limits that can be used to determine worst-case conditions. For a typical staggered pin design where the length difference is 0.5 mm, the elapsed time between long and short pin contact is between 25 ms and 250 ms. It is quite practical to design hot-swap circuits that can operate at that speed.
As long as the hot-swap connector is sufficiently rigid, one of the four corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row connector arrangement this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is fully seated. This diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that fully seated detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot. The remaining pins are used for all the other data signals.

==Power electronics==
The DC power supplies to a hot-swap component are usually pre-charged by dedicated long pins that make contact before the main power pins. These pre-charge pins are protected by a circuit that limits the inrush current to an acceptable value that cannot damage the pins nor disturb the supply voltage to adjacent slots. The pre-charge circuit might be a simple series resistor, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) resistor, or a current-limiter circuit. Further protection can be provided by a &quot;soft-start&quot; circuit that provides a managed ramp-up of the internal DC supply voltages within the component.

A typical sequence for a hot-swap component being plugged into a slot could be as follows:
#Long ground pins make contact; basic electrical safety and ESD protection becomes available.
#Long (or medium) pre-charge pins make contact; decoupling capacitors start to charge up.
#Real time delay of tens of milliseconds.
#Short power/signal pins make contact.
#Connector becomes fully seated; power-on reset signal asserted within component
#Soft-start circuit starts to apply power to the component.
#Real time delay of tens of milliseconds.
#Soft-start circuit completes sequence; power-on reset circuit deasserted
#Component begins normal operation.

Hot-swap power circuits can now be purchased commercially in specially designed ASICs called hot-swap power managers (HSPMs).

==Signal electronics==
Circuitry attached to signal pins in a hot-swap component should include some protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD). This usually takes the form of clamp diodes to ground and to the DC power supply voltage. ESD effects can be reduced by careful design of the mechanical package around the hot-swap component, perhaps by coating it with a thin film of conductive material.

Particular care must be taken when designing systems with bussed signals which are wired to more than one hot-swap component. When a hot-swap component is inserted its input and output signal pins will represent a temporary short-circuit to ground. This can cause unwanted ground-level pulses on the signals which can disturb the operation of other hot-swap components in the system. This was a problem for early parallel SCSI disk-drives. One common design solution is to protect bussed signal pins with series diodes or resistors. CMOS buffer devices are now available with specialized inputs and outputs that minimize disturbance of bussed signals during the hot-swap operation. If all else fails, another solution is to quiesce the operation of all components during the hot-swap operation.

==Applications==
=== Radio transmitters ===
Modern day radio transmitters (and some TV transmitters as well) use high power RF transistor power modules instead of vacuum tubes. Hot swapping power modules is not a new technology, as many of the radio transmitters manufactured in the 1930s were capable of having power tubes swapped out while the transmitter was running—but this feature was not universally adopted due to the introduction of more reliable high power tubes.

In the mid-1990s, several radio transmitter manufactures in the US started offering swappable high power RF transistor modules.
* There was no industry standard for the design of the swappable power modules at the time.
* Early module designs had only limited patent restrictions.
* By the early 2000s, many transmitter models were available that used many different kinds of power modules.

The reintroduction of power modules has been good for the radio transmitter industry, as it has fostered innovation. Modular transmitters have proven to be more reliable than tube transmitters, when the transmitter is properly chosen for the conditions at the transmitting site.

Power limitations:
* Lowest power modular transmitter: generally 1.0 kW, using 600 W modules.
* Highest power modular transmitter: 1.0 MW (for LW, MW).
* Highest power modular transmitter: 45 kW (FM, TV).

===Gaming===
Although most contemporary video game systems can interchange games and multimedia (e.g. Blu-rays) without powering down the system, older generations of systems varied in their support of hot-swapping capabilities. For example, whereas the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could eject a game disc with the system powered on, the Nintendo Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo 64 would freeze up and could potentially become corrupt if the game cartridge was removed with the power on. Manufacturers specifically warned against such practices in the owner&#x27;s manual or on the game cartridge. It was supposedly for this reason that Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop was taken out of the Banjo-Kazooie series. With the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive system, it was sometimes possible to apply cheats (such as a player having infinite lives) and other temporary software alterations to games by hot swapping cartridges, even though the cartridges were not designed to be hot swappable.

=== Keyboards ===
Hot-swappable keyboards enable changing the switches without having to disassemble the keyboard. On standard mechanical-switch keyboards, the switch is directly soldered to the PCB. Hot-swappable keyboards instead have a socket in its place that allows the switch to be freely replaced without re-soldering.

Due to hot-swappable keyboards being less common, they often require being custom built or bought from custom keyboard manufacturers. They can be found in a variety of sizes and layouts, including more specialized ergonomic layouts.

==Software==
Hot swapping can also refer to the ability to alter the running code of a program without needing to interrupt its execution. Interactive programming is a programming paradigm that makes extensive use of hot swapping, so the programming activity becomes part of the program flow itself.

Only a few programming languages support hot swapping natively, including Pike, Lisp, Erlang, Smalltalk, Visual Basic 6 (not VB.NET), Java and most recently Elm and Elixir. Microsoft Visual Studio supports a kind of hot swapping called Edit and Continue, which is supported by C#, VB.NET and C/C++ when running under a debugger.

Hot swapping is the central method in live coding, where programming is an integral part of the runtime process. In general, all programming languages used in live coding, such as SuperCollider, TidalCycles, or Extempore support hot swapping.

Some web-based frameworks, such as Django, support detecting module changes and reloading them on the fly. However, although the same as hotswapping for most intents and purposes, this is technically just a cache purge, triggered by a new file. This does not apply to markup and programming languages such as HTML and PHP respectively, in the general case, as these files are normally reinterpreted on each use by default. There are a few CMSes and other PHP-based frameworks (such as Drupal) that employ caching, however. In these cases, similar abilities and exceptions apply.

Hot swapping also facilitates developing systems where large amounts of data are being processed, as in entire genomes in bioinformatics algorithms.

==Trademarks==
The term &quot;HOT PLUG&quot; was registered as a trademark in the United States in November 1992 to Core International, Inc., and cancelled in May 1999.

<text>General Sir Arthur William Currie, (5 December 187530 November 1933) was a senior officer of the Canadian Army who fought during World War I. He had the unique distinction of starting his military career on the very bottom rung as a pre-war militia gunner before rising through the ranks to become the first Canadian commander of the Canadian Corps. Currie&#x27;s success was based on his ability to rapidly adapt brigade tactics to the exigencies of trench warfare, using set piece operations and bite-and-hold tactics. He is generally considered to be among the most capable commanders of the Western Front, and one of the finest commanders in Canadian military history.

Currie began his military career in 1897 as a part-time soldier in the Canadian militia while making his living as a teacher and later as an insurance salesman and real estate speculator. Currie rose quickly through the ranks: commissioned as an officer in 1900, promoted to captain in 1901, then major in 1906 and became an artillery regimental commander in 1909. In 1913 Currie accepted the command of the newly created 50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada. Finding himself in debt following a real estate crash in Victoria, Currie embezzled ten thousand dollars earmarked for regimental uniforms into his personal accounts to pay off his debts. When the First World War broke out Canadian Minister of Militia Sam Hughes appointed Currie as commander of the 2nd Canadian Brigade. Following the Second Battle of Ypres Currie was promoted to major-general and commander of the 1st Canadian Division. Following the Battle of Vimy Ridge, Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng was promoted to general and Currie, the 1st Canadian Division commander, was promoted to lieutenant-general and assumed command of the Canadian Corps. Upon returning to Canada, Currie was promoted to general and was made Inspector General of the Canadian Army. Although he had only a high school diploma, Currie became the principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University in 1920, holding this post until his death in 1933.

==Early life==
Arthur Currie was born on 5 December 1875 to William Garner Curry and Jane Patterson on their farm near the hamlet of Napperton, Ontario, just west of Strathroy. He was the third in a family of eight children and grew up on the homestead of his paternal grandparents, John Corrigan and Jane Garner. Currie&#x27;s grandparents had emigrated from Ireland in 1838 to escape religious strife, and upon their arrival in Canada they had converted from Catholicism and Anglicanism to Methodism, changing the family name from Corrigan to Curry. Arthur Currie modified the spelling of his surname from Curry to Currie in 1897.

Currie was educated in local common schools and at the Strathroy District Collegiate Institute, where he proved to be a good student especially interested in literature. He had plans to pursue a professional career in law or medicine; however, the death of his father when Arthur was fifteen made this impossible due to his limited financial means. Currie instead pursued teacher training, but he was unable to secure a job and returned to high school to complete an honours certificate in order to gain university entrance. In May 1894, mere months before his final exams, Currie quarrelled with one of his teachers, and subsequently left high school to seek his fortune in British Columbia, hoping to take advantage of the financial boom resulting from the construction of the transcontinental railway. However, Currie found no prospects outside of teaching, so he qualified as a teacher in British Columbia and took a teaching position on the Saanich Peninsula north of Victoria, British Columbia. In 1896 Currie moved to Victoria, taking a position at Boy&#x27;s Central School and later Victoria High School.

==Early military career==
On 6 May 1897 Currie joined the Canadian Militia as a part-time gunner for the 5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment. Currie achieved the rank of corporal in 1900 and was soon after offered an officer&#x27;s commission, which would give him a much higher status in the social circles of Victoria. A military commission was however an expensive proposition. Officers were expected to provide their own set of tailored uniforms and to donate their pay to the officer&#x27;s mess. Currie was discouraged by his financial prospects as a teacher; and consequently, in February 1900, he left teaching and took a position as an insurance salesman with Matson &amp; Coles, a local insurance firm. On 14 August 1901 Currie married Lucy Chaworth-Musters, who had been raised by Currie&#x27;s aunt and uncle in British Columbia after being abandoned by her British military officer father following the death of her mother in childbirth.
Currie took on his role as militia officer seriously. He attended every available course offered by the British Army Contingent at Work Point Barracks in Esquimalt, often ordered military text books from London and was found on the shooting range every Saturday. He was a keen marksman and was elected president of the British Columbia Rifle Association in 1905. Currie was promoted to captain in November 1901, and then to major in 1906. By September 1909, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, commanding the 5th Regiment. Apart from his interest in the militia, Currie was also an active Freemason, rising to the position of deputy grandmaster of the Victoria District of Freemasonry in 1907. He also served two years as president of the Young Men&#x27;s Liberal Association of Victoria, and several times was suggested as a candidate for the provincial legislature.

In addition to his military career, Currie continued to be active in business. He was appointed head of the Matson Insurance Firm in 1904 when Sam Matson, who had many business interests beyond his insurance firm, decided to concentrate his energy on publishing the &quot;Daily Colonist&quot;. With a land speculation boom in Victoria in full swing, Currie and a Victoria businessman, R. A. Power, formed Currie &amp; Power in 1908. Currie invested heavily in the real estate market. The firm was a success until 1912 when property prices began to decline. In 1913 Currie&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated rapidly as the value of his real estate holdings decreased and he became financially over-extended. In August, Currie&#x27;s five-year term as commander of the 5th Regiment came to a close and he faced a forced retirement from the Canadian Militia at the age of 38. At this critical juncture, he was approached to take command of a new militia regiment.
Following the Canadian federal election of 1911, Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes had ordered a rapid expansion of the national force. The large number of Scottish citizens of Victoria appealed for the formation of a Highland regiment in Victoria to augment the 88th Regiment Victoria Fusiliers, which had been formed in 1912. On 15 August 1913 the government authorized the formation of the 50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada. The originally designated commanding officer for the new regiment failed to qualify for the post and Currie was approached as a logical replacement. Currie initially turned down the idea, likely recognizing that the cost of the new Highland uniforms and mess bills would only add to his financial problems. His subordinate and friend, Major Garnet Hughes, Sam Hughes&#x27; son, was responsible for persuading Currie to reconsider and accept the position. Currie attended the Militia Staff Course conducted by Major Louis Lipsett, future commander of the 3rd Canadian Division, and qualified in March 1914.

Currie was desperate to avoid personal bankruptcy, which would have resulted in a loss in social standing and forced him to resign his commission. On 31 July 1914, Currie received from the Militia Department with which to purchase new uniforms. Instead of using the funds to pay contractor Moore, Taggart and Co for the regimental uniforms, Currie embezzled the funds to pay off his personal debts. The 50th Regiment&#x27;s honorary colonel, William Coy, had promised to underwrite the regiment with $35,000, and Currie planned to use the funds to pay the uniform contractor. Unfortunately for Currie, Coy did not follow through with his financial commitment to the regiment, leaving Currie&#x27;s accounting sleight-of-hand potentially exposed.

When World War I broke out and Canada found itself at war on 4 August 1914, Currie was offered command of Military District No.11British Columbia. When he turned this down, he was then offered command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Canadian Expeditionary Force&#x27;s 1st Canadian Division. Currie considered turning down this offer as well so he could attempt to solve his financial woes. He once again changed his mind at the urging of Garnet Hughes. Currie&#x27;s promotion to brigadier-general was confirmed on 29 September 1914, and he took command of the 2nd Brigade at the Valcartier Camp in Quebec. When the 50th Regiment&#x27;s acting commanding officer, Major Cecil Roberts, wrote to him inquiring as to the status of the uniform grant, Currie ignored the correspondence and sailed overseas with his brigade in October 1914.

==World War I==
===Brigade commander===
The 1st Canadian Division spent the winter of 1914–15 training in England, and were sent to France in February 1915. After a period of indoctrination in the realities of trench warfare, they took control of a section of trench in the Ypres Salient on 17 April 1915. Only five days later, the Germans used poison gas for the first time on the Western Front. French colonial troops on the Canadians&#x27; left flank broke, leaving a long hole in the Allied line. In the chaos that followed, Currie proved his worth as a leader by assessing the situation, and coolly issuing commands from his brigade headquarters even as it was gassed and then destroyed by fire. Currie cobbled together a fluid defence and counterattacked. At one point, he personally went back to the rear to try to convince two regiments of British reinforcements to move forward. After several days of fierce fighting, Allied counterattacks re-established a stable defensive line, denying the Germans a breakthrough.

Currie&#x27;s leadership during the Second Battle of Ypres was a source of dispute by British historian James Edward Edmonds, who argued that Currie and his 2nd Canadian Brigade performed poorly at Ypres. Currie, supported by the Canadian official historian Colonel Archer Fortescue Duguid, waged a vigorous defense, charging that Edmonds was seeking to diminish the Canadian contribution to the Second Battle of Ypres. Edmonds wrongly accused Currie of ordering his men to retreat on 24 April 1915 because of the chaos caused by the chlorine gas and fierce attacks of the German infantry; Currie and Duguid said it was Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commanding the 3rd Canadian Brigade on Currie&#x27;s left, who had ordered a retreat without orders, leaving Currie with an exposed left flank. Canadian historian Timothy Travers also argued that Edmonds was very unfair to Currie since the 1st Canadian Division occupied a position that would have been difficult to defend even under normal conditions, without considering the effects of the first mass use of poison gas and the complete withdrawal of French forces on their left flank. Although acknowledging that Currie had made mistakes, Travers maintained that unlike the Algerians who fled, Currie&#x27;s 2nd Brigade held its ground at Ypres, consequently losing 46% of its total strength either killed or wounded over two days of fighting.

Following the battle, Currie was promoted to major-general, and given command of the entire 1st Canadian Division. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and a Commander of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur.

===Division commander===
Although the Canadians did not take part in the infamous Anglo-French offensive on the Somme on 1 July 1916, they did eventually move into the line in the fall to aid the slow crawl forward. Currie proved himself to be the master of the set-piece assault, designed to take limited objectives and then hold on in the face of inevitable German counterattacks. It was at this time that Currie lost favour with former friends Sam and Garnet Hughes. Sam Hughes wanted Garnet promoted to command of a division, but Currie, having seen Garnet in action at the Second Battle of Ypres, believed Garnet to be an incompetent officer, and refused. Currie&#x27;s reputation was on the rise, and Hughes did not have the necessary leverage to force Currie to comply.

By late 1916, the four Canadian divisions were in France, gathered together as the Canadian Corps under the command of Sir Julian Byng. The British High Command informed Byng that the Canadians would have a central role in the upcoming Battle of Arras by attacking Vimy Ridge, northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plains. Byng ordered Currie to study the Battle of the Somme and advise what lessons could be taken and applied. Currie was also among a set of officers who attended a series of lectures hosted by the French Army regarding their experiences during the Battle of Verdun. Currie not only questioned senior French officers but also sought out junior officers and asked the same questions, carefully noting the discrepancies between the senior officers&#x27; beliefs and the junior officers&#x27; experiences. On 20 January 1917 Currie began a series of well received lectures to Corps and divisional headquarters based on his research. In response to the Verdun visit, organizational changes were made to the platoon structure within the infantry battalions that would later become corps-wide changes. In his report, Currie evaluated not only the French tactics but also what the Canadians had done wrong in the fighting around Pozières in 1916. Currie summarized the primary factors behind successful French offensive operations as: careful staff work, thorough artillery preparation and support, the element of surprise, and a high state of training in the infantry units detailed for the assault.

Currie, in command of the 1st Canadian Division, was responsible for the broad southern sector of the Canadian Corps advance and expected to make the greatest advance in terms of distance. The attack was to begin at 5:30am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. By the end of the first day, the 1st Canadian Division had captured all of its first line objectives and the left half of its second line. The next morning by 9:30am, fresh troops had leap-frogged existing battalions to advance to the third objective line. To permit the troops time to consolidate the third line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for ninety minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced and, by 2:00pm, the 1st Canadian Division secured their final objective.

===Canadian Corps commander===

When Byng was promoted to general in command of the British Third Army in June 1917, Currie was raised to the temporary rank of lieutenant-general on 9 June, and given command of the entire Canadian Corps. Currie was knighted by King George V and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 4 June 1917. As he was taking command of the Corps, word reached Currie that the Canadian cabinet had been informed of his embezzlement. To avoid news of the scandal from breaking, Currie borrowed money from two wealthy subordinates, David Watson and Victor Odlum, to finally pay back the money he had taken from the 50th Regiment.
The British First Army commander Lieutenant-General Henry Horne ordered the Canadian Corps to relieve I Corps opposite the city of Lens on 10 July 1917, and directed Currie to develop a plan for capturing the city by the end of July 1917. The operation was intended to engage as many German formations as possible and to prevent them from reinforcing the Ypres sector during the Third Battle of Ypres. After examining the area, Currie instead proposed to take the high ground outside the city, marked on allied maps as Hill 70, hold the feature in the expectation of a German counterattack, and inflict casualties by preparing a zone of concentrated artillery and machine gun fire. Currie&#x27;s plan was implemented successfully, and by the end of the battle, some 20,000 Germans had been killed or wounded at the cost of 9,000 Canadians. The operation was effective in preventing German formations from transferring local men and equipment to Ypres, and Haig believed that the Battle of Hill 70 was one of the finest minor operations of the war.

The Canadian Corps was then transferred from Lens to Ypres to take part in the Battle of Passchendaele. Currie was tasked with continuing the advance started by the now exhausted II Anzac Corps in order to ultimately capture Passchendaele village and gain favourable observation positions and drier winter positions. Currie submitted his provisional operational plan on 16 October and presented a plan with extensive resources made available in reserve. He estimated the attack would result in 16,000 casualties. Currie&#x27;s preparations included reconnaissance, road construction and a massing of artillery and heavy machine guns. Rather than one mass assault, Currie designed a series of well-prepared, sharp attacks that allowed the Corps to take an objective and then hold it against the inevitable German counterattacks. By 30 October, the Canadians, aided by two British divisions, gained the outskirts of the village in a driving rainstorm, and then held on for five days against intense shelling and counter-attacks, often standing waist deep in mud as they fought. The Canadians&#x27; victory came at the cost of 15,654 casualties, including 4,028 killed. Currie&#x27;s grim casualty prediction had been accurate.

===End of the war===
By early 1918 the Canadian Corps was in a state of uncertainty. The Canadian government wanted to expand the Canadian Corps by forming a 5th Division but the BEF wanted the Canadian Corps reorganized to mirror British divisions. British command also intended to integrate American battalions into the depleted corps, which Currie predicted would be a disaster and would destroy the homogeneous structure of the corps. Currie was opposed to all those measures since he did not view them as being in the best interests of the corps. Currie, with the aid of the Minister of Overseas Military Forces, prevailed against the structural changes. The Canadian Corps retained its original Canadian organizational structure and fought as a homogeneous formation for the entire Hundred Days Offensive.

On 21 March 1918 the Germans launched a major Spring Offensive hoping to force an armistice on their terms, but by the summer their forward momentum had been contained and the Allies prepared to counterattack. In August 1918, when Currie was ordered to move the corps south to Amiens, the Canadians took pains to camouflage their move. This included sending a radio unit and two battalions to Ypres as a diversion. With no preliminary artillery bombardment at Amiens to warn the Germans, the attack on 8 August was a success. The Canadians were withdrawn from the line, and moved to the Somme, where they participated in the attack on the Hindenburg Line at the Drocourt–Quéant Line on 2 September. The assault resulted in the Germans being overrun along a front. Historian Denis Winter called the seizure of the Drocourt–Quéant line by the Canadian Corps the &quot;greatest single achievement&quot; of the British Expeditionary Force during the entire war, and praised Currie for his ability to bring an &quot;unprecedented&quot; concentration of artillery and machine gun fire together with flexible infantry sections that were adjusted for the situation. The German Seventeenth Army then retreated behind the flooded Canal du Nord. Currie took three weeks to prepare perhaps his most audacious plan: he suggested the entire corps cross the drier section of the canal on a front of only . On 27 September the entire corps moved across the canal as planned, and then through the German lines in a series of planned zig-zag manoeuvres designed to confuse the Germans. Exhausted and demoralized, the German army staged a controlled retreat over the next five weeks. On 10 November, in what was to be his most controversial decision, Currie, under orders to continue to advance, ordered elements of the corps to liberate Mons. On the morning of 11 November, as Currie received orders confirming there would be a general armistice at 11:00am, the capture of Mons was completed.

In December 1918, Currie established the Canadian War Narrative Section to maintain a level of control as to how the Canadian contribution to the Hundred Days Offensive would be documented in print and presented to the public. Tim Cook argues that the Canadian War Narrative Section was an important step in not only recording and presenting the achievements of the Canadian Corps but also in restoring Currie&#x27;s damaged reputation, which had been battered by Sam Hughes and his supporters in Parliament. Hughes frequently referred to Currie as a butcher.

==Post-war==
Currie and family had moved to England in 1915. They returned to Canada following the war, arriving in Halifax on 17 August 1919. No band or crowd received the ship when it docked and when Currie arrived at the Victoria Memorial Building to greet the 13th Canadian Parliament he received a lukewarm reception. Currie was appointed Inspector General of the Armed Forces and was then promoted to full general on 10 December, the highest ranking position in the Canadian forces. Currie intended to use the position to reform the military. However, in the post-war period, military funding was cut and Currie encountered significant opposition from the military bureaucracy to organizational changes. Deeply unhappy, Currie retired from the military, and in May 1920 accepted the position of principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University in Montreal.

===McGill University===
Currie had only a high school diploma, but on the recommendation of McGill&#x27;s acting principal, Frank Dawson Adams, Currie was selected as principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University on the basis of his &quot;exceptional powers of organization and administration&quot; and his &quot;capacity for inspiration and leadership&quot; rather than academic prowess. Within months of Currie&#x27;s appointment, he led a fund-raising campaign to revive the university, travelling from coast to coast in a personal appeal for support; the fundraising campaign raised , more than the original goal of . Currie made a name for himself as a premier university administrator. From 1925 to 1927 he served as president of the National Conference of Canadian Universities and was elected as a trustee of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 1927. Currie was also instrumental in saving the School for Graduate Nurses at Royal Victoria College from closure in the early 1930s. During Currie&#x27;s time as McGill&#x27;s Principal the university established the Faculty of Music, the School for Graduate Nurses, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research, and doubled its income despite the difficulties brought on by the Great Depression. Currie was also President of the Last Post Fund from 1924 to 1932.

===Libel suit===
In June 1927, the city of Mons erected a plaque commemorating its liberation by the Canadian Corps nine years earlier. But, when this event was reported in Canadian newspapers, Currie&#x27;s enemies took the opportunity to again question the necessity of the final day of fighting. A front-page editorial published on 13 June 1927 by the Hughes-friendly &quot;Port Hope Evening Guide&quot; argued that Currie was either negligent or deliberate in wasting the lives of soldiers under his command in taking Mons on the final day of the war. The newspaper had only a small local circulation, and Currie&#x27;s friends advised him against pursuing the matter. However, Currie was unwilling to let the matter go, and sued the newspaper for libel, seeking $50,000 ($ today) in damages. The trial in April 1928 was front-page news across Canada. On the stand, Currie testified that he had been under orders from Allied Supreme Commander Ferdinand Foch to pursue German forces; to do otherwise would have been treason. Many of Currie&#x27;s senior officers testified that Currie had urged them to advance with caution, avoiding unnecessary casualties. At the end of the trial, the jury returned a verdict after four hours, finding the newspaper guilty of libel but awarding Currie only $500 ($ today) in damages, plus costs.

Although Currie was awarded only a small portion of the value sought, newspapers across Canada referred to the result as a victory for him. The trial helped to restore Currie&#x27;s reputation; however, the stress took a toll on his health. Currie was subsequently elected Dominion president of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League in 1928. However, he suffered a stroke the following year and his ill health obliged him to resign, whereupon he was bestowed with the honorary title of Grand President.

===Death===
Currie suffered another stroke on 5 November 1933 and died on 30 November at the age of 57 at Royal Victoria Hospital from bronchial complications brought on by pneumonia. His civilian and military funeral on 5 December was held in Montreal and was the largest to that point in Canadian history. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of his funeral: &quot;It was, by common consent, the most impressive funeral ever seen at Montreal&quot; and Robert Borden believed the ceremony &quot;was perhaps more elaborate than at any state or military funeral in the history of Canada&quot;. Approximately 150,000 people lined the streets to watch the procession and the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission broadcast the funeral over radio. Those attending the funeral included Lord Bessborough, at the time the Governor General of Canada, important Canadian politicians, foreign diplomats and representatives of McGill University. No less than 170 organizations sent floral tributes. The service was conducted by the Bishop of Montreal at Christ Church Cathedral and was followed by a graveside service presided over by Archdeacon (Hon. Colonel) John Almond, a wartime Director of the Canadian Chaplain Service for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Eight general officers acted as pallbearers. The funeral procession received a 17-gun salute. In London a memorial service was conducted in Westminster Abbey on the same day as the funeral in Montreal, which was filled to capacity. Memorial services were held elsewhere in Canada also. On 3 December, 7,000 persons attended a memorial service for Currie at Toronto&#x27;s Arena Gardens. Currie was initially interred in a family plot at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. However, three years after his death, Currie&#x27;s remains were moved to a more prominent site surmounted by a cross of sacrifice.

Currie was survived by his wife, Lucy, and a son and daughter. Lucy was left in some financial difficulty following her husband&#x27;s death when McGill decided it could not afford to continue paying her a portion of his salary. In 1935 the Canadian government finally recognized his service to Canada by granting $50,000 to his estate.

==Honours and tribute==
Currie was named a Companion of the Order of the Bath after the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915 and promoted Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1919 New Year Honours, and was Mentioned in Despatches nine times over the course of the war. Currie also received a number of foreign awards, including the French Légion d&#x27;honneur and Croix de guerre (with Palm), the Belgian Croix de guerre and Order of the Crown, and the US Distinguished Service Medal. Currie&#x27;s contributions both to the war effort as well as post-war education was recognized in 19 honorary degrees.

Many tributes have been made to Currie. In 1919 General Currie Elementary School was built in Richmond, British Columbia. A Sir Arthur Currie Elementary School under the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal was also built. Mount Currie (2810 m) at the Spray River headwaters in Banff National Park is named after Currie. The Currie Barracks in Calgary opened in 1933 was named in his honour (later renamed to CFB Calgary). In 1934, Currie was designated as a Canadian Person of National Historic Significance. The Currie Building and Currie Hall at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario were subsequently named in his honour. In Victoria the street where Currie lived was renamed &quot;Arthur Currie Lane&quot; and an on-campus housing building at University of Victoria is named in his honour. In Strathroy, Ontario the local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion bears his name, and a statue has been raised to him. Robert A. Heinlein, in his science fiction novel &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, named one of the basic training facilities &quot;Camp Arthur Currie&quot;. In 2006 Canada honoured Currie as one of fourteen Canadians in the Valiants Memorial, and is one of the five people commemorated with a life-sized statue. and the Sir Arthur Currie Memorial Gymnasium at McGill University in Montreal.
==Legacy==
Canadian historians, including Pierre Berton and Jack Granatstein, have described Currie as Canada&#x27;s greatest military commander. Although physically a large man, standing over six feet tall, Currie did not cut a heroic military figure. Nor was he a charismatic speaker. Described as aloof by his troops, who called him &quot;Guts and Gaiters&quot;, he nevertheless inspired them. He was a brilliant tactician who used his skills to reduce casualties and is credited with accelerating the end of the war. According to historian Jack Hyatt, &quot;His slogan was, &#x27;Pay the price of victory in shellsnot lives,&#x27; and if he did anything heroic it was that.&quot; Currie&#x27;s leadership of the Canadian Corps was described in an article in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;: &quot;No flashing genius, but a capable administrator, cool headed and even tempered and sound of judgment. He has surrounded himself with a capable staff whose counsel he shares and whose advice he takes. He is the last man in the world to stick to his own plan if a better one offers. So far as tactics go he is first among equals for such is the way his staff works.&quot;

<text>William Henry Hudson (4 August 1841 – 18 August 1922), known in Argentina as Guillermo Enrique Hudson, was an Anglo-Argentine author, naturalist and ornithologist. Born in the Argentine pampas where he roamed free in his youth, he observed bird life and collected specimens for the Smithsonian Institution. The Patagonian birds &quot;Knipolegus hudsoni&quot; and &quot;Asthenes hudsoni&quot; are named after him. He would later write about life in Patagonia that drew special admiration for his style. His most popular work &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904), a romance set in the Venezuelan forest inspired a Hollywood movie and several other works.

== Life==

Hudson was the fourth child of Daniel Hudson (1804–1868) and his wife Caroline Augusta (1804–1859), United States settlers of English and Irish origin. His paternal grandfather was from Clyst Hydon in Devon. He was born and lived his first years in a small estancia called &quot;Los Veinte-cinco Ombues&quot; which was on the banks of the &quot;Arroyo Conchitas&quot; stream which flows into the Plata river in what is now Ingeniero Allan, Florencio Varela, Argentina.

In 1846, the family established at a &quot;pulpería&quot; further south, &quot;Las Acacias,&quot; in the surroundings of Chascomús, not far from the lake of the same name. In this natural environment, Hudson spent his youth studying the local flora and fauna and observing both natural and human dramas on what was then a lawless frontier. He was taught by three tutors who lived on the ranch. He became keenly interested in the life of the pampas, and grew up with gaucho herders, native Indians, settlers with whom he explored the pampas and developed a special love for Patagonia. At the age of fifteen he suffered from a serious typhus fever and still later suffered from rheumatic fever. At sixteen he read Gilbert White&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Selbourne&quot; and was deeply influenced to study natural history. In 1859, his mother, a devout Christian, died, and in the same year he read Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. From 1866, he collected bird skins for S. F. Baird at the Smithsonian Institution but he would note later the glory of birds in life and the ugliness of taxidermy. In 1866, he also served in the Argentinian army during the war with Paraguay. He later collected insect specimens for Hermann Burmeister in Buenos Aires and sent bird specimens to the Zoological Society of London from 1870. In 1870, he wrote his a series of nine letters on the &quot;ornithology of Buenos Ayres&quot; that were published by Philip Sclater in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Zoological Society.&quot; In his third letter of 1870 Hudson takes on some statements made by Darwin on Patagonian birds. Darwin noted that the woodpecker &quot;Colaptes campestris&quot; occurred on the Pampas where not a tree grew and Hudson argued that there were indeed trees on the La Plata and that in much vaster grassland areas, the woodpecker was never found. Darwin responded, accepting that he may have been mistaken in some of his observations but that there was no wilful error and clarified the location where he had made his observations. In 1872 Hudson sent specimens of birds from Patagonia, including a species Sclater would describe and name after Hudson as &quot;Cnipolegus hudsoni&quot; (spelling used in the paper)&quot;.&quot; Hudson was initially skeptical about evolution but he would later be a grudging evolutionist. 

Hudson saw the pampas being destroyed by European immigrants and in April 1874 he boarded the steamer &quot;Ebro&quot; to England. He slept in Hyde park after arrival and struggled to find employment. He met John Gould in the hope of finding work but found a cold response from Gould who was ill and the sight of dead hummingbirds all around sickened Hudson. He then sought to work as a genealogy researcher for a Chester Waters who turned out to be deeply indebted and unable to pay. In 1876, he married singer Emily (1829-1921) daughter of John Hanmer Wingrave and lived in her home at Southwick Crescent where she ran boarding houses. They later moved to rented rooms and she tried to make a living by giving music lessons. They later moved to a larger three-story house in Bayswater that Emily inherited. They lived in a flat and rented out the others which paid back their debts. They had no children. He struggled to make a living through writing and among the few that he managed to write was an article in a women&#x27;s magazine in 1876 that he wrote under the pseudonym Maud Merryweather. In 1880, he met Morley Roberts and through his connections he was able to contribute stories to magazines. He wrote several books including a two-volume work on &quot;Argentine Ornithology&quot; (1888), &quot;Idle Days in Patagonia&quot; (1893)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;The Naturalist in La Plata&quot; (1892)&quot;.&quot; He began to travel in England and wrote &quot;Nature in Downland&quot; (1900). His books on the English countryside, all of them set in Wiltshire, including &quot;Hampshire Days&quot; (1903), &quot;Afoot in England&quot; (1909), and &quot;A Shepherd&#x27;s Life&quot; (1910), which helped foster the back-to-nature movement of the 1920s and 1930s. He was a supporter of the Society for the Protection of Birds from its early days and was often the only man who sat in the meetings organized by Eliza Phillips. He later wrote some pamphlets for the organization in 1898 against the trade in plumes. Hudson became a British citizen in 1900 and in 1901 he received a Civil list pension of £150 per year for his writings on natural history. This was made possible by the influence Sir Edward and his wife Lady Dorothy Grey. 

Hudson was more than six feet tall and he loved to talk to people from rural working classes and would live among them during his travels in the countryside. Hudson was a friend of the late-19th century English author George Gissing, whom he met in 1889. They corresponded until the latter&#x27;s death in 1903, occasionally exchanging their publications, discussing literary and scientific matters, and commenting on their respective access to books and newspapers, a matter of supreme importance to Gissing. In September 1890, Morley Roberts, Gissing and Hudson went to Shoreham and were involved in rescuing three drowning girls even though Hudson could not swim. Other close friends included Cunninghame Graham. He campaigned (1900) against the building of the National Physical Laboratory in the grounds of Kew Gardens. He began to write fiction, his most popular work being &quot;Green&quot; &quot;Mansions&quot; (1904) which was set in a Venezuelan forest. In 1959 it was made into a movie. Other works of fiction included &quot;The Purple Land&quot; (1904), &quot;A Crystal Age&quot; (1906), &quot;Tales of the Pampas&quot; (1916), and &quot;A Little Boy Lost&quot; (1905). He wrote an autobiographical book &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918). In 1911, his wife became invalid and she was taken care of by nurse in Worthing, Sussex, until her death in 1921. Hudson lived in London with a weak heart and died on 18 August 1922, at 40 St Luke’s Road, Westbourne Park, Bayswater, and was buried in Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery, Worthing, on 22 August 1922, next to his wife, who had died early in 1921. He left some bequests but nearly his entire estate of £8225 was left to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (including earnings from his works) of which he was an early member. His Executors were the publisher Ernest Bell and Wynnard Hooper, a journalist. He wanted his notebooks and papers to be destroyed and did not want his life to be written about.

==Personal views==
Hudson was an advocate of Lamarckian evolution. Early in his life he was a critic of Darwinism and defended vitalism. He was influenced by the non-Darwinian evolutionary writings of Samuel Butler. Hudson considered himself an animist and although he was familiar with Christian tradition from his mother he did not belong to any denomination. 

==Recognition and awards==

In 1925, a memorial to him was inaugurated in Hyde Park by Stanley Baldwin. A stone panel made by Jacob Epstein depicting Rima from &quot;Green Mansions&quot;. The engravings are by the designer Eric Gill. It stands in the Hudson Memorial Bird Sanctuary in Hyde Park, not far from where he slept upon arrival to England. 

At the headquarters of the RSPB in Sandy, Bedfordshire, a portrait of Hudson painted by Frank Brooks hangs over the fireplace noting his role in the early days of the Society and for his bequest.

Ernest Hemingway referred to Hudson&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Land&quot; (1885) in his novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, and to &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; in his posthumous novel &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; (1986). He listed &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; in a suggested reading list for a young writer. Joseph Conrad stated that Hudson&#x27;s writing &quot;was like the grass that the good God made to grow and when it was there you could not tell how it came.&quot;

James Rebanks&#x27; 2015 book &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Life&quot; about a Lake District farmer was inspired by Hudson&#x27;s work of the same name: &quot;But even more than Orwell or Hemingway, W.H. Hudson turned me into a book obsessive ...&quot; (p. 115), and: &quot;One day, I pulled &quot;A Shepherd&#x27;s Life&quot; by W.H. Hudson from the bookcase ...and the sudden life-changing realization it gave me that we could be in books – great books.&quot; (p. 114)

In Argentina, Hudson is considered to belong to the national literature as &quot;Guillermo Enrique Hudson&quot;, the Spanish version of his name. A town in Berazategui Partido and several other public places and institutions are named after him. The town of Hudson in Buenos Aires Province is named for him.

==Works==
The complete collected works of Hudson produced in 1922-3 went to 24 volumes. Many of his works were translated into other languages. Hudson&#x27;s best-known novel is &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904), which was adapted into a film starring Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins, and his best-known non-fiction is &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918), which was also made into a film.

<text>The Institute for Social Research (, IfS) is a research organization for sociology and continental philosophy, best known as the institutional home of the Frankfurt School and critical theory. Currently a part of Goethe University Frankfurt, it has historically also been affiliated with Columbia University in New York City.

==History==

The Institute was founded in Frankfurt am Main in 1923, where it was (and once again is) affiliated with the University of Frankfurt am Main. It was founded by Felix Weil, a student of the Marxist philosopher Karl Korsch, with an endowment provided by Weil&#x27;s wealthy father Hermann Weil. Its first director, Kurt Albert Gerlach, who proposed the idea of creating the institute with Weil, died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by Carl Grünberg, a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow &quot;orthodox&quot; Marxists at the Institute, including his former pupil Henryk Grossman. Grünberg was followed by co-founder Friedrich Pollock.

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by Max Horkheimer. Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group&#x27;s journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung&quot; (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a critical theory of society.

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands. In 1933, after the rise of Hitler, the Institute left Germany for Geneva and then in 1934 moved to New York City. In New York it became affiliated with Columbia University, and its journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung&quot; was renamed &quot;Studies in Philosophy and Social Science&quot;. It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute&#x27;s residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work&#x27;s favorable reception in American and English academia.

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current acting director is Ferdinand Sutterlüty, who has followed on from Axel Honneth&#x27;s directorship of 2001 to 2018.

<text>Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (officially Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, also known as Victoria Terminus (VT), Bombay station code: CSMT (mainline)/ST (suburban)), is a historic railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

The terminus was designed by a British architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station, and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria&#x27;s rule.
In March 1996, the station&#x27;s name was officially changed from &quot;Victoria Terminus&quot; to &quot;Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus&quot; (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior king and the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire who founded the state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau. In 2017, the station was again renamed &quot;Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus&quot; (with code CSMT), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning, &quot;Great king; emperor.&quot; Both former initials &quot;VT&quot; and the current, &quot;CST&quot;, are also commonly used.

The terminus is the headquarters of India&#x27;s Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India, serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.

== History ==
=== Victoria Terminus ===
This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.

The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received as the payment for his services. Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig. The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to Scott&#x27;s second prize winning entry for Berlin&#x27;s parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome. The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.

The station took ten years to complete, the longest for any building of that era in Mumbai.

=== Missing statue ===

During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main façade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India. Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed &quot;Rani Baug&quot;) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed. The symbol of &quot;Progress&quot;, another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria.

=== Renaming ===

The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888 and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to &quot;Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus&quot; in honour of Shivaji, the founder and first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.

In December 2016, the Fadnavis Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names &quot;VT&quot; as well as &quot;CST&quot; along with the current name &quot;CSMT&quot; are popularly used.

=== 2008 Mumbai attacks ===

On 26 November 2008, two Pakistani terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was later caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The others did not survive. The attacks began around 21:30 when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire, The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others, their assault ending at about 22:45 after they exited the station via the North FOB towards the west to Cama hospital back entrance. The CCTV evidence was used to identify and indict Kasab. In 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death for his role in the attack, and in 2012 he was hanged.

== Structure ==

The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Externally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. The station stands as an example of 19th-century railway architectural marvels for its advanced structural and technical solutions. The CSMT was constructed using a high level of engineering both in terms of railway and civil engineering. It is one of the first and finest products of the use of industrial technology, merged with the Gothic Revival style in India. The centrally domed office structure has a 330-foot-long platform connected to a 1,200-foot-long train shed, and its outline provides the skeleton plan for the building. CSMT&#x27;s dome of dovetailed ribs, built without centering, was considered as a novel achievement of the era.

The interior of the building was conceived as a series of large rooms with high ceilings. It is a utilitarian building and has had various changes required by the users, not always sympathetic. It has a C-shaped plan which is symmetrical on an east–west axis. All the sides of the building are given equal value in the design. It is crowned by a high central dome, which acts as the focal point. The dome is an octagonal ribbed structure with a colossal female figure symbolising Progress, holding a torch pointing upwards in her right hand and a spoked wheel in her left hand. The side wings enclose the courtyard, which opens on to the street. The wings are anchored by monumental turrets at each of their four corners, which balance and frame the central dome. The façades present the appearance of well-proportioned rows of windows and arches. The ornamentation in the form of statuary, bas-reliefs, and friezes is exuberant yet well controlled. The columns of the entrance gates are crowned by figures of a lion (representing Great Britain) and a tiger (representing India). The main structure is built from a blend of India sandstone and limestone, while high-quality Italian marble was used for the key decorative elements. The main interiors are also decorated: the ground floor of the North Wing, known as the Star Chamber, which is still used as the booking office, is embellished with Italian marble and polished Indian blue stone. The stone arches are covered with carved foliage and grotesques. Internally, the ceiling of the booking hall was originally painted blue, gold and strong red on a ground of rich blue with gold stars. Its walls were lined with glazed tiles made by Maw &amp; Co of Britain. Outside, there are statues representing Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering and Science, with a statue representing Progress on the central dome of the station. The best time to visit CST is in the evening, because at this time the CST building is decorated with colourful lights, which looks very beautiful. Especially on 15 August and 26 January, there is light all around here.

== Platforms ==
CSMT has a total of 18 platforms—seven platforms are for suburban EMU trains and eleven platforms (Platform 8 to Platform 18) are for long-distance trains. Rajdhani, Duronto, Garib Rath and Tejas Express leave from Platform No. 18. Air-conditioned dormitories were inaugurated at CST on 16 April 2013. The facility has 58 beds for men and 20 for women.

== In popular culture ==

* The station was a filming location for the &quot;Jai Ho&quot; song in &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; and the 2011 Indian film &quot;Ra.One&quot;.

<text>The Konkan Railway (abbreviated KR) is one of the 19 railway zones in India with its headquarters at CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The first passenger train ran on Konkan railway tracks on 20 March 1993, between Udupi and Mangalore. During its initial years of operation in the mountainous Konkan region, a number of accidents prompted Konkan Railway to implement new technology. Anti-collision devices, the Sky Bus and roll-on/roll-off are several of the railway&#x27;s innovations. The long railway line connects the states of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. The first train on the completed track was sent off on 26 January 1998.

==History==

===Background===
For most of the modern era, the Konkan coast of India did not have a railway link connecting its coastal cities, towns and villages. Even the British who ruled India until 1947 did not build a railway along this route. The first proposal was surveyed in 1920. In 1957 an aerial survey was conducted of the area between Dasgaon, Raigad District in Maharashtra and Mangalore with the object of studying the possibilities of railway development in this region.

The long-pending demand of this region was fulfilled by George Fernandes who was the Railway minister in V.P. Singh&#x27;s government, backed by then Finance minister Madhu Dandavate and Vice Chairman of Planning Commission Ramakrishna Hegde. They set up Konkan Railway Corporation Limited headed by E.Sreedharan for executing Konkan railway line to tide over funds crunch of Indian Railways.

The first phase of the Konkan Railway was the section from Apta to Roha. It was cleared by the Planning Commission, and the project was included in the 1978-79 budget at an estimated cost of 11.19 billion. The length of the railway from Apta to Mangalore was estimated at , and its cost was estimated at 2.39 billion in 1976. The engineering and traffic survey for the West Coast Railway Line from Apta to Mangalore was conducted from 1970 to 1972. The final survey for the Apta-Roha-Dasgaon section was made in 1974–75.

===Challenges===
The project involved over 2,116 bridges (of which the Panvalnadi bridge was the highest viaduct in India till 2010, Now Jhajjhar Khad is the highest viaduct in India) and 92 tunnels and was the largest railway project of the century in Asia. A major challenge was land acquisition from about 43,000 landowners. When the Konkan Railway Corporation (KRCL) began asking people to surrender property which had belonged to them for generations, many (convinced of the project&#x27;s importance) did so voluntarily. This enabled the process to be completed in one year. The longest bridge is on the River Sharavathi, spanning and the longest Tunnel is in Karbude near Ratnagiri, stretching .

Terrain and the elements were challenging; flash floods, loose soil, landslides and tunnel collapses affected work at many places on the project. Thickly-forested construction sites were often visited by wild animals.

The route crosses three states (Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka), each of which agreed to provide financing. The authorised share capital was increased in 1996-1997 from 6 billion to 8 billion, with the government of India taking a 51-percent share; the rest went to Maharashtra (22 percent), Karnataka (15 percent), Kerala (6 percent) and Goa (6 percent).

Contracts for the project were given to construction firms which included Larsen &amp; Toubro who were given a major part of the project, Gammon India and Afcons. To speed up construction, piers for major bridges were cast on riverbanks itself and launched with pontoon-mounted cranes. This was India&#x27;s first use of incremental launch bridge-building. The greatest challenge was presented by the nine tunnels bored through soft soil, which required a slow, manual process. Excavation was difficult due to saturated clay and high water table. Tunnels collapsed immediately several times, requiring the work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost in the construction of the soft-soil tunnels alone, and a total of seventy-four people died during the railway&#x27;s construction. The compensation is being paid to the persons displaced due to Konkan Railway Project. The amount paid up till now is approx. Rs. 103 crores to about 39000 persons.

===Controversy===
In Goa, which makes up of the route, concerns were raised about the environmental and economic impact of the railway. According to opponents of the project, the coastal railway would destroy habitat, damage historical sites, and disrupt lives in the densely-populated state. In 1991, the Konkan Railway Re-Alignment Committee (KRRAC) organised protests against the proposed railway line. The KRRAC&#x27;s main points were that the proposal would flood coastal regions, destroy fertile land, harm the monuments of Old Goa, irreparably damage the marshes and mangrove swamps along the coast and the estuaries of the Mandovi and Zuari Rivers, and displace neighbourhoods along the coast. The committee proposed an alternative hinterland alignment passing through relatively-unpopulated regions, which would extend the line by about but reduce environmental damage.
But the hinterland alignment was rejected by the Konkan Railway Corporation because it would substantially lengthen &amp; divert the line, deny rail access to Goa&#x27;s population centers, and delay and increase the costs of construction. The KRRAC, which had become a political movement, filed public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court in March 1992 seeking an injunction on construction work and diversion of the line through the hinterland alignment. The high court dismissed the petition the following month, ruling that The Konkan Railway Re-Alignment Committee (KRRAC) now under new name Save Konkan Ecology Forum (SKEF) is strictly &amp; violently opposing Doubling &amp; Electrification Works of Konkan Railway Line, planned by Indian Railways in 2014/2015, citing concerns about the environmental and economic impact, destruction habitat, damage historical sites, and disrupt lives in the densely-populated state. Maharashtra, Karnataka &amp; Kerala Governments had given Green signal for doubling &amp; electrification of Konkan Railway Line in 2015/2016.

===Completion===
In March 1993, the southern between Thokur, from Mangalore, (now Mangaluru) and Udupi in Karnataka entered service, followed by the northern section between Roha and Veer in Maharashtra in June of that year. The first passenger train on the route ran between Mangalore and Udupi on 20 March 1993. The service was extended by from Veer to Khed in March 1995, and by a further from Khed to Sawantwadi Road in December 1996. The Southern service was extended by from Udupi to Kundapur in January 1995, and by a further to Pernem in Goa in August 1997.

Through services between Mumbai and Mangalore remained on hold due to a problematic tunnel at Pernem, which experienced repeated cave-ins and flooding. The tunnel was finally completed in January 1998, six years after its construction began. Through services on the line began after the inauguration of the full stretch from Roha to Mangalore on 26 January 1998. Passenger service on the full route, between Mumbai and Mangalore, began in May 1998.
==Improvements==
===Track doubling===
According to a study by the railway, track doubling is possible on about which runs on the plains. Several stretches on the line can be converted to double track, such as the line from Roha to Veer, which is now doubled. The stretch between Udupi and Mangalore is another candidate. The track from Madure to Vaibhavwadi Road is entirely flat terrain and can easily be converted into Double Track. The track from Panvel Junction to Roha has been doubled.

On 3 November 2015, Konkan Railway senior official Bhanu P. Tayal announced to the press that track-doubling and electrification would begin on 8 November in Kolad. Life Insurance Corporation offered a favourable 2.5 billion loan, and other funding would be available. The project, expected to cost 100 billion, was scheduled for completion by 2020. In October 2018, the railway announced that the stretch between Roha and Veer would have two tracks by December 2019.

Matsyagandha Express ( Train number 02619 run as special) travelling from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Mumbai (LTT) to Mangaluru Central (MAQ) became the first train to take the Roha-Veer double line on Konkan railway route on 30 August 2021.

===Electrification===
The foundation stone laying for electrification of the Konkan railway line was done in November 2015. The entire 741 kilometer route stretching from Roha, Maharashtra to Thokur, Karnataka has been electrified in March 2022. Inspection of the entire stretch was completed in six phases starting in March 2020. The last stretch between Ratnagiri and Thivim was inspected on March 24 and authorisation was obtained on 29 March.

===New stations===
The railway was scheduled to have new crossing stations at Indapur, Goregaon Road, Sape Wamne, Kalambani Budruk, Kadavai, Veravali, Saundal, Kharepatan Road, Achirne, Mirjan and Innanje by December 2019. Most of these stations are operational now.

==Operations==

The railway has a total track length of . Its length through Maharashtra is , through Karnataka , and through Goa.

===Passenger===
The route is popular with passengers due to its connectivity with regions hitherto inaccessible by rail and the substantial time savings for travellers between western and southern India. Several trains which had taken circuitous routes ran on the Konkan Railway, reducing running time. The first of these was the Mumbai-Mangalore Netravati Express (later extended to Trivandrum), which was diverted to the Konkan Railway on 1 March 1998; this was followed by the Thiruvananthapuram Rajdhani Express on 1 April of that year. The Matsyagandha Express, running from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus to Mangalore, began service on 1 May 1998. The Hazrat Nizamuddin-Mangalore Mangala Lakshadweep Express was diverted to the route and extended to Ernakulam Junction on 1 August 1998. The Pune-Ernakulam Junction Express was introduced on 25 February 1999. The Marusagar Express, which runs between Jaipur and Ernakulam Junction and was extended to Ajmer via the Konkan Railway, began service on 12 October 2001. The Jan Shatabdi Express was flagged off between Mumbai and Madgaon (the longest-running Jan Shatabdi) on 16 April 2002 to commemorate Indian Railways&#x27; 150th anniversary. On 1 February 2008, a Garib Rath Express between the Kochuveli railway station in Thiruvananthapuram and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus began service.

The Tejas Express is the first semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train fleet introduced by Indian Railways, with modern on-board facilities. Its inaugural run was on 24 May 2017 from Mumbai&#x27;s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Karmali railway station in Goa. It covered 552 km (342 mi) in eight hours and 30 minutes.

The Mumbai CSMT–Madgaon Vande Bharat Express semi-high-speed train, was also introduced by Indian Railways, with modern on-board facilities. Its inaugural run was on 27 June 2023 from Mumbai&#x27;s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Madgaon Junction railway station in Goa. It covers 581 km (361 mi) in eight hours.

===Freight===
Freight response to the railway was lukewarm, prompting its corporation to consider reducing its rates. With an outstanding debt of 33.75 billion, the KRCL was counting on freight traffic for revenue. To attract freight traffic, the corporation began advertising to industries on the route.

The corporation introduced roll-on/roll-off (RORO) service, a road-rail system, on the section between Kolad (Maharashtra) and Verna, Goa in 1999; it was extended to the Surathkal railway station in Karnataka in 2004. The RORO service, the first of its kind in India, allowed trucks to be transported on flatcars. It has been popular, carrying about 1.6 million trucks and earning over 1.2 billion by 2009.

==Safety==
The terrain and weather of the Konkan region have caused problems for the railway. During the 1998 monsoon, torrential rains triggered landslides which washed away tracks and disrupted service. Despite the corporation&#x27;s efforts to address the problems through engineering (such as protective netting along cuttings to prevent boulders from rolling onto the tracks), the problems recurred each year.

The line&#x27;s first major accident occurred on the night of 22 June 2003, when a landslide derailed a Karwar–Mumbai express train at the entrance to a tunnel. Fifty-one people died as a result of the accident, and others were injured. As a result, the corporation was severely criticised for failing to take adequate safety measures in the landslide-prone region. An inquiry reported that the cause of the accident was the failure of a cutting due to the lack of monsoon patrolling. The findings were disputed by the corporation, which said that the lack of monsoon patrolling did not lead to the accident (which was due to forces of nature). Shortly after the accident, however, the corporation announced that it would enhance safety measures on the route.

Barely a year later, the measures were found inadequate when a second major accident occurred on 16 June 2004. A Mangalore–Mumbai Matsyaganda Express derailed and fell off a bridge after striking boulders on the tracks, killing 20 people. Again, the corporation insisted that the accident was due to forces of nature. Questions were then raised about the safety and reliability of the Konkan Railway. An inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety ruled that the accident was caused by the &quot;falling of boulders and earth&quot; on the tracks. After the report was issued, the corporation implemented its recommendations. These included reducing train speeds during the monsoon to from and engineering measures such as boulder netting, shotcreting, rock bolting, micropiling and vetiver plantations along the line to improve safety.

A goods train carrying fertilizers derailed between Diwankhavti and Khed stations (83/7Km) at 15:57 on 10 May 2020. This happened during COVID-19 lockdown when regular passenger and goods trains were stopped by Central or Union government of India. There was no injury or casualty. Traffic resumed on the railway on 13 May 2020 at 09:15.

<text>Virginia (1913) is a novel by Ellen Glasgow about a wife and mother who in vain seeks happiness by serving her family. This novel, her eleventh, marked a clear departure from Glasgow&#x27;s previous work—she had written a series of bestsellers before publishing &quot;Virginia&quot;—in that it attacked, in a subtle yet unmistakable way, the very layer of society that constituted her readership. Also, as its heroine, though virtuous and god-fearing, is denied the happiness she is craving, its plot did not live up to readers&#x27; expectations as far as poetic justice is concerned and was bound to upset some of them. Today, &quot;Virginia&quot; is seen by many as an outstanding achievement in Glasgow&#x27;s career, exactly because the author defied literary convention by questioning the foundations of American society around the dawn of the 20th century, be it capitalism, religion or racism.

==Plot==
Born in 1864 to a clergyman and his dutiful wife, Virginia grows up as a Southern belle in the town of Dinwiddie, Virginia. Her education is strictly limited to the bare minimum, with anything that might disturb her quiet and comfortable existence vigorously avoided. Thus prepared for life, Virginia falls for the first handsome young man who crosses her path—Oliver Treadwell, the black sheep of a family of capitalist entrepreneurs who, during the time of Reconstruction, brought industry and the railroad to the South. Oliver, who has been abroad and has only recently arrived in Dinwiddie, is a dreamer and an intellectual. An aspiring playwright, his literary ambitions are more important to him than money, and he refuses his uncle&#x27;s offer to work in his bank. However, when Virginia falls in love with him he realizes that he must be able to support a family, and eventually accepts his uncle&#x27;s offer to work for the railroad.

The young couple get married and have three children, a boy and two girls. Gradually perfecting her household skills, Virginia is able to get by on very little money. When, after many years, Oliver&#x27;s first play is put on the stage in New York City, his expectations are high. However, the show is a complete failure as the play is far too intellectual and radical for a Broadway audience who wants to be entertained rather than reformed. Reading about the flop in the local newspaper, Virginia for the first time in her life leaves her children, asking her mother to take care of them for a day or two, and takes the night train to New York to be with, and console, her husband—only to be rejected by him, who is in a state of severe depression. When he has recovered from the shock, Oliver makes yet another concession to society and public taste and starts writing &quot;trash&quot;.

Throughout the years, Virginia leads a vicarious life: She is happy when her husband and children are happy; she makes sure their clothes are in perfect condition while neglecting her own outward appearance; and she is eager to provide for her children the education she herself has been denied. When, at one point, she realizes that the women her age whom she has known since childhood still look quite young while she has aged prematurely, she quickly persuades herself to believe that a life of altruistic subservience is more than worthwhile, that living and acting the way she does is her duty and God&#x27;s will. Her father&#x27;s sudden if honourable death—he unsuccessfully tries to prevent the lynching of an innocent young African American and is stabbed in the process by an angry and drunken young man—adds to the gloom that starts creeping into her life, especially when she sees that, as a widow, her mother suddenly loses all her will to live. When she dies only a few months after her husband, Virginia has a premonition that her own fate when losing Oliver could be a similar one.

Meanwhile, Oliver&#x27;s first successful play—a trashy one—premières in New York, with some more to follow in quick succession, and, as the money keeps pouring in, the family move into a bigger house in Dinwiddie. They now employ a number of servants, including an African American butler. With the children gone—their son and one daughter are at college, while the other daughter has married a much older widower with two grown-up children and has also flown the nest—and Oliver frequently in New York to supervise the staging of his plays, Virginia&#x27;s life becomes increasingly empty. Having &quot;outlived her usefulness&quot;, the days seem endless to her, and with all the servants about the house there is absolutely no housework for her to do either. Now in her mid-forties, Virginia for the first time in her life spends Christmas alone at home.

The biggest blow, however, is yet to come: When she accompanies Oliver to New York for a première, she finds out to her dismay that he has been betraying her with a famous actress who stars in one of his plays. For the last time summoning up all her courage, she takes a taxi and pays her an unexpected call but immediately realizes when talking to her that she has no chance of winning her husband back. Without many words, Oliver asks her to let him divorce her, but clinging to the only thing she has left in her life—her marriage—she refuses. The novel ends on a somewhat optimistic note when Virginia, again alone in the empty house in Dinwiddie, receives a letter from her son telling her that he is going to leave Oxford before he has completed his two-year course at the university in order to come back and stay with his mother.

<doc id="287659" wikidata="Q7790241" url="?curid=287659" title="Thomas Guide">
<text>Thomas Guide is a series of paperback, spiral-bound atlases featuring detailed street maps of various large metropolitan areas in the United States, including Boise, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Phoenix, Portland, Reno-Tahoe, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson, and Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Road Atlas titles are Arizona including Las Vegas, California Including portions of Nevada, and Pacific Northwest covering Washington, Oregon, Western Idaho, Southwestern British Columbia. The map books are usually arranged by county; for example, separate &quot;Thomas Guides&quot; have been published for Los Angeles County and San Diego County. There are also guides that will have two or three counties combined (for example, Los Angeles and Orange County), or guides that cover a metropolitan area (for instance, the San Francisco Bay Area). Each guide has a detailed index of streets and points of interest, as well as arterial maps for easy page location.

&quot;Thomas Guides&quot; were a local icon in Southern California for decades, with many companies including the &quot;Thomas Guide&quot; map grid information for their locations in Yellow Pages listings and other advertisements.

==History==
=== 1915: Creation in Oakland, CA ===
Thomas Bros. Maps, the publishers of the &quot;Thomas Guide&quot;, previously known as &quot;Popular Street Atlas&quot;, &quot;Street Guide&quot;, and &quot;Popular Atlas&quot;, was started in Oakland, California, in 1915 by cartographer George Coupland Thomas and his two brothers, who were business partners. Early publications were detailed block maps, bird eye view of communities, road &amp; highway maps, and what would be generally referred as generalized tourist maps. Thomas Bros. also produced redlining maps of Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, and the East Bay for the US government-sponsored Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation in the 1930s.

The company relocated its headquarters to Los Angeles in 1940. The company had grown to publish street maps of cities in several Western states; these maps were sold in fold-out, card stock covers. By the late 1940s, the company had added pocket-sized guidebooks of California and the city of San Francisco which included fold-out maps attached to the inner rear cover. The first street guides, which were initially pocket sized paperback booklets also began to appear at about this time, and were introduced for several counties in California, and one in Washington.

=== Acquisition by Warren B. Wilson; digital age ===
After George Coupland Thomas died in 1955, the company was acquired by Coupland Thomas&#x27;s family lawyer Warren B. Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s brother Lionel would later become mayor of Oakland.

During the California home development boom of the late 1970s, Wilson moved the company to a newly-built state-of-the-art design building in an industrial park in Irvine, California, in early 1980. For 40 years, Wilson served as CEO and owner of Thomas Bros. Maps (TBM) and was responsible for leading the company into the digital age. Starting in the 1990s, Wilson hired many CEOs to run the company to give him more time for traveling and studying his love of art.

After conversion and completion of all of their pen and ink map atlases to digital format in the mid-1990s, map data became a significant part of TBM company sales. The company had large data contracts in the 1990s with the California Highway Patrol, large utilities, and many area cities and counties. The Thomas Brothers map database had a monopoly in the 1990s, since they had the best street address indexes in them, making them very good for address matching for businesses.

=== Acquisition by Rand McNally; decline ===
Because sales of its last produced guidebooks for Washington, D.C., and Virginia did not sell as expected and much money was lost on the website store design, the company was in major debt. The company also intended to conquer the East Coast, but failed to compete against existing mapmakers there. It was purchased by and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rand McNally in 1999.

The company made radical changes in operation beginning in November 2003, and let go many of Thomas Brothers&#x27; most skilled cartographers and employees. The Rand McNally CEO announced all Irvine data edits would be outsourced to Bangalore, India. The remaining Irvine employees would send and manage the data to and from India and check the map work India editors did before publishing.

After January 2004, many important things in the guides were cut to save money. The valued POI index was no longer updated. Thinner and cheaper paper was used in the map guides. The Irvine source department was closed and no customer corrections were taken or recorded. Many guides were no longer printed yearly. The book name was dropped to just &quot;Thomas Guide&quot; and colors changed to match Rand McNally colors and product line releases. The popular map store was closed at the Irvine building, which was the last TBM store to close as they had they shut the ones in San Francisco, downtown Los Angeles, and the South Coast Plaza Mall years earlier. The map guides still sell, but the famous digital map database is now outdated. Rand McNally now buys their map data and updates from the big map digital data companies like Tele Atlas and Navteq. They overlay the new streets on their old database for publication.

Rand McNally/TBM no longer has any employees or customer service in California, after laying off the final Irvine headquarters employees in 2009.

An updated Thomas Guide for Los Angeles and Orange Counties was published in 2021, three years after its previous update. Larry Thomas, majority owner of the Thomas Maps brand, noted that California state legislation requires police and fire vehicles to carry Thomas Guides, and that the brand sold 1,000 to 1,500 guides per year.

== Technical and technological development ==

From the early days until the late 1970s, draftsmen, not cartographers, annually compiled and updated maps. Maps were drawn in various scales and sizes. As communities infilled and expanded during the post-war period, this presented problems because the early base maps did not account for the Earth&#x27;s curvature. Large wall maps were mosaics of smaller units making street alignment interesting. Easter-egg, or deliberate errors, were included on maps to help protect copyrights. These bugs usually were lakes, parks, or other fictitious landmarks; fictitious streets (&quot;trap streets&quot;) were avoided due to extensive use by emergency services.

In the growth period of the early 1990s the company led the way and did a lot of new innovative things in the map industry. They were the first map company to start a map education foundation that trained teachers on geography and interesting map lessons and donated map materials to area schools. They were also the first map publishing company to set up a computer map database that could have sections checked out by cartographers, updated, and then checked back in to a live digital map library with date stamps to keep track of what was edited. They also solved many software digital mapping problems that other companies still use today, and they were the first map company to set up a digital map page and grid look-up system for the whole world. Many long-time TBM map book users can still recite what page and grid they live on, even if they stopped using the map books years ago.

==Products==

Thomas Guide atlases are sometimes referred to as a &quot;Thomas Brothers&quot; (for &quot;Thomas Bros. Maps&quot;). However, &quot;Thomas Guides&quot; are so commonly used in Southern California that governments, businesses, individuals and even emergency response agencies will often refer to a &quot;Thomas Guide&quot; page number and map grid to help specify a location.

Businesses often use the large &quot;Thomas Guide&quot; wall maps. One common use for the wall maps is for delivery businesses, such as a local pizza restaurant. In addition, custom versions of the guides and wall maps are produced for businesses and governments that include such things as census tracts, locations of government facilities, watershed boundaries, and political boundaries.

There are also CD-ROM digital editions of the &quot;Thomas Guide&quot; atlases available (Microsoft Windows only). In addition, the Thomas Brothers digital database can be licensed to companies and governments to use as a base map for geographical information systems applications.

Updated editions are released annually, although according to interviews with former employees responsible for product updates, actual map content for some titles is updated only every other year. (Product covers are updated every year, even if map content has not changed.) Folding map products are created as a derivative of the Thomas Guides, which carry the Rand McNally name, but mention that the content is from the Thomas Guides. Rand McNally also releases Thomas Guide-like Street Guides and traditional fold-out versions of maps covering regions of North America not covered by the Thomas Guides.

A wide variety of products were produced for sales planning, dispatching, routing, real estate listings and territorial assignments. Besides the regular annual street atlases, they also produced wall maps, Zip Code guides, Rock Products Zones, and Census Tract editions.

<text>Windsor Davies (28 August 1930 – 17 January 2019) was a British actor. He is best remembered for playing Battery Sergeant Major Williams in the sitcom &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; (1974–1981) over its entire run. The show&#x27;s popularity resulted in Davies and his co-star Don Estelle achieving a UK number-one hit with a version of &quot;Whispering Grass&quot; in 1975. He later starred with Donald Sinden in &quot;Never the Twain&quot; (1981–1991), and his deep Welsh-accented voice was heard extensively in advertising voice-overs.

==Early life==
Davies was born on 28 August 1930 in Canning Town, East London, to Welsh parents. In 1940 they returned to their native village of Nant-y-moel, Glamorgan. Davies studied at Ogmore Grammar School and worked as a coal miner. He performed his National Service in Libya and Egypt, with the East Surrey Regiment, between 1950 and 1952. Following teacher training at Bangor Teacher Training College, he taught English and Maths at Leek in Staffordshire, and at a school in Elephant and Castle, south London.

Davies had become active in amateur dramatics, including the Bromley Little Theatre, and took a short drama course with a Kew theatre company. He became a professional actor at the age of 31 and began working at the Cheltenham repertory theatre in 1961.

==Career==
=== Television ===
Davies&#x27; best known role was as Battery Sergeant Major Williams in the British sitcom &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; (1974–1981), who was modelled on similar individuals Davies had met as a soldier during his national service. &quot;Bastards, real bastards some of them were. They knew it, too, and took pride in it,&quot; he once said. Among his character&#x27;s catchphrases was &quot;Shut Up!!&quot;, delivered as an eardrum-shattering military scream. Another phrase was &quot;Oh dear, how sad, never mind&quot;, delivered in a dry, ironic manner, and used when others around him had problems. Journalist Neil Clark, contributing to &quot;The Times&quot; in 2005, described his performance as the &quot;definitive portrayal of a bullying and uneducated sergeant-major&quot; and reported Spike Milligan was of the opinion that Davies&#x27; role was &quot;the funniest comic performance he had ever&quot; watched. Davies and co-star Don Estelle had a number-one hit in the UK with a semicomic version of &quot;Whispering Grass&quot; in 1975.

His other television roles included the sailor Taffy in the first of the BBC series &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; (1971), a boat captain in an episode of &quot;Special Branch,&quot; a special branch detective in &quot;Callan&quot; (1972), and the antique dealer Oliver Smallbridge in &quot;Never the Twain&quot; (1981–1991), with Donald Sinden. In the field of science fiction television, Davies appeared in the 1967 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; as Toby; and was the voice of Sergeant Major Zero (a spherical robotic soldier in charge of 100 other spherical robotic soldiers) in the 1983 Gerry Anderson-Christopher Burr production &quot;Terrahawks&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1976 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

In September–October 1985, Davies played the lead role of George Vance, a museum custodian elevated to the peerage, in the six-part BBC Two comedy series &quot;The New Statesman&quot;. This was based on the play by Douglas Watkinson and is not to be confused with the later sitcom of the same name. (Colin Blakely played the role of Vance in a pilot episode transmitted on BBC2 in December 1984.)

Davies also featured in the BBC comedy sitcom &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot;, written by David Croft and Richard Spendlove, as the Lord Mayor in an episode broadcast in 1997. He also featured in an episode of 2 Point 4 Children in 1999, as Ben&#x27;s long-lost Uncle Ion.

===Films===
In the cinema, Davies played major roles in two &quot;Carry On&quot; films, &quot;Behind&quot; (1975) and &quot;England&quot; (1976), in the latter again as a sergeant major. He played Mog in the Welsh rugby film &quot;Grand Slam&quot; (1978), and was a sergeant in the Highland Regiment in &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot; (1973) with Jim Dale and Spike Milligan. In 1989, he revived the role of Sergeant Major Williams in a 30-minute Royal Air Force training film, &quot;Hazardous Ops&quot;.

===Pantomime===
Davies appeared as Baron Hardup in the pantomime&quot; Cinderella&quot; in Bournemouth, UK, from 10 December 1992 to 17 January 1993.

===Voice work===
Davies&#x27; distinctive voice was heard in commercials for New Zealand&#x27;s Pink Batts house insulations and confectionery ads for Cadbury&#x27;s Wispa and for Heinz Curried (Baked) Beans. He also appeared alongside New Zealand rugby union coach Alex Wyllie in New Zealand advertisements for Mitre 10 hardware stores in the early 1990s. Davies and Wyllie had worked together previously on the rugby-themed film &quot;Old Scores&quot; in 1991.

In the 1970s, he read an edition of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Morning Story&quot; programme, and also narrated the audiobook for the Ladybird children&#x27;s classic &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. He sang and voiced many characters in the Paul McCartney film &quot;Rupert and the Frog Song&quot; in 1984, and appeared in that year&#x27;s children&#x27;s film &quot;Gabrielle and the Doodleman&quot; as three different characters (the Ringmaster, the Black Knight, and an Ugly Sister). In 1984, he auditioned to be the voice of the UK&#x27;s speaking clock. 

==Personal life and death==
In 1957, he married Eluned Lynne Evans; the couple had four daughters and a son. Eluned died in September 2018. Davies lived in the south of France, and was a keen birdwatcher.
Davies was an amateur organist and occasionally played at Capel Y Cymru London.

He died on 17 January 2019, aged 88, four months following the death of his wife. His estate was valued at £883,000.

<text>The dunlin (Calidris alpina) is a small wader in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot;. The English name is a dialect form of &quot;dunling&quot;, first recorded in 1531–1532. It derives from &quot;dun&quot;, &quot;dull brown&quot;, with the suffix &quot;-ling&quot;, meaning a person or thing with the given quality.

It is a circumpolar breeder in Arctic or subarctic regions. Birds that breed in western Europe are short-distance migrants largely staying on western and southern European and northwest African coasts; those breeding in far northern Europe and Asia are long-distance migrants, wintering south to Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East. Birds that breed in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic migrate short distances to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, although those nesting in northern Alaska overwinter in Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The dunlin was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tringa alpina&quot;. Linnaeus specified the location as Lapland. This species was formerly placed (with the other &quot;stints&quot;) by some American authors in the genus &quot;Erolia&quot;, but is now placed with 23 other sandpipers in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; that was introduced in 1804 by the German naturalist Blasius Merrem. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;alpina &quot; is from Latin and means &quot;of high mountains&quot;, in this case referring to alpine tundra habitats generally, rather than the Alps specifically.

Ten subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;C. a. arctica&quot; — breeds in northeast Greenland. Smallest subspecies, short-billed; silvery upperparts with minimal rufous; small black belly patch.
*&quot;C. a. schinzii&quot; — breeds in southeast Greenland, Iceland, the British Isles, southern Scandinavia &amp; the Baltic. Browner upperparts; small black belly patch.
*&quot;C. a. alpina&quot; — breeds in northern Scandinavia, Svalbard, and northwest Siberia
*&quot;C. a. centralis&quot; — breeds in north-central and northeast Siberia
*&quot;C. a. sakhalina&quot; — breeds in eastern Russia to the Chukchi Peninsula
*&quot;C. a. kistchinski&quot; — breeds around the Sea of Okhotsk to Kuril Islands and Kamchatka
*&quot;C. a. actites&quot; — breeds on Sakhalin
*&quot;C. a. arcticola&quot; — breeds from northwest Alaska to northwest Canada
*&quot;C. a. pacifica&quot; — breeds in western and southern Alaska
*&quot;C. a. hudsonia&quot; — breeds in central Canada

An adult dunlin in breeding plumage shows the distinctive black belly which no other similar-sized wader possesses. In winter, dunlins are grayish-brown above and white below. Juveniles are brown above with two weak whitish &quot;V&quot; shapes on the back, though less obvious than the same feature on little stint and some other species in the genus. They usually have black marks on the flanks or belly. All ages show a narrow white wingbar in flight. The legs and slightly decurved bill are black. The subspecies differ mainly in the extent of rufous plumage and the size of the black belly patch in the breeding season, and the bill length; in winter there are no subspecific distinctions in the plumage, with only the bill length providing a limited guide. Bill length varies between sexes, the females having longer bills than the males, further complicating winter subspecies identification. On the tip of the Dunlin&#x27;s bill is a soft covering that fills with blood and with many nerve endings, forming a sensitive probe that is used to locate invertebrate prey in mud and sand. Although the bill can look sharp-pointed in dead specimens, in life it is blunt.

The call is a typical sandpiper &quot;chreep&quot;, and the display song a harsh trill.

==Distribution and habitat==
Dunlin are small migratory waders, however they show strong philopatry with individuals of the southern subspecies &quot;Calidris alpina schinzii&quot; in Sweden and Finland returning to, or very close to, their natal patches. Habitat fragmentation has reduced the availability of habitat patches to these birds through reducing patch size and increasing patch isolation. This reduced connectivity between patches has reduced the movements of Dunlin leaving them more susceptible to inbreeding in these locations.

==Behaviour==
The dunlin is highly gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches. Large numbers can often be seen swirling in synchronized flight on stop-overs during migration or on their winter habitat.

This bird is one of the most common waders throughout its breeding and wintering ranges, and it is the species with which other waders tend to be compared. At length and with a wingspan, it is similar in size to a common starling, but stouter, with a longer, thicker bill.

The dunlin moves along the coastal mudflat beaches it prefers with a characteristic &quot;sewing machine&quot; feeding action, methodically picking small food items. Insects form the main part of the dunlin&#x27;s diet on the nesting grounds; it eats molluscs, worms and crustaceans in coastal areas.

===Breeding===
The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with vegetation, into which typically four eggs are laid and incubated by the male and female parents. Chicks are precocial, but are brooded during early development. They start to fly at approximately three weeks of age. The majority of brood care is provided by the male, as the female deserts the brood and often leaves the breeding area.

Apparent hybrids between this species and the white-rumped sandpiper as well as with the purple sandpiper have been reported from the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe, respectively.

==Status==
The dunlin has an extremely large range and although the population appears to be decreasing, the population is still very large. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has judged that the threat to the species is of &quot;Least concern&quot;. The dunlin is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The southern subspecies &quot;C. a. schinzii&quot; is of particular concern, declining and endangered in some areas, particularly towards the southern edge of its range; in Denmark, only 95 pairs were left in 2021, compared to 50,000 pairs a century earlier. The northeast Greenland subspecies &quot;C. a. arctica&quot; is also endangered, with a very small population.

<text>San Pablo, officially the City of San Pablo (), is a component city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 285,348 people.

The city is also known as the &quot;City of Seven Lakes&quot; (), referring to the Seven Lakes of San Pablo: Lake Sampaloc (or Sampalok), Lake Palakpakin, Lake Bunot, Lakes Pandin and Yambo, Lake Muhikap, and Lake Calibato.

San Pablo was part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa beginning in 1910. On November 28, 1967, it became an independent diocese and became the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pablo.

==Etymology==
San Pablo is derived from the Spanish for Saint Paul, referring to the local patron saint, Paul the First Hermit. It was previously known as &quot;San Pablo de los Montes&quot;, which translates to &quot;Saint Paul of the Mountains&quot; in Spanish.

==History==
San Pablo&#x27;s earliest historical record dates back to pre-Spanish times when four large barrios bounded by Mount Makiling composed of settlements, the most prominent of which was &quot;Sampalok&quot; (Sampaloc). In 1571, the first Spanish troops under Captain Juan de Salcedo arrived in the upland village of Sampaloc. It was noted by Father Joaquin Martinez de Zuñiga that its original inhabitants were Aetas and were ruled by four chieftains.

San Pablo became a parish in 1586, and then a municipality in 1647, and was renamed &quot;San Pablo de los Montes&quot; in honor of Saint Paul the First Hermit.

Augustinian friar, Father Hernando Cabrera built the first church made of wood. It was noted that the sacristy of this church was ornamented and contained silver, which rivalled and even surpassed that of Spain.

In 1756, it was placed under the jurisdiction of Batangas province but was returned to Laguna in 1883.
In 1899, a municipal government was established, with Atty. Innocente Martinez as municipal president. Marcos Paulino was elected municipal president in 1902 when the civil government was set up. From 1926 to 1940, the people of San Pablo worked for its independence from the province of Laguna.

On May 7, 1940, the Charter Bill sponsored by Assemblyman Tomas D. Dizon of Laguna&#x27;s 1st district was approved by President Manuel L. Quezon. The bill became known as the City Charter of San Pablo or Commonwealth Act No. 520, approved by President Quezon.

The city was inaugurated on March 30, 1941, with Potenciano Malvar, a former governor of Laguna, as the city mayor appointed by president Manuel L. Quezon. Succeeding him in 1941 as an appointed mayor was Manuel Quisumbing, in turn followed by Tomas D. Dizon in 1943 as an appointed mayor. The succeeding mayors were elected after 1955, with Cipriano B. Colago being the first elected city mayor.

==Geography==
San Pablo is located in the southern portion of Laguna province, southeast of Manila via Alaminos and southwest of Santa Cruz via Calauan.

By land area, it is the largest in Laguna province; by population, it is the sixth largest, after the cities of Calamba, Santa Rosa, Biñan, San Pedro, and Cabuyao.

San Pablo has a cool climate owing to its location. It is located in the foothills of three mountains: Mount Banahaw, Mount Makiling and the Sierra Madre Mountains within the Laguna Volcanic Field, also known as the San Pablo Volcanic Field.

The climate and soil are suitable for agriculture. The different barangays have plantations for coconuts, lanzones fruit (&quot;Lansium parasiticum&quot;), and rambutan fruit.

=== Climate ===
The prevailing climatic conditions in the city is categorized into wet and dry seasons.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 census, San Pablo had a population of 285,348 people, up from 266,068 people in the 2015 census. The city was once the largest city in Laguna, but it was overtaken by Calamba in the 1990 census. San Pedro followed suit in 1995, then came Santa Rosa and Biñan in 2007, and Cabuyao in 2015, all owing their growth to its proximity to Metro Manila.

===Ethnicity and language===
The language spoken in the city and the medium of instruction in schools are English and Filipino, also known as Tagalog in this area.

== Economy ==

At the end of the 20th century and the start of the 21st century, economic development shifted from San Pablo to western Laguna. San Pedro, Biñan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, Calamba, Los Baños, and Santa Cruz experienced rapid economic development brought about by local and foreign investments, the rapid growth of industrial estates and export processing zones, and the placement of major institutions in those areas, San Pablo City was left behind and remained a semi-developed residential community.

Despite the fact that the city was partly touched by economic development, San Pablo boasts itself as a potential eco-tourism destination in the province. However, given its human and land resources, various BPO companies are seriously looking at developing the city into the ICT hub of Southern Luzon. Although there were previous attempts to build a similar establishment, SM Prime Holdings was given its go signal in July 2008 to push ahead for SM City San Pablo located at Riverina Commercial Estates along Maharlika Highway at Barangay San Rafael.
Apart from this, the development of the Hacienda Escudero plantation resort town and nearby real estates, which is a joint venture with Landco, is by far the largest planned community investment in the city covering : It will include resort type communities; the original Villa Escudero Plantations as the center-piece; commercial establishments like a mall, hotels, and a convention center to be built relative to the distinctive architecture theme of the original Villa Escudero. As such &quot;Hacienda Escudero&quot; will become the ultimate history town themed community in this part of the country.

ABS-CBN TV-46 San Pablo (DWLY-TV) served the city through its office along Rizal Avenue at the heart of the city until its operations was shut down in 2020.

San Pablo also claims the title &quot;City of Buko Pie&quot;, although other neighboring towns are also known for producing the delicacy. Colettes&#x27; Buko Pie, based in San Pablo, was known for experimenting with different variants of the delicacy. Colette&#x27;s has also regularly produced the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Buko Pie&quot; during San Pablo&#x27;s Coco Festival. Colette&#x27;s is the largest Buko Pie brand in the Laguna area with 34 stores. The supply of coconut in San Pablo makes it an ideal spot for putting up buko pie shops.

Franklin Baker Company, one of the well-known companies with operations in San Pablo, has announced that its plant in the city would cease its operations and transfer to another existing facility, owned by the said company, in Davao del Sur by December 2008. The said decision could affect the jobs of at least 1,200 people, the majority of them San Pableños. Various factors are blamed for this closure, including the conversion of big coconut farms into residential areas. However, production was restored in the first quarter of 2009 in the San Pablo plant of Franklin Baker Company due to processing problems encountered at Davao del Sur.

==Tourism and recreation==

=== Natural Attractions ===
The Seven Lakes of San Pablo, seven crater lakes scattered around the city, have for many generations provided food and livelihood, leisure and respite for the citizens of the city.

Zacarias Africa Ticzon, who as well improved tourism places around Lake Sampaloc, that is near the municipal City Hall. Both places serve as haven for sports, and recreation. The vicinity for tourism consequently encouraged small businesses for restaurants of native dishes catering visitors of the area. It has dramatically contributed income for the city.
* The Komikero Komiks Museum, a brick-and-mortar museum meant to showcase the Philippines&#x27; rich history of graphic novels and comic books, and the talent of eminent artists in the field, features original art from Philippine comic book industry leaders including Alfredo Alcala, Francisco Coching, Alex Niño, Steve Gan, Nestor Redondo, Tony Velasquez, Hal Santiago, and Gerry Alanguilan.

<text>Latrodectus is a broadly distributed genus of spiders with several species that are commonly known as the true widows. This group is composed of those often loosely called black widow spiders, brown widow spiders, and similar spiders. However, the diversity of species is much greater. A member of the family Theridiidae, this genus contains 34 species, which include several North American &quot;black widows&quot; (southern Black Widow &quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot;, western black widow &quot;Latrodectus hesperus&quot;, and northern black widow &quot;Latrodectus variolus&quot;). Besides these, North America also has the red widow &quot;Latrodectus bishopi&quot; and the brown widow &quot;Latrodectus geometricus&quot;, which, in addition to North America, has a much wider geographic distribution. Elsewhere, others include the European black widow (&quot;Latrodectus tredecimguttatus&quot;), the Australian redback spider (&quot;Latrodectus hasseltii&quot;) and the closely related New Zealand katipō (&quot;Latrodectus katipo&quot;), several different species in Southern Africa that can be called button spiders, and the South American black-widow spiders (&quot;Latrodectus corallinus&quot; and &quot;Latrodectus curacaviensis&quot;). Species vary widely in size. In most cases, the females are dark-coloured and can be readily identified by reddish markings on the central underside (ventral) abdomen, which are often hourglass-shaped.

These small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the neurotoxin latrotoxin, which causes the condition latrodectism, both named after the genus. Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands, and their bite can be particularly harmful to large vertebrates, including humans. However, despite their notoriety, &quot;Latrodectus&quot; bites rarely cause death or produce serious complications. Only the bites of the females are dangerous to humans.

==Description==

Female widow spiders are typically dark brown or a shiny black in colour when they are full grown, usually exhibiting a red or orange hourglass on the ventral surface (underside) of the abdomen; some may have a pair of red spots or have no marking at all. The male widow spiders often exhibit various red or red and white markings on the dorsal surface (upper side) of the abdomen, ranging from a single stripe to bars or spots, and juveniles are often similar to the male pattern. Females of a few species are paler brown and some have no bright markings. The bodies of black widow spiders range from in size; some females can measure in their body length (not including legs). Including legs, female adult black widows generally measure .

==Behaviour==

The prevalence of sexual cannibalism, a behaviour in which the female eats the male after mating, has inspired the common name &quot;widow spiders&quot;. This behaviour may promote the survival odds of the offspring; however, females of some species only rarely show this behaviour, and much of the documented evidence for sexual cannibalism has been observed in laboratory cages where the males could not escape. Male black widow spiders tend to select their mates by determining if the female has eaten already to avoid being eaten themselves. They are able to tell if the female has fed by sensing chemicals in the web. &quot;Latrodectus hesperus&quot; is referred to as an &quot;opportunistic cannibal&quot; because in dire situations it will resort to cannibalism. In addition to sexual cannibalism, &quot;Latrodectus hesperus&quot; are also known to engage in sibling cannibalism.

Like other members of the Theridiidae, widow spiders construct a web of irregular, tangled, sticky silken fibres. Black widow spiders prefer to nest near the ground in dark and undisturbed areas, usually in small holes produced by animals, or around construction openings or woodpiles. Indoor nests are in dark, undisturbed places such as under desks or furniture or in a basement. The spider frequently hangs upside down near the centre of its web and waits for insects to blunder in and get stuck. Then, before the insect can extricate itself, the spider rushes over to envenomate and wrap it in silk. To feed, the spider&#x27;s mouth pulses digestive juices over the prey, which liquifies, which the spider internalizes by capillary action, sucking the slurry into its mouth. Their prey consists of small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, beetles, and caterpillars. If the spider perceives a threat, it quickly lets itself down to the ground on a safety line of silk.

As with other web-weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend on vibrations reaching them through their webs to find trapped prey or warn them of larger threats. When a widow spider is trapped, it is unlikely to bite, preferring to play dead or flick silk at the potential threat; bites occur when they cannot escape. Many injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets unintentionally squeezed or pinched. The blue mud dauber species, &quot;Chalybion californicum&quot;, is a wasp that, in western North America, is the primary predator of black widow spiders.

The ultimate tensile strength and other physical properties of &quot;Latrodectus hesperus&quot; (western black widow) silk are similar to the properties of silk from orb-weaving spiders that had been tested in other studies. The tensile strength for the three kinds of silk measured in the Blackledge study was about 1,000 MPa. The ultimate strength reported in a previous study for &quot;Trichonephila edulis&quot; was 1,290 ± 160 MPa. The tensile strength of spider silk is comparable to that of steel wire of the same thickness. However, as the density of steel is about six times that of silk, silk is correspondingly stronger than steel wire of the same weight.

Spiders of the genus &quot;Steatoda&quot; (also of the Theridiidae) are often mistaken for widow spiders, and are known as &quot;false widow spiders&quot;; while their bite can be painful, they are significantly less harmful to humans.

==Taxonomy==


The genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot; was erected by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1805, for the species &quot;Latrodectus tredecimguttatus&quot; and &quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot;. Arachnologist Herbert Walter Levi revised the genus in 1959, studying the female sexual organs and noting their similarity across described species. He concluded the colour variations were variable across the world and were not sufficient to warrant species status, and reclassified the redback and several other species as subspecies of the black widow spider.

Levi also noted that study of the genus had been contentious; in 1902, both F. O. Pickard-Cambridge and Friedrich Dahl had revised the genus, with each criticising the other. Cambridge questioned Dahl&#x27;s separating species on what he considered minor anatomical details, and the latter dismissed the former as an &quot;ignoramus&quot;.

==Distribution==
Widow spiders are found on every continent of the world except Antarctica. In North America, the black widows commonly known as southern (&quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot;), western (&quot;Latrodectus hesperus&quot;), and northern (&quot;Latrodectus variolus&quot;) are found in the United States, equally in western Mexico (&quot;Latrodectus occidentalis&quot;), as well as parts of southern Canada – particularly in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, as are the &quot;grey&quot; or &quot;brown widow spiders&quot; (&quot;Latrodectus geometricus&quot;) and the &quot;red widow spiders&quot; (&quot;Latrodectus bishopi&quot;).

The most prevalent species occurring in eastern Asia and Australia is commonly called the redback (&quot;Latrodectus hasselti&quot;).

They are often confused with spiders in the genus &quot;Steatoda&quot;, known as false widow spiders, due to their similar appearance.

==Venom==

Due to the presence of latrotoxin in their venom, black widow bites are potentially dangerous and may result in systemic effects (latrodectism) including severe muscle pain, abdominal cramps, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and muscle spasms. Symptoms usually last for 3–7 days, but may persist for several weeks. In 1933, a University of Alabama medical faculty, Allan Blair conducted an experiment on himself to document the symptoms of a black widow bite, and to test whether someone can build immunity after being bitten. The effects of the bite were so painful and harsh that Blair failed to complete the experiment and did not follow through with being bitten a second time.

In the United States each year, about 2,500 people report being bitten by a black widow, but most do not need medical treatment. Some bites have no venom injected—⁠a &quot;dry&quot; bite. In the United States, no deaths due to black widows have been reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers since 1983. Black widows are not especially aggressive spiders, and they rarely bite humans unless startled or otherwise threatened.

Contrary to popular belief, most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage, let alone death. Fatal bites were reported in the early 20th century mostly with &quot;Latrodectus tredecimguttatus&quot;, the Mediterranean black widow.

Since the venom is not usually life-threatening, antivenom has been used as pain relief and not to save lives. However, a study demonstrated that standardized pain medication, when combined with either antivenom or a placebo, had similar improvements in pain and resolution of symptoms.

<doc id="287668" wikidata="Q422152" url="?curid=287668" title="Anthracene">
<text>Anthracene is a solid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) of formula C14H10, consisting of three fused benzene rings. It is a component of coal tar. Anthracene is used in the production of the red dye alizarin and other dyes, as a scintillator to detect high energy particles, as production of pharmaceutical drugs. Anthracene is colorless but exhibits a blue (400–500 nm peak) fluorescence under ultraviolet radiation.

== History and etymology ==
Crude anthracene (with a melting point of only 180°) was discovered in 1832 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Auguste Laurent who crystalized it from a fraction of coal tar later known as &quot;anthracene oil&quot;. Since their (inaccurate) measurements showed the proportions of carbon and hydrogen of it to be the same as in naphthalene, Laurent called it &quot;paranaphtaline&quot; in his 1835 publication of the discovery, which is translated to English as paranaphthalene. Two years later, however, he decided to rename the compound to its modern name derived from because after discovering other polyaromatic hydrocarbons he decided it was only one of isomers of naphthalene. This notion was disproved in 1850s and 1860s.

==Occurrence and production==
Anthracene, as many other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is generated during combustion processes. Most human exposure is through tobacco smoke or ingestion of charred food.

The mineral form of anthracene is called freitalite and is related to a coal deposit. Coal tar, which contains around 1.5% anthracene, remains a major industrial source of this material. Common impurities are phenanthrene and carbazole. 

A classic laboratory method for the preparation of anthracene is by cyclodehydration of o-methyl- or o-methylene-substituted diarylketones in the so-called Elbs reaction, for example from &quot;o&quot;-tolyl phenyl ketone.

==Reactions==
===Reduction===
Reduction of anthracene with alkali metals yields the deeply colored radical anion salts M+[anthracene]− (M = Li, Na, K). Hydrogenation gives 9,10-dihydroanthracene, preserving the aromaticity of the two flanking rings.

===Cycloadditions===
In any solvent except water, anthracene photodimerizes by the action of UV light:

The dimer, called dianthracene (or sometimes paranthracene), is connected by a pair of new carbon-carbon bonds, the result of the [4+4] cycloaddition. It reverts to anthracene thermally or with UV irradiation below 300 nm. Substituted anthracene derivatives behave similarly. The reaction is affected by the presence of oxygen.

Anthracene also reacts with dienophile singlet oxygen in a [4+2]-cycloaddition (Diels–Alder reaction):

===With electrophiles===
Chemical oxidation occurs readily, giving anthraquinone, C14H8O2 (below), for example using hydrogen peroxide and vanadyl acetylacetonate.

Electrophilic substitution of anthracene occurs at the 9 position. For example, formylation affords 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Substitution at other positions is effected indirectly, for example starting with anthroquinone. Bromination of anthracene gives 9,10-dibromoanthracene.

==Uses==
Anthracene proper has application as an organic semiconductor and chemical feedstock for various preservatives and dyes. 

===Electronics===

Anthracene is a wide band-gap organic semiconductor, with an emission spectrum peaking between 400 nm and 440 nm. Organic field-effect transistors have been constructed from it. In particle physics, it is used as a scintillator to detect high-energy photons, electrons, or alpha particles. Plastics, such as polyvinyltoluene, can be doped with anthracene to produce an approximately water-equivalent scintillator in radiation therapy dosimetry. 

Anthracene is commonly used as a UV tracer in conformal coatings applied to printed wiring boards. The anthracene tracer allows the conformal coating to be inspected under UV light.

It is also used in wood preservatives, insecticides, and coating materials.

===Derivatives===

A variety of anthracene derivatives find specialized uses. Industrially, anthracene is converted mainly to anthraquinone, a precursor to dyes. Derivatives having a hydroxyl group are 1-hydroxyanthracene and 2-hydroxyanthracene, homologous to phenol and naphthols, and hydroxyanthracene (also called anthrol, and anthracenol) are pharmacologically active. 
Anthracene may also be found with multiple hydroxyl groups, as in 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene.

Some anthracene derivatives are used as pharmaceutical drugs, including bisantrene, trazitiline, and benzoctamine.
==Toxicology==
Many investigations indicate that anthracene is noncarcinogenic: &quot;consistently negative findings in numerous in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests&quot;. Early experiments suggested otherwise because crude samples were contaminated with other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, it is readily biodegraded in soil. It is especially susceptible to degradation in the presence of light. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies anthracene as IARC group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans.

<text>Sir Samuel Hughes, (January 8, 1853 – August 23, 1921) was the Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence during World War I. He was notable for being the last Liberal-Conservative cabinet minister, until he was dismissed from his cabinet post.

==Early life==
Hughes was born January 8, 1853, at Solina near Bowmanville in what was then Canada West. He was a son of John Hughes from Tyrone, Ireland, and Caroline (Laughlin) Hughes, a Canadian descended from Huguenots and Ulster Scots. He was educated in Durham County, Ontario and later attended the Toronto Normal School and the University of Toronto. In 1866 he joined the 45th West Durham Battalion of Infantry and served during the Fenian raids in the 1860s and 1870s. Throughout his life, Hughes was very involved in the militia, attending all of the drill practice sessions, and taking up shooting with a rifle in his spare time to improve his aim. A superb shot with a rifle, Hughes was active in gun clubs and ultimately became president of the Dominion Rifle Association. Hughes liked to see himself as embodying the Victorian values of hard work, self discipline, strength and manliness. Tall, muscular, and broad-shouldered, Hughes excelled at sports, being especially talented at lacrosse. He later claimed, in the British &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, to have &quot;personally offered to raise&quot; Canadian contingents for service in &quot;the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, the Afghan Frontier War, and the Transvaal War&quot;.

At the age of 20, he married his first wife, Caroline Preston, who died a year later. Subsequently, he married Mary Burk, and the new couple soon moved to Toronto. He was a teacher from 1875 to 1885 at the Toronto Collegiate Institute (now Jarvis Collegiate), where he was noted for his eccentricities such as his habit of chewing on his chalk when delivering his lectures. Hughes abandoned teaching as he had trouble supporting a wife and three children on his salary while teaching offered little prospect of promotion. In 1885, he moved his family to Lindsay, where he had bought &quot;The Victoria Warder&quot;, the local newspaper. He was the paper&#x27;s publisher from 1885 to 1897.

==Newspaperman==
In his first editorial, Hughes accused the Roman Catholic Church of being behind the smallpox epidemic that was ravaging Montreal at the time and called French-Canadians &quot;little better than brutes&quot;. Shortly after he began his proprietorship of the &quot;Victoria Warder&quot; in July 1885, Hughes joined the local Liberal-Conservative Association. The Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, often commented that Hughes&#x27;s letters to him were &quot;voluminous&quot; and sometimes &quot;impertinent&quot; as he demanded patronage jobs for local Tories. Macdonald also noted in 1888 that &quot;Sam Hughes is one of our best friends&quot;, as the &quot;Victoria Warder&quot; very strongly supported the Conservatives, making him a useful man for the Tories in the rural Victoria County, where most people got their news from his newspaper.

At the time when Hughes arrived in Victoria County, it was a mostly forested area where lumbering was the chief industry, though agriculture was increasing as the trees were cut down. Most of the towns and villages in Victoria County were isolated settlements located on the lakes and connected only by water and by primitive roads. The population of the county was overwhelmingly of British descent and Protestant. On the masthead of the &quot;Victoria Warder&quot;, Hughes put the following poem: &quot;A Union of hearts, a Union of hands, A Union no man can sever, A Union of tongues, A Union of lands, And the flag-British Union forever&quot;. Hughes had much affection for the rugged landscape of the Victoria County, talking about its forests and lakes in the same manner he praised the Highlands of Scotland and the rolling fields of Ulster. His grandson wrote that for Hughes Victoria County was his &quot;spiritual home&quot;. Victoria County in the 19th century was considered to be a &quot;rough&quot; frontier area, and during his tempestuous time as editor, Hughes was sued for libel, there was an arson attempt against the &quot;Victoria Warder&quot; and was at least one assassination attempt against him when he was shot at while leaving his newspaper office.

In 1885, Hughes tried to volunteer for the expeditionary force sent to put down the North-West Rebellion led by the &quot;Metis&quot; Louis Riel, but he was refused despite being a very active member of the militia. Hughes&#x27;s younger brother, James, was part of the force sent to the Northwest Territory (modern Saskatchewan) and to compensate for being not able to fight, he gave the war extensive coverage in &quot;The Victoria Warder&quot;. Reflecting his life-long belief in the superiority of citizen soldiers over professional soldiers, Hughes presented the Northwest Rebellion as a triumph of the Canadian militia, proudly trumpeting the fact that almost all of the men sent to the Northwest had been civilians only weeks before donning their uniforms to head west. About the Canadian victory in the Battle of Batoche, Hughes wrote in an editorial that &quot;regular troops were all right for police purposes in times of peace and for training schools, but beyond that they are an injury to the nation&quot;.

A recurring theme of Hughes&#x27;s writing in the &quot;Victoria Warder&quot; was the fear that industrialization and urbanization might lead to a loss of masculinity, and that the best way to save traditional masculinity was compulsory militia service for all Canadian men. Hughes equated masculinity with toughness, and argued that militia service would toughen up Canadian men who might otherwise go soft living in an urban environment full of labor-saving devices. As one of his arguments for the militia, Hughes played a key role in creating what the Canadian historian Desmond Morton called the &quot;militia myth&quot; around the War of 1812; namely, he misrepresented Upper Canada as being saved from successive American invasions in 1812, 1813 and 1814 by the Upper Canada militia, instead of the British Army regulars, who in fact did most of the fighting.

Another theme of Hughes&#x27;s coverage of the Northwest Rebellion was the way in which he essentially agreed with Riel that the stream of English-speaking, Protestant settlers from Ontario into the Prairies were indeed threatening the existence of the Catholic religion and French language of the &quot;Metis&quot;, with the only difference that what Riel saw as a tragedy, Hughes saw as a blessing. Victoria County had as a percentage of the population the largest number of Orangemen in Canada in the late 19th century, and Hughes who sat on the executive board of the local Lodge of the Loyal Orange Order in the county was able to use the Orangemen to provide a reliable group of voters when seeking election to the House of Commons throughout his career. The combative Hughes enjoyed brawling with Irish Catholic immigrants on trips to Toronto. As the editor of the &quot;Victoria Warder&quot;, Hughes often attacked &quot;Romanists&quot; as he called Catholics. For an example in an editorial on 4 October 1889 he accused the &quot;Romanists&quot; of Lindsay of being &quot;a disloyal murder-planning society&quot;. After Wilfrid Laurier, the new Liberal Leader of the Official Opposition, spoke in favour of free trade with the United States, Hughes accused him in an 1888 editorial of being in favour of having Canada annexed by the United States. To counter Laurier&#x27;s argument that free trade with the United States meant prosperity, Hughes proposed an Imperial Federation with Great Britain as the best way to bring about prosperity, though he also held out the possibility that the United States might one day join to create a union of the English-speaking peoples.

==Member of Parliament==
In the 1891 election, Hughes ran as a Conservative to represent Victoria North, but was narrowly defeated by only 202 votes by the Liberal incumbent, Jack Barron. Charging electoral fraud, Hughes went to court to challenge the result. Two justices at the Queen&#x27;s Bench in Toronto ruled that the evidence of electoral fraud presented by Hughes was overwhelming, and ordered a by-election, held on 11 February 1892. During the by-election, Barron twice tried to bribe Hughes to drop out. Hughes was elected to Parliament in the by-election. In January 1894, Hughes was involved in a brawl on Lindsay&#x27;s main street with a Roman Catholic blacksmith named Richard Kylie, which led him to being convicted of assault and fined $500. Despite expectations that the assault conviction would cause him to lose his seat, in the 1896 election, Hughes kept his seat.

In 1870, when the province of Manitoba was created out of the North-West Territories as part of the political deal to end the Red River Rebellion, Manitoba had a French-speaking &quot;Métis&quot; majority, and it was declared in the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; creating the province that French was one of Manitoba&#x27;s official languages, and the province was to provide Catholic education in French. By 1890, immigration from Ontario had changed the demographics of Manitoba drastically and in that year the Manitoba government passed a law making all education in English under the grounds that French-language education was costing too much money. This in turn led to demands for the Dominion government to intervene as this law violated the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. The Manitoba Schools Question proved to be one of the most bitterly divisive issues of the 1890s, and Hughes emerged as a spokesman for those who urged the Dominion government not to intervene, arguing that if Manitoba did not wish to provide education in French, that was its right. Hughes justified his views under the grounds of secularism, writing in 1892 &quot;all churches are a simple damned nuisance&quot;. Despite his anti-Catholic stance, Hughes supported the claims of the Catholic John Thompson to be prime minister. Hughes&#x27;s support for Thompson was based upon political expediency, namely that Thompson was the best man to beat the popular Wilfrid Laurier.

Hughes used his influence with the Orange Order to try to keep them from inflaming the Manitoba Schools Question, and to convince them to accept Thompson as the next Conservative leader to replace the ailing Sir John Abbott. As Thompson represented a more upper-class, urban wing of the Conservative Party, the support of Hughes who represented a more lower-class, rural wing of the Conservatives was instrumental in assuring Thompson became prime minister in November 1892 when Abbott finally resigned. He also tried to persuade the Orangemen to accept a Catholic prime minister. During Thompson&#x27;s time as prime minister, Hughes supported his efforts to find a compromise to the Manitoba Schools Question, though he notably stopped writing as often to the prime minister after Thompson decided in 1894 to pass a remedial bill to force Manitoba to abide by the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. When Thompson died in December 1894, Hughes supported the candidacy of Sir Charles Tupper against Senator Mackenzie Bowell, but Bowell prevailed and became the next prime minister. As the debate intensified into a crisis in 1895–96 following a ruling by the Privy Council against Manitoba, Hughes took a generally moderate position on the Manitoba Schools Question, asking rhetorically in a letter to the editor of the &quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; &quot;why should we plunge Canada into a religious war?&quot; In a letter to Nathaniel Clarke Wallace, the Grand Master of the Orange Order, he advised against extremism on the Manitoba Schools Question, saying the issue was tearing the Conservative Party apart. Faced with certain defeat in the 1896 election, Hughes was one of the Conservative MPs who voted in March to depose Bowell in favour of Tupper.

Hughes supported Tupper&#x27;s &quot;friendly means&quot; compromise of secular education in Manitoba with religious instruction after the school day had officially ended. Wallace disregarded Hughes&#x27;s advice and in 1896 stated that the Orangemen would only support candidates who stood against the federal remedial bill against Manitoba, which in effect meant supporting the Liberals. Laurier, despite being a French-Canadian Catholic, supported Manitoba under the grounds of provincial rights, and had the Liberals filibuster Tupper&#x27;s remedial bill. At a national meeting of the Orange Order in Collingwood in May 1896, Hughes spoke in favour of Tupper and was almost expelled from the Order. In the 1896 election, Hughes&#x27;s main challenger was John Delemere, an independent candidate endorsed by Wallace. Hughes held on to his seat by arguing that the affairs of Manitoba were irrelevant to Victoria County and he understood local issues far better than his opponent. The election of 1896 resulted in a Liberal victory, and in the new, much smaller Conservative caucus, Hughes stood out as the few MPs whose reputation had been enhanced by the Manitoba Schools Question. Hughes&#x27;s position on the Question was based upon pragmatism, namely the need to keep the Conservatives united to win the next general election in face of the challenge from Laurier, whose &quot;sunny ways&quot; were winning over people all over Canada. Unlike other Conservative MPs like George Foster who argued that the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; had guaranteed the right to a Catholic education in French, and it was the duty of the Dominion government to uphold the law, Hughes had no interest in minority rights. Hughes felt that a secular education system was superior to a religious one, and that the language of instruction in Manitoba schools should be English. His moderate stance on the Manitoba Schools Question was motivated entirely by the fear that the issue might cause the Conservatives to lose the next general election, as indeed proved to be the case. Despite the fact that Wallace had campaigned against him, Hughes tried to rebuild the relationship between the Conservatives and the Orange Order, through it was not until Wallace died in 1901 that his efforts bore fruit.

The returned Prime Minister Laurier had declared his support for the British policies in South Africa, but was non-committal about sending Canadian troops if war should break out. In the summer of 1899, the Governor General of Canada, Lord Minto, and the commander of the Canadian Militia, Colonel Edward Hutton, drafted a secret plan for a Canadian contingent of 1,200 men to go to South Africa, and decided that Hughes as one of the most outspokenly imperialist members of Parliament was to be one of the commanders. In September 1899, Minto and Hutton first informed Frederick William Borden, the Minister of Militia and Defence, of the plan that they had drafted, though Laurier remained out of the loop. As Laurier continued to hesitate, Hughes offered to raise a regiment at his own expense to fight in South Africa, an offer which threatened to upset Hutton&#x27;s plans as Hughes&#x27;s offer gave Laurier the perfect excuse for doing nothing. When Hutton ordered Hughes as a subordinate militia officer to remain silent, Hughes responded with an angry outburst in public alleging an attempt by a British officer to silence a Canadian MP, creating what the Canadian historian Morton called a clash of &quot;two like-minded, but out-sized egos&quot;.

==Boer War service==
On 3 October 1899, the Transvaal Republic declared war on Great Britain. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, sent Laurier a note thanking him for his offer of Canadian troops to South Africa, which confused the prime minister as he made no such offer. At the same time the October 1899 edition of the &quot;Canadian Military Gazette&quot; published the details of the plan to send 1,200 men to South Africa. When Laurier denied in the House of Commons having any plans to send troops, Chamberlain&#x27;s note was leaked to the press, and on 9 October 1899, Laurier received a note from editor of the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; (which supported the Liberals) saying the prime minister must &quot;either send troops or get out of office&quot;. As the Liberal caucus was badly divided between anti-war French-Canadian MPs and pro-war English-Canadian MPs, Laurier did not dare summon Parliament for a vote as the Liberals might split over the issue, and instead issued an order-in-council on 14 October saying that Canada would provide a force of volunteers for South Africa. Hughes promptly volunteered for the contingent, but was vetoed by Hutton who had neither forgotten nor forgiven Hughes for his insubordination and his abrasive refusal to be silenced; however, perhaps as a form of revenge against Hutton, Laurier insisted that Hughes be allowed to go to South Africa.

Having convinced Laurier to send Canadian troops, Hughes embarked to serve in the Second Boer War. Upon boarding the ship &quot;SS Sardinian&quot; which left Quebec City for Cape Town on 31 October 1899, carrying 1,061 Canadian volunteers, Hughes announced that he was &quot;free of all military authority&quot; and would take no orders from any officer. Upon arriving in South Africa, Hughes told the press that the Boers &quot;on their old plugs of horses&quot; would out-ride the British on the &quot;veld&quot;, a remark that marked the beginning of Hughes&#x27;s stormy service in South Africa as ironically the ultra-imperialist Hughes constantly clashed with the British Army. Hughes developed a strong contempt for the British military while in South Africa and came away with the idea that frontier living had made the Canadians tougher and hardier soldiers than the British. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton wrote that Hughes &quot;hated the British Army&quot;. Hughes always believed the part-time citizen soldiers of the Canadian militia were far better soldiers than the full-time professionals of the British Army, a viewpoint that did much to influence his later decisions in World War I. In this regard, the performance of the Boer &quot;kommandos&quot; (commandos) was used by Hughes to prove his point, as he argued that the citizen militias of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State had out-fought the British Army for much of the war, though he ignored the fact that in the end it was the British Army that won the war. Hughes also used the performance of irregular cavalry units from Canada and Australia to support his theory, noting that the &quot;cowboy&quot; units recruited from the Australian Outback and the Canadian Prairies were the ones most effective at hunting down the &quot;kommandos&quot;. Hughes&#x27;s biographer, Ronald Haycock noted that he naively assumed that all future wars would be like the Boer War, even right down to being fought in a place like the &quot;veld&quot;. Haycock also noted that Hughes seemed to have no interest in understanding why the commandos had been defeated, instead presenting the war as almost a Boer victory. It was also during the Boer war that Hughes become convinced of the thesis that the Ross rifle developed by a Scottish sportsman, Sir Charles Ross, and manufactured in Canada was the ideal weapon for infantrymen. The more that the British Army rejected the Ross rifle as unsuitable, the more it persuaded Hughes of its superiority, though Morton noted that the British objections to the Ross rifle were sound as it was a hunting rifle that overheated after rapid firing and was too easily jammed by dirt.

However, despite his frequent clashes with British Army officers, Sir Alfred Milner, the British High Commissioner for South Africa, praised Hughes for his willingness to by-pass bureaucracy and to get things done. Two men who were later prominent in Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten, William Hitchens and Lionel Curtis both served under Hughes&#x27;s command from March 1900 onward as they advanced across the &quot;veld&quot; from the Cape Colony into the Orange Free State. Outside of Hughes&#x27;s own accounts of his Boer War service, most of what is known about his time in South Africa comes from the accounts written by Hitchens, and Curtis and their mutual friend, Leo Amery, the war correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot; of London, who first met Hughes in Cape Town in December 1899 together with another mutual friend, Max Balfour. Amery, Balfour, Curtis and Hitchens all described Hughes as a populist leader who was not aloof from the common soldiers, impatient with bureaucracy, forthright about expressing his opinions about everything, and who shared the hardships on war on the &quot;veld&quot;. Balfour wrote that Hughes was chivalrous towards Boer civilians, apologising to the wife of a man he arrested as a guerrilla for taking away her husband while Curtis stated that Hughes always paid for the food he had taken from farms out on the &quot;veld&quot;, saying he was no thief. Amery described Hughes as a hard-driving, aggressive commander whose cavalry covered vast distances across the &quot;veld&quot;, saying he was relentless in his pursuit of the enemy. In a promotion, in May 1900, Milner had Hughes made the intelligence officer and assistant adjutant general to Warren&#x27;s Scouts commanded by Sir Charles Warren, which had the task of advancing over the Orange river to neutralise a Transvaal force under the command of Commandant-General Piet de Villers. During the advance, de Villers attacked the British camp at the Faber Pass outside of Campbell on 27 May 1900, and a half-dressed Hughes who sprung into action after waking up at the sound of the shooting, was involved in leading the counterattack that drove the Transvaalers back at the cost of 23 dead and 33 wounded. Afterwards, Hughes attacked Warren for &quot;absolutely untrue&quot; statements in his official report about the action at the Faber Pass such as his claim that he was not taken by surprise and the camp was well situated, criticism which Haycock described as very well merited.

Hughes would continually campaign, unsuccessfully, to be awarded a Victoria Cross (V.C.) for actions that he had supposedly taken in the fighting. The Canadian historian René Chartrand wrote that &quot;...Hughes&#x27;s character may be read from the fact that he had actually &quot;asked&quot; for the V.C. for his services in South Africa&quot;. Hughes&#x27;s recommendation of himself for a V.C. was most unorthodox as normally one had to be recommended for the award. Hughes published most of his own accounts of the war, often saying that when he left, the British commander was &quot;sobbing like a child.&quot; In fact, Hughes was dismissed from Boer War service in the summer of 1900 for military indiscipline, and sent back to Canada. Letters in which Hughes charged the British military with incompetence had been published in Canada and South Africa. Hughes had also flagrantly disobeyed orders in a key operation by granting favourable terms to an enemy force which surrendered to him. Although Hughes had proved a competent, and sometimes exceptional, front-line officer, boastfulness and impatience told strongly against him. Hughes&#x27;s demand for a V.C. was refused, but as a consolation prize, his demand for to be knighted for his Boer War services was granted, albeit only belatedly in 1915, and therefore Hughes was proud to be known as &quot;Sir Sam&quot;. By this time, Hughes had become convinced that he deserved not one, but two V.C.s for his service in South Africa, a demand that exasperated the War Office in London who patiently told Hughes one could not recommend oneself for the V.C., and his requests for a V.C. bar could not be considered.

==Shadow defence minister==
As the defence critic in the Conservative shadow cabinet, Hughes who was widely read on military history, current military trends, and issues in the Canadian militia proved a vigorous and effective shadow defence minister, accusing the defence minister, Sir Frederick Borden, of being ineffectual in handling his portfolio. Hughes was also well known for his attacks upon the immigration policy of the Laurier government, charging that Canada needed more immigrants of &quot;good British stock&quot;. The subject of settling the Prairies much interested Hughes as he served as an agent between 1902 and 1905 for the Canadian Northern Railway headed by his friend, William Mackenzie, travelling twice to the Prairies to select the route for the CNR. Amery, having first met Hughes in the Boer War, followed him on his second trip across the Prairies, writing about how he talked with great passion about his plans to build the &quot;finest city&quot; on the Prairies. In the 1904 election, the Liberals triumphed in a landslide, and even Hughes held on to his seat in Victoria County by a narrow margin. The Conservative leader, Robert Borden, lost his own seat in Halifax, and Hughes offered to resign to allow Borden to represent Victoria County. Though Borden chose another safe Conservative seat in Ontario to represent, he thanked Hughes for his &quot;kindness&quot; in offering up his own seat.

Hughes was also active in the Imperial Federation movement, regularly corresponding with both Joseph Chamberlain and Alfred Milner on the issue, and every year from 1905 onward, introduced a resolution in the House of Commons calling for an &quot;equal partnership union&quot; of the Dominions with the United Kingdom. In this, Hughes often confounded Milner and Chamberlain, who thought he was the foremost Canadian champion of the Imperial Federation concept, as what Hughes wanted was for Canada to become an equal partner in running the British empire, instead of playing the more subordinate role that Milner and Chamberlain had envisioned. Hughes favoured a protectionist policy of Imperial Preference, but unlike Chamberlain, he insisted that Imperial Preference be tied to &quot;equal partnership&quot; with an Imperial cabinet of all the Dominion prime ministers plus the British prime minister to decide policy for the entire empire. Hughes repeatedly objected to Chamberlain&#x27;s concept of the British prime minister and cabinet deciding questions for the Dominions, and Haycock wrote what Hughes wanted sounds very similar to the British Commonwealth that emerged after 1931.

In 1906, after repeatedly hammering the immigration minister, Clifford Sifton in debate, Hughes&#x27;s motion calling for the Canadian government to give preference in handing out land in the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to veterans of the British Army was accepted as policy. Like other English-Canadians at the time, Hughes believed that too many immigrants from Eastern Europe were being allowed to settle on the Prairies, and instead the Prairies should be settled by immigrants from Britain, with veterans in particular encouraged to settle. In 1907 Hughes told the House of Commons that Catholic immigrants from Europe were &quot;a curse upon Canada&quot;. Despite being publicly censured by the Conservative leader Robert Borden for his &quot;curse upon Canada&quot; remark with Borden insisting that the Conservative Party was not a sectarian party, two months later in June 1907 at the Orange Order&#x27;s national convention in Vancouver, Hughes repeated his thesis that Catholic immigrants were a &quot;curse upon Canada&quot;, which was followed up with the warning that the Orangemen would never vote Conservative again if Borden expelled Hughes. Hughes&#x27;s ability to bring out the votes of the Orange Order for the Conservatives ensured that Borden did not expel him despite the way in which he kept sabotaging Borden&#x27;s efforts to reach out to Catholic voters.

Hughes, who claimed to have been offered but declined the post of Deputy Minister of Militia in 1891, was appointed Minister of Militia after the election of Borden in 1911, with the aim of creating a distinct Canadian army within the British Empire, to be used in case of war. He wrote a letter to the Governor General, the Duke of Connaught, about his longtime demand for the Victoria Cross. Connaught privately recommended that Borden get rid of him. Chartrand described Hughes as an individual endowed with &quot;great charm, wit, and driving energy, allied with consummate political skills&quot;, but on the negative side called him &quot;a stubborn, pompous racist&quot; and a &quot;passionate Orange Order supremacist&quot; who did little to disguise his dislike of Catholics in general and of French-Canadians in particular. Hughes&#x27;s views later did much to put off French-Canadians and Irish-Canadians from supporting the war effort in World War I. Chartrand further wrote that Hughes was a megalomaniac with a grotesquely inflated sense of his own importance who &quot;would admit no contradiction to his views&quot;. Hughes&#x27;s own son, Garnet, wrote: &quot;God help he who goes against my father&#x27;s will&quot;.

==Minister of Militia and Defence==
Borden had &quot;profound misgivings&quot; about appointing Hughes to the cabinet, but as Hughes insisted on the defence portfolio, and Borden owed Hughes a political debt for his past loyalty, he received his wish to be appointed defence minister. This debt went back to Borden&#x27;s days as the embattled Leader of the Official Opposition, when Hughes, then shadow defence minister, had been loyal to him at a time when many Conservative MPs wanted a new leader after Borden lost two general elections in a row in 1904 and 1908. Hughes was by then a colonel in the militia, and he insisted on wearing his uniform at all times, including cabinet meetings. In 1912, Hughes promoted himself to the rank of major-general. An energetic minister, Hughes travelled all over Canada in his private luxury railroad car to attend parades and manoeuvres by the militia. His penchant for colourful and flamboyant statements made him a media favourite, and journalists were always asking the defence minister for his opinions on any subject, secure in the knowledge that Hughes was likely to say something outrageous that would help to sell newspapers. Berton described Hughes as &quot;...a staunch Britisher, but also a staunch Canadian nationalist, who was absolutely determined that Canada should not be a vassal of the mother country&quot;. Hughes saw the Dominions as equal partners of the United Kingdom in the management of the British empire, making claims for powers for Ottawa that anticipated the 1931 Statute of Westminster, and fiercely fought against attempts on the part of London to treat Canada in a mere colonial role.

In December 1911, Hughes announced that he was going to increase the militia budget and built more camps and drill halls for the militia. From 1911 to 1914, the defence budget rose from $7 million to $11 million per year. Hughes was openly hostile to the Permanent Active Militia, or Permanent Force, as Canada&#x27;s small professional army was known, and praised the Non-Permanent Active Militia (often shortened to just &quot;Militia&quot;) as reflecting the authentic fighting spirit of Canada. Taking the view that citizen soldiers were better soldiers than the professionals, Hughes cut spending on the &quot;bar room loafers&quot; as he called the Permanent Force to increase the size of the Non-Permanent Active Militia. Critics charged that Hughes favoured the Militia as it allowed him opportunities for patronage as he gave various friends and allies officers&#x27; commissions in the militia that did not exist with the Permanent Force, where promotion was based on merit. Hughes did not have much interest in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), which had been founded by Laurier in 1910, in large part because the Navy by its very existence required a full-time force of professionals, which did not fit in well with the Defence Minister&#x27;s enthusiasm for citizen-soldiers. Furthermore, the Navy was under the Department of Naval Services, which made it rival to the Defence Department in terms of military spending. But at the same time, Hughes was opposed to Borden&#x27;s plans to disband the Navy and instead have Canada contribute some $35 million directly to the British Royal Navy, preferring that Canada have its own navy. During the naval debates in 1912, Hughes supported retaining the &quot;tin-pot navy&quot; as the RCN was often called and helped to ensure its continued existence.

In April 1912, Hughes caused much controversy when he forbade militia regiments in Quebec from taking part in Catholic processions, a practice that went back to the days of New France, and had been tolerated under British rule and since 1867 under Confederation. Hughes justified the move as upholding secularism, but Quebec newspapers noted that Hughes was an Orangeman, and blamed his decision as due to the anti-Catholic prejudices one could expect from a member of the Loyal Orange Order. Hughes&#x27;s practice of pushing out experienced Permanent Force officers serving on the general staff in favour of militia officers and his lavish spending were also the causes of controversy. Hughes used the Defence Department funds to give a free Ford Model T car to every militia colonel in Canada, a move which caused much criticism. In 1913, Hughes went on an all-expenses paid junket to Europe together with his family, his secretaries, and various militia colonels who were his friends and their families. Hughes justified the trip, which lasted several months, as necessary to observe military manoeuvres in Britain, France and Switzerland, but to many Canadians, it appeared more like an expensive vacation taken with the taxpayer&#x27;s money.

Hughes&#x27;s intention was to make militia service compulsory for every able-bodied male, a plan that caused considerable public opposition. Chartrand wrote that Hughes&#x27;s plan for compulsory militia service, based on the example of Switzerland, failed to take into account the differences between Switzerland, a highly conformist society in Central Europe vs. Canada, a more individualistic society in North America. The reasons Hughes gave for a larger Swiss-style militia were moral, not military. A strong believer in temperance, Hughes banned alcohol from militia camps and believed that compulsory militia was the best way of stamping out the consumption of alcohol in Canada. In a speech in Napanee in 1913, Hughes declared he wanted to :&quot;To make the youth of Canada self-controlled, erect, decent and patriotic through military and physical training, instead of growing up to as under present conditions of no control, into young ruffians or young gadabouts; to ensure peace by national preparedness for war; to make military camps and drill halls throughout Canada clean, wholesome, sober and attractive to boys and young men; to give that final touch to imperial unity, and crown the arch of responsible government by an inter-Imperial Parliament dealing only with Imperial affairs&quot;. Hughes&#x27;s campaign for compulsory militia service as a form of moral reformation to save the alleged wayward young men of Canada from lives of debauchery and licentiousness made him into one of the better known and most controversial ministers in the Borden government. Borden himself wanted to sack Hughes, whom he regarded as a political liability, by 1913 but was afraid of his bellicose defence minister to whom he also owned some major political debts. Borden was a gentlemanly and mild-mannered lawyer from Halifax who was intimidated by Hughes, a huge blustering and combative Orangeman overtly fond of getting into brawls, who wrote &quot;long, vituperative letters&quot; at the slightest criticism, claimed to be &quot;loved by millions&quot; of voters, and often compared himself to a train and his critics to dogs. Hughes himself often said that Borden was &quot;gentle hearted as a girl&quot;.

==First World War==
===At war===
In 1839, a treaty had been signed by Prussia and Britain guaranteeing the independence and neutrality of Belgium. On 2 August 1914, Imperial Germany, which had assumed Prussia&#x27;s commitment to Belgian neutrality and independence in 1871, invaded Belgium as the German chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg dismissed the guarantee as a &quot;mere scrap of paper&quot;. The question facing British leaders was whether the United Kingdom would honour the guarantee of Belgium by declaring war on Germany or not. On the morning of 3 August 1914, Hughes arrived at the Defence Department, visibly upset and angry, and according to those present cried out: &quot;They are going to skunk it! They seem to be looking for an excuse to get out of helping France. Oh! What a shameful state of things! By God, I don&#x27;t want to be a Britisher under such conditions!&quot; When it was pointed out that the British cabinet had called an emergency meeting to discuss the invasion of Belgium, Hughes replied: &quot;They are curs enough to do it; I can read between the lines. I believe they will temporize and hum and haw too long-and by God, I don&#x27;t want to be a Britisher under such conditions-it is too humiliating.&quot; Hughes asked if the Union Jack was flying in front of the Defence Department, and upon being told it was, shouted: &quot;Then send up and have it taken down! I will not have it over Canada&#x27;s military headquarters, when Britain shirks her plain duty-it is disgraceful!&quot; The Union Jack was pulled down, and only put up again the next day, when it was announced that Britain had sent an ultimatum demanding that Germany pull out of Belgium at once, and upon its rejection, Britain had honoured the guarantee of Belgium by declaring war on Germany, shortly after midnight on 4 August 1914. As Canada was part of the British Empire, the Dominion was automatically at war. In a speech (in French) to the House of Commons, Laurier, who had become the leader of the Official Opposition after losing the 1911 election, stated: &quot;When the call comes, our answer goes at once, and it goes in the classical language of the British answer to the call of duty, &#x27;Ready, aye, ready&#x27;.&quot; Laurier&#x27;s speech captured the mood of the nation in August 1914 and most Canadians wanted to aid the &quot;mother country&quot; as it faced its greatest challenge yet.

On 7 August 1914, Borden announced to the House of Commons that the British government had just accepted his offer of an expeditionary force to Europe. In 1911, the General Staff under Major-General Sir Willoughby Gwatkin had drawn up a plan in the event of a war in Europe for mobilizing the militia that called for Canada to send an expeditionary force of one infantry division and an independent cavalry brigade together with artillery and support units from the Permanent Force that was to be assembled at Camp Petawawa outside of Ottawa. Much to everyone&#x27;s surprise, Hughes disregarded the General Staff&#x27;s plan and refused to mobilize the militia, instead creating a brand new organization called the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) made up of numbered battalions that was separate from the militia. Instead of going to the existing Camp Petawawa, Hughes chose to build a new camp at Valcartier, outside of Quebec City, for the CEF. Hughes&#x27;s sudden decision not to call out the militia and create the CEF threw Canadian mobilization into complete chaos as a new bureaucracy had to be created at the same time that thousands of young men flocked to the colors.

Morton wrote that in August–September 1914 &quot;...a sweating, swearing, sublimely happy Hughes pulled some kind of order from the chaos he had created.&quot; In the process, Hughes managed to insult everyone from the Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught, to the French-Canadian community. When the president of the Toronto chapter of the Humane Society visited Hughes to express concern about the neglect and mistreatment of horses at Camp Valcartier, Hughes called him a liar and personally picked him up and tossed him out of his office. Likewise, when John Farthing, the Anglican bishop of Montreal, visited Hughes to complain about the shortage of Church of England chaplains at Valcartier to tend to the spiritual needs of Anglican volunteers, Hughes burst into a rage and began to loudly swear at Farthing, making liberal use of a number of four letter words not normally used to address an Anglican bishop, who was predictably shocked. Though Hughes worked hard at ensuring the construction of Camp Valcartier and trying to bring order to the chaos he caused by not calling out the militia, almost everyone who knew him was convinced he was in some way insane. The Duke of Connaught wrote in a report to London that Hughes was &quot;off his base&quot;. A Conservative MP from Toronto, Angus Claude Macdonell, told Borden &quot;The man is insane&quot;, and that Canada needed a new defence minister at once. The deputy prime minister, Sir George Foster, wrote in his diary on 22 September 1914: &quot;There is only one feeling about Sam. That he is crazy.&quot; The industrialist, Sir Joseph Flavelle, wrote that Hughes was &quot;mentally unbalanced with the low cunning and cleverness often associated with the insane.&quot; Borden in his memoirs wrote about Hughes that his behavior was &quot;so eccentric as to justify the conclusion that his mind was unbalanced&quot;.

Hughes encouraged the recruitment of volunteers following the First World War&#x27;s outbreak and ordered the construction of Camp Valcartier on August 7, 1914, demanding it to be finished by the time the entire force was assembled. With the aid of 400 workmen, Hughes saw the completion of the camp. Unfortunately the camp was poorly organized. With approximately 33,000 recruits, training became a chaotic process. There was little time to train the volunteers, so the training system was rushed. Another problem was that the camp&#x27;s population was constantly growing, which made planning a difficult task.

Hughes was infamous for belligerently giving orders to troops and their officers and he publicly criticized officers in front of their men, telling one officer who was speaking too quietly for his liking &quot;Pipe up, you little bugger or get out of the service!&quot; When Hughes addressed one officer as a captain, only to be told by the man that he was a lieutenant, Hughes promoted him on the spot to captain. When it was pointed out that he did not have that power as minister of defence, Hughes shouted &quot;Sir, I know what I&#x27;m talking about!&quot; and said if he wanted to promote the officer to a captain, then the officer was a captain. Hughes insisted on riding around the camp surrounded by an honour guard of lancers and shouting out orders for infantry manoeuvres long since removed from the training manuals like &quot;Form square!&quot;; when presented with such commands, the soldiers did their best to guess what it was he wanted them to do, though Hughes seemed well satisfied. Volunteer morale was challenged by inadequate tents, shortages of greatcoats, and confusion regarding equipment and storage. However, Hughes was praised for the speed of his actions by Prime Minister Borden and members of the cabinet. All of the officers Hughes chose to command the brigades and battalions of the First Contingent were Anglo-Canadians. François-Louis Lessard, a Permanent Force officer with an outstanding record in the Boer War was denied by Hughes permission to join the First Contingent even through his record certainly merited such an appointment. Lessard was a Permanent Force man, a Catholic and a French-Canadian, and for all reasons, Hughes would not allow him to join the CEF. Recruitment of volunteers in Quebec might have yielded better results if Lessard had been given a command position. By October 1914, the troops were mobilized and ready to leave for England. As the First Contingent embarked for Europe in Quebec City on 3 October 1914, Hughes sat astride his horse to deliver a speech that caused the men of the First Contingent to boo and jeer him. Borden wrote in his diary that Hughes&#x27;s speech was &quot;flamboyant and grandiloquent&quot; and that &quot;Everybody laughing at Sam&#x27;s address.&quot;

Despite Hughes&#x27;s claims about the superiority of Canadians over British soldiers, two-thirds of the First Contingent were British immigrants to Canada. The majority of the 1,811 officers of the First Contingent were Canadian-born men who had previously held commissions in the Militia or Permanent Force. The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein wrote that an &quot;extraordinary&quot; 228,170 of the about 470,000 British male immigrants in Canada enlisted in the CEF during the war, making them easily the largest ethnic group in the CEF at 48.5%, and not until conscription was introduced in 1917 did the majority of the CEF finally become Canadian-born. Even in 1918, the Canadian-born soldiers consisted of 51.4% of the total serving, with the majority of the rest being British immigrants.

===From Salisbury Plain to Flanders Fields===
Hughes left for London at the same time as the First Contingent did, as he heard correct reports that the British War Secretary, Lord Kitchener, was planning on breaking up the CEF when it arrived in Britain to assign its battalions to the British Army. As Hughes took an ocean liner he arrived in Southampton several days before the CEF&#x27;s arrival, and upon his landing, he told the British press that if it was not for him that the convoy of 30 ships taking the CEF across the North Atlantic would have been torpedoed by U-boats, though just how Hughes had saved the 30 ships from U-boats was left unexplained. Hughes was determined that the CEF fight together and upon arriving in London, went dressed in his full ceremonial uniform as a major-general in the Canadian militia, to see Kitchener. Hughes clashed with Kitchener and insisted quite vehemently that the CEF not be broken up. In a telegram to Borden, Hughes wrote: &quot;I determined that Canada was not to be treated as a Crown Colony and that, as we paid the bill and furnished the goods, which in nearly every instance were better than the British, I would act.&quot; Hughes won his bureaucratic battle with Kitchener and ensured the CEF stayed together, mostly by arguing that since the Dominion was paying the entire costs of maintaining the CEF, the Dominion government should have the final say over its deployment. Berton wrote that ensuring the CEF stayed together was Hughes&#x27;s greatest achievement, as without his intervention in October 1914, what ultimately became the Canadian Corps of four divisions would never have existed. In the fall of 1914, Hughes created the Shell Committee to manufacture shells and bullets for both the Canadians and the British. By Christmas 1914, the Shell Committee had orders for 2 million shells and 1.9 million brass casings.

As the CEF took up its training facilities on Salisbury Plain, Hughes wanted the 1st Canadian Division to be commanded by a Canadian general. He very reluctantly accepted a British officer, Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson, as the commander of the 1st Division when it turned out that there was no qualified Canadian officer. Hughes&#x27;s insistence on supplying the CEF with Canadian-made equipment, regardless of its quality, made for difficult conditions for the men of the CEF, with many soldiers already complaining about the Ross rifle in training. Alderson replaced the Shield Shovels invented by Hughes&#x27;s secretary, Ena MacAdam, with the standard British Army shovel, much to the relief of the CEF and to Hughes&#x27;s fury. Hughes constantly sought to undermine Alderson&#x27;s command, regularly involving himself in divisional matters that were not the normal concern of a defence minister. The first Canadian unit to see action was Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, a regiment privately raised by a wealthy Montreal industrialist, Hamilton Gault, which arrived on the Western Front in December 1914, separately from the First Contingent. On 16 February 1915, the CEF arrived in France to head for the front lines, taking up position at the crucial Ypres Salient in Belgium.

On 22 April 1915, at the Ypres salient, the German Army unleashed 160 tons of chlorine gas. From the German lines arose an ominous yellow cloud which floated across no-man&#x27;s land to bring death and suffering to the Allied soldiers on the other side, killing 1,400 French and Algerian soldiers in the trenches, leaving another 2,000 blinded while the rest broke and fled in terror. Despite the dangers of the gas which blinded when it did not kill, the 1st Canadian Division stepped up to hold the line on the night of 22–23 April and prevented the Germans from marching through the 4-mile hole in the Allied lines created when the French and Algerians fled. On 23 April, the Germans unleashed the chlorine gas on the Canadian lines, leading to &quot;desperate fighting&quot; as the Canadians used improvised gas-masks of urine-soaked rags while complaining about the Ross rifles, which too often jammed up in combat. The Second Battle of Ypres was the first major battle for the Canadians, costing the 1st Division 6,035 men killed, wounded, or missing, while Princess Patricia&#x27;s battalion lost 678 dead, and gave the CEF a reputation as a &quot;tough force&quot; that was to last for the rest of the war. The Canadians had held the line at Ypres in spite of appalling conditions and unlike the French and Algerians, the Canadians did not flee when faced with the cloud of gas.

Hughes was ecstatic at the news that the Canadians had won their first battle, which in his own mind validated everything he had done as defence minister. At the same time, Hughes attacked Alderson for the losses at Ypres, claiming that a Canadian general would have done a better job and was furious when he learned that Alderson wanted to replace the Ross rifles with Lee-Enfield rifles. In a telegram to Max Aitken, the Canadian millionaire living in London whom Hughes had appointed as his representative in Britain, Hughes wrote: &quot;It is the general opinion that scores of our officers can teach the British officers for many moons to come.&quot; In September 1915, the Second Contingent arrived on the Western Front in the form of the 2nd Canadian Division, and the Canadian Corps was created. Alderson was appointed the corps commander, while for first time, Canadians were given divisional command with Arthur Currie of Victoria taking command of the 1st Division and Richard Turner of Quebec City taking command of the 2nd Division. Hughes himself had wanted to take command of the Canadian Corps, but Borden had prevented this. In May 1915, Hughes first learned that Currie had embezzled some $10,000 from his militia regiment in Victoria in June 1914 and the police were recommending criminal charges be brought against him. One of Hughes&#x27;s agents, Harold Daly, wrote after the war he had been ordered by the Defence Minister &quot;to assure General Currie that his personal interests were being looked after and he was on no account to worry.&quot; In the spring of 1915, the Second Contingent had been raised and departed for training in England.

===Mismanaging the war===
Hughes was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, on August 24, 1915. In 1916 he was made an honorary lieutenant-general in the British Army.
A Regimental and King&#x27;s Colours display and plaque at Knox Presbyterian Church (Ottawa) is dedicated to the memory of those who served in the 207th (Ottawa-Carleton) Battalion, CEF during the First World War. The Regimental Colours were donated by the American Bank Note Company and presented by Hughes to the battalion on Parliament Hill on November 18, 1916.

In spite of mounting criticism from 1915 onward at the way in which Hughes ran the Defence Department in wartime, the politically indebted Borden kept Hughes on.To Borden, events seemed to prove that many of Hughes&#x27;s opinions were right, as the prime minister visited the Western Front in the summer of 1915 and became convinced that much of what Hughes had to say about the inefficiency of the British Army was correct. Hughes&#x27;s methods were unorthodox and chaotic, but Hughes argued he was merely cutting through the red-tape to help &quot;the boys&quot; in the field. Finally, Borden in his dealings with British officials often found them patronising and condescending, which led him to side with his nationalist defence minister who argued that Canadians were the equals of the &quot;mother country&quot; in imperial affairs, and should not be talked down to.

The same summer, it emerged that the Shell Committee had $170 million worth in orders to fulfill while it delivered only $5.5 million of its orders, with accusations being made that Hughes&#x27;s friends were engaging in war profiting. With the support of Borden, the British Minister of Munitions, David Lloyd George stopped all orders until Canada created the Imperial Munitions Board headed by the industrialist Sir Joseph Flavelle. Flavelle ended the corruption and increased efficiency in the munitions industry, reaching the point that by 1917 Canadian factories were turning out some $2 million worth of shells per day. Hughes was enraged at the way that Flavelle had taken over an important function from his department, and even more that the Imperial Munitions Board was far more efficient and honest than the Defence Department had been. Despite the scandal caused by the Shell Committee, which led Borden to face very embarrassing questions in the House of Commons and to hopes on the part of Laurier that he might become prime minister again, Hughes was not sacked.

Between October 1914 – September 1915, 71 battalions had been raised for the CEF by the existing militia regiments, but the losses in the war required even more men. In August 1915, Hughes announced that any individual or group could form a &quot;chum&#x27;s battalion&quot; (also known as a &quot;pal&#x27;s battalion&quot;) for the CEF, leading to the formation of various units such as Highland battalions for Scots-Canadians, Irish battalions for Irish-Canadians, &quot;sports&quot; battalions based upon men interested in common sport like hockey, American battalions for American volunteers, Orange battalions for Orangemen, &quot;bantam&quot; battalions for men shorter than 5′2″, and so forth. The &quot;pal&#x27;s battalion&quot; campaign was based upon the &quot;chum&#x27;s battalion&quot; campaign launched in Britain in 1914. Though Hughes&#x27;s &quot;pal&#x27;s battalions&quot; campaign raised 170 new battalions by 1916, only 40 reached full strength, and many of the men who joined during the &quot;pal&#x27;s&quot; campaign were underage, unfit, or too old, as recruiting colonels were more concerned about the quantity of volunteers than the quality. Of only those Canadians who saw combat in the war, 60% had joined by the end of 1915, and by the beginning of 1916 the number of volunteers fell off drastically with only 2,810 men volunteering between July 1916 – October 1917. In March 1916, a 3rd Division was formed by amalgamating Princess Patricia&#x27;s Light Infantry, the Royal Canadian Regiment (a Permanent Force regiment, which previously guarded Bermuda against the unlikely threat of German invasion), and various mounted rifle units that had been stationed in England since the spring of 1915. The 3rd Division first saw action on 1 June 1916 in the Battle of Mount Sorrel, which was lost to the Germans and then taken back by 13 June. In September 1916, the Canadian Corps entered the Battle of the Somme, fighting on until the end of the battle in November, and suffered 24,029 casualties. The &quot;chum&#x27;s battalions&quot; raised in 1915 were formed into the 4th Division, which first saw action on the Somme on 10 October 1916. The 4th Division was commanded by David Watson, the owner of the &quot;Quebec Chronicle&quot; newspaper, who been personally chosen by Hughes, who thought highly of him. 

Hughes, an Orangeman prone to anti-Catholic sentiments and not well liked among French Canadians, increased tensions by sending Anglocentrics to recruit French Canadians, and by forcing French volunteers to speak English in training. He reluctantly accepted Japanese-Canadians and Chinese-Canadians for the CEF and assigned black Canadians to construction units. However, some black Canadians did manage to enlist as infantrymen, as Chartrand noted that in a painting by Eric Kennington of the 16th Canadian Scottish Battalion marching through the ruins of a French village, one of the soldiers wearing kilts in the painting is a black man. In marked contrast to his attitudes towards black Canadian and Asian Canadian volunteers, Hughes encouraged the enlistment of First Nations volunteers into the CEF as it was believed that Indians would make for ferocious soldiers. The First Nations volunteers were generally assigned as snipers out of the belief that Indians were expert marksmen, and the most deadly sniper of the war with 378 kills was the Ojibwa Francis Pegahmagabow.

Despite orders from the Governor-General not to, Hughes used Defence Department funds to buy newspaper ads in the neutral United States recruiting for the American Legion that he planned to form within the CEF. Borden was unaware until early 1916 that Hughes had recruited a battalion of American volunteers, which he first learned of after receiving American complaints about Canadian violations of American neutrality. Borden was even astonished to learn that an American Unitarian clergyman living in Toronto, the Reverend C.S. Bullock, whom Hughes had appointed his chief recruiter for the American Legion, had also received from Hughes a colonel&#x27;s commission in the CEF despite having no military experience.

Between 1914 and 1916, Hughes raised in total about half million volunteers for the CEF, of whom only about 13,000 were French-Canadians. Hughes&#x27;s hostility towards French Canada together with his decision not to call out the militia in 1914 contributed at least in part to the failure of recruiting in Quebec, despite the Defence Department spending $30,000 in Quebec in a campaign headed by Colonel Arthur Mignault in 1916 to recruit more volunteers. After the battle of Courcelette in 1916, two of the CEF&#x27;s battalions from Quebec, the 163rd &quot;Poil-aux-pattes&quot; commanded by Olivar Asselin and the 189th, a group of hard-fighting &quot;Gaspésiens&quot; who included two winners of the Victoria Cross, had to be broken up owing to a lack of replacements for their losses. The remaining men from the 163rd and 189th went into the 22nd Battalion, the future &quot;Van Doos&quot;, whose men won more decorations for valor than any of the other battalions of the CEF by the end of the war. However, the failure of the recruiting efforts were also due to an attempt by the Ontario government in 1916 to ban schools for the French-Canadian minority in Ontario, which caused much resentment in Quebec, being seen as an attempt by the Orange Order, which was powerful in Ontario, to stamp out the French culture and language. Recruiting efforts in &quot;la belle province&quot; also failed due to Quebec&#x27;s status as the most industrialised province as Montreal at the time was Canada&#x27;s largest and most wealthiest city. During the war, munitions and textile plants in Montreal offered higher wages than anything the CEF could offer, and many French-Canadian men preferred to support the war effort by working in a factory in Montreal rather than enlisting in the CEF. Granatstein noted that French-Canadians made up 30% of Canada&#x27;s population, but only 4% of the CEF, and that French-Canadians living outside of Quebec, as the Acadians in New Brunswick, were more likely to enlist than those in Quebec.

Over the course of the war, the policies carried out by the Ministry of Defence and Militia were much marked by inefficiency and waste, largely caused by Hughes as Morton wrote: &quot;Hughes&#x27;s perennial contempt for military professionals, shared by his overseas agent, Max Aitken, became an excuse for chaos and influence-peddling in militia administration&quot;. As scandals continued from the exposure of wasteful purchasing in 1915 to the &quot;munitions scandal&quot; of 1916 which exposed Hughes&#x27;s flunky J. Wesley Allison as corrupt, Borden took away various functions from Defence Ministry to be handled by an independent board or commission headed by men who were not cronies of Hughes. Hughes was widely resented and disliked by the men of the CEF and when Hughes visited Camp Borden in July 1916, &quot;his boys&quot; loudly booed him, blaming the minister for the shortages of water at Camp Borden.

Hughes&#x27;s policy of raising new battalions instead of sending the reinforcements to the existing battalions led to much administrative waste and ultimately led to most of the new battalions being broken up to provide manpower for the older battalions. To manage the Canadian Expeditionary Force in London, Hughes created a confusing system of overlapping authorities run by three senior officers, in order to make himself the ultimate arbiter of every issue. The most important of the officers in England was Major-General John Wallace Carson, a mining magnate from Montreal and a friend of Hughes, who proved himself a skillful intriguer. While the officers in London feuded for Hughes&#x27;s favour, what Morton called a &quot;...burgeoning, wasteful, array of camps, offices, depots, hospitals, and commands spread out across England.&quot; Twice, Borden sent Hughes to England to impose order and efficiency, and twice the prime minister was gravely disappointed. In September 1916, Hughes acting on his own and without informing Borden, announced in London the formation of the &quot;Acting Overseas Sub-Militia Council&quot; to be chaired by Carson with Hughes&#x27;s son-in-law to serve as the chief secretary.

===Controversy===
His historical reputation was sullied further by poor decisions on procurements for the force. Insisting on the utilization of Canadian manufactured equipment, Hughes presided over the deployment of equipment that was often inappropriate for the Western Front, or of dubious quality. Previous to 1917, this negatively affected the operational performance of the CEF. The Ross rifle, MacAdam Shield Shovel, boots and webbing (developed for use in the South African War), and the Colt machine gun were all Canadian items which were eventually replaced or abandoned due to quality or severe functionality issues. The management of spending for supplies was eventually taken away from Hughes and assigned to the newly formed War Purchasing Commission in 1915. It was not until Hughes&#x27; resignation in November 1916 that the Ross rifle was fully abandoned by the CEF in favour of the British standard Lee–Enfield rifle.

Canadian staff officers possessed an extremely limited level of experience and competence at the start of the war, having been discouraged from passing through the British Staff College for many years prior. Compounding the issue was Hughes&#x27; regular attempts to promote and appoint officers based upon patronage and Canadian nativism instead of ability, an act which not only created tension and jealousy between units but ultimately negatively affected the operating performance of the CEF as well. Lieutenant-General Julian Byng, who replaced Alderson as commander of the CEF from May 1916, eventually became so incensed with the continuous interference on the part of Hughes that he threatened to resign. Byng, an aristocrat and a career British Army officer who was modest in his tastes and known for his care for his men, was very popular with the rank and file of the Canadian Corps, who called themselves &quot;the Byng boys&quot;. This in turn sparked Hughes&#x27;s jealousy. On 17 August 1916, Byng and Hughes had dinner where Hughes announced in his typical bombastic way that he never made a mistake and would hold the power of promotion within the Canadian Corps; Byng in reply stated that as a corps commander he had the power of promotion, that he would inform Hughes before any making promotions as a courtesy, and would resign if Hughes continued his interference with his command in the same way he had with Alderson. When Hughes claimed &quot;I am never wrong&quot;, Byng replied &quot;What a damn dull life you must have had, Minister!&quot; Byng wanted to give command of the 2nd Division to Henry Burstall, who had greatly distinguished himself, over the objections of Hughes, who wanted to give command of the 2nd Division to his son Garnet, whom Byng regarded as a mediocrity unfit to command anything. Byng diplomatically told Hughes he had not appointed his son because the &quot;Canadians deserved and expected the best leaders available&quot;. Byng wrote to Borden to say that he would not tolerate political interference in his corps, and he would resign if the younger Hughes was given the command of the 2nd Division rather than Burstall, who did indeed receive the appointment.

Criticism from Field Marshal Douglas Haig, King George V and from within his own party gradually forced Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden to tighten control over Hughes. The &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; in an editorial on 22 June 1916 attacked Hughes for his &quot;swashbuckling&quot; speeches that were damaging relations with Britain. Borden, becoming assertive as the war continued on, began to tire of Hughes&#x27;s tirades before the cabinet, and hinted more than once he was thinking about sacking him. However, it was not until Hughes&#x27; political isolation, with the creation of the Ministry of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada, overseen by George Halsey Perley, and subsequent forced resignation in November 1916, that the CEF was able to concentrate on the task of the spring offensive without persistent staffing interference. The creation of the Ministry of Overseas Military Forces to run the CEF was a major reduction in Hughes&#x27;s power, causing him to rage and threaten Borden. After Hughes sent Borden an extremely insulting letter on 1 November 1916, the prime minister vacillated for the next nine days before making his decision. Borden&#x27;s patience with Hughes finally broke, and he dismissed him from the cabinet on 9 November 1916. In his letter dismissing him, Borden stated that he was fired because of his &quot;strong tendency to assume powers which [he did] not possess&quot;, and because the prime minister no longer had the &quot;time or energy&quot; to keeping solving all of the problems he had created.

Hughes later claimed in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; to have served &quot;in France, 1914–15&quot; despite not being released from his ministry and not having been given any command in the field. His presence at the Western Front was limited to his visits to troops.

==On the margins==
Hughes&#x27;s firing from the cabinet was greeted with relief by the rest of cabinet with the deputy prime minister Forster writing in his diary &quot;the nightmare is removed&quot;. In the CEF, both the officers and the other ranks also generally welcomed his sacking. An embittered Hughes set out to embarrass Borden in the House of Commons by making accusations that Borden was mismanaging the war effort, though Hughes&#x27;s determination to not appear unpatriotic imposed some limits on his willingness to attack the government. In his first speech to the Commons after his sacking on 20 January 1917, Hughes accused the finance minister, Sir William Thomas White, of running up the national debt irresponsibly, and his successor Albert Edward Kemp of mismanaging the defence ministry. By this time, Borden, whom many dismissed as a milquetoast at the beginning of the war, had shown himself to be tougher leader than many had expected, and for a great many people in English Canada, it was Borden rather than Hughes who emerged as the symbol of the national will to victory by 1917.

With the financial support of his millionaire friend Aitken, who was now ennobled as Lord Beaverbrook, Hughes planned to start a third party, the War Party, which would allow him to become prime minister. The plan called for Beaverbrook and another right-wing millionaire &quot;press baron&quot; Lord Rothermere to buy up most of the newspapers in English Canada to build support for the War Party. However, the plan collapsed when Rothermere showed no interest in the project, and Beaverbrook refused to move unless Rothermere joined the project. After Hughes&#x27;s sacking, many of his friends abandoned him, and Beaverbrook was one of the few who remained close to him, though the fact that Beaverbrook was living in London meant he rarely saw him in person. In January 1917, Hughes floated another plan for Beaverbrook to use his influence with David Lloyd George, by then British prime minister, to have him in turn use his influence with King George V to have Hughes appointed to the Privy Council. Lloyd George consulted with Borden, who emphatically stated that the king should be not advised to give Hughes a seat on the Privy Council. Lloyd George told Beaverbrook that Hughes could best serve the war effort by remaining a backbench Conservative MP in Canada. At the same time, Hughes remained frustrated that Garnet Hughes was only commanding the 5th Canadian Division in England, which was used for training men sent to the four front line divisions of the Canadian Corps. When Currie replaced Byng as the commander of the Canadian Corps, Hughes wrote to him, saying it was time for his son to command the 1st Division. When Currie kept the younger Hughes in command of the 5th Division, Hughes turned on him. As Currie had embezzled money from his militia regiment in June 1914, and was only being saved from criminal charges in 1915 when Hughes intervened on his behalf, the latter accused the former of ingratitude.

By 1917, Hughes had become extremely paranoid, writing in a letter to his son Garnet, that his mail was being &quot;tampered with...and they even had detectives on prominent friends of mine.&quot; In the same letter, Hughes called the war effort &quot;hell on earth&quot; without him to lead it, and labelled Borden a &quot;weakling&quot;. The Canadian historian Tim Cook wrote by 1917 Hughes was losing his mind as he &quot;appeared to be suffering from some form of nascent dementia&quot;. Borden decided to break his promise against conscription because of mounting casualties, he proposed in May 1917 a coalition Union government that would bring together the Conservatives and the Liberals. Laurier refused, but many English Canadian Liberal MPs crossed the floor to join the Union government. Hughes was against the idea of the Union government, saying at a Tory caucus meeting that a Union government would &quot;forever wipe out&quot; the Conservative Party. Hughes saw a coalition government as being a hostile takeover of the Conservative Party by the Liberals. In the Conscription crisis of 1917, Hughes attacked Borden at first for bringing in conscription, claiming that enough volunteers to keep the Canadian Corps fighting would have been found had he continued as Defence Minister, but he changed his mind after receiving pro-conscription letters from his constituents in Victoria County. In the 1917 election Hughes did not run at first as a Union candidate, instead running as a Conservative, and his main challenger was a Union candidate endorsed by Borden. Three weeks before the election, Hughes finally declared his support for the Union government, which led the Unionist candidate to drop out in favour of Hughes. In the 1917 election, Hughes was returned with his greatest margin of victory ever. Hughes during his time as Defence Minister had used funds from the Dominion government to bring about a number of municipal improvements in Lindsay, increasing his popularity in Victoria County. One visitor from Toronto asked a local farmer what county he was in, and received the reply &quot;This is Sam Hughes&#x27;s country!&quot;

After Currie won the Battles of Hill 70, Lens, and finally Passchendaele in November 1917, Hughes requested a meeting in January 1918 with Borden to discuss &quot;Lens and somewhat similar massacres&quot;. When Borden refused, Hughes accused Currie in another letter to Borden of &quot;massacres&quot; of &quot;my boys&quot; due to &quot;bullheadness and incompetency&quot;. At least part of the motive for the attack on Currie was the failure of the War Party, which led Hughes to make it his life mission to &quot;expose the whole rotten show overseas&quot; to ruin the reputation of Borden. In a letter to Lord Beaverbrook, Hughes wrote: &quot;Currie was a coward at St. Julien and a damned fool ever since. He was the cause of practically having murdered thousands of men at Lens and Paschendaele [Passchendaele], and it is generally supposed the motive was to prevent the possibility of Turner coming back with the Second Army Corps, and to prevent Garnet from commanding a Division.&quot; Cook described this letter as the most malicious of all Hughes&#x27;s accusations against Currie as he was claiming that Currie had deliberately caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Canadians to force the government to send reinforcements to the Canadian Corps, and thereby prevent the creation of a second corps to be commanded by Turner, who had been dismissed from active command in 1916.

Ignoring the existence of the Imperial War Cabinet, Hughes in a speech in Toronto claimed: &quot;A Dominion which sends to an European war an army immeasurably greater than the Allied armies sent to the Crimea cannot again have the issue of peace and war determined for her by a government in which she is not represented.&quot; In another speech at a Masonic Lodge in Toronto on 9 January 1918, he demanded that all males in the age group 10–16 undergo militia training. In spite of concerns about possible riots, Hughes travelled to Montreal to give a speech attacking Borden for not conscripting what he claimed were 700,000 young men all across Canada. His speeches attacking Borden in Toronto and Montreal were well received by his audiences. On 6 May 1918, Hughes in a speech before the Commons denounced the Ministry of Overseas Forces for an excessive number of bureaucrats, and for the first time indirectly attacked Currie as he spoke of officers with a &quot;reckless disregard for life&quot;. In October 1918, Hughes had written Borden a letter accusing Currie of &quot;useless massacres of our Canadian boys, as needlessly occurred at Cambrai.&quot; Borden ignored Hughes&#x27;s request that Currie and his &quot;Black-hand Gang&quot; be sacked.

==Feud with Currie==
The news of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 was ill-received by Hughes, who felt that Currie had stolen the glory of victory was rightfully his. In December 1918, Currie learned from friends in Canada that Hughes was telling anybody who would listen that he was &quot;a murderer, a coward, a drunkard and almost everything else that is bad and vile&quot;. In a letter to his sister, Currie wrote &quot;Sam Hughes is a vindictive and bitterly disappointed man, and so is his son Garnet&quot;.

On 4 March 1919, in a speech before the Commons, Hughes accused Currie of &quot;needlessly sacrificing the lives of Canadian soldiers&quot;. As part of his speech, Hughes read out several of his 1918 letters to Borden, which was thereby entered in &quot;Hansard&quot; (allowing the press to quote from them), and thus incriminated Borden in his accusations against Currie. In particular, Hughes made much of the Second Battle of Mons in November 1918, claiming that Currie had only attacked Mons to have the Canadian Corps end the war for the British Empire where it began (the British Expeditionary Force fought its first battle at Mons in August 1914). Hughes always attacked Currie in speeches in the Commons, where criminal and civil law did not apply, ensuring he did not need fear a libel suit or a criminal charges for selectively quoting from official documents that were still classified as secret. Hughes&#x27;s controversial speech attracted much attention. Hughes&#x27;s speech accusing Currie of &quot;murder&quot; left most Canadians at the time &quot;stunned&quot;. On 5 March 1919, &quot;The Toronto Daily Star&quot; published as a lead story on the front page a defence of Currie&#x27;s leadership at the Second Battle of Cambrai, noting that Currie had the infantry supported by tanks encircle Cambrai, instead of the &quot;mad frontal assault&quot; claimed by Hughes. &quot;The Toronto Globe&quot; in an editorial on 6 March wrote: &quot;The terrors of the war have been great and manifold for our gallant men in France, but Sir Sam Hughes is a greater terror than any of them. The enemy never dealt a fouler blow than that directed by Sir Sam Hughes against the leaders of the Canadian Army still in the field and unable to defend themselves&quot;. Cook noted the strangest aspect of the Hughes-Currie affair was that Hughes did not reveal that Currie was an embezzler, something that greatly worried Currie at the time. Hughes may have restrained himself as the fact he prevented criminal charges from being laid against Currie in 1915 would have left himself open to charges of obstruction of justice and abuse of his powers as defence minister.

In his last two years of his life, Hughes believed that it was Currie, whom he was relentless in attacking, as the man behind what he regarded as the plots against him. In a letter to Garnet in May 1919, he wrote: &quot;I have the fullest evidence now that upwards of nine months or more ago, instructions have been issued in a propaganda form to certain writers and correspondents, &#x27;On every occasion, Sir Sam must be overshadowed by others&#x27;. And in several instances I have the definite instructions, &#x27;Under any and every circumstances Sir Sam must be completely overshadowed by Sir Arthur Curry [Currie]&#x27;&quot; In September 1919, Hughes in a speech to the Commons accused Currie of cowardice at the Second Battle of Ypres, claiming he fled in abject terror from his command post when he saw the yellow cloud of chlorine gas floating across no-man&#x27;s land. On 16 June 1920, Hughes in another speech before the House said that Currie&#x27;s military reputation was &quot;propaganda&quot; and there were dozens of officers who &quot;are regarded throughout the length and breadth of this country as infinitely superior to General Sir Arthur Currie as a general or as a gentleman&quot;. Currie never responded publicly to these attacks, out of the fear that Hughes might reveal that he had stolen $10,000 from his regiment in Victoria, but he was greatly wounded and hurt.

==Death==
In the summer of 1921, Hughes was informed by his doctors that he had only weeks to live. He returned to his home in the forests of Victoria County, which had been built to resemble a luxurious hunting lodge. On his deathbed, a Methodist minister came to offer solace, only to be told by the ever combative Hughes: &quot;Don&#x27;t you bother about me. Pretty soon I&#x27;ll be sitting on the right hand of God and I&#x27;ll be able to arrange things all right enough.&quot;

Sam Hughes died of pernicious anaemia, aged sixty-eight, in August 1921, and was survived by his son, Garnet Hughes, who served in the First World War, and his grandson, Samuel Hughes, who was a field historian in the Second World War and later a judge. On 26 August 1921, his funeral in Lindsay became the largest ever in the town, being attended by 20,000 people. To honour &quot;Lindsay&#x27;s foremost citizen&quot;, his coffin was carried by six veterans down the main street of Lindsay together with 45th Victoria Regiment, who marched to the somber tunes of drums and bagpipes. At the Riverside Cemetery, Hughes&#x27;s coffin was placed into the earth while bugler Arthur Rhodes winner of the Military Medal played &quot;The Last Post&quot; and artillery guns fired 15 salutes. He and his wife are buried together.

==Awards and decorations==


==Plaques==
A memorial plaque dedicated to the memory of Sam Hughes was erected in front of the Victoria Park Armoury building in Lindsay, Ontario. It reads:
Soldier, journalist, imperialist and Member of Parliament for Lindsay, Ontario from 1892 to 1921, Sam Hughes helped to create a distinctively Canadian Army. As Minister of Militia and Defence (1911–1916) he raised the Canadian Expeditionary Force which fought in World War I, and was knighted for his services. Disagreements with his colleagues and subordinates forced his retirement from the Cabinet in 1916.&quot; 
Sir Sam Hughes is also listed on the WW1 Memorial Cenotaph in front of the Lindsay Public Library.

<doc id="287670" wikidata="Q1200011" url="?curid=287670" title="Ju-On">
<text>is a Japanese horror franchise created by Takashi Shimizu. The franchise began in 1998 with the release of the short films &quot;Katasumi&quot; and &quot;4444444444&quot;. Shimizu attended the Film School of Tokyo, where he studied under Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Kurosawa helped Shimizu shepherd the &quot;Ju-On&quot; projects to fruition.

The &quot;Ju-On&quot; films generally revolve around a curse created in a house in Nerima, Tokyo, when Takeo Saeki, convinced that his wife, Kayako, is having an affair with another man, murders her, their son, Toshio, and Toshio&#x27;s pet cat in a jealous fit of rage. According to &quot;Ju-On&quot;, when a person dies with a deep and powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in the place where that person has died or which they frequented, and repeats itself there. The spirits of the deceased haunt the location, potentially killing anyone who encounters the curse by any means, such as entering a cursed house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed after entering it. The curse&#x27;s manifestation is mainly death, where the victims&#x27; bodies may or may not disappear. The following deaths may create more curses and spread them to other locations.

The franchise consists of thirteen films, including four American-produced films and one streaming television series, alongside various additional media and merchandise products.

==History==
Shimizu stated in an interview that the inspiration for &quot;Ju-On&quot; came from his own personal fears as a child, and from a Japanese butoh dance group that would paint their nude bodies white and perform. Shimizu found the performance frightening and decided to &quot;paint [his] ghosts white&quot;. He also mentioned that the rise in the number of domestic abuse cases emerging in Japan during production of his previous films gave him ideas about the origins of the story.

The title of the Japanese films translates roughly to &quot;Curse of Grudge&quot;, or more abstractly, a curse created due to an individual bearing a grudge against someone or something. The first two films in the series were so-called V-Cinema, or direct-to-video releases, but became surprise hits as the result of favorable word of mouth. Both films were shot in nine days and feature a story that is a variation on the classic haunted house theme, as well as a popular Japanese horror trope, the &quot;vengeful ghost&quot; (&quot;onryō&quot;). The titular curse, &quot;ju-on&quot;, is one which takes on a life of its own and seeks new victims. Anyone who encounters a ghost killed by the curse is killed themselves and the curse is able to be spread to other areas.

Under very tight budgetary constraints, Shimizu&#x27;s films garnered much acclaim from both critics and genre fans for their effective use of limited locations and eerie atmosphere to generate chills. Shimizu was at the same time perfectly willing to show his ghosts onscreen, in contrast to some directors who might choose only to hint at their appearance. Critics noted that Shimizu&#x27;s minimalist approach to directing and storytelling—a necessary by-product of the production&#x27;s limited overall resources—allows the films to retain their ability to unnerve viewers. Very few scenes in the movies are graphically bloody, making such scenes more disturbing when they occur.

Following the success of the two direct-to-video films, and the international success of Hideo Nakata&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; (1998), Kurosawa and &quot;Ring&quot; screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi helped Shimizu develop a theatrical &quot;Ju-On&quot; sequel starring Megumi Okina and Takako Fuji. The film, titled &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot;, was released on October 18, 2002, to critical acclaim, and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge 2&quot;, that was released on August 23, 2003.

The rights to an American film remake of &quot;The Grudge&quot; were eventually acquired, with Shimizu himself attached to direct and Sarah Michelle Gellar starring. The film was released in 2004 to mixed reviews. The film&#x27;s box office success would lead it to spawn its own series of American-produced films, including 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Grudge 2&quot; and 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Grudge 3&quot;. Both films follow a unique storyline, albeit &quot;The Grudge 2&quot; still drawing inspiration from several Japanese films.

In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the franchise, two new sequels, &quot;Ju-On: White Ghost&quot; and &quot;Ju-On: Black Ghost&quot; were screen simultaneously in Japanese theaters in 2009. The stories of two films deviate from that of the cursed Saeki family, focusing on two unrelated, but also, ill-fated families.

For the fifteenth anniversary of the &quot;Ju-On&quot; franchise, a reboot was released in 2014, titled &quot;Ju-On: The Beginning of the End&quot;. Drawing inspiration from &quot;The Grudge 2&quot;, &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; features a new backstory regarding the curse, while still featuring the Saeki family as an integral part of the plot. The film was followed by a 2015 sequel, &quot;Ju-On: The Final Curse&quot;, which was promoted as the final film in the series. Both films had no significant input from series creator Shimizu.

A crossover with the &quot;Ring&quot; franchise, &quot;Sadako vs. Kayako&quot;, was released on June 18, 2016.

Another installment of the American film series was released on December 31, 2019, to generally negative reviews.

&quot;Grudge&quot; director, Nicolas Pesce, expressed interest in a crossover between the American &quot;Grudge&quot; and &quot;Ring&quot; film series, just as was done with 2016&#x27;s &quot;Sadako vs. Kayako&quot;. Prior to his film&#x27;s release, Pesce expressed further interest in a sequel being set in both a different part of the world than America or Japan, and in a different &quot;less contemporary&quot; time period compared to previous films.

A TV series adaptation, titled &quot;Ju-On: Origins&quot;, was released exclusively on Netflix worldwide on July 3, 2020.

== TV series ==
&quot;Ju-On: Origins&quot; is a streaming television series. The series premiered on Netflix on July 3, 2020 with a total of 6 episodes.

==Theater==
A stage play adaptation of &quot;Ju-On&quot; was developed in 2023. It adapts the plots from &quot;Ju-On: The Curse&quot; and its sequel.

==Literature==
Several &quot;Ju-On&quot; print publications were published by Kadokawa in Japan, and Dark Horse Comics in North America between 2003 and 2015. Every single &quot;Ju-On&quot; film has received a novel adaptation, except for &quot;The Grudge 3&quot;.

===Novels===
In 2003, novelizations of stories from the series were written by Kei Ohishi. The first novel, &quot;Ju-on&quot;, elaborates on events and characters from &quot;Ju-On: The Curse&quot;, &quot;The Curse 2&quot; and &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot;. A novel titled &quot;Ju-On 2&quot; was released the same year, which elaborates on the events from &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge 2&quot;. Novelizations of &quot;Ju-On: White Ghost&quot; and &quot;Black Ghost&quot; were published in 2009. &quot;Ju-On 2&quot;, &quot;White Ghost&quot; and &quot;Black Ghost&quot; did not receive English translations. In 2014, a novelization of &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; was released and a novelization of &quot;The Final Curse&quot; was released in 2015.

Official Japanese-language novelizations of the American films were also written by Kei Ohishi, the first being a novelization of &quot;The Grudge&quot; (released in Japan as &quot;The Juon&quot;), which was published in 2005 and generally follows the premise of the film faithfully. A novelization of its sequel, &quot;The Grudge 2&quot; (released in Japan as &quot;Ju-On: Pandemic&quot;), was published later on in 2007. The novels were all published by Kadokawa Shoten and only the 2003 novel received an English translation.

==Video game==
In honor of the series&#x27; 10th anniversary, a game, titled &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge – Haunted House Simulator&quot; was developed for the Wii. The game was released in Japan in 2009 by AQ Interactive under the title &quot;Kyoufu Taikan: Ju-On&quot; (&quot;Fear Experience: Ju-On&quot;), and in Europe under the title &quot;Ju-On: A Fright Simulator&quot;. Upon release, the game was critically panned.

Xseed Games described it as a &quot;haunted house simulator&quot;, rather than a traditional survival horror game. The game does not feature any combat, as its format relies on subtle exploration and scare tactics. Joystiq reviewers who were present for the demo&#x27;s screening at the E3 justified this, observing that &quot;in most horror games, a skilled player can actually defeat the creatures (with notable exceptions like &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;&#x27;s Pyramid Head ...), making the game more of a power fantasy than a true fright. In both of these games [&quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; and &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot;], you can escape the creatures at best&quot;.

<text>The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution or the February Revolution, were a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines, mostly in Metro Manila, from February 22 to 25, 1986. There was a sustained campaign of civil resistance against regime violence and electoral fraud. The nonviolent revolution led to the departure of Ferdinand Marcos, the end of his 20-year dictatorship and the restoration of democracy in the Philippines.

It is also referred to as the Yellow Revolution due to the presence of yellow ribbons during demonstrations (in reference to the Tony Orlando and Dawn song &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;) as a symbol of protest following the assassination of Filipino senator Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr. in August 1983 upon his return to the Philippines from exile. It was widely seen as a victory of the people against two decades of presidential rule by President Marcos, and made news headlines as &quot;the revolution that surprised the world&quot;.

The majority of the demonstrations took place on a long stretch of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, more commonly known by its acronym &quot;EDSA&quot;, in Metro Manila from February 22 to 25, 1986. They involved over two million Filipino civilians, as well as several political and military groups, and religious groups led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, along with Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines President Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, the Archbishop of Cebu. It is remembered as a &quot;Rosary miracle&quot; in the peaceful victory.

The protests, fueled by the resistance and opposition after years of governance by President Marcos and his cronies, ended with the ruler, his family, and some of their supporters fleeing to exile in Hawaii; and Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s widow, Corazon Aquino, inaugurated as the eleventh President of the Philippines.

==Background and history==
Senate President Ferdinand Marcos was elected president in 1965, defeating incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal by a margin of 52 to 43 percent. During this time, Marcos was very active in the initiation of public works projects and the intensification of tax collections. Marcos and his government claimed that they &quot;built more roads than all his predecessors combined and more schools than any previous administration&quot;. Amidst charges from the opposition party of vote-buying and a fraudulent election, President Marcos was reelected in the 1969 Philippine presidential election, this time defeating Sergio Osmeña Jr. by 61 to 39 percent.

President Marcos&#x27;s second term for the presidency was marred by allegations by the opposition Liberal Party of widespread graft and corruption. According to leftists who rioted during the First Quarter Storm, the increasing disparity of wealth between the very wealthy and the very poor that made up the majority of the Philippines&#x27; population led to a rise in crime and civil unrest around the country. In March 1969, the New People&#x27;s Army (NPA) was formed as the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, initiating the still-ongoing CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion. Marcos quickly denounced the movement, hoping to gain monetary and political support from anti-Communist administrators in the United States.

In 1972, the Moro National Liberation Front, a militant Muslim separatist group, formed in the southern island of Mindanao.

Marcos soon used the rise of militant and civil unrest as justification for declaring martial law.

===Martial law===

Barred from running for a third term as president in 1973, Marcos announced Proclamation No. 1081 on September 23, 1972, declaring martial law, using the civil unrest that arose after the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis as a justification for the proclamation.

Through this decree and through a controversial referendum in which citizen assemblies voted through a show of hands, Marcos seized emergency powers giving him full control of the Philippines&#x27; military and the authority to suppress and abolish the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, and many other civil liberties.

President Marcos also dissolved the Philippine Congress and shut down media establishments critical of the Marcos Administration. He also ordered the immediate arrest of his political opponents and critics. Among those arrested were Senate President Jovito Salonga, and the leaders Senator Jose W. Diokno and Senator Ninoy Aquino – Plot – whom Marcos sent to Laur, Nueva Ecija – and the man who was groomed by the opposition to succeed President Marcos after the 1973 elections.

A constitutional convention, which had been called for in 1970 to replace the Commonwealth-era 1935 Constitution, continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to parliamentary and allowing President Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973. The constitution was approved by 95% of the voters in the Philippine constitutional plebiscite. The constitution was part of the landmark &quot;Javellana v. Executive Secretary&quot; case (G.R. No. 36142) that led to the resignation of Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion. Part of the plot of the regime involved legitimizing the military rule through the new constitution providing legislative and executive powers to the president. Simultaneously Marcos conducted the 1973 plebiscite through the simple counting of hands raised by children and adults that involved questions such as the option for more rice in lieu of constitutional affirmation.

With practically all of his political opponents arrested, out of office, and in exile, President Marcos&#x27;s pre-emptive declaration of martial law in 1972 and the ratification of his new constitution by more than 95% of voters enabled Marcos to effectively legitimize his government and hold on to power for another 14 years beyond his first two terms as president. In a Cold War context, Marcos retained the support of the United States through Marcos&#x27;s promise to stamp out communism in the Philippines and by assuring the United States of its continued use of military and naval bases in the Philippines.

On November 27, 1977, a military tribunal sentenced Aquino and two co-accused, NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, to death by firing squad. In 1978, while still the last opposition leader yet to be released from prison at Fort Bonifacio, Aquino founded his political party, &quot;Lakas ng Bayan&quot; (abbreviated &quot;LABAN&quot;; English: &quot;People&#x27;s Power&quot;) to run for office in the Interim Batasang Pambansa (Parliament). All LABAN candidates lost, including Aquino himself. He appeared in a television interview with Ronnie Nathanielsz to freely criticize the regime during the campaign. In 1980, Ninoy Aquino suffered a heart attack, and was compassionately released from prison to undergo a heart bypass surgery in the United States. Aquino stayed with his wife Corazon, and children in Boston College as a fellow for numerous American universities such as Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

===1980s economic collapse===
Because the Marcos administration&#x27;s spending had relied so heavily on debt since the Marcos family&#x27;s first term in the 1960s, the Philippines was left vulnerable when the US economy went into recession in the third quarter of 1981, forcing the Reagan administration to increase interest rates. The Philippine government plunged further into debt and the economy began going into decline in 1981, continuing to do so by the time of the Benigno Aquino Jr. assassination in 1983. By the end of that year, the economy contracted by 6.8%.

The economic and political instability combined to produce the worst recession in Philippine history in 1984 and 1985, with the economy contracting by 7.3% for two successive years.

===Aquino assassination===

Despite threats from First Lady Imelda Marcos, Ninoy Aquino was determined to return home, saying that &quot;the Filipino is worth dying for&quot;. After failing to apply for a passport in Washington and New York, Ninoy got two passports with the help of Rashid Lucmanone bearing his real name, and the other with the alias &quot;Marcial Bonifacio&quot;.

On August 21, 1983, after three years, Aquino was murdered by the military, as he disembarked from a China Airlines plane at Manila International Airport (later renamed in Aquino&#x27;s honor). His assassination shocked and outraged most Filipinos, who had lost confidence in the Marcoses. The event led to more suspicions about the government, triggering non-cooperation among Filipinos that eventually led to outright civil disobedience. It also shook the Marcos Administration, which was by then deteriorating due in part to Marcos&#x27;s blatant illness (turned out to be the fatal lupus erythematosus).

In 1984, Marcos appointed a commission, first led by Chief Justice Enrique Fernando and later Corazon Agrava, to launch an investigation into Aquino&#x27;s assassination. Despite the commission&#x27;s conclusions, Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, declined an offer to join the commission and rejected the government&#x27;s views on the assassination.

===Formation of coalesced opposition===
This began a period of coalitions, first led by the nationalist liberal democrats under Jose W. Diokno called &quot;Kilusan sa Kapangyarihan at Karapatan ng Bayan&quot; or KAAKBAY, an umbrella organization founded in 1983, which headed the first grand liberal coalition called JAJA, or the Justice for Aquino, Justice for All movement. JAJA consisted of organizations such as the social democrat-based August Twenty One Movement (ATOM) led by Butz Aquino, KAAKBAY, MABINI, the Makati-based Alliance of Makati Associations or AMA, and others.

This was before the division of the center-left and national democratic/Marxist left, when the coalitions tended to pursue Diokno&#x27;s philosophy of pressure politics or mass actions to influence and sway the Marcos dictatorship.

Parliamentarians of the streets, as they were called, applied pressure politics, and soon other coalitions were formed, culminating in the first call for elections for the opposition in the &quot;Kongreso ng Mamamayang Pilipino&quot; or KOMPIL. KOMPIL was organized by Aquino&#x27;s ATOM from the JAJA coalition, as a means to unite the businessmen, communists, and other groups. Most of the KOMPIL members were led by the AMA leaders.

Meanwhile, Diokno, Lorenzo M. Tañada of MABINI, Butz and Corazon Aquino, and a few others were elected the overall presiding leaders in a search to find the opposition candidate. The main issue was whether to accept the CAMEL or Call for Meaningful Elections or, as Diokno and the more liberal JAJA members preferred, to boycott the event which might be another fixed election.

JAJA was later replaced by the Coalition of Organizations for the Restoration of Democracy (CORD) in the middle of 1984, which retained most of JAJA&#x27;s features and membership. A year later CORD was replaced by Bagong Alyansang Makabayan or BAYAN, which was to be a platform for Diokno should he run for president, and was led by Tañada and student leader Lean Alejandro of the University of the Philippines. However the socialists/national democrats took control of the coalition so Diokno, Ambrosio Padilla, and the liberal democrats as well as Butz Aquino, ATOM, and the social democrats left BAYAN to the present national democratic coalition that it has become in the 21st century.

====Call for meaningful elections====
Eventually the top leaders decided to convene to select a candidate in case of contingencies or any sudden announcements of changes. It was then on November 3, 1985, after pressure from the US government, that Marcos suddenly announced a snap presidential election would take place the following year, one year ahead of the regular presidential election schedule, to legitimize his control over the country. The snap election was legalized with the passage of Batas Pambansa Blg. 883 (National Law No. 883) by the Marcos-controlled unicameral congress called the Regular Batasang Pambansa.

To select a leader, the convenor&#x27;s group of opposition leaders formed underlying principles. These principles, mainly proposed and edited by Diokno, discussed matters that involved anti-foreign domination in the economy, especially American intervention and military bases. After the principles were agreed upon by the opposition leaders, as Lorenzo M. Tañada quipped, it became almost automatic and completely expeditious in agreeing unanimously on one candidate to face Marcos. For the initial step in nominating a candidate, the selection process started out with a pooled list among the opposition leaders themselves. The list of candidates for president were mostly including former senators: Jose W. Diokno, Butz Aquino, Jovito Salonga, Eva Estrada-Kalaw, Salvador &quot;Doy&quot; Laurel, Ambrosio Padilla, Aquilino Pimentel, Raul Manglapus, and Ramon Mitra, as well as a future senator in Teofisto Guingona Jr., and a technocrat who once served as Marcos&#x27;s executive secretary named Rafael Salas.

After the vetting of nominees, as men such as Sen. Diokno vehemently opposed to run for president, the remaining potential candidates who openly wished to earn the opposition&#x27;s nomination were Salonga, Laurel, and Estrada-Kalaw. United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) members Estrada-Kalaw and Laurel were the only two not to sign the declaration of unity or the underlying principles. Eventually Estrada-Kalaw withdrew after being overwhelmed by the multiple candidates in the selection process and campaigned to become the vice-presidential candidate. Between 64 year old Salonga, who with 64 year old Estrada-Kalaw represented the two largest Liberal Party factions, and Laurel, who was son of former president Jose P. Laurel, it was decided by men such as Chino Roces that both candidates might lack the popularity needed to win. This was because Salonga had spent much time in exile in the United States while Laurel, the founder and main head of UNIDO, was deemed &quot;too lightweight&quot;.

UNIDO and the other coalitions agreed to choose Aquino&#x27;s wife Cory Aquino instead of Doy Laurel or Estrada-Kalaw and began the Cory Aquino for President Movement or CAPM, led by Roces, et al. Only Laurel, a friend of Ninoy Aquino, did not agree with this choice and wanted to run against Aquino and Marcos. UNIDO overwhelmed Laurel&#x27;s vote and encouraged him to become Cory Aquino&#x27;s vice-president instead. Once Cory Aquino became the main candidate, Laurel eventually ran as Cory Aquino&#x27;s running mate for vice-president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party. Marcos ran for re-election, with Arturo Tolentino as his running mate under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) party. Thus within a matter of only a few weeks the candidates were fixed and the campaign period was set for the 1986 snap election.

===1986 election===

The election was held on February 7, 1986. The official election canvasser, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), declared that Marcos was the winner. The final tally of the COMELEC had Marcos winning with 10,807,197 votes against Aquino&#x27;s 9,291,761 votes. On the other hand, based on returns of 70% of the precincts of the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), an accredited poll watcher, had Aquino winning with 7,835,070 votes against Marcos&#x27;s 7,053,068 votes.

This electoral exercise was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering of election results, culminating in the walkout of 30 COMELEC computer technicians to protest the deliberate manipulation of the official election results to favor Ferdinand Marcos. The walkout was considered one of the early &quot;sparks&quot; of the People Power Revolution. The walkout also served as an affirmation to allegations of vote-buying, fraud, and tampering of election results by the KBL.

Because of reports of alleged fraud, the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) through Cardinal Ricardo Vidal issued a statement condemning the elections. The United States Senate also passed a resolution stating the same condemnation. President Ronald Reagan issued a statement calling the fraud reports as &quot;disturbing&quot; but he said that there was fraud &quot;on both sides&quot; of the Philippine election. In response to the protests, COMELEC claimed that Marcos with 53 percent won over Aquino. However, NAMFREL countered that the latter won over Marcos with 52 percent of votes.

On February 15, Marcos was proclaimed by COMELEC and Batasang Pambansa as the winner amid the controversy. All 50 opposition members of the Parliament walked out in protest. The Filipino people repudiated the results, asserting that Aquino was the real victor. Both &quot;winners&quot; took their oath of office in two different places, with Aquino gaining greater mass support. Aquino also called for coordinated strikes and mass boycott of the media and businesses owned by Marcos&#x27;s cronies. As a result, the crony banks, corporations, and media were hit hard, and their shares in the stock market plummeted to record levels.

===Vidal&#x27;s declaration===
On February 13, Cebu Archbishop Cardinal Ricardo Vidal issued a declaration on behalf of the Philippine Church hierarchy stating that when &quot;a government does not of itself freely correct the evil it has inflicted on the people then it is our serious moral obligation as a people to make it do so.&quot; The declaration also asked &quot;every loyal member of the Church, every community of the faithful, to form their judgment about the February 7 polls&quot; and told all the Filipinos, &quot;Now is the time to speak up. Now is the time to repair the wrong. The wrong was systematically organized. So must its correction be. But as in the election itself, that depends fully on the people; on what they are willing and ready to do.&quot;

==Events==

===Civil disobedience and boycott campaign launch (February 16)===
On February 16, 1986, Corazon Aquino held the &quot;Tagumpay ng Bayan&quot; (People&#x27;s Victory) rally at Luneta Park, announcing a civil disobedience campaign and calling for her supporters to boycott publications and companies which were associated with Marcos or any of his cronies. The event was attended by a crowd of about two million people. Aquino&#x27;s camp began making preparations for more rallies, and Aquino herself went to Cebu to rally more people to their cause.

===Aborted military coup (February 22)===

In the aftermath of the election and the revelations of irregularities, the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) – a cabal of officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) disgruntled by the patronage politics and corruption in the AFP, formed in 1982 – set into motion a coup attempt against Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos.

RAM&#x27;s initial plan was for a team to assault Malacañang Palace and arrest Ferdinand Marcos. RAM founder Col. Gringo Honasan formulated a plan to attack the palace and &quot;neutralize&quot; the Marcos couple. Other military units would take over key strategic facilities, such as the airport, military bases, the GHQAFP in Camp Aguinaldo, and major highway junctions to restrict counteroffensive by Marcos-loyal troops.

On February 20, members of the RAM also approached Cory Aquino, informed her of the coup plans and informed her that they would form a junta headed by a Council of Elders composed of Enrile, Ramos, Cardinal Sin, Jaime Ongpin, Alejandro Melchor, and Doy Laurel. Mrs. Aquino rejected the offer, as there was a sense that the Council will just be a front for a military junta headed by Enrile.

On the morning of February 21, Gen. Ver conducted a conference with Commandant of the Philippine Marines, BGen. Artemio Tadiar at the Naval Intelligence Compound in Fort Bonifacio. Gen. Ver informed BGen. Tadiar that there is a brewing coup plot by Enrile and assassination attempt on the latter as well as the Philippine Navy Flag-Officer-in-Command (FOIC), RAdm. Brilliante Ochoco. BGen. Tadiar, placed Fort Bonifacio Naval Station on alert. Capt. Ariel Querubin was put to task by Tadiar to look into the plot. Capt. Querubin confirmed the information with the Marines Military Police headed by Capt. Benjamin Dolorfino, and Naval Operations Officer, Capt. Pablo Ong, that there were augmented personnel inside Fort Bonifacio the next two nights from the Ministry of Defense. As night came, Capt. Querubin along with Lt. Alexander Balutan encountered the 19 personnel who were conducting &quot;night training exercises&quot; and were commander by LtJG. Michael Angelo Asperin. The men were part of the security detail of Minister Roberto Ongpin. Capt. Querubin was then ordered by Col. Guillermo Ruiz, that Malacanang wanted the night runners shipped off to El Fraile Island at the mouth of Manila Bay. Capt. Querubin instead took the men to the PMC Firing Range, and upon interrogation found out that their mission was to secure BGen. Tadiar and RAdm. Ochoco to neutralize their command during the coup.

The following morning, Minister Ongpin phoned Enrile who was at The Atrium in Makati, asking on the whereabouts of his security staff. Since three of the men arrested were on loan from the Ministry of Defense, Enrile was worried that the fingers will be pointed towards him. Meanwhile, Col. Honasan and his staff who were at the MND Building in Camp Aguinaldo was monitoring troop movements overnight found out that the 5th Marine Battalion Landing Team from Fort Bonifacio was moved to Pandacan, and the 1th Infantry Battalion from Nueva Ecija was moved to the North Harbor early morning. This would translate to an unusual amount of troops within Metro Manila, and it seemed that Gen. Ver was already taking actions to protect Malacanang.

However, after Marcos learned about the plot, he ordered their leaders&#x27; arrest, and presented to the international and local press some of the captured plotters, Maj. Saulito Aromin and Maj. Edgardo Doromal. Threatened with their impending imprisonment, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and his fellow coup plotters decided to ask for help from then-AFP Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, who was also the chief of the Philippine Constabulary (now the Philippine National Police). Ramos agreed to resign from his position and support the plotters. Ramos also contacted the highly influential Cardinal Archbishop of Manila Jaime Sin for his support. Despite Ramos&#x27; defection, however, the coup plotters were essentially trapped in Camp Crame, and in the words of historian Vicente L. Rafael, &quot;became sitting ducks for Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; loyalist forces.&quot;

At about 6:30 p.m. on February 22, Enrile and Ramos held a press conference at the Ministry of National Defense building in Camp Aguinaldo, the AFP headquarters, where they announced that they had resigned from their positions in Marcos&#x27; cabinet and were withdrawing support from his government. Marcos himself later conducted a news conference calling on Enrile and Ramos to surrender, urging them to &quot;stop this stupidity&quot;. Marcos tried to call Enrile, but Enrile refused to play Marcos&#x27;s game. Eventually out of desperation Marcos televised his sickly appearance, and announced that he promised to crush every Filipino who stood in his way in order to capture Enrile and Ramos.

===Cardinal Sin&#x27;s appeal (February 22)===
After Cardinal Vidal&#x27;s February 13 condemnation of the snap election&#x27;s fraudulent result, Cardinal Sin went on Radio Veritas at around 9 p.m. on February 22 and exhorted Filipinos in the capital to aid rebel leaders by going to the section of EDSA between Camp Crame and Aguinaldo and giving emotional support, food and other supplies. For many, this seemed an unwise decision since civilians would not stand a chance against a dispersal by government troops. Many people, especially priests and nuns, still trooped to EDSA.

Radio Veritas played a critical role during the mass uprising. Former University of the Philippines president Francisco Nemenzo stated that: &quot;&quot;Without Radio Veritas, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to mobilize millions of people in a matter of hours.&quot; Similarly, a certain account in the event said that: &quot;Radio Veritas, in fact, was our umbilical cord to whatever else was going on&quot;.&quot;

===Rising mass support (February 23)===
At dawn, Sunday, government troops arrived to knock down the main 50-kilowatt transmitter of Radio Veritas, cutting off broadcasts to people in the nearby provinces. The station switched to a 10-kilowatt standby transmitter with a limited range of broadcast. The station was targeted because it had proven to be a valuable communications tool for the people supporting the rebels, keeping them informed of government troop movements and relaying requests for food, medicine, and supplies.

Still, people came to EDSA until it swelled to hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians. The mood in the street was very festive, with many bringing whole families. Performers entertained the crowds, nuns and priests led prayer vigils, and people set up barricades and makeshift sandbags, trees, and vehicles in several places along EDSA and intersecting streets such as Santolan and Ortigas Avenue. Everywhere, people listened to Radio Veritas on their radios. A photo taken by Pete Reyes of Srs. Porferia Ocariza and Teresita Burias leading the rosary in front of soldiers has since become an iconic picture of the revolution. Several groups sang &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; (My Homeland), which, since 1980, had become a patriotic anthem of the opposition. People frequently flashed the &#x27;LABAN&#x27; sign, which is an &quot;L&quot; formed with their thumb and index finger. &#x27;laban&#x27; is the Filipino word for &#x27;fight&#x27;, but also the abbreviation of Lakas ng Bayan, Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s party. After lunch on February 23, Enrile and Ramos decided to consolidate their positions. Enrile crossed EDSA from Camp Aguinaldo to Camp Crame amidst cheers from the crowd.

In the mid-afternoon, Radio Veritas relayed reports of Marines massing near the camps in the east and LVT-5 tanks approaching from the north and south. A contingent of Marines with tanks and armored vans, led by Brigadier General Artemio Tadiar, was stopped along Ortigas Avenue, about two kilometers from the camps, by tens of thousands of people. Nuns holding rosaries knelt in front of the tanks and men and women linked arms together to block the troops. Tadiar asked the crowds to make a clearing for them, but they did not budge. In the end, the troops retreated with no shots fired.

By evening, the standby transmitter of Radio Veritas failed, although the stations of the Far East Broadcasting Company also took up the task of broadcasting information to the crowds, calling them in particular to protect Gate 2 of Camp Aguinaldo. Shortly after midnight, the Radio Veritas staff led by Father James Reuter were able to move to the transmitter of DZRJ-AM so they could begin broadcasting again. To help keep their location a secret, they took up the moniker &quot;Radyo Bandido&quot; (Bandit Radio) as a callsign. June Keithley, with her husband Angelo Castro Jr., was the radio broadcaster who continued Radio Veritas&#x27; program throughout the night and in the ensuing days.

===The Sotelo landing (February 24)===
In the early morning hours of February 24, helicopters manned by the 15th Strike Wing of the Philippine Air Force, led by Colonel Antonio Sotelo, were ordered from Sangley Point in Cavite, south of Manila, to head to Camp Crame. Secretly, the squadron had already defected and instead of attacking Camp Crame, landed in it with the crowds cheering and hugging the pilots and crew members in response to what has been referred to as the &quot;Sotelo landing,&quot; considered a key turning point where the military circumstances turned against Marcos.

A Bell 214 helicopter piloted by Major Deo Cruz of the 205th Helicopter Wing and Sikorsky S-76 gunships piloted by Colonel Charles Hotchkiss of the 20th Air Commando Squadron joined the rebel squadron earlier in the air. The presence of the helicopters boosted the morale of Enrile and Ramos who had been continually encouraging their fellow soldiers to join the opposition movement. In the afternoon, Aquino arrived at the base where Enrile, Ramos, Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) officers, and a throng were waiting.

===Marcos departure rumor (February 24)===
At around that 6:30, June Keithley received reports that Marcos had left Malacañang Palace and broadcast this to the people at EDSA. The crowd celebrated and even Ramos and Enrile came out from Crame to appear to the crowds. This would be disproven when Marcos went on MBS 4 a few hours later, so it was later speculated that the false report was a calculated move against Marcos to encourage more defections.

===Fourth Marine brigade refusal of &quot;Kill Order&quot; (February 24)===
At dawn on Monday, February 24, Marines marching from Libis towards the east of Camp Aguinaldo lobbed tear gas at the demonstrators, who quickly dispersed. By 8:30 a.m., some 3,000 Marines entered and held the east side of Camp Aguinaldo, and the Fourth Marine brigade under the command of Colonel Braulio Balbas positioned howitzers and mortars to strike against Camp Crame.

Despite the fact that civilians would be killed in such an attack, General Josephus Ramas gave the &quot;kill order&quot; against Camp Crame at around 9 AM. Although the artillery was ready to fire, Balbas stalled, telling Ramas that they were &quot;still looking for maps.&quot; Ramas then told Balbas that &quot;The President is on the other line waiting for compliance!&quot; Ramas repeated his orders to Balbas at 9:20, to which Balbas replied they were &quot;still positioning the cannons.&quot; Balbas would eventually refuse to follow Ramas&#x27; orders each of the four times he was ordered to fire on Camp Crame, leading historians to point to this moment as the point at which Marcos lost control of the Philippine Marine Corps.

===Marcos TV appearance on MBS 4 (February 24)===
The jubilation resulting from the rumor that Marcos had fled was short-lived, as Marcos appeared on television on the government-controlled MBS-4 at around 9:00, (using the foreclosed ABS-CBN facilities, transmitter and compound in Broadcast Plaza, now ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center) declaring that he would not step down.

====Lifting of Maximum Tolerance policy====
During the broadcast, Marcos announced that he had lifted the policy of &quot;Maximum Tolerance&quot; which that government had previously put in place. This gave armed forces permission to use force to defend government installations, as well as communications facilities, from Enrile and Ramos&#x27; forces. In addition, he told radio and TV stations not to broadcast news about military movements without permission – which was exactly what Radyo Bandido had been doing.

====Marcos orders not to attack via airstrike====

At one point during the broadcast, General Ver approached Marcos and informed him that the AFP was ready to mount an airstrike on Camp Crame, but Marcos ordered them to halt. The actual dialogue on TV between Marcos and then AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Ver went as follows:

===Capture of MBS-4 (February 24)===
At about 9:50 a.m. MBS-4 suddenly went off the air during Marcos&#x27; broadcast. A contingent of rebels, under Colonel Mariano Santiago, had captured the station. MBS-4 was put back on the air shortly after noon, with Orly Punzalan announcing on live television, &quot;Channel 4 is on the air again to serve the people.&quot; By this time, the crowds at EDSA had grown to over a million, but some estimates place the crowd number up to 2 million people.

The ensuing marathon broadcast was considered the &quot;return&quot; of ABS-CBN on air because this was the first time that former employees of the network were inside the complex after 14 years of closure since Marcos sequestered the property during the declaration of martial law in September 1972. &quot;Radyo Bandido&quot; ended broadcasting that afternoon, while Radio Veritas resumed transmissions, this time from the Broadcast Plaza&#x27;s radio studios. Among the various personnel that appeared alongside Orly Punzalan in its first few hours were Maan Hontiveros and Dely Magpayo

===Attack on Villamor Airbase and further defections (February 24)===
In the late afternoon of February 24, helicopters of the 15th Strike Wing, commanded by Sotelo, attacked Villamor Airbase, destroying presidential air assets. Sotelo had radioed ahead to the pilots and crews of the air assets, telling them to stay away from the aircraft. As a result, the assets were disabled without any human casualties. Sotelo had sent another helicopter to Malacañang, where it fired a rocket on the palace grounds and caused minor damage.

Later, most of the officers who had graduated from the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) defected. The majority of the Armed Forces had already changed sides.

===Two inaugurations (February 25)===

On the morning of Tuesday, February 25, at around 7 a.m., a minor clash occurred between loyal government troops and the reformists. Snipers stationed atop the crony-owned RPN-9 transmitter in Panay Avenue, near MBS-4, began shooting at the reformists. Many rebel soldiers surged to the station, and a rebel S-76 helicopter later shot the snipers at the broadcast tower. The troops later left after a V-150 was blocked by a crowd that assembled.

Later in the morning, Corazon Aquino was inaugurated as President of the Philippines in a simple ceremony at Club Filipino in Greenhills, about a kilometer from Camp Crame. She was sworn in as president by Senior Associate Justice Claudio Teehankee, and Laurel as vice-president by Justice Vicente Abad Santos. The Bible on which Aquino swore her oath was held by her mother-in-law Aurora Aquino, the mother of Ninoy Aquino. Attending the ceremonies were Ramos, who was then promoted to General, Enrile, and many politicians.

Outside Club Filipino, all the way to EDSA, hundreds of people cheered and celebrated. &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; (&quot;My Country&quot;, a popular folk song and the unofficial National Anthem of protest) was sung after Aquino&#x27;s oath-taking. Many people wore yellow, the color of Aquino&#x27;s presidential campaign.

An hour later, Marcos held the inauguration at Malacañang Palace. Loyalist civilians attended the ceremony, shouting &quot;&quot;Marcos, Marcos, Marcos pa rin!&quot; (Marcos, Marcos, still Marcos!)&quot;. On the Palace balcony, Marcos took the Oath of Office, aired on IBC-13 and RPN-9 (RPN-9 was going off-the-air during the broadcast of the inauguration, as its transmitter was captured by reformist soldiers) None of the invited foreign dignitaries attended the ceremony, for security reasons. The couple finally emerged on the balcony of the Palace before 3,000 KBL loyalists who were shouting, &quot;Capture the snakes!&quot; Rather tearfully, First Lady Imelda Marcos gave a farewell rendition of the couple&#x27;s theme song – the 1938 &quot;kundiman&quot; &quot;Dahil Sa Iyo&quot; (Because of You) – chanting the song&#x27;s entreaties in Tagalog:
Because of you, I became happyLoving I shall offer youIf it is true I shall be enslaved by youAll of this because of you.
The broadcast of the event was interrupted as rebel troops successfully captured the other stations. It was the last time Marcos was seen in the Philippines.

By this time, hundreds of people had amassed at the barricades along Mendiola, only a hundred meters away from Malacañang. They were prevented from storming the Palace by loyal government troops securing the area. The angry demonstrators were pacified by priests who warned them not to be violent.

===Marcos&#x27; departure (February 26)===
Despite holding an inauguration, Marcos and his family were already preparing to flee the country. At 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning, Marcos phoned United States Senator Paul Laxalt, asking for advice from the White House. Laxalt advised him to &quot;cut and cut cleanly&quot;, to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause. In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Minister Enrile, asking for safe passage for him, his family, and close allies such as General Ver. He also asked Enrile if United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth could assign a security escort for the Marcos family&#x27;s departure.

Around midnight, the Marcos family boarded a United States Air Force HH-3E Rescue helicopter and flew to Clark Air Base in Angeles City 83 kilometers north of Manila. At Clark Air Base, Marcos asked to spend a couple of days with his family in Ilocos Norte, his native province. Aquino vetoed the request. President Reagan privately derided Aquino for denying Marcos a last look at his home province.

The deposed First Family and their servants then rode US Air Force C-9A Nightingale and C-141B Starlifter planes to Andersen Air Force Base in the north of the United States territory of Guam, then flying to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos finally arrived on February 26. The United States government documented that they entered the United States with millions of dollars in jewelry, gold, stocks, and cash.

When news of the Marcos family&#x27;s departure reached civilians, many rejoiced and danced in the streets. Over at Mendiola, the demonstrators stormed the Palace, which was closed to ordinary people for around a decade. Despite looting by some angry protesters, the majority wandered about inside through rooms where national history was shaped, looking at objects extravagant and mundane that the Marcos clan and its court had abandoned in their flight. Shortly after midnight on February 26, five army trucks of troops under the command of Fidel Ramos arrived in Malacañang Palace to secure it after Ferdinand Marcos had left – marking the end of the Marcos dictatorship, and placing the palace under the control of the provisional government of the Philippines until a new constitution could be enacted a year later, in 1987.

As the provisionary government took control of Malacanang Palace, and in the rush of the Marcos&#x27; family&#x27;s departure, documents pertaining to overseas land holdings and bank accounts were recovered. These documents were the foundation of successive attempts to recover the Marcos ill-gotten wealth starting with Operation Big Bird, as well as court cases against the Marcos family and cronies.

In other countries, people also rejoiced and congratulated Filipinos they knew. CBS anchorman Bob Simon reported: &quot;We Americans like to think we taught the Filipinos democracy. Well, tonight they are teaching the world.&quot;

===Events outside the capital===
While much of the historical focus regarding the People Power Revolution has been on events around the two camps and the presidential palace, Filipinos from all over the archipelago also participated in the revolution, with large protests happening in Baguio, Cebu City, Iloilo City, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao City, as well as prominent municipalities such as Los Baños, Laguna. Cebu played a particularly important part because Corazon Aquino was there at the time the EDSA protests began, speaking at a rally at Fuente Osmeña Circle which was a protest against cheating during the Presidential elections earlier that month.

==Aftermath==

Immediately after her accession, Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3, a provisional constitution which established a revolutionary government. The edict promulgated the 1986 Freedom Constitution, which retained or superseded various provisions of the 1973 Constitution that were in force up to that point. This allowed Aquino to wield both executive and legislative powers; among her first acts was to unilaterally abolish the Batasang Pambansa (the unicameral legislature duly elected in 1984), pending a plebiscite for a more permanent Constitution and the establishment of a new Congress by 1987.

Despite the success of the People Power Revolution, there were elements which were dissatisfied by Aquino&#x27;s rise to power, including the leaders Reform the Armed Forces Movement which had launched the failed coup against Marcos and had been saved by the arrival of the civilians at EDSA. As a result, these groups launched a number of coup d&#x27;état attempts throughout Aquino&#x27;s term.

The revolution had an effect on democratization movements in such countries as Taiwan and South Korea and indirectly contributed to the downfall of communism in Soviet bloc and the end of the Cold War; other effects include the restoration of the freedom of the press, abolition of repressive laws enforced by the previous regime, the adoption of the 1987 Constitution, and the subordination of the military to civilian rule, despite several coup attempts during Aquino&#x27;s rule.

The revolution provided for the restoration of democratic institutions after 13 years of authoritarian rule and these institutions has been used by various groups to challenge the entrenched political families and to strengthen Philippine democracy.

==Legacy==
The People Power Revolution has inspired a call for a change of government through peaceful protests rather than bloodshed. Many similar revolutions have followed since then, taking the Philippine example of nonviolent regime change, such as that in East Germany and many other former Soviet Bloc countries, most of which had direct relation to the end of the Cold War in 1989.

Rampant corruption during the term of President Joseph Estrada led to the similar 2001 EDSA Revolution leading to his resignation from the presidency.

On January 19, police and military forces withdrew their support from Estrada. At around noon on January 20, Davide swore Estrada&#x27;s constitutional successor Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo into office. A few hours later, Estrada and his family fled Malacanang.

In spite of the revolution&#x27;s repudiation of Marcos&#x27; dictatorial regime, the Marcos family slowly regained a political presence in the Philippines mostly through what researchers attribute to a systematic spread of lies and disinformation, with Imelda and her children Bongbong and Imee reacquiring positions in government by the 1990s. Bongbong himself was defeated as runner-up to Leni Robredo as a candidate for the Philippine vice presidency during the 2016 presidential elections. He protested in the Supreme Court and was denied multiple times, with the official gap getting even significantly larger from the original results. In 2021, Bongbong announced his bid for the Philippine presidency in the 2022 Philippine presidential election. He was elected president, marking the Marcos family&#x27;s return to Malacañang after 36 years. In the 38th anniversary of the EDSA Revolution on February 25, 2024, the fight against charter change continued. &quot;We are not EDSA-pwera. Because People Power was not only EDSA,&quot; the Campaign Against the Return of Marcoses and Martial Law (CARMMA) said. The wreath-laying ceremony and commemorative rites were led and organized by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. &quot;Ito po ay taon-taon naming gugunitain hangga&#x27;t mayroon kaming mandato,&quot; [We will commemorate this every year as long as we have a mandate,] said Ian Alfonso, a senior researcher of NHCP.

===Commemoration===
The EDSA Revolution Anniversary is a special public holiday in the Philippines. From 2002 to 2023, the holiday has been declared a special non-working holiday. It was not included in the list of holidays in 2024 declared by President Bongbong Marcos in his proclamation, citing that it “falls on a Sunday,” which is considered as a rest day for most laborers, while maintaining respect for its commemoration. It was restored as a holiday in 2025, this time as a special working day. Despite this, several academic institutions opted to suspend classes or implement alternative learning modes to commemorate the event.

Three commemorative sites along EDSA memorialize the People Power Revolution, put up by different organizations to commemorate different aspects of the People Power Revolution.
* The Shrine of Mary, Queen of Peace, Our Lady of EDSA, better known as the EDSA Shrine is a small church put up in 1989 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila in the Ortigas Center at the corner of EDSA with Ortigas Avenue. Priminently featuring the Our Lady of EDSA sculpture by Virginia Ty-Navarro and containing numerous other artworks throughout the church, it commemorates the &quot;miraculously&quot; peaceful nature of the People Power protests, as well as the role of the Catholic Church in the revolution.
* The Bantayog ng mga Bayani was put up by civil society groups and inaugurated in 1992 to commemorate the struggle against the Marcos dictatorship, and the People Power Revolution as a key turning point in the struggle. The site&#x27;s Wall of Remembrance has an extensively researched list of the martyrs and heroes who fought the authoritarian regime. The site, designed by National Artist for landscape architecture Ildefonso P. Santos Jr., also features the &quot;Inang Bayan&quot; sculpture by Eduardo Castrillo, as well as a specialty library and a museum commemorating the martyrs and heroes honored on the Wall of Remembrance.
* The People&#x27;s Park put up in 1993 by the Philippine Government on the southwest corner of Camp Aguinaldo at the intersection of EDSA and White Plains Avenue contains the 30-figure People Power Monument sculpture by Eduardo Castrillo as well as a 1983 statue of Ninoy Aquino sculpted by artist Tomas Concepcion.

===In culture and the arts===
In 1986 a few months after February a music video starring various artists was released called, &quot;Handog ng Pilipino Sa Mundo&quot;. It was written by Apo Hiking Society singer Jim Paredes and performed by numerous artists, and showed martial law heroes Jose W. Diokno, Lorenzo M. Tañada, Rene Saguisag, Butz Aquino, Joe Burgos, and Pres. Aquino with Vice-president Doy Laurel during their campaign.

In 2003, the &quot;Radio Broadcast of the Philippine People Power Revolution&quot; was inscribed in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Memory of the World Register, which is the official documentary heritage list of the United Nations (UN)&#x27;s educational and scientific body.

<text>This is a list of television programs currently or formerly broadcast by Cartoon Network in the United States. The network was launched on October 1, 1992, and airs mainly animated programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. In its early years, Cartoon Network&#x27;s programming was predominantly made up of reruns of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, and Hanna-Barbera shows (most notably &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;Quick Draw McGraw&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, and &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;).

Cartoon Network&#x27;s first original series was &quot;The Moxy Show&quot; and the late-night satirical animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; (the latter moving to Adult Swim at launch on September 2, 2001). The &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; series of showcase shorts brought the creation of many Cartoon Network original series collectives branded as &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot; in 1995. Cartoon Network has also broadcast several feature films, mostly animated or containing animated sequences, under its &quot;Cartoon Theater&quot; block, later renamed &quot;Flicks&quot;.

<text>CSX Transportation , known colloquially as simply CSX, is a Class I freight railroad company operating in the Eastern United States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Operating about 21,000 route miles () of track, it is the leading subsidiary of CSX Corporation, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida.

CSX Corporation was formed in 1980 from the merger of Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, two holding companies that controlled railroads operating in the Eastern United States. Initially only a holding company, the subsidiaries that made up CSX Corporation completed merging in 1987. CSX Transportation formally came into existence in 1986, as the successor of Seaboard System Railroad. In 1999, CSX Transportation acquired about half of Conrail in a joint purchase with competitor Norfolk Southern Railway. In 2022, it acquired Pan Am Railways, extending its reach into northern New England.

Norfolk Southern remains CSX&#x27;s chief competitor; the two share a duopoly on transcontinental freight rail lines in the east half of the US.

CSX is the result of a number of mergers among railroads operating in the eastern United States, the earliest among them the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) which formed in the 1820s. Many of the competing railroads along the east coast began merging from the 1950s onward as part of a broader trend of consolidation. An announcement from the New York Central (NYC) and Pennsylvania (PRR) railroads in November 1957 that they were considering combining set off discussions between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) on a merger. Ultimately, the financially stronger C&amp;O took control of the B&amp;O in December 1962, though the two railroads kept their separate identities. The NYC and PRR ultimately formed Penn Central Transportation Company in 1968, which by 1970 was bankrupt.

The combined C&amp;O/B&amp;O purchased stock in the Western Maryland Railway until it was able to take full control in February 1967, bringing a third railroad into the combined entity, which in 1973 became formally known as the Chessie System after the C&amp;O&#x27;s historic cat mascot Chessie.

While the railroads in Appalachia were merging, southern railroads (and historical competitors) Seaboard Air Line Railroad and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad decided to pursue a merger in 1960, which was authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission in late 1963 and finally completed in 1967, forming the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The combined company absorbed the Piedmont and Northern Railway in 1969.

In the Midwest, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) went on an acquisition spree, splitting the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad (C&amp;EI) with the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1969. This was followed in 1971 with the acquisition of the Monon Railroad, which had complained bitterly about the C&amp;EI split. The L&amp;N also purchased a portion of the Tennessee Central Railway in 1969. While still independent, the L&amp;N had long standing links to the Atlantic Coast Line, and other railroads in the region began to worry about a combined L&amp;N/SCL system.

In 1969, the Seaboard Coast Line created Seaboard Coast Line Industries as a holding company. The Seaboard Coast Line Railroad had already held some of L&amp;N&#x27;s stock, but the new holding company began buying up as much as it could find and held nearly total control of shares by 1971. With this also came control of the Clinchfield Railroad and Georgia Railroad, both of which were nominally jointly owned by SCL and L&amp;N. The resulting railroad conglomerate began operating under the name &quot;Family Lines&quot;.

Despite this wave of mergers, one more was yet to come - the combination of Chessie System and the Family Lines. To this end, the CSX Corporation was organized on November 14, 1978, as a future vehicle for such a merger. Chessie and SCL Industries formally applied for ICC approval of their merger plans in January 1979, causing a rapid reaction from the region&#x27;s other railroads. By April, the Norfolk and Western Railway and Southern Railway unveiled their own plans for a merger. The Southern was opposed to the planned CSX merger, but soon came to terms with Chessie and SCL and dropped its objections. On November 1, 1980, following ICC approval, CSX Corporation officially came into being as the successor of Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries. In 1982, N&amp;W and the Southern completed their merger and formed Norfolk Southern Railway, creating a competitor to CSX.

=== Early years ===

One of the first issues the new railroad grappled with was the choice of name. Chessie and SCLI leadership agreed that, as a merger of equals, neither of the existing names could be used. A call for suggestions went out to employees of both railroads, who responded with a wide variety of initialisms combining C and S in some form. At the same time, the two companies&#x27; lawyers needed a name to use as part of their proceedings with the ICC. &quot;CSC&quot; was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. &quot;CSM&quot; (for &quot;Chessie-Seaboard Merger&quot;) was also taken. Needing some sort of identifier for the new railroad, the lawyers decided to use &quot;CSX&quot;, and the name stuck, despite only being intended as a placeholder. In the public announcement, it was said that &quot;CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard and X, the multiplication symbol, means that together we are so much more.&quot; However, an August 9, 2016, article on the &quot;Railway Age&quot; website stated that &quot; ... the &#x27;X&#x27; was for &#x27;Consolidated&#x27; &quot;. A fourth letter had to be added to CSX when used as a reporting mark because reporting marks that end in X mean that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. Chessie&#x27;s public relations staff drafted a number of possible logos for the new railroad, but continued to strike out until it was suggested to combine the letters &quot;C&quot; and &quot;S&quot; in the shape of an X.

Despite the merger in 1980, CSX was a paper railroad (meaning no CSX painted locomotives or rolling stock) until 1986. In that year, Seaboard System changed its name to CSX Transportation. On April 30, 1987, the B&amp;O merged into the C&amp;O. With the Western Maryland having already merged into the C&amp;O, this left the C&amp;O as the sole operating railroad under the Chessie System banner. Finally, on August 31, 1987, C&amp;O/Chessie System merged into CSX Transportation, bringing all of the major CSX railroads under one banner.

===Conrail acquisition===
Government formed Conrail began to show promise in the early 1980s, showing a profit for the first time under the leadership of L. Stanley Crane in the wake of the Staggers Rail Act. The Reagan Administration wished to privatize Conrail now that it had shown it could stand on its own and placed it for sale in 1983. While CSX expressed interest, it ultimately did not place a bid for Conrail; Norfolk Southern did, however. When the government identified NS&#x27; bid as the winner, CSX realized it faced financial peril from a combined NS/Conrail system. The railroad fiercely argued against allowing the sale to go through, even arguing that monopoly concerns precluded a Conrail sale to either NS or CSX. Despite his history in organizing the NS merger while leading the Southern Railway, Crane was a strong advocate for Conrail&#x27;s independence and proposed an alternative: privatizing Conrail through an initial public offering to the general public. Crane&#x27;s solution was ultimately adopted in 1987, keeping Conrail independent.

This was not the end of CSX and NS interest in Conrail, and attempts by both competitors resumed in the 1990s. This time, CSX struck first, announcing a surprise deal to purchase Conrail in October 1996. NS promptly made an offer of its own and began a bidding war with CSX that was only resolved in January 1997 when the competitors struck a deal to split Conrail between them.

On June 23, 1997, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) filed a joint application with the Surface Transportation Board for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of the Conrail, which had been created in 1976 by bringing together several ailing Northeastern railway systems into a government-owned corporation. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the CSX–NS application and set August 22, 1998, as the effective date of its decision. CSX acquired 42 percent of Conrail&#x27;s assets, and NS received the remaining 58 percent. As a result of the transaction, CSX&#x27;s rail operations grew to include some of the Conrail system (predominantly lines that had belonged to the former New York Central Railroad). CSX began operating its trains on its portion of the Conrail network on June 1, 1999. CSX now serves much of the Eastern United States, with a few routes into nearby Canadian cities.

The two competitors were unwilling to give one company full control of busy industrial areas in Detroit, Philadelphia, and northern New Jersey (the Chemical Coast). A compromise solution was reached by creating Conrail Shared Assets Operations, a jointly owned switching and terminal railroad which would operate in these areas on behalf of both CSX and NS.

=== Other acquisitions ===
Virginia shortline Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (RF&amp;P) was acquired by CSX in February 1990. The RF&amp;P had historically been jointly owned by a number of connecting railroads through a holding company and operated as a bridge line. All of these owners except the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Southern Railway eventually became part of CSX, and the PRR stake was given up during the bankruptcy of Penn Central. This purchase added a new connection between Alexandria and Richmond, linking former B&amp;O lines with those of C&amp;O and Seaboard. However, the State of Virginia, which held partial ownership of the RF&amp;P, was displeased with the merger agreement created by CSX. In particular the status of Potomac Yard, then a major classification yard in the RF&amp;P system, was a matter of disagreement. The yard had potential for redevelopment, and as part of negotiations with the state, CSX ultimately agreed to decommission the rail yard by the time a deal was reached in October 1991 whereby CSX and the State of Virginia each purchased part of the RF&amp;P.

From the 1930s, the B&amp;O had used part of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&amp;LE) main line from McKeesport, Pennsylvania, to West Pittsburg via a trackage rights agreement. The P&amp;LE remained healthy enough to escape inclusion in Conrail, but a severe downturn in the steel industry in the 1980s crippled the railroad. As local traffic dried up, conditions reached the point that the B&amp;O was running as many as 20 trains per day on the P&amp;LE main line versus just one run by the line&#x27;s owner. When P&amp;LE employees went on strike to protest a change in ownership of the railroad, the company cut maintenance and reduced its main line to one track to cut costs. This adversely affected CSX usage of the line and sparked an interest in purchasing it outright.

An initial attempt to buy out the P&amp;LE in partnership with an employee buyout by P&amp;LE employees in 1988 failed when negotiations between CSX and the other railroad&#x27;s unions could not come to an agreement. CSX instead purchased the P&amp;LE main line outright in 1991, leasing it back to the P&amp;LE. The next year, CSX formed the Three Rivers Railway as a subsidiary and purchased several key P&amp;LE lines through it. CSX did not want the entire railroad, so some lines and company assets were instead retained by the P&amp;LE&#x27;s parent company, which ultimately sold them off.

===Into the 21st century===
The company introduced its current slogan, &quot;How Tomorrow Moves&quot;, in 2008.

In 2014, Canadian Pacific Railway approached CSX with an offer to merge the two companies, but CSX declined, and in 2015 Canadian Pacific made an attempt to purchase and merge with Norfolk Southern, but NS declined to do so as well.

In 2017, CSX announced Hunter Harrison would become its new chief executive officer; a settlement with activist investor Paul Hilal and Mantle Ridge. CSX added five new directors to their board, including Harrison and Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal. Mantle Ridge owns 4.9% of CSX. Harrison quickly moved to convert CSX rail operations to precision railroading. On December 14, 2017, CSX announced that Hunter Harrison was on medical leave. Two days after the announcement, Harrison died, one day after being hospitalized for complications of an ongoing illness. CSX initially saw a 10% drop in its stock price, but turned around to hit a new 52-week high less than a month later (January 2018). Harrison&#x27;s successors have continued the shift to precision railroading, with most hump yards converted to flat yards, low volume shipping lanes eliminated and reductions in rolling stock and work force.

===Pan Am Railways acquisition===
On November 30, 2020, CSX Transportation&#x27;s parent company CSX Corporation announced on social media that they had come to an agreement with Pan Am Systems to purchase New England based Class II Pan Am Railways, pending regulatory approval from the Surface Transportation Board. The STB approved the purchase on April 14, 2022. As part of the acquisition, Norfolk Southern Railway will gain trackage rights over several CSX lines, and Pan Am Southern, 50 percent owned by Pan Am Railways, will be operated by the Berkshire and Eastern Railroad, a new Genesee &amp; Wyoming subsidiary formed explicitly for this purpose. CSX completed the purchase on June 1, 2022.

===Meridian and Bigbee Railroad acquisition===

On June 28, 2023, CSX and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) announced the intention to purchase Meridian and Bigbee Railroad (MNBR). The MNBR creates a connection between CSX in Burkville, Alabama near Montgomery, and Meridian, Mississippi, where it joins the Meridian Speedway heading west. Under the proposed agreement, CSX will resume operations between Montgomery and Myrtlewood, terminating the lease currently in place with MNBR, while CPKC will acquire the segment of the line between Myrtlewood and Meridian. MNBR will cease operations between Montgomery and Myrtlewood although it may continue to operate between Myrtlewood and Meridian, and continue to serve existing customers on that segment of the line. If the STB approves the purchase, it will provide a connection between the two companies&#x27; networks and allow CSX traffic destined for Mexico to be delivered directly to CPKC, eliminating the need for a third intermediate railroad to move such traffic. Currently, CSX traffic bound for Mexico is exchanged with the Union Pacific Railroad in New Orleans, who then takes it to the cross-border gateway in Laredo, Texas, where it is delivered to CPKC.

In October 2024, the STB approved CSX&#x27;s resumption of operations on the leased from M&amp;B between Burkville and Myrtlewood and CPKC&#x27;s purchase of the miles of line between Myrtlewood and Meridian. The agreement became effective on November 16, 2024.

Initially, and for the next five years, CSX and CPKC will interchange across the line an average of two trains per day in each direction.

In turn, the Board also required CSX to maintain its Selma, AL, gateway open and to provide one shipper access to the NS at Selma at the M&amp;B rate for five years, subject to reasonable cost escalation. It also includes conditions protecting employees affected by the line sale, and requires noise mitigation efforts regarding the CSX portion.

A few days before CSX and CPKC officially took over the former M&amp;B line, Schneider National, CSX&#x27;s one of major intermodal partners and CPKC&#x27;s main partner, announced that a new interline service connecting the Southeast (Florida and Georgia) with the Texas and Mexico markets via the route between Montgomery and Meridian will be launched beginning in December.

==Unit trains==
CSX operated the Juice Train which consisted of Tropicana cars that carried fresh orange juice between Bradenton, Florida, and the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey. The northbound train was originally designated on CSX as K650 during the 1990s, and Q740 in the 2000s. The Juice Train has previously been studied as a model of efficient rail transportation that can compete with trucks and other modes in the perishable-goods trade. In 2017, the train was abolished from north of Tampa, Florida, and now mixed freight trains deliver the cars to their respective destinations. It still operates between Bradenton and Tampa however, but is designated as local O823.
CSX operates Coke Express unit trains. They carry coke for steelmaking, power generation and other various uses, running between Pittsburgh and Chicago, and other places in the Rust Belt.

==Locomotives==

CSX has rebuilt a significant number of locomotives. Some of their EMD GP38-2, GP40-2, and SD40-2 locomotives have been rebuilt to Dash 3 standards with updated Wabtec Electronically Controlled Air Brakes, air conditioning, automated starting controls, a crash safe cab, a new electronic control stand, and Positive Train Control (PTC). In 2019, 25 SD70AC locomotives were rebuilt at the CSX Huntington Heavy Repair Facility, with rebuilt prime movers, in-cab electronic and comfort improvements, New York Air Brake CCB II airbrake systems, and new Mitsubishi drive controls. CSX has also partnered with Wabtec to rebuild GE locomotives at their Fort Worth facility with prime movers upgraded to the FDL Advantage spec and new electronic controls such as the Wabtec Trip Optimizer Zero-to-Zero system.

CSX has also obtained a few EMD F40PH-2s that were previously retired from Amtrak, of which are now being used for executive office car service and geometry trains. Under CSX, they were originally numbered 9992, 9993, 9998, and 9999, but in 2021, all of these locomotives except for 9999 were renumbered to CSX 1, 2, and 3, and repainted into a heritage scheme honoring the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Another locomotive, ex-MARC GP40WH-2 no. 9969, was also acquired for the same purposes as the previous locomotives.

With the arrival of Hunter Harrison, CSX began to store many locomotives. Following Harrison&#x27;s death, his replacement James Foote largely continued his policies. The company had over 900 locomotives in storage in January 2018.

CSX ordered ten SD70ACe-T4s in August 2018, which were delivered in July the following year. They are classified as ST70AHs. CSX also has a contract with Wabtec for modernizing their fleet of CW44s. The modernized locomotives, nearly thirty in number as of June 2020, are being classified as CM44AC. In February 2024, CSX and Wabtec reached a new agreement, of which, involves the modernization of over 200 locomotives. This accounts for the rest of the active roster of CW44ACs &amp; CW44AHs. The locomotives will be modernized through 2028.

On April 30, 2019, CSX unveiled locomotives 911 and 1776, two ES44AH locomotives created to honor the first responders and veterans respectively. Another special unit, ES44AH 3194, was unveiled on August 22, 2019, in honor of the law enforcement. On September 13, 2022, CSX unveiled SD70AC 4568 painted in honor of Operation Lifesaver&#x27;s 50th anniversary. On December 31, 2024, CSX unveiled another SD70AC 4720 painted in honor of their &#x27;One CSX&#x27; initiative that honors the railroads employees.

===Heritage units===
In May 2023, CSX unveiled their heritage unit program, beginning with ES44AH No. 1827 being painted for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. CSX then stated that a total of 21 heritage locomotives would be painted over the coming months, with the locomotive number coinciding with the year the railroad was founded or the name began being used.

==Safety==
In 1995, CSX started a new liability insurance requirement of $200 million to introduce their official policy, &quot;no steam on its own wheels&quot;, banning the operation of steam locomotives and other antique rail equipment on their trackage due to safety concerns, and increased risk.

<doc id="287685" wikidata="Q1254842" url="?curid=287685" title="Dragon Half">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ryūsuke Mita. The manga was serialized in Fujimi Shobo&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; from January 30, 1988 to April 30, 1994 and the chapters collected into 7 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It was adapted into a 2-episode OVA series animated by Production I.G in 1993. ADV Films had previously licensed the anime series in North America. Discotek Media has since re-licensed the OVAs for a DVD release in 2014. The manga has been licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment.

The story follows Mink, a half human/half dragon teenage girl on a quest for a potion which will turn her into a full human so that she can win the love of the legendary dragon slayer/crooner Dick Saucer. In the manga, in order to get the potion, she must slay Azetodeth, the greatest demon in the land.

The story is very tongue-in-cheek, and pokes fun at a number of anime clichés, including the overuse of super deformation, across a wide range of genres, similar to anime such as &quot;Excel Saga&quot;.
Much of the manga contains references to role-playing games and occasionally either other manga, or anything that begins with the word &quot;dragon&quot;. Ryūsuke Mita&#x27;s favorite animal is the dragon. As a result, several dragons play an important role in the manga, most notably Mana and her father, Titan.

== Plot ==

Mink was born to a man who used to be a skilled swordsman and a female imperial red dragon. At age fifteen, she falls in love with a singer named Dick Saucer, but because he is also a dragonslayer, she has no choice but to get a potion that can change her into a pure human. She can only get the potion, however, if she can slay the most powerful Demon Lord in the land, Azetodeth, and go to his palace known as the Demon King&#x27;s island. Not only does she have to reconstruct the Gourd of the Saints, an item that can seal Azetodeth, she also has to be aware of Princess Vina, her rival for Saucer&#x27;s affections. Mink is aided by her friends Lufa, Pia, and a fairy mouse named Mappy on her quest.

After a number of adventures, mainly a conflict with a vampire and her four handmaidens and discovering Dick Saucer&#x27;s past, Mink finally comes face to face with Azetodeth. She manages to seal the Demon Lord away with the Gourd of Saints, and although she gains the potion, she chooses to remain half-human, half-imperial red dragon forever. Instead of using the potion herself, she gives the potion to her friend Lufa, who had been turned into a toad by the Demon Lord&#x27;s magic.

== Terminology ==
=== Locations ===
;The Demon King&#x27;s island
:An island where Azetodeth and his three sons live. This island has tall rugged rocks and is surrounded by a wall that prevents anything that goes through unless it goes into the main entrance which is difficult to find or a gate guarded by a receptionist named Suzuki who is beaten by Mink and runs off. The island is first seen at the end of Chapter 13. After making several more cameos, Mink finally gets on the island in Chapter 50. There is also a castle which is completely destroyed by Azetodeth in Chapter 64.

;Village of the Red Lightning
:The village where Mink and her family and friends live. It is shown in the beginning having a river flowing through it and mountains surrounding it, and is shown again in the credits.

=== Items ===
;The Gourd of the Saints
:The Gourd of the Saints is a bottle that took 200 years for Mink&#x27;s dragon great-grandfather to make. It was broken into three pieces which transformed into three holy artifacts 2000 years ago. The artifacts were Parza&#x27;s holy grail (a goblet), Lorelo&#x27;s Ball (a black ball that &quot;provides super-screw&quot;) and Gill&#x27;s crown. The Gourd of the Saints is extremely important as it is the only one that can seal Azetodeth away.

=== The three holy artifacts ===
There are three sacred treasures required to resurrect the gourd known as the three holy artifacts (Sango no Jingi in the Japanese version). They are loosely based on the Imperial Regalia of Japan. Parza&#x27;s holy grail represents the mirror of wisdom, Lorelo&#x27;s ball represents the Jewel of Benevolence and Gil&#x27;s crown represents the sword of valor, but only Lorelo&#x27;s ball and the jewel of benevolence correspond to each other in the story.

==Media==
=== Manga ===

&quot;Dragon Half&quot; was released in two versions. The first was as seven standard &quot;tankōbon&quot;, and the second was a wideban release comprising three volumes which included extra galleries and interviews with Mita not found in the original releases. The manga consists of 65 chapters. After &quot;Dragon Half&quot; ended, Ryūsuke Mita created a sequel one-shot called &quot;Dragon Half Z&quot; about Mink&#x27;s seven-year-old daughter Pink. The manga has been licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment.

=== Anime and video game ===
A 2-episode OVA series adaptation was animated by Production I.G in 1993. It was written and directed by Shin&#x27;ya Sadamitsu, with character designs by Masahiro Koyama and music by Kōhei Tanaka. The first OVA, , was released on March 26, 1993. The second, , was released two months later on May 28.

The OVA series is based on sections of the first two volumes. There were originally going to be 4 OVA episodes but there was not enough interest so only two episodes were produced. The ending theme song, &quot;My Omelette&quot;, was written to the music of Beethoven (Symphony No. 7, 4th movement) and sung by Kotono Mitsuishi while in character.

The OVA has also inspired a game for the PC Engine, also called &quot;Dragon Half&quot;, released by Microcabin of Xak series fame. The game is an RPG and roughly follows the plot of the OVA. The OVA&#x27;s voice actors returned to voice roles in the game. A PC-98 and FM-Towns versions were developed by Micro Cabin Corp.

<text>The pillory is a device made of a wooden or metal framework erected on a post, with holes for securing the head and hands, used during the medieval and renaissance periods for punishment by public humiliation and often further physical abuse. The pillory is related to the stocks.

== Etymology ==
The word is documented in English since 1274 (attested in Anglo-Latin from ), and stems from Old French (1168; modern French , see below), itself from medieval Latin , of uncertain origin, perhaps a diminutive of Latin &#x27;pillar, stone barrier&#x27;. 

==Description==

Rather like the lesser punishment called the stocks, the pillory consisted of hinged wooden boards forming holes through which the head or various limbs were inserted; then the boards were locked together to secure the captive. Pillories were set up to hold people in marketplaces, crossroads, and other public places. They were often placed on platforms to increase public visibility of the person; often a placard detailing the crime was placed nearby. These punishments generally lasted only a few hours.

In being forced to bend forward and stick their head and hands out in front of them, offenders in the pillory would have been extremely uncomfortable during their punishment. However, the main purpose in putting criminals in the pillory was to humiliate them publicly. On discovering that the pillory was occupied, people would excitedly gather in the marketplace to taunt, tease and laugh at the offender on display.

Those who gathered to watch the punishment typically wanted to make the offender&#x27;s experience as unpleasant as possible. In addition to being jeered and mocked, the criminal might be pelted with rotten food, mud, offal, dead animals, and animal excrement. Sometimes people were killed or maimed in the pillory because crowds could get too violent and pelt the offender with stones, bricks and other dangerous objects. However, when Daniel Defoe was sentenced to the pillory in 1703 for seditious libel, he was regarded as a hero by the crowd and was pelted with flowers.

The criminal could also be sentenced to further punishments while in the pillory: humiliation by shaving off some or all hair or regular corporal punishment(s), notably flagellation (the pillory serving as the &quot;whipping post&quot;) or even permanent mutilation such as branding or having an ear cut off (cropping), as in the case of John Bastwick.

In Protestant cultures (such as in the Scandinavian countries), the pillory would be the worldly part of a church punishment. The delinquent would therefore first serve the ecclesiastical part of his punishment on the pillory bench in the church itself, and then be handed to the worldly authorities to be bound to the Skampåle (literally: &quot;Shame Pole&quot;) for public humiliation.

==Uses==
In 1816, use of the pillory was restricted in England as punishment for perjury or subornation. The pillory was formally abolished as a form of punishment in England and Wales in 1837, after Lord John Russell had said &quot;I shall likewise propose to bring in a Bill to abolish the punishment of the pillory—a punishment which is never inflicted.&quot; However, the stocks remained in use, though extremely infrequently, until 1872. The last person to be pilloried in England was Peter James Bossy, who was convicted of &quot;wilful and corrupt perjury&quot; in 1830. He was sentenced to seven years penal transportation, six months in prison at Newgate and one hour in the pillory in the Old Bailey.

In France, time in the &quot;&quot; was usually limited to two hours. It was replaced in 1789 by &quot;exposition&quot;, and abolished in 1832. Two types of devices were used:

* The &#x27; (literally: &quot;post&quot; or &quot;pole&quot;) was a simple post, often with a board around only the neck, and was synonymous with the mode of punishment. This was the same as the &#x27; (&quot;shamepole&quot;) in Dutch. The &#x27;, an iron ring around the neck to tie a prisoner to such a post, was the name of a similar punishment that was abolished in 1832. A criminal convicted to serve time in a prison or galleys would, prior to his incarceration, be attached for two to six hours (depending on whether he was convicted to prison or the galleys) to the &#x27;, with his name, crime and sentence written on a board over his head.
* A permanent small tower, the upper floor of which had a ring made of wood or iron with holes for the victim&#x27;s head and arms, which was often on a turntable to expose the condemned to all parts of the crowd.
Like other permanent apparatus for physical punishment, the pillory was often placed prominently and constructed more elaborately than necessary. It served as a symbol of the power of the judicial authorities, and its continual presence was seen as a deterrent, like permanent gallows for authorities endowed with high justice.

The pillory was also in common use in other western countries and colonies, and similar devices were used in other, non-Western cultures. According to one source, the pillory was abolished as a form of punishment in the United States in 1839, but this cannot be entirely true because it was clearly in use in Delaware as recently as 1901. Governor Preston Lea finally signed a bill to abolish the pillory in Delaware in March 1905.

Punishment by whipping-post remained on the books in Delaware until 1972, when it became the last state to abolish it. Delaware was the last state to sentence someone to whipping in 1963; however, the sentence was commuted. The last whipping in Delaware was in 1952.

In Portugal today pillory has a different meaning. The Portuguese word is &#x27;, and there are examples which are monuments of great importance, in a tradition dating back to Roman times, when criminals were chained to them. They are stone columns with carved capitals, and they are usually located on the main square of the town, and/or in front of a major church or palace, or town hall: they symbolize local power and authority. are considered major local monuments, several clearly bearing the coat of arms of a king or queen. The same is true of its former colonies, notably in Brazil (in its former capital, Salvador, the whole old quarter is known as ) and Africa (e.g. Cape Verde&#x27;s old capital, Cidade Velha), always as symbols of royal power. In Spain, the device was called &#x27;.

==Similar humiliation devices==

There was a variant (rather of the stocks type), called a barrel pillory, or Spanish mantle, used to punish drunks, which is reported in England and among its troops. It fitted over the entire body, with the head sticking out from a hole in the top. The criminal is put in either an enclosed barrel, forcing him to kneel in his own filth, or an open barrel, also known as &quot;barrel shirt&quot; or &quot;drunkards collar&quot; after the punishable crime, leaving him to roam about town or military camp and be ridiculed and scorned.

Although a pillory, by its physical nature, could double as a whipping post to tie a criminal down for public flagellation (as used to be the case in many German sentences to &quot;staupenschlag&quot;), the two as such are separate punishments: the pillory is a sentence to public humiliation, whipping is essentially a painful corporal punishment. The combination of the pillory and the whipping post was one of the various punishments the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony applied to enforce religious and intellectual conformity on the whole community. Sometimes a single structure was built with separate locations for the two punishments, with a whipping post on the lower level and a pillory above (see image at right).

When permanently present in sight of prisoners, whipping posts were thought to act as a deterrent against bad behaviour, especially when each prisoner had been subjected to a &quot;welcome beating&quot; on arrival, as in 18th-century Waldheim in Saxony (12, 18 or 24 whip lashes on the bare posterior tied to a pole in the castle courtyard, or by birch rod over the &quot;bock&quot;, a bench in the corner). Still a different penal use of such constructions is to tie the criminal down, possibly after a beating, to expose him for a long time to the elements, usually without food and drink, even to the point of starvation.

Finger-pillories were at one time in common use as instruments of domestic punishment. Two stout pieces of oak, the top being hinged to the bottom or fixed piece, formed when closed a number of holes sufficiently deep to admit the finger to the second joint, holding the hand imprisoned. A finger-pillory is preserved in the parish church of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire.

==Notable cases==
*Peter Annet
*Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald
*Daniel Defoe
*James Nayler
*Elizabeth Needham
*Titus Oates
==Legacy==

While the pillory has left common use, the image remains preserved in the figurative use, which has become the dominant one, of the verb &quot;to pillory&quot; (attested in English since 1699), meaning &quot;to expose to public ridicule, scorn and abuse&quot;, or more generally to humiliate before witnesses.

Corresponding expressions exist in other languages, e.g., &#x27; &quot;to nail to the pillory&quot; in French, &#x27; in Italian, or &#x27; in Spanish. In Dutch it is &#x27; (nailing to the pole of shame) or &#x27;, placing even greater emphasis on the predominantly humiliating character as the Dutch word for pillory, &#x27;, literally meaning &quot;pole of shame&quot;.

<doc id="287690" wikidata="Q1146647" url="?curid=287690" title="Chibi (style)">
<text>Chibi, also known as super deformation (SD), is a style of caricature originating in Japan, and common in anime and manga where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way, typically small and chubby with stubby limbs, oversized heads, and minimal detail. The style has found its way into the anime and manga fandom through its usage in manga works and merchandising.

==Word usage and etymology==
The English term &quot;chibi&quot; derives from the Japanese , where is a colloquial word for very short people and children, itself deriving from , and is loaned from the English &quot;character&quot;.

&quot;Super deformed&quot; and &quot;S.D.&quot; come from Japanese , itself from French .

==Proportions and appearance==

Compared to the average anime character, usually about seven to eight heads tall, the head of a super-deformed character is normally anywhere between one third and one half the character&#x27;s height. In addition to their modified proportions, super-deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super-deformed character, certain aspects of their design will be simplified and others will be more exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent in the super deformed version of the character.

The chibi style easily falls under the Japanese category of kawaii, with the specific proportions being exaggerated in the ways that they are. With it being as cute as it is, the chibi style allows for easy advertisement in the culture, and even in other countries.

==Media usage==
One example of &quot;chibi&quot;&#x27;s usage in Japanese, which brought the term to the attention of Western fans, is Chibiusa; this diminutive pet name for the daughter of Sailor Moon comes from &quot;Chibi Usagi&quot; (&quot;Little Rabbit&quot;). The &quot;chibi&quot; art style is part of the Japanese &quot;kawaii&quot; culture, and is seen everywhere from advertising and subway signs to anime and manga. The style was popularized by franchises like &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;SD Gundam&quot; in the 1980s. It is used as comic relief in anime and manga, giving additional emphasis to a character&#x27;s emotional reaction.

The super deformed style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series such as &quot;Homestuck&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which feature super deformed shorts. It also appeared in French-Canadian shows such as &quot;Totally Spies!&quot; and &quot;Martin Mystery&quot;.

The main character of the manga, and later several anime adaptations, Astro Boy, is an early example of the evolving chibi style. Created in 1952, the chibi style was not yet what was known as today, and yet some of the characteristics were beginning to emerge. Astro Boy has the usage of exaggerated features, like very large eyes, round heads, and small rounded limbs, and as these features lend themselves well to it, this style is often used to represent children and child-like characters like Astro Boy.

Perhaps the most renowned use of the style is in the Hello Kitty character. An anthropomorphic cat with a head bigger than her body created in 1974 for a coin purse, Hello Kitty is one of Japan&#x27;s biggest icons being featured in series, music, games, and books.

In May 2016, Rooster Teeth released the first episode of &quot;RWBY Chibi&quot;, a 3D animated series of shorts involving the characters popularized by their show &quot;RWBY&quot;.

In 2022, Disney Channel introduced the &quot;Chibiverse&quot; series that uses Disney animated characters.

<text>In music, relative keys are the major and minor scales that have the same key signatures (enharmonically equivalent), meaning that they share all of the same notes but are arranged in a different order of whole steps and half steps. A pair of major and minor scales sharing the same key signature are said to be in a relative relationship. The relative minor of a particular major key, or the relative major of a minor key, is the key which has the same key signature but a different tonic. (This is as opposed to &quot;parallel&quot; minor or major, which shares the same tonic.)

For example, F major and D minor both have one flat in their key signature at B♭; therefore, D minor is the relative minor of F major, and conversely F major is the relative major of D minor. The tonic of the relative minor is the sixth scale degree of the major scale, while the tonic of the relative major is the third degree of the minor scale. The minor key starts three semitones below its relative major; for example, A minor is three semitones below its relative, C major.

The relative relationship may be visualized through the circle of fifths.



Relative keys are a type of closely related keys, the keys between which most modulations occur, because they differ by no more than one accidental. Relative keys are the most closely related, as they share exactly the same notes.
The major key and the minor key also share the same set of chords. In every major key, the triad built on the first degree (note) of the scale is major, the second and third are minor, the fourth and fifth are major, the sixth minor and the seventh is diminished. In the relative minor, the same triads pertain. Because of this, it can occasionally be difficult to determine whether a particular piece of music is in a major key or its relative minor.

== Distinguishing on the basis of melody ==
To distinguish a minor key from its relative major, one can look to the first note/chord of the melody, which usually is the tonic or the dominant (fifth note); The last note/chord also tends to be the tonic. A &quot;raised 7th&quot; is also a strong indication of a minor scale (instead of a major scale): For example, C major and A minor both have no sharps or flats in their key signatures, but if the note G (the seventh note in A minor raised by a semitone) occurs frequently in a melody, then this melody is likely in A harmonic minor, instead of C major.

== List ==
A complete list of relative minor/major pairs in order of the circle of fifths is:

==Terminology==
In German, &quot;relative key&quot; is &quot;Paralleltonart&quot;, while &quot;parallel key&quot; is &quot;Varianttonart&quot;. Similar terminology is used in most Germanic and Slavic languages, but not in Romance languages. Adding to the confusion, a parallel chord is derived from the relative key.

<text>Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) is a state network of PBS member television stations and NPR member radio stations serving the U.S. state of Georgia. It is operated by the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission, an agency of the Georgia state government which holds the licenses for most of the PBS and NPR member stations licensed in the state. The broadcast signals of the nine television stations and 19 radio stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

The network&#x27;s headquarters and primary radio and television production facilities are located on 14th Street in Midtown Atlanta, just west of the Downtown Connector in the Home Park neighborhood. The facility and GPB are also a major part of Georgia&#x27;s film and television industry, and in addition to commercial production occurring at the GPB facilities, some production companies also rent production offices from GPB.

==History==
===Establishing the network===
On May 23, 1960, the University of Georgia signed on WGTV, the second educational television station in Georgia (after Atlanta&#x27;s WETV, later WPBA, now WABE-TV). From 1960 to 1964, in a separate initiative, the Georgia Board of Education launched four educational television stations across the state, aimed at providing in-school instruction. This evolved into the Georgia Educational Television Network, which aired Board of Education-produced classes for schools and evening programming from WGTV. WGTV moved its transmitter to Stone Mountain in 1969, adding Atlanta to its coverage area.

In November 1980, Governor George Busbee proposed the consolidation of WGTV with the state&#x27;s network of transmitters into a new Georgia Public Telecommunications Council and also called for said body to negotiate to buy WETV from the Atlanta Board of Education. The Georgia state senate approved the bill, but it stalled in the House of Representatives due to the objections of Athens-area members and those involved with the UGA station. After the legislative session ended, Governor Busbee revived the proposal by executive order. On January 1, 1982, the new council took operational control of WGTV, and the combined service rebranded as Georgia Public Television; by June 1982, after the expiration of remaining program contracts, WGTV was fully incorporated into the network, and UGA&#x27;s role was reduced to program supplier.

===Growth into radio===
In February 1985, the GPTC entered into public radio, launching stations serving Macon, Columbus and Valdosta in the first year. These formed the nuclei of Peach State Public Radio, which provided the first public radio services to much of Georgia; previously, only Atlanta and Savannah had public stations. During the 1980s and 1990s, stations that had been operated by other educational institutions and community groups became affiliated with the network. The service was renamed Georgia Public Radio in 2001.

In 1995, the GPTC began using &quot;Georgia Public Broadcasting&quot; as its corporate name. This would eventually become the umbrella title for all GPB operations in early 2004, when GPTV and Georgia Public Radio simultaneously rebranded under the Georgia Public Broadcasting name.

===New studios and new scandals===

The late 1990s were a time of political scandal for GPB. In 1997, the agency used Georgia Lottery funds earmarked for technology to build its present facility in Midtown, later cited as one of several unnecessary projects using lottery monies. Financial mismanagement led Governor Roy Barnes in 1999 to oust the executive director, Vernon Rogers, and board of directors, appointing longtime state auditor Claude Vickers to turn around a three-year deficit nearing $7 million. The ouster of Rogers came after an audit revealed that the agency had a stack of accounts receivable, the oldest of them 12 years old; a bank loan that the Georgia legislature never approved; and had misplaced $1 million in equipment. Under Vickers, GPB cut expenses by $5.2 million without cutting radio or television program production and had its first positive audit in six years.

As the audiovisual industry has grown in Georgia, GPB studios have been used for the production of commercial television programming. The studio facilities were used for the production of the first season of the CBS Television Distribution-syndicated program &quot;Swift Justice With Nancy Grace&quot;; production of that series was moved to Los Angeles for its second and final season. In 2014, another syndicated court show, &quot;Lauren Lake&#x27;s Paternity Court&quot;, began using the GPB facilities under the same arrangement; in 2017, it was joined by &quot;Couples Court with the Cutlers&quot;.

GPB is an agency under the oversight of the governor, which has led to concerns of political connections in the broadcasting operation. In 2012, the director of the agency hired state senator Chip Rogers to host a program on a direct recommendation from Nathan Deal; the arrangement was panned by former NPR president Vivian Schiller and seen as a way to land the politician in a favorable position. Rogers was let go from GPB in 2014.

==GPB Television==
GPB Television broadcasts PBS programming and statewide programs produced specifically for the GPB network 24 hours a day on a network of nine full-power stations as well as numerous low-power translator stations (especially in the state&#x27;s mountainous northeastern counties). Certain programs broadcast by GPB Television (mainly those provided by PBS) feature a Descriptive Video Service track that is audible over the second audio program (SAP) channel of each station; GPB Radio feeds could previously be heard during times when DVS-transcribed programs were not airing, prior to the 2009 digital television transition. All stations within the GPB Television network act as rebroadcasters, simulcasting the network&#x27;s programming at all times. GPB-produced programs include &quot;Gardening in Georgia&quot;, &quot;Georgia Backroads&quot;, &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Business&quot;, &quot;Georgia Outdoors&quot; and &quot;Georgia Traveler&quot;, as well as annual coverage of the Georgia General Assembly when it is in legislative session early in the year. Live coverage of the football and basketball championship games from the Georgia High School Association is broadcast at the end of their respective seasons.

GPB Television also operates four digital subchannels that are carried on most of its stations: GPB Knowledge debuted in September 2008, but officially launched on October 1 of that year. GPB Knowledge carries programming from the World network during prime time hours, and GPB documentary and news programming (including BBC World News) at other times. It replaced GPB Education, which is still available to schools statewide on demand over the Internet. GPB Kids, launched in January 2009 as the second digital subchannel of the GPBTV stations, replacing the standard-definition feed (which mirrored each station&#x27;s analog feed) of GPB&#x27;s main channel. GPB Kids aired 24/7 with content from PBS Kids. During December 2008, the subchannel carried only a static station identification for all nine stations (including the GPB/PBS Kids logo), and the electronic program guide for the channel continued to show main channel information for the GPBTV stations. In March 2015, GPB Kids was replaced with Create. In January 2017, PBS Kids 24/7 was launched, being the fourth digital subchannel of the GPB TV stations.

===Television stations===
Each of GPB&#x27;s television stations identify themselves with two locations—usually, the smaller community where the station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (almost always the station&#x27;s transmitter location) and the larger city that it serves. The exceptions are WVAN-TV and WJSP-TV, which are actually licensed in major Georgia cities: WVAN-TV is licensed to Savannah, while WJSP-TV is licensed to Columbus. However, in order to conform to the pattern, GPB lists the locations for the stations&#x27; transmitters as the second city.

This rule only applies to the television stations, not to those on radio, which, except for two, bear only the city of license.

The GPB television stations are:

===Broadcast translators===
GPB Television operates several low-power translator stations located in the hilly terrain of the north Georgia mountains. These include:

====Former translators====
The following translators were abandoned by GPB, which had their licenses (and in some cases, digital applications and permits) cancelled by the FCC, apparently at GPB&#x27;s request, possibly due to the expense of running and upgrading them.
===WUGA-TV===

On December 23, 2010, the University of Georgia announced that it would enter into a programming partnership with GPB, which would provide all programming for the university-owned WNEG-TV (channel 32) in Toccoa, with most of the content coming from its GPB Knowledge subchannel. The station filed with the FCC to convert WNEG&#x27;s station license to non-commercial status. The partnership between UGA and GPB was due to a reduction of advertising dollars, resulting from an economic downturn and the loss of WNEG&#x27;s CBS affiliation (the station had been with CBS since August 1995, receiving affiliation as a by-product of the CBS programming moving in the adjacent Atlanta market from WAGA-TV [channel 5] to WGCL-TV [channel 46] in December 1994). At 5:30 am on May 1, 2011, the station began carrying GPB Knowledge programming; the following day, its call letters were changed to WUGA-TV. UGA sold WUGA-TV to Marquee Broadcasting in 2015; at 12:01 am on July 1, 2015, the new owners dropped all GPB Knowledge programming, changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WGTA, and returned the station to commercial operation with programming from the MeTV, Heroes &amp; Icons, Decades, and Movies! networks.

===Digital television===
WGTV, WXGA-TV, and WVAN-TV were the first GPB stations to begin operating their own digital television signals. The other six stations signed on their digital signals in July 2008. The ERP/HAAT figures listed within the table for those stations are based on those listed in the stations&#x27; individual Wikipedia articles, though some of the stations were operating at low power, and only upgraded to full-power when the digital transition occurred.

===Subchannels===
The digital signals of GPB&#x27;s TV stations are multiplexed:
&lt;section begin=subchannels /&gt;
All nine stations carry the same programming from each of the four channels, but channel labels differ somewhat between the stations.&lt;section end=subchannels /&gt;

====Analog-to-digital conversion====

The GPB Television stations shut down their analog signals on February 17, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12).

Each stations&#x27; post-transition digital allocations are as follows:
* WABW-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 14; the station&#x27;s digital signal moved from its pre-transition VHF channel 5 to channel 6, using PSIP to display WABW-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 14 on digital television receivers.
* WACS-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 25; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 8, using PSIP to display WACS-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 25 on digital television receivers.
* WCES-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 20; the station&#x27;s digital signal moved from its pre-transition VHF channel 2 to channel 6, using PSIP to display WCES-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 20 on digital television receivers.
* WGTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 12 to channel 8.
* WJSP-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using PSIP to display WJSP-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 28 on digital television receivers. The station was licensed to move its digital signal to VHF channel 5 effective April 5, 2019.
* WMUM-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 29; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 7, using PSIP to display WMUM-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 29 on digital television receivers.
* WNGH-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 18; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 33, using PSIP to display WNGH-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 18 on digital television receivers.
* WVAN-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 13 to channel 9.
* WXGA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 9 to channel 8.

GPB has placed most of its stations on VHF due to the lower effective radiated power requirements (20 or 32 kW instead of 1000 kW), which in turn reduces the cost of purchasing the transmitter and using the electrical power for it. For WABW and WCES, this makes them one of the few television stations in the country to operate on low-band VHF channels (2 to 6), which require larger receiving antennas, are prone to tropospheric ducting (weather) and impulse noise, make mobile TV (ATSC-M/H) difficult, and for 5 and 6 are also an obstacle to expanding the FM broadcast band. The high-band VHF channels also have these problems, but not to a major extent.

==Cable and satellite availability==
GPB Television&#x27;s various stations are carried on all cable providers in Georgia (the station that is available on a given provider varies on the jurisdiction). Additionally, Savannah&#x27;s WVAN is carried on cable systems on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina; Columbus&#x27; WJSP is carried on cable systems in Phenix City and Auburn, Alabama; and Augusta&#x27;s WCES is carried on most cable systems in Aiken and Edgefield, South Carolina. WABW is carried on Comcast&#x27;s system in Tallahassee, Florida.

On satellite, WGTV, WVAN, WCES, WJSP, WNUM, WABW, WNGH, and WXGA are carried on the Atlanta, Savannah, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Albany, Chattanooga, and Jacksonville DirecTV and Dish Network feeds, respectively.

==GPB Radio==
GPB Radio broadcasts 24 hours a day on several FM radio stations across the state, except in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The network had previously operated a translator station in Atlanta, W264AE (100.7 FM), which broadcast from a transmission tower located in the city&#x27;s downtown district. However, it (and WGHR) was forced to go silent when full-power station WWWQ (100.5 FM, now WNNX) moved from Anniston, Alabama (where it operated under the WHMA-FM call letters) into the Atlanta market on an adjacent channel. Despite having almost no presence in metropolitan Atlanta prior to 2014, the network reaches nearly all the rest of Georgia, plus parts of Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and Tennessee. Atlanta-area listeners heard NPR programming on locally licensed stations WABE and WCLK instead.

===WRAS-Atlanta controversy===
On May 6, 2014, Georgia State University announced an arrangement allowing Georgia Public Broadcasting to program the university&#x27;s station WRAS (&quot;Album 88&quot;) from 5a.m. to 7p.m. daily, leaving 7p.m. to 5a.m. as the only remaining student airtime. This took effect on June 29. In exchange, GPB promised to provide internships at GPB for GSU students and other media collaborations between the two institutions, with WRAS broadcasting a separate feed from the main statewide network. The announcement immediately prompted intense opposition and denunciations from WRAS listeners, staffers, and GSU alumni, going so far as evoking a protest at GSU&#x27;s commencement ceremony, a social media campaign with the tag #savewras, and a petition with more than 10,000 signatories on Change.org. Some of them have made accusations of secrecy and even illegality surrounding the transaction as they protested that the alternative rock format was unique to the Atlanta market (despite the presence of another college station in the area, WREK, licensed to the Georgia Institute of Technology) and that it was being displaced by programming that largely duplicated offerings on WABE. This has led to a public effort to boycott GPB and its underwriters.

Despite these protests, the network announced plans to increase news and talk programming later in 2014 to cater to WRAS listeners.

===Programming===
Most of the stations presently air a mix of classical music, and news and talk programming sourced from NPR; however, some stations carry select locally produced programming. WRAS airs NPR news and talk programming during the hours that GPB programs it.

Previously, GPB Radio was transmitted over the second audio program feed of GPB&#x27;s television stations at most times prior to the 2009 digital television transition. GPB Radio is still audible through this function on DirecTV, but not GPB&#x27;s digital television stations or on cable for unknown reasons.

GPB Radio stations in southern and southeastern Georgia also relay hurricane evacuation information for listeners approaching or leaving Georgia&#x27;s Atlantic Coast or the Florida Panhandle. Signs along interstate and other major highways in the region direct the evacuee to the nearest GPB Radio station carrying the emergency information.

=== Radio stations ===
=== Notes ===
WGPB and WNGH were commercial radio stations purchased by a GPB foundation in the late 2000s, hence their location outside of the 88-92 MHz reserved band.

GPB/GPTC also owns translator station W233CA in Athens, which repeats WUGA.

==GPB Education==
GPB Education (formerly known as Peachstar) serves state agencies and the Georgia learning community through the use of telecommunications technology. GPB delivers educational programming that reflects state standards to Georgia classrooms using the GPB satellite network, open-air television, and the GPB video streaming portal. GPB provides professional development to Georgia educators through face-to-face trainings, satellite-delivered programs, and interactive webcasts. GPB also meets the training needs of state agencies through its video production, satellite broadcast, and interactive webcasting services, as well as through its extensive digital library.

GPB is currently transitioning its GPB Education programming from direct broadcast satellite to digital terrestrial television, through its GPB Knowledge subchannel.

==Departments==
===GPB News===

<doc id="287702" wikidata="Q237128" url="?curid=287702" title="Mesa Verde National Park">
<text>Mesa Verde National Park is a national park of the United States and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Montezuma County, Colorado, and the only World Heritage Site in Colorado. The park protects some of the best-preserved Ancestral Puebloan ancestral sites in the United States.

Established by Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, the park occupies near the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. With more than 5,000 sites, including 600 cliff dwellings, it is the largest archaeological preserve in the United States. Mesa Verde (Spanish for &quot;green table&quot;, or more specifically &quot;green table mountain&quot;) is best known for structures such as Cliff Palace, one of the largest cliff dwellings in North America.

Starting BC Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic Paleo-Indians known as the Foothills Mountain Complex. The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas, including the Great Basin, the San Juan Basin, and the Rio Grande Valley. Later, Archaic people established semi-permanent rock shelters in and around the mesa. By 1000 BC, the Basketmaker culture emerged from the local Archaic population, and by 750 AD the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture.

The Pueblo people survived using a combination of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash (the &quot;Three Sisters&quot;). They built the mesa&#x27;s first pueblos sometime after 650, and by the end of the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they migrated south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including the Rio Chama, the Albuquerque Basin, the Pajarito Plateau, and the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

==Inhabitants==

===Paleo-Indians===
The first occupants of the Mesa Verde region, which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico, were nomadic Paleo-Indians who arrived in the area BC. They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams, many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the San Juan Mountains receded. The earliest Paleo-Indians were the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition, defined largely by how they fashioned projectile points. Although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region, there is little indication that they lived in central Mesa Verde during this time.

After 9600 BC, the area&#x27;s environment grew warmer and drier, a change that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance at a time when most of the region&#x27;s big game had disappeared from the landscape.

===Archaic===

6000 BC marks the beginning of the Archaic period in North America. Archaeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo-Indians, called the Foothills Mountain Complex, but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas, including the Great Basin, the San Juan Basin, and the Rio Grande Valley. The Archaic people probably developed locally, but were also influenced by contact, trade, and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas.

The early Archaic people living near Mesa Verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rock shelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.

By the late Archaic, more people were living in semi-permanent rock shelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. They started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. The late Archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as obsidian and turquoise. Marine shells and abalone from the Pacific coast made their way to Mesa Verde from Arizona, and the Archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants. Rock art flourished, and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood. Their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the Archaic period, .

===Basketmaker culture===
With the introduction of corn to the Mesa Verde region BC and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent pithouse settlements, the Archaic Puebloan transitioned into what archaeologists call the Basketmaker culture. Basketmaker II people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills, use of the atlatl, and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery. By 300, corn had become the preeminent staple of the Basketmaker II people&#x27;s diet, which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops.

In addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than tall. Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout Mesa Verde. They depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the Hopi call Kokopelli.

By 500 AD, atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the Basketmaker II Era and the beginning of the Basketmaker III Era. Ceramic vessels were a major improvement over pitch-lined baskets, gourds, and animal hide containers, which had been the primary water storage containers in the region. Pottery also protected seeds against mold, insects, and rodents. By 600, Ancestral Pueblo People were using clay pots to cook soups and stews. Year-round settlements first appear around this time. The population of the San Juan Basin increased markedly after 575, when there were very few Basketmaker III sites in Mesa Verde; by the early 7th century, there were many such sites in the mesa. For the next 150 years, villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences. The population of Mesa Verde was approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people.

Beans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region . By 775, some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people; the construction of large, above-ground storage buildings began around this time. Basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year, but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields. By the end of the 8th century, the smaller hamlets, which were typically occupied for ten to forty years, had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations. Basketmaker III people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures.

===Ancestral Puebloans===
====Pueblo I: 750 to 900====

750 marks the end of the Basketmaker III Era and the beginning of the Pueblo I period. The transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called pueblos. Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pit-houses were moved to these above-ground dwellings. This altered the function of pit-houses from all-purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies, although they continued to house large extended families, particularly during winter months. During the late 8th century, Pueblo people began building square pit structures that archaeologists call protokivas. They were typically deep and wide.

The first pueblos appeared at Mesa Verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of Pueblo people lived in them. As local populations grew, Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. This shift from semi-nomadism to a &quot;sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever&quot;. Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from 1–3 to 15–20, with average populations of two hundred people. Population density increased dramatically, with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two. This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents. It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans, and by the late 8th century, as Mesa Verde&#x27;s population was being augmented by settlers from the south, four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages.

Large Pueblo I settlements laid claim to the resources found within . They were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about apart. By 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in Mesa Verde. Within the plazas of larger villages, the Pueblo I people dug massive pit structures of that became central gathering places. These structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the Pueblo II Era great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite robust growth during the early and mid-9th century, unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area. Many late Pueblo I villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation, and by 880 Mesa Verde&#x27;s population was in steady decline. The beginning of the 10th century saw widespread depopulation of the region, as people emigrated south of the San Juan River to Chaco Canyon in search of reliable rains for farming. As Pueblo people migrated south, to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before, the influence of Chaco Canyon grew, and by 950 Chaco had supplanted Mesa Verde as the region&#x27;s cultural center.

====Pueblo II: 900 to 1150====
The Pueblo II Period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite their participation in the vast Chacoan system, Puebloan retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century Puebloan pueblos influenced two hundred years of Chacoan great house construction. Droughts during the late 9th century rendered Ancestral Pueblo people&#x27;s dry land farming unreliable, which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next 150 years. Crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early 11th century. By 1050 the population of the area began to rebound; as agricultural prosperity increased, people immigrated to Mesa Verde from the south. 

Pueblonan farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the Pueblo II Era. During the 11th century, they built check dams and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff. These fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields. By the mid-10th and early 11th centuries, protokivas had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas, which were usually across. These Mesa Verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a sipapu, which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber and symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloan&#x27;s place of emergence from the underworld. At this time, Ancestral Pueblo people began to move away from the post and mud jacal-style buildings that marked the Pueblo I Period toward masonry construction, which had been utilized in the region as early as 700, but was not widespread until the 11th and 12th centuries.

The expansion of Chacoan influence in the Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark in the form of Chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Puebloan villages after 1075. Far View House, the largest of these, is considered a classic Chaco &quot;outlier,&quot; on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125, although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020. The era&#x27;s timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years. During the early 12th century, the locus of regional control shifted away from Chaco to Aztec, New Mexico, in the southern Mesa Verde region. By 1150, drought had once again stressed the region&#x27;s inhabitants, leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at Mesa Verde.

====Pueblo III: 1150 to 1300====

A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for the Puebloan, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Puebloan had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure. A recent study has shown that residents resorted to cannibalism starting in 1150 due to the discovery of disarticulated human remains that were prepared and consumed.

The Chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region. For approximately six hundred years, most Puebloan farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads of one or two families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.

Ancestral Pueblo villages thrived during the mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects constructed massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built during this period have been described as &quot;among the world&#x27;s greatest archaeological treasures&quot;. Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde&#x27;s population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought. At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there. The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260. Most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as Yellow Jacket Pueblo, near Cortez, Colorado. Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. By 1260, the majority of Puebloans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.

The 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the Mesa Verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures. Dendrochronology indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in 1281. There was a major decline in ceramic imports to the region during this time, but local production remained steady. Despite challenging conditions, the Puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from 1276 to 1299 ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at Mesa Verde. Archaeologists refer to this period as the &quot;Great Drought&quot;. The last inhabitants of the mesa left the area .

====Warfare====

During the Pueblo III period (1150 to 1300), Puebloans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. They often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas. Warfare was conducted using the same tools the Puebloans used for hunting game, including bows and arrows, stone axes, and wooden clubs and spears. They also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles. Periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the 13th century. Civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought. This system probably broke down during the &quot;Great Drought&quot;, leading to intense warfare between competing clans. Increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century&#x27;s final decades led to widespread conflict. Evidence of partly burned villages and post-mortem trauma have been uncovered, and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site-wide massacre.

Evidence of violence and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Puebloans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Puebloans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument&#x27;s Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.

====Migration====
The Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations. The added population stressed the mesa&#x27;s environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought. The region&#x27;s bimodal precipitation pattern, which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter, began to fail post-1250. After 1260, there was a rapid depopulation of Mesa Verde, as &quot;tens of thousands of people&quot; emigrated or died from starvation. Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period. The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability, but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied, and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements. While drought, resource depletion, and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation, their overdependence on maize crops is considered the &quot;fatal flaw&quot; of their subsistence strategy.

The vacating Ancestral Pueblo people left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archaeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. An estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited. Many surviving emigrants may have relocated to southern Arizona and New Mexico. Although the rate of settlement is unclear, increases in sparsely populated areas, such as Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe, correspond directly with the period of migration from Mesa Verde. Archaeologists believe the Puebloans who settled in the areas near the Rio Grande, where Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery became widespread during the 14th century, were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders. Archaeologists view this migration as a continuation, versus a dissolution, of Ancestral Puebloan society and culture. Many others relocated to the banks of the Little Colorado River, in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona. While archaeologists tend to focus on the &quot;push&quot; factors that drove the Puebloans away from the region, there were also several environmental &quot;pull factors&quot;, such as warmer temperatures, better farming conditions, plentiful timber, and bison herds, which incentivized relocation to the area near the Rio Grande. In addition to numerous settlements along the Rio Grande, contemporary descendants of the Puebloans live in pueblos at Acoma, Zuni, Jemez, and Laguna.

====Organization====
Although Chaco Canyon might have exerted regional control over Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, most archaeologists view the Mesa Verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure. Several ancient roads, averaging wide and lined with earthen berms, have been identified in the region. Most appear to connect communities and shrines; others encircle great house sites. The extent of the network is unclear, but no roads have been discovered leading to the Chacoan Great North Road, or directly connecting Mesa Verde and Chacoan sites.

Ancestral Puebloan shrines, called &quot;herraduras&quot;, have been identified near road segments in the region. Their purpose is unclear, but several C-shaped herraduras have been excavated, and they are thought to have been &quot;directional shrines&quot; used to indicate the location of great houses.

====Architecture====
Mesa Verde is best known for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.

Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in &quot;U,&quot; &quot;E&quot; and &quot;L&quot; shapes. The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts. Pottery became more versatile, including pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams, also emerged during this period.
Styles for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chacoan system. Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style or spiritual significance rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.

While much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.

====Astronomy====

The Pueblo people used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along the path of the sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde&#x27;s Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.

The temple is D-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east–west. Its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the winter solstice, which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.

====Agriculture and water-control systems====
Starting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central Mesa Verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination of corn and beans provided the Puebloans with the amino acids of a complete protein. When conditions were good, of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Puebloans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun. Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil, but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as legumes add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields.

Most Pueblo people practiced dry farming, which relied on rain to water their crops, but others utilized runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe that prior to the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as the Pueblo moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community.

Between 750 and 800, Puebloans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms – the Morefield and Box Elder reservoirs. Soon afterward, work began on two more: the Far View and Sagebrush reservoirs, which were approximately across and constructed on the mesa top. The reservoirs lie on an east–west line that runs for approximately , which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. In 2004, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated these four structures as National Civil Engineering Historic Landmarks. A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the Far View Reservoir. This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture.

====Hunting and foraging====

Puebloans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their main sources of animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area&#x27;s rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.

Puebloans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Puebloans often buried their dead in these mounds.

====Pottery====
Scholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or introduced from the south. Specimens of shallow, unfired clay bowls found at Canyon de Chelly indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the Mogollon Rim area to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the common era. Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, CE. There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed igneous rock tempers from places like Ute Mountain were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them.

Neutron activation analysis indicates that much of the black-on-white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally. Cretaceous clays from both the Dakota and Menefee Formations were used in black-on-white wares, and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars. Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters, or they might have shared a common source of raw materials. The Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery was produced at three locations: Sand Canyon, Castle Rock, and Mesa Verde. Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter. Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood. Their sizes vary, but the larger ones were up to long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families. Designs were added to ceramic vessels with a Yucca-leaf brush and paints made from iron, manganese, beeplant, and tansy mustard.

Most of the pottery found in 9th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular gray wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.

====Rock art and murals====

Rock art is found throughout the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river&#x27;s importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region&#x27;s population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Pueblonian rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde&#x27;s Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.

Starting during the late Pueblo II period (1020) and continuing through Pueblo III (1300), the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde region created plaster murals in their great houses, particularly in their kivas. The murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals, people, and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as Basketmaker III, . Others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape. The murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room. Geometric patterns that resemble symbols used in pottery and zigzag that represent stitches used in basket making are common motifs. The painted murals include the colors red, green, yellow, white, brown, and blue. The designs were still in use by the Hopi during the 15th and 16th centuries.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Mesa Verde National Park has a dry-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dsa&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Mesa Verde National Park Headquarters at 6952 ft (2119 m) elevation is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −0.1 °F (−17.8 °C).

The region&#x27;s precipitation pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. Water for farming and consumption was provided by summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5 °C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced the amount of water needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was 10 to 20 °F (5–10 °C) warmer in the canyon alcoves than on the top of the mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.

==Anthropogenic ecology and geography==
Anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might indicate that Pueblonian subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, with the exception of invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Mesa Verde National Park has a Juniper/Pinyon (&quot;23&quot;) potential vegetation type with a Great Basin montane forest /Southwest Forest (&quot;4&quot;) potential vegetation form.

Mesa Verde&#x27;s canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area. This resulted in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about , the highest elevation at Park Point. The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the Rocky Mountains.

==Geology==
Although the area&#x27;s first Spanish explorers named the feature &quot;Mesa Verde&quot;, the term is a misnomer, as true mesas are almost perfectly flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park is made up of several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde&#x27;s slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area&#x27;s cliff dwellings.

In the late Cretaceous Period, the Mancos Shale was deposited on top of the Dakota Sandstone, which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado. The beds of the Mancos Shale are &quot;fine-grained sand-stones, mudstones, and shales&quot; which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea. It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain. On top of this shale, there are three formations in the Mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time. The first is the Point Lookout Sandstone, which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park (elevation ). This sandstone, which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding, is &quot;massive, fine-grained, cross-bedded, and very resistant&quot;, in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation. Its sediments are approximately thick, and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates.

Next is the Menefee Formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.

The Cliff House Sandstone is the area&#x27;s youngest rock layer. It was formed after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.

Continuing through the Cretaceous period and into the early Tertiary, there was uplifting in the area of the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.

==Rediscovery==
Mexican-Spanish missionaries and explorers Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, seeking a route from Santa Fe to California, faithfully recorded their travels in 1776. They reached Mesa Verde (&quot;green plateau&quot;) region, which they named after its high, tree-covered plateaus, but they never got close enough, or into the needed angle, to see the ancient stone villages. They were the first Europeans to travel the route through much of the Colorado Plateau into Utah and back through Arizona to New Mexico.

The Mesa Verde region has long been occupied by the Utes, and an 1868 treaty between them and the United States government recognized Ute ownership of all Colorado land west of the Continental Divide. After there had become an interest in land in western Colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north. Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land. The Ute wintered found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde. Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings.

Occasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, John Moss, making his observations known in 1873. The following year, Moss led eminent photographer William Henry Jackson through Mancos Canyon, at the base of Mesa Verde. There, Jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling. Geologist William H. Holmes retraced Jackson&#x27;s route in 1875. Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the Hayden Survey, one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West. These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archaeological sites.

In her quest to find Ancestral Puebloan settlements, Virginia McClurg, a journalist for the &quot;New York Daily Graphic&quot;, visited Mesa Verde in 1882 and 1885. Her party rediscovered Echo Cliff House, Three Tier House, and Balcony House in 1885; these trips inspired her to protect the dwellings and artifacts.

===Wetherills===
A family of cattle ranchers, the Wetherills, befriended members of the Ute tribe near their ranch southwest of Mancos, Colorado. With the Ute tribe&#x27;s approval, the Wetherills were allowed to bring cattle into the lower, warmer plateaus of the present Ute reservation during winter. Word of the Ancestral Puebloan great houses had spread, and Acowitz, a member of the Ute tribe, told the Wetherills of a special cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde: &quot;Deep in that canyon and near its head are many houses of the old people – the Ancient Ones. One of those houses, high, high in the rocks, is bigger than all the others. Utes never go there, it is a sacred place.&quot;

On December 18, 1888, Richard Wetherill and cowboy Charlie Mason rediscovered Cliff Palace after spotting the ruins from the top of Mesa Verde. Wetherill gave the ruin its present-day name. Richard Wetherill, family and friends explored the ruins and gathered artifacts, some of which they sold to the Historical Society of Colorado and much of which they kept. Among the people who stayed with the Wetherills and explored the cliff dwellings was mountaineer, photographer, and author Frederick H. Chapin, who visited the region during 1889 and 1890. He described the landscape and ruins in an 1890 article and later in an 1892 book, &quot;The Land of the Cliff-Dwellers&quot;, which he illustrated with hand-drawn maps and personal photographs.

===Gustaf Nordenskiöld===

The Wetherills also hosted Gustaf Nordenskiöld, the son of polar explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, in 1891. Nordenskiöld was a trained mineralogist who introduced scientific methods to artifact collection, recorded locations, photographed extensively, diagrammed sites, and correlated what he observed with existing archaeological literature as well as the home-grown expertise of the Wetherills. He removed many artifacts and sent them to Sweden, where they eventually went to the National Museum of Finland. Nordenskiöld published, in 1893, &quot;The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde&quot;. When Nordenskiöld shipped the collection that he made of Mesa Verde artifacts, the event initiated concerns about the need to protect Mesa Verde land and its resources.

==National park==
In 1889, Goodman Point Pueblo became the first pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Mesa Verde region to gain federal protection. It was the first such site to be protected in the US. Virginia McClurg was diligent in her efforts between 1887 and 1906 to inform the United States and European community of the importance of protecting the important historical material and dwellings in Mesa Verde. Her efforts included enlisting support from 250,000 women through the Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, writing and having published poems in popular magazines, giving speeches domestically and internationally, and forming the Colorado Cliff Dwellers Association.

The Colorado Cliff Dwellers&#x27; purpose was to protect the resources of Colorado cliff dwellings, reclaiming as much of the original artifacts as possible and sharing information about the people who dwelt there. A fellow activist for protection of Mesa Verde and prehistoric archaeological sites included Lucy Peabody, who, located in Washington, D.C., met with members of Congress to further the cause. Former Mesa Verde National Park superintendent Robert Heyder communicated his belief that the park might have been far more significant with the hundreds of artifacts taken by Nordenskiöld.


By the end of the 19th century, it was clear that Mesa Verde needed protection from people in general who came to Mesa Verde and created or sold their own collection of artifacts. In a report to the Secretary of the Interior, Smithsonian Institution Ethnologist Jesse Walter Fewkes described vandalism at Mesa Verde&#x27;s Cliff Palace:
Many artifacts from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the US and across the world. A representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, is now in the British Museum in London. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt approved creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906. The park was an effort to &quot;preserve the works of man&quot; and was the first park created to protect a location of cultural significance. The park was named with the Spanish term for &quot;green table&quot; because of its forests of juniper and piñon trees.

In 1976, was designated a wilderness area. These three small and separate sections of the National Park are located on the steep north and east boundaries and serve as buffers to further protect the significant Native American sites. Unlike most wilderness areas, visitor access to Mesa Verde Wilderness is prohibited, along with the rest of the park&#x27;s backcountry.

===Excavation and protection===
Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of the early efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, starting in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.

In 1966, as with all historical areas administered by the National Park Service, Mesa Verde was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1987, the Mesa Verde Administrative District was listed on the register. It was designated a World Heritage Site in 1978. In its 2015 travel awards, &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine named Mesa Verde National Park &quot;the best cultural attraction&quot; in the Western United States.

=== Conflicts with local tribes ===
Clashes between non-Indigenous environmentalists and local tribes surrounding the ruins at Mesa Verde began even before the park&#x27;s official establishment. Conflicts over who laid claim to the land surrounding the ruins came to fruition in 1911, when the US government wanted to secure more land for the park that was owned by the Ute Indians. The Utes were reluctant to agree to the land swap proposed by the government, noting that the land they were seeking was the best land the tribe owned. Frederick Abbott, working with Indian Office official James McLaughlin, proclaimed to be an ally to the Ute in negotiations. Abbott later claimed that the &quot;government was stronger than the Utes&quot;, saying that when the government finds &quot;old ruins on land that it wants to take for public purposes, it has the right to take it&quot;. Feeling they were left with no other options, the Utes reluctantly agreed to trade the on Chapin Mesa for on Ute Mountain.

The Utes continued to battle the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prevent more Ute land from being incorporated into the park. In 1935, the BIA attempted to gain back some the land traded in 1911. Additionally, superintendent Jesse L. Nusbaum later confessed that the Ute Mountain land traded for Chapin Mesa in 1911 belonged to the tribe anyway, meaning the government had traded land that never belonged to them in the first place.

Other issues unrelated to land disputes emerged as a result of park activities. In the 1920s, the park began offering &quot;Indian ceremony&quot; performances that gained popularity among visiting tourists; however, the ceremonies did not actually reflect the rites of the Ancient Puebloans who lived in the cliff dwellings nor the rites of the modern Ute. Navajo day laborers performed these rituals, resulting in &quot;the wrong Indians doing the wrong dance on... the wrong land&quot;. In addition to the inaccuracy of the ceremonies, a question of whether Navajo dancers were paid fairly also resulted in questions regarding the lack of local American Indians being employed in other capacities in the park. Additionally, the park offered little financial benefits to the Ute Mountain Ute despite their land swap making much of the park possible.

===Services===
The entrance to Mesa Verde National Park is on U.S. Route 160, approximately east of the community of Cortez and west of Mancos, Colorado. The park covers It contains 4,372 documented sites, including more than 600 cliff dwellings. It is the largest archaeological preserve in the US. It protects some of the most important and best-preserved archaeological sites in the country. The park initiated the Archaeological Site Conservation Program in 1995. It analyses data pertaining to how sites are constructed and utilized.

The Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center is located just off of Highway 160 and is before the park entrance booths. The Visitor and Research Center opened in December 2012. Chapin Mesa (the most popular area) is beyond the visitor center. Mesa Verde National Park is an area of federal exclusive jurisdiction. Because of this all law enforcement, emergency medical service, and wildland/structural fire duties are conducted by federal National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers. The Mesa Verde National Park Post Office has the ZIP code 81330. Access to park facilities vary by season. Three of the cliff dwellings on Chapin Mesa are open to the public. The Chapin Mesa Museum is open all year. Spruce Tree House is closed due to rock fall danger. Balcony House, Long House and Cliff Palace require tour tickets for ranger-guided tours. Many other dwellings are visible from the road but not open to tourists. The park offers hiking trails, a campground, and, during peak season, facilities for food, fuel, and lodging; these are unavailable in the winter.

The park&#x27;s early administrative buildings, located on Chapin Mesa, form an architecturally significant complex of buildings. Built in the 1920s, the Mesa Verde administrative complex was one of the first examples of the Park Service using culturally appropriate design in the development of park facilities. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1987.

===Wildfires and culturally modified trees===
During the years 1996 to 2003, the park suffered from several wildfires. The fires, many of which were started by lightning during times of drought, burned of forest, more than half the park. The fires also damaged many archaeological sites and park buildings. They were named: Chapin V (1996), Bircher and Pony (2000), Long Mesa (2002), and the Balcony House Complex fires (2003), which were five fires that began on the same day. The Chapin V and Pony fires destroyed two rock art sites, and the Long Mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum – the first one ever built in the National Park System – and Spruce Tree House, the third largest cliff dwelling in the park.

Prior to the fires of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed – most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7 million () budget into a culturally modified trees project in the national park.

===Ute Mountain Tribal Park===

The Ute Mountain Tribal Park, adjoining Mesa Verde National Park to the east of the mountains, is approximately along the Mancos River. Hundreds of surface sites, cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and wall paintings of Ancestral Puebloan and Ute cultures are preserved in the park. Native American Ute tour guides provide background information about the people, culture, and history of the park lands. &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; chose it as one of &quot;80 World Destinations for Travel in the 21st Century&quot;, one of only nine places selected in the US.

==Key sites==
In addition to the cliff dwellings, Mesa Verde boasts a number of mesa-top ruins. Examples open to public access include the Far View Complex and Cedar Tree Tower on Chapin Mesa, and Badger House Community, on Wetherill Mesa.

===Balcony House===
Balcony House is set on a high ledge facing east. Its 45 rooms and 2 kivas would have been cold during the winter. Visitors on ranger-guided tours enter by climbing a ladder and crawling through a small tunnel. The exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village easy to defend and secure. One log was dated at 1278, so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area. It was officially excavated in 1910 by Jesse L. Nusbaum, who was the first National Park Service Archeologist and one of the first Superintendents of Mesa Verde National Park. Visitors can enter Balcony House only through a ranger-guided tour, which involves numerous ladders up the cliff face and crawling through a small tunnel.

===Cliff Palace===
This multi-storied ruin, the best-known cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, is located in the largest alcove in the center of the Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.
===Long House===

Located on the Wetherill Mesa, Long House is the second-largest Pueblonian village; approximately 150 people lived there. The location was excavated from 1959 through 1961, as part of the Wetherhill Mesa Archaeological Project. Long House was built ; it was occupied until 1280. The cliff dwelling features 150 rooms, a kiva, a tower, and a central plaza. Its rooms are not clustered like typical cliff dwellings. Stones were used without shaping for fit and stability. Two overhead ledges contain storage space for grain. One ledge seems to include an overlook with small holes in the wall to see the rest of the village below. A spring is accessible within several hundred feet, and seeps are located in the rear of the village.

===Mug, Oak Tree, Spruce Tree, and Square Tower houses===
Mug House is located on Wetherill Mesa; it contains 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. 
Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. 
Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum.
The Square Tower House is one of the stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.

<text>Robert Joseph Vila (born June 20, 1946) is an American home improvement television show host known for &quot;This Old House&quot; (1979–1989), &quot;Bob Vila&#x27;s Home Again&quot; (1990–2005), and &quot;Bob Vila&quot; (2005–2007).

==Early life and education==
Vila, a Cuban-American, is a native of Miami, Florida. When Vila was a child, his father built the family home by hand. Vila graduated from Miami Jackson High School and studied journalism at the University of Florida. After graduating in 1969, he served as a volunteer in the Peace Corps, working in Panama in the late 1960s. He then went to Europe for two years to study and travel, before returning to the US and enrolling at the Boston Architectural Center.

==Career==
Vila was hired as the host of &quot;This Old House&quot; in 1979, after receiving the “Heritage House of 1978” award by &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;, for his restoration of a Victorian Italianate house in Newton, Massachusetts. On &quot;This Old House&quot;, Vila appeared with carpenter Norm Abram as they, and others, renovated houses. In 1989, he left the show following a disagreement arising from his involvement with outside commercial endorsements for New Jersey–based Rickel Home Centers, and the subsequent retaliatory pulling of underwriting by Rickel&#x27;s competitor, Home Depot, and lumber supplier Weyerhaeuser. He was replaced by Steve Thomas.

After leaving &quot;This Old House&quot;, Vila began hosting &quot;Bob Vila&#x27;s Home Again&quot; (renamed to simply &quot;Bob Vila&quot; in 2005), a weekly syndicated home-improvement program. His series ran for 16 seasons in syndication before it was canceled by distributor CBS Television Distribution due to declining ratings; the series remains in reruns and on the PlutoTV streaming service. His relationship with Rickel was also short lived, as he was signed to an endorsement deal with Sears in 1990 to pitch their line of Craftsman tools; the relationship ended acrimoniously in 2006 following a lawsuit settlement.

Vila also appeared on three episodes of the situation comedy &quot;Home Improvement&quot; during 1992 and 1993 as himself on &quot;Tool Time&quot;, the fictional show within the sitcom, where main character and cable TV host Tim Taylor (played by Tim Allen) saw him as a rival, and made futile attempts to outdo Vila. Contrary to &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, when Allen was interviewed by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and asked if he could make a video game, Allen proposed one about aspects of carpentry, and the end scene would be the player being featured on &quot;Bob Vila&#x27;s Home Again&quot;.

Vila made a cameo in the 1993 comedy spoof &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;.

Vila has written 10 books, including a five-book series titled &quot;Bob Vila&#x27;s Guide to Historic Homes of America&quot;.

Vila has appeared on the Home Shopping Network selling a range of tools under his own name brand that he founded in 2016.

==Other productions==
Bob Vila&#x27;s less widely known productions include: &quot;Guide to Historic Homes of America&quot; (1996), &quot;In Search of Palladio&quot; (1996) for A&amp;E, and &quot;Restore America&quot; for HGTV.

===&quot;Guide to Historic Homes of America&quot;===
The &quot;Guide to Historic Homes of America&quot; (1996) included two-hour segments on each of four major regions of the United States: the Northeast (including New England and the Mid-Atlantic States), the South, the Midwest, and the West.

==== &quot;The Northeast&quot; ====
* Morris–Jumel Mansion overlooking the Polo Grounds in Washington Heights, Manhattan.
* Dyckman House on Broadway in Upper Manhattan.
* Hancock Shaker Village in western Massachusetts.
* Strawbery Banke restoration in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
* Olana — “a palatial amalgam of Middle Eastern and European influences.”

==== &quot;The Mid-Atlantic States&quot; ====
* Chesapeake Bay and Annapolis, Maryland — William Paca House and Hammond–Harwood House.
* New Castle, Delaware — George Read, Jr. House, built by the son of George Read.
* Baltimore, Maryland — Homewood House on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus.
* Washington, D.C. — Decatur House on President&#x27;s Park and Tudor Place in Georgetown.

==== &quot;The South&quot; ====

* Thomas Jefferson
** University of Virginia — ten residential pavilions surround the great, terraced Lawn.
** Ash Lawn–Highland.
** Poplar Forest — octagonal house filmed while undergoing complete restoration.
** Monticello — includes Dome Room at top of building (not open to the public) and Honeymoon Cottage.
* Natchez, Mississippi
** House on Endicott Hill — early trader&#x27;s house.

* Texarkana, Texas — the Ace of Clubs House.

==== &quot;The Midwest and West&quot; ====
* Ellwood House — built by barbed wire entrepreneur Isaac L. Ellwood in DeKalb, Illinois.
* Frank Lloyd Wright
** Dana-Thomas House — Prairie School style home in Springfield, Illinois. Quoted as being “richer in detail than any other Wright home.”

* Filoli — Georgian home designed by Willis Polk; located in Woodside, California on the eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
* Tor House — stone house and tower overlooking the Pacific Ocean at Carmel-by-the-Sea, California; built by Robinson Jeffers.

===&quot;In Search of Palladio&quot;===
&quot;In Search of Palladio&quot; (1996) was a three-part, six-hour study of the work and lasting influence of the 16th-century architect Andrea Palladio. Palladio designed various types of buildings, but the series concentrates on his domestic architecture. (see also: Palladian Villas of the Veneto).

==== I. &quot;Villas of the Veneto&quot; ====
* Villa Giustinian, Roncade → For Vila, this building (not by Palladio) provided the context for Palladio&#x27;s innovative thinking—gothic battlements, portcullis, and stone walls that concealed a Renaissance palace and farm buildings.
* Villa Pisani in Montagnana → a descendant of the original owners served as Vila&#x27;s guide.
* Villa Cornaro → A suburban villa on a town street, a palatial residence which was also an on-site place of business for running a large farming enterprise.
* Villa Barbaro.
* Villa Emo – For Vila this is &quot;perhaps the most dramatic farmhouse ever built&quot;.
* La Rocca Pisana – spectacular hilltop belvedere by Palladio&#x27;s pupil Vincenzo Scamozzi.

;II. &quot;The Palladians in England and Ireland&quot;
* London: Chiswick House, Marble Hill House and Stourhead.
* Bath, Somerset: Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent.
* Ireland: Casino at Marino – &quot;the architectural equivalent of a Fabergé egg&quot;.
* Northern Ireland: Castle Ward – overlooking Strangford Lough with both Palladian and Gothic facades and interiors.

;III. &quot;The Palladian Legacy in America&quot;
* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Mount Pleasant.
* Marblehead and Waltham, Massachusetts: Jeremiah Lee Mansion and Gore Place
* Hudson Valley, New York: Boscobel House Museum – purchased in 1955 for thirty-five dollars. Meticulously restored, situated on a bluff on the east bank of the Hudson River opposite the United States Military Academy at West Point.
* Hartford, Connecticut: Austin House – built for Wadsworth Atheneum director Arthur Everett Austin, Jr.
* South Bend, Indiana. In Indiana Vila looks at University of Notre Dame architectural school &quot;where Palladio and classical architecture are taken seriously indeed&quot;, Vitruvian House designed by Thomas Gordon Smith and Villa Indiana designed by Duncan G. Stroik.

===&quot;Restore America&quot;===
&quot;Restore America&quot; consisted of 50 one-hour segments which explored historic preservation and building restoration in each of the fifty U.S. states. Anticipating the turn of the 3rd millennium, it was first broadcast on HGTV between July 4, 1999, and July 4, 2000.

<text>The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee (NOC) and the National Paralympic Committee for the United States. It was founded in 1895 and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The USOPC is one of only four NOCs in the world that also serve as the National Paralympic Committee for their country. The USOPC is responsible for supporting, entering and overseeing U.S. teams for the Olympic Games, Paralympic Games, Youth Olympic Games, Pan American Games, Parapan American Games and Junior Pan American Games and serves as the steward of the Olympic and Paralympic Movements in the United States.

The Olympic Movement is overseen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC is supported by 35 international federations that govern each sport on a global level and the 207 National Olympic Committees that oversee Olympic sport as a whole in their respective nations, and national federations that administer each sport at the national level (called National Governing Bodies, or NGBs, in the United States). The National Paralympic Committee is the sole governing body responsible for the selection and training of all athletes participating in the Paralympic Games.

The USOPC is one of 207 NOCs and 176 NPCs within the international Olympic and Paralympic movements. Forty-seven NGBs are members of the USOPC. Fifteen of the NGBs also manage sports on the Paralympic program (there are fewer Paralympic sports in the world). While the USOPC governs four Paralympic sports (cycling, skiing, swimming, and track &amp; field), five other Paralympic sports are governed by U.S. members of International Paralympic Federations (wheelchair basketball, boccia, goalball, powerlifting, and wheelchair rugby).

Unlike most other nations, the United States government does not have a Ministry of Sports and does not fund its Olympic Committee. This is in part due to the taboo of mixing sports and politics in the U.S. The USOPC was reorganized by the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, originally enacted in 1978. It is a federally chartered nonprofit corporation and does not receive federal financial support (other than for select Paralympic military programs). Pursuant to the Act, the USOPC has the exclusive right to use and authorize the use of Olympic-related marks, images and terminology in the United States. The USOPC licenses that right to sponsors as a means of generating revenue in support of its mission.

Founded as the American Olympic Committee (AOC) and having been known since the 1960s as the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the organization changed its name to the USOPC changed on June 20, 2019, becoming the first Olympic Committee in the world to include the word &quot;Paralympic&quot; in its name.

==History==


Upon the founding of the International Olympic Committee in 1894, the two American IOC members – James Edward Sullivan and William Milligan Sloane – formed a committee to organize the participation of American athletes in the 1896 Summer Olympics, in Athens, Greece. In 1921, the committee adopted a constitution and bylaws to formally organize the American Olympic Association.

From 1928 to 1953, its president was Avery Brundage, who later went on to become the president of the IOC, the only American to do so.

In 1940, the AOA changed its name to the United States of America Sports Federation and, in 1945, changed it again to the United States Olympic Association. In 1950, federal mandate allowed the USOA to solicit tax-deductible contributions as a private, non-profit corporation. After several constitutional revisions were made to the federal charter in 1961, the name was changed to the United States Olympic Committee.

The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (later renamed in the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act) established the USOPC, then referred to as the USOC (United States Olympic Committee), as the coordinating body for all Olympic-related athletic activity in the United States, specifically relating to international competition. The USOPC was also given the responsibility of promoting and supporting physical fitness and public participation in athletic activities by encouraging developmental programs in its member organizations. The provisions protect individual athletes, and provide the USOPC&#x27;s counsel and authority to oversee Olympic and Paralympic business in the United States.

The public law not only protects the trademarks of the IOC and USOPC, but also gives the USOPC exclusive rights to the words &quot;Olympic&quot;, &quot;Olympiad&quot; and &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot;, as well as commercial use of Olympic and Paralympic marks and terminology in the United States, excluding Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which fall under the authority of separate NOCs and NPCs.

One of the many revolutionary elements contained within the legislation was the Paralympic Amendment – an initiative that fully integrated the Paralympic Movement into the USOPC by Congressional mandate in 1998.

U.S. Paralympics, a division of the USOPC, was founded in 2001. In addition to selecting and managing the teams which compete for the United States in the Paralympic Games, U.S. Paralympics is also responsible for supporting Paralympic community and military sports programs around the country. In 2006, the USOPC created the Paralympic Military Program with the goal of providing Paralympic sports as a part of the rehabilitation process for injured soldiers. Through the U.S. Olympic Committee Paralympic Military Program, USOPC hosted the Warrior Games for wounded service personnel from 2010 to 2014, until the organization of the event was taken on by the Department of Defense in 2015.

The USOPC moved its headquarters from New York City to Colorado Springs on July 1, 1978. The USOPC headquarters moved to its present location in downtown Colorado Springs in April 2010, while the previous site – located just 2 miles (3 km) away – remains a U.S. Olympic Training Center.

In October 2007, the ARCO Training Center in Chula Vista, California (see below) was closed temporarily due to the Harris Fire, one of many that ravaged southern California.

After convening in 2010 the Working Group for Safe Training Environments, the USOPC formed the Safe Sport program to address child sexual abuse, bullying, hazing and harassment and emotional, physical and sexual misconduct within its domain.

In February 2011, the USOPC launched an anti-steroid campaign in conjunction with the Ad Council called &quot;Play Asterisk Free&quot; aimed at teens. The campaign first launched in 2008 under the name &quot;Don&#x27;t Be An Asterisk&quot;.

The state-of-the-art United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Museum was officially opened in Colorado Springs on July 30, 2020.

The USOPC remains one of the only National Olympic Committees in the world to receive no government funding.

==Governance==
The USOPC is governed by a 16-member board of directors, led by a chairman, and has a professional staff, headed by a CEO. The USOPC also has three constituent councils to serve as sources of opinion and advice to the board and USOPC staff, including the Athletes&#x27; Advisory Council (AAC), National Governing Bodies Council (NGBC), and Multi-Sport Organizations Council. The AAC and NGBC each have three representatives on the board, while six members of the board are independent. The USOPC CEO and all US members of the IOC and IPC (Anita DeFrantz, James Easton, and Angela Ruggiero) are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the board.

The USOPC named Scott Blackmun CEO on January 6, 2010. Blackmun previously served as acting chief executive officer (2001), senior managing director of sport (2000), and general counsel (1999). He also serves on the IOC&#x27;s Marketing Commission and on the board of the National Foundation for Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition. He retired in 2018 and was replaced by Sarah Hirshland.

On October 2, 2008, Lawrence F. Probst III was elected chairman of the USOPC board of directors. Probst also serves on the IOC&#x27;s International Relations Commission, a post he assumed by IOC appointment on March 10, 2011. Probst retired in 2019 and was replaced by Susanne Lyons.



==National Governing Body members==
National Governing Bodies are organizations that look after all aspects of their individual sports. The NGBs are responsible for the training, competition and development of athletes for their sports, as well as nominating athletes to the U.S. Olympic, Paralympic, Youth Olympic, Pan American, and Para-Pan American Teams. There are currently 39 Olympic summer sport NGBs in the United States and eight Olympic winter sport NGBs. Sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing were added to the Olympic roster of sports for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Some Olympic sports are not featured in the Paralympics, that is why there are more solely Olympic NGBs rather than those that manage both Olympic and Paralympic divisions. Additionally, some Paralympic sports, like wheelchair basketball, boccia, goalball, powerlifting, and wheelchair rugby, are governed by U.S. members of International Paralympic Federations.

==Fundraising efforts==
The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation supported by American individuals and corporate sponsors. Unlike most other nations, the USOPC does not receive direct government funding for Olympic programs (except for select Paralympic military programs).

The USOPC&#x27;s main sources of revenue are television broadcast rights, sponsorships and philanthropy in the form of major gifts and direct mail income. Additional funding comes from the government for Paralympic programming, as well as other sources such as the city of Colorado Springs and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation.

The USOPC asks for contributions from time to time using public service announcements and other direct solicitations. Also, some proceeds from sales in its online store benefit the committee.

The USOPC currently does not hold telethons or other fundraising events, but has in the past.

==Criticism==
There has been some financial conflict between the USOPC and International Olympic Committee (IOC), with some pointing out the frequent leadership changes of USOPC, and USOPC trying to broadcast the Olympics using its own television network, which the IOC discouraged. USOPC president Peter Ueberroth allegedly stonewalled a negotiation between IOC and USOPC to discuss the revenue sharing of the US broadcasts with IOC. Under a long-standing contract, the USOPC has received a 20 percent share of global sponsorship revenue and a 12.75 percent cut of U.S. broadcast rights deals (not that much given the fact that the USOPC is the only NOC in the world not to receive government funding, other countries fund their Olympic Committees, plus more than a half of the Olympic global sponsors are American companies, but the USOPC received only 20% (not 50%) of sponsorship revenue). The IOC believed the USOPC share, set out in an open-ended contract dating to 1996, was excessive and should be renegotiated. The USOPC argued that it saved the Olympic movement by hosting the most financially successful Games in the history of the Olympics in 1984. In the 1980s, after the disastrous and unprofitable 1976 and 1980 Olympics, many believed the Olympic movement was in decline. However, the U.S. hosted the most financially successful games without government funding (unlike Montreal 1976 and Moscow 1980) and revitalized the Olympic movement. The failure of the 2012 and 2016 US Olympic bids was partly blamed by some on USOPC. For instance, NBC television executive Dick Ebersol said after the failed 2016 bid, &quot;This was the IOC membership saying to the USOPC there will be no more domestic Olympics until you give more to the IOC&quot;. A new revenue-sharing agreement was signed in 2012.

USOPC has also been criticized for not providing equal funding to Paralympic athletes, compared to Olympic athletes. In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by American Paralympic athletes Tony Iniguez, Scot Hollonbeck and Jacob Heilveil. They alleged that the USOPC was underfunding American Paralympic athletes. Iniguez cited the fact that the USOPC made health care benefits available to a smaller percentage of Paralympians, provided smaller quarterly training stipends and paid smaller financial awards for medals won at the Paralympics. American Paralympians saw this as a disadvantage for Paralympic athletes, as nations such as Canada and the United Kingdom support Paralympians and Olympians virtually equally. The USOPC did not deny the discrepancy in funding, but contended that this was due to the fact that it did not receive any government financial support. As a result, it had to rely on revenue generated by the media exposure of its athletes. Olympic athletic success resulted in greater exposure for the USOPC than Paralympic athletic achievements. The case was heard by lower courts, who ruled that the USOPC has the right to allocate its finances to athletes at different rates. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, who on September 6, 2008, announced that it would not hear the appeal. However, during the time the lawsuit had lasted (from 2003 to 2008), the funding of Paralympic athletes more than tripled. In 2008, $11.4 million was earmarked for Paralympic athletes, up from $3 million in 2004. In 2018, the USOPC announced it would increase its Operation Gold Awards for U.S. Paralympic athletes to be equal to payments earned by U.S. Olympic athletes.

In 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that revealed that some 100 American athletes failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete; among those athletes were Carl Lewis, Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard. Before showing the documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case &quot;baseless&quot; as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.

Carl Lewis broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had failed tests for banned substances, but claiming he was just one of &quot;hundreds&quot; of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the 1988 Summer Olympics. Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. &quot;For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there&#x27;s absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete. You have to believe governing bodies are doing what they are supposed to do. And it is obvious they did not,&quot; said former American sprinter and 1984 Olympic champion, Evelyn Ashford.

Exum&#x27;s documents revealed that Carl Lewis had tested positive three times at the 1988 Olympics trials for minimum amounts of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, which were banned stimulants. Bronchodilators are also found in cold medication. Due to the rules, his case could have led to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and suspension from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;Ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason. The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot; Following Exum&#x27;s revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. Additionally, in 1988 the federation reviewed the relevant documents with the athletes&#x27; names undisclosed and stated that &quot;the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as &#x27;negative cases&#x27; in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken&quot;.

In the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics, it was discovered that the American uniforms for the Games&#x27; opening and closing ceremonies, designed by Ralph Lauren, were manufactured in China. This sparked criticism of the USOPC from media pundits, the public and members of Congress.

In 2018, the USOPC came under fire for its complicity in the sexual assault and abuse of women and girls at the hands of former USA Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar. Olympian Aly Raisman released a public statement accusing the committee of failing &quot;to acknowledge its role in this mess.&quot; In the wake of Nasar&#x27;s convictions, more than 150 lawsuits are pending against people and institutions related to the case, including the USOPC. In May 2018, the USOPC was accused of knowingly participating in sex trafficking in a class-action lawsuit. In response, the committee said it was &quot;aggressively exploring and implementing new ways to enhance athlete safety&quot;.

==Training facilities==

The USOPC operates Olympic Training Centers at which aspiring Olympians prepare for international competition:
*The main facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, offers both summer and winter sports training in a variety of sports. It houses the USOPC headquarters and many permanent athletic venues.
*The U.S. Olympic Center in Lake Placid, New York, is a facility for winter sports athletes. Permanent facilities include an ice hockey/figure skating arena, a bobsled run, and a luge run.

Although catered toward elite athlete training, these complexes are also open to the public (the only Olympic training facilities in the world to be open to the public) and offer a variety of services, including tours and regular camps and competitions for various domestic and international sport programs.

Additionally, the USOPC partners with 16 elite training sites across the country, to provide U.S. athletes with Olympic-caliber facilities that positively impact performance. Facilities with U.S. Olympic training site designation have invested millions of dollars in operating, staffing, equipment and training costs. These sites are often selected to host U.S. Olympic Team Trials and support Team USA athletes prepare for the Olympic Games.

==Awards==
The USOPC administers a number of awards and honors for individuals and teams who have significant achievements in Olympic and Paralympic sports, or who have made contributions to the Olympic and Paralympic movement in the U.S.

*USOPC Athlete of the Year – Awards are given annually to the top overall male athlete, female athlete, Paralympic athlete, and team, from among the USOPC&#x27;s member organizations.
*USOPC Coach of the Year – Awards are given annually to the top national, developmental, Paralympic, and volunteer coaches, and for achievement in sports science.
*U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame – The Hall of Fame honors Olympic and Paralympic athletes, teams, coaches, and others who have demonstrated extraordinary service to the U.S. Olympic movement.
*U.S. Olympic Spirit Award – This award is given biennially to athletes demonstrating spirit, courage, and achievement at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
*Jack Kelly Fair Play Award – Presented annually to an athlete, coach or official in recognition of an outstanding act of fair play and sportsmanship displayed during the past year. 
*Rings of Gold Award – Awards are presented annually in honor of an individual and a program dedicated to helping children develop their Olympic or Paralympic dreams and reach their highest athletic and personal potential. 
*Olympic Torch Award – Presented annually to an individual who has positively impacted the Olympic Movement and has contributed to promoting the Olympic Ideals throughout the U.S.

When a US athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze. The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017. These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal. Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians. The International Paralympic Committee noted that &quot;&#x27;Operation Gold Awards&#x27; for [American] Paralympic athletes [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.&quot;

==Partnerships==
The USOPC generates support from two principal types of Olympic sponsorship: worldwide and domestic. Each level of sponsorship grants companies different marketing rights and offers exclusive use of designated Olympic and Team USA images and marks. Under the domestic sponsorship program, the USOPC also has special partnerships with various licensees, suppliers and outfitters that provide vital services and products to support Team USA. Across all levels of sponsorship, the USOPC is committed to preserving the values of the Olympic properties and protecting the exclusive rights of Olympic sponsors.

===Worldwide===
Created by the International Olympic Committee in 1985, the Olympic Partners TOP program is the highest level of Olympic sponsorship, granting exclusive worldwide marketing rights to the Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games. Managed by the IOC, the TOP program supports the OCOGs, NOCs and the IOC.

Operating on a four-year term in line with each Olympic quadrennium, the TOP program features approximately 10 worldwide Olympic Partners, with each receiving exclusive global marketing rights within a designated product or service category.

===US Domestic===
The Olympic Games domestic sponsorship program grants marketing rights within the host country or territory only. Under the direction of the IOC, the USOPC manages the domestic program within the United States. Like the worldwide TOP program, the domestic sponsorship program operates on the principle of product-category exclusivity. Approximately 20 corporations currently participate in the U.S. domestic sponsorship program, which enables the USOPC to deliver increased funding and equitable distribution to National Governing Bodies. The establishment of these long-term domestic partnerships helps generate independent financial stability for American athletes while ensuring the viability of the Team USA on the international stage.

===Licensees===
The USOPC has granted licensing rights to nearly three dozen companies to manufacture and distribute official licensed products, which convey the rich history of American culture and commemorates the Olympic Movement. These companies are referred to as licensees and pay a royalty for each item sold bearing any related Olympic, USOPC or Team USA marks.

==Media coverage==
NBCUniversal has held the American broadcasting rights of the Summer Olympics since 1988, and the broadcasting rights of the Winter Olympics since 2002. In 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38 billion contract with the International Olympic Committee to broadcast the 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 Games. On May 7, 2014, NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract with the IOC to broadcast the 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032 Games. As such, NBC Olympics is the IOC&#x27;s, and by extension the Olympic movement&#x27;s, highest revenue stream. The IOC distributes Olympic broadcast revenue through Olympic Solidarity – the body responsible for managing and administering the share of the television rights of the Olympic Games. Under the current format, the revenue is allocated to the NOCs – including the USOPC – the local organizing committee and International Federations.

In 2009, the USOPC and Comcast announced plans for The U.S. Olympic Network, which would have aired Olympic-sports events, news, and classic footage. However, the USOPC met opposition from the International Olympic Committee, which preferred to deal with NBCU (and its then-new Universal Sports joint venture). Later, Comcast purchased NBCUniversal, and eventually Universal Sports was discontinued, with interim programming agreements to air events on NBCSN and Universal HD made. On July 1, 2017, NBCUniversal launched the Olympic Channel on the former channel space of Universal HD; the USOPC is a partial operating partner in the network with the NBC Sports Group and it contains archived content from the USOPC.

==Relationship between IOC and USOPC==
In May 2012, USOPC&#x27;s leaders negotiated a resolution with the IOC, addressing a decades-long revenue sharing debate and paving the way for a peaceful future between the two bodies. The new agreement elevates the USOPC&#x27;s global perception and restructures how worldwide Olympic sponsorship and U.S. TV revenues are shared, while providing for USOPC contributions to Olympic Games costs.

The agreement, revising 27-year-old terms governing the USOPC&#x27;s shares of worldwide Olympic sponsorship and U.S. broadcast rights revenue, preserves the USOPC&#x27;s future revenue at current levels and includes an escalator for inflation. Under the terms of the new agreement, the USOPC is guaranteed seven percent of the U.S. broadcast revenue and 10 percent of the IOC&#x27;s global sponsorship revenue. The agreement guarantees the USOPC approximately $410 million per quadrennium, plus inflation and a percentage of revenue from new growth areas, beginning in 2020.

<doc id="287717" wikidata="Q2944925" url="?curid=287717" title="Canadian Hurricane Centre">
<text>The Canadian Hurricane Centre (CHC; ) is an organisation that monitors and warns of the threat of tropical cyclones such as hurricanes and tropical storms. CHC is a division of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC), which is in turn a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada. Founded in 1987, CHC provides guidance to MSC&#x27;s weather centres in eastern and Atlantic Canada, and is based in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CHC frequently consults with its United States counterpart, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, to coordinate the tracks and positions of storms that pose a threat to Canada.

==History==
1985&#x27;s Hurricane Gloria and its less-than-expected damage prompted Environment Canada to create the CHC due to confusion between information received from the US National Hurricane Centre and US media and on-the-ground information and observations. Its first hurricane warnings were issued in 2008 for Hurricane Kyle, which struck near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia on September 28, 2008, and quickly became extratropical while maintaining much of its strength into New Brunswick and Labrador.

==Duties==
The organization gathers information on tropical and post-tropical cyclones (systems in the process of becoming extratropical cyclones), predicts their evolution and assesses their potential impact on Canada. Their area of responsibility is bound by the Canada-United States border and extends into waters offshore Canada to . Like other hurricane centres, the Canadian Hurricane Centre makes presentations about tropical cyclones to schools, businesses, the media, and other governmental agencies. They also coordinate with the public concerning additional queries about hurricanes in Canada.

==Frequency==
While hurricanes are relatively uncommon in Canada, they do approach or strike from time to time. Recent occurrences include:
*Hurricane Bob, which struck Campobello Island, New Brunswick, in 1991.
*Hurricane Luis, which struck Newfoundland in September 1995. 
*Hurricane Hortense, which struck Nova Scotia in September 1996.
*Hurricane Michael, which struck Newfoundland in October 2000.
*Hurricane Juan, which struck Nova Scotia in September 2003.
*Hurricane Igor, which struck Newfoundland in September 2010.
*Hurricane Dorian, which struck Nova Scotia in September 2019.
*Hurricane Larry, which struck Newfoundland in September 2021.
*Hurricane Fiona which struck Nova Scotia in September 2022.
*Hurricane Lee, which struck Nova Scotia in September 2023.
Also of note due to its rarity and the damage caused is Hurricane Hazel which hit Toronto, Ontario in 1954, and remained a strong storm even after crossing over the U.S. East Coast.

<doc id="287723" wikidata="Q7829152" url="?curid=287723" title="Tourism in Hawaii">
<text>Hawaii is a U.S. state that is an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. Of the eight major islands, Hawaii, Oahu, Maui, and Kauai have major tourism industries. Tourism is limited on Molokai and Lānai, and access to Niihau and Kahoʻolawe is prohibited.

The state&#x27;s favorable climate, tropical landscape, beaches, and culture make it among the U.S.&#x27;s most visited states. In 2017 alone, according to state government data, there were over 9.4 million visitors to the Hawaiian Islands with expenditures of over $16 billion. Tourism comprises 21% of the state&#x27;s economy, with many of Hawaii&#x27;s largest industries revolving around the constant flow of tourists.

Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year. The summer months and major holidays are the most popular times for outsiders to visit, however, especially when residents of the rest of the United States are looking to escape from cold winter weather. The Japanese, with their economic and historical ties to Hawaii and the US as well as relative geographical proximity, make up the largest group of inbound international travelers to the islands, reaching 1,568,609 in 2017. 
==History of travel to Hawaii==

Hawaii was first populated between 1000 and 1200 AD by people of Polynesian origin. Subsequent Western contact began as a consequence of European Enlightenment exploration and was continued by Protestant ministers of New England origin in the early 19th century.

===16th century===
According to Hawaiian tradition, a vessel wrecked at Keʻei near Kealakekua Bay in the 1560s with only two survivors: the captain and his sister. Their penitent posture led to the naming of the place as Kūlou; they later intermarried with the native population and their descendants became prominent chiefs. The timing coincides with the voyage of a small fleet of three vessels commanded by Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón, who departed Mexico on October 31, 1569; during that voyage, two ships disappeared after a storm.
Spaniard Juan Gaetano, who had served as the pilot of a 1522 expedition led by Ruy López de Villalobos, reportedly discovered the Hawaiian Islands during that voyage. The official narrative of the voyage reported that a group of islands were found after approximately 30 days of sailing west from Mexico, which were named the &quot;Islas del Rey&quot;; these were later speculated to be the Caroline Islands or Marshall Islands, not Hawaii. The coordinates of Gaetano&#x27;s discovery were not reported outside the Spanish Empire until 1743, when a manuscript chart was captured from the annual treasure galleon by , commanded by Captain George Anson; although the latitude was approximately correct and the physical features were similar to the Hawaiian Islands, the longitude was 17° east of the actual position of Hawaii. The Spanish Hydrographical Department reported in 1865 that an ancient manuscript chart confirmed Gaetano&#x27;s discovery from 1555, which he had named &quot;Islas de Mesa&quot;. continues as to whether the Spanish visited the islands before James Cook.
===18th century===
In 1748, Anson published a redrawn version of the captured chart in &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;, one of the best-selling books of its day. Anson&#x27;s chart showed the Pacific to be relatively barren, but the three voyages of James Cook would add significant detail.
The first recorded western visitor to Hawaii was Captain James Cook on his fatal third and final voyage in the Pacific. Cook&#x27;s ships first sighted Niihau and Kauai on January 19, 1778, and anchored near Waimea the following evening. As described by James Jackson Jarves in 1843, during the first visit &quot;the natives manifested the greatest respect and kindness toward their visitors, and both parties indulged in a lucrative trade, yet [the natives&#x27;] propensity for thieving was continually manifested ... Theft or lying were to them no crimes. Success in either was a virtue, and it was not until several severe lessons, in regard to the enormity of the former had been received, that their discretion got the better of temptation.&quot; He went on to add &quot;the commander manifested a laudable humanity, in endeavoring to shield the population from the evil effects which so inevitably result from connection between foreign seamen and the native females. But his efforts were vain. If the discipline of his own crew could have been strictly enforced, the eagerness of the women was not to be repressed.&quot;

Cook&#x27;s fleet departed on February 2, returning to Hawaii in November, when they began resupplying their ships and mapping the coastline. They anchored in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779, and stayed for 19 days; although they departed on February 6, they were forced to return for repairs on February 11. A series of misunderstandings would lead Cook to attempt to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, resulting in Cook&#x27;s death.

===19th century===

Prominent 19th-century travelers to Hawaii included journalist Isabella Bird, along with a number of American and British authors. Tourist visits remained around 2,000 per year from 1872 to 1898. American writers include Mark Twain aboard the &quot;Ajax&quot; as a travel journalist with the &quot;Sacramento Daily Union&quot; in 1866, and Herman Melville, who deserted from his whaler in 1843 and later found passage back to the mainland that summer aboard . Twain&#x27;s unfinished novel of Hawaii was incorporated into his &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, with King Arthur bearing striking similarities to Kamehameha V, the first reigning monarch Twain was to meet. The &quot;modernizing&quot; potential offered by the Connecticut Yankee from the future is a satire of the potentially negative Protestant Missionary influence on Hawaiian life. Melville&#x27;s writing of the Pacific includes &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot; (considered factual travel accounts when published) and his Pacific experiences would develop into the portrayal of Queequeg in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

British writers include the Scot Robert Louis Stevenson, whose subsequent &quot;In the South Seas&quot; was published based on his voyages. During his stay in the islands, he wrote a stunning defense of Father Damien&#x27;s work with the lepers of Kalaupapa against the politicized views of Father Damien&#x27;s Protestant detractors. Consequently, Hawaii is home to the eponymous Stevenson Middle School. Stevenson later died in Samoa.

Regular commercial passenger, cargo, and mail service to Hawaii via steamship started in 1870 with the North Pacific Transportation Company of Australia. The Oceanic Steamship Company was incorporated by John D. Spreckels, son of sugar baron Claus Spreckels, on December 24, 1881, to establish a steamship line between San Francisco and Hawaii. Oceanic signed a contract in July 1882 with William Cramp &amp; Sons for two &quot;first-class iron steamships&quot; intended for the Honolulu route; these were completed in 1883 as the and . Spreckels traveled to the East Coast intending to contract for the building of two more steamships, but returned in March 1886 after having purchased and from John Elder &amp; Company.

William Matson had served as captain of Claus Spreckels&#x27;s yacht (named &quot;Lurline&quot;) and in turn, Spreckels helped Matson purchase his first ship, the (named for Spreckels&#x27;s daughter), which made its first voyage to Hawaii in 1882. Matson would go on to found the Matson Navigation Company, whose genesis was in the first , purchased to replace the smaller &quot;Emma Claudina&quot;; that first &quot;Lurline&quot; was sold to Matson by Spreckels and undertook a two-month maiden sail from San Francisco to Hawaii in 1887, marking the start of Matson&#x27;s commercial passenger service to the Hawaiian Islands.
19th-century development in Hawaii played a big part in the increase of tourism that continued into the 21st century. In 1888, a writer for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; extolled &quot;culture, refinement, and a hospitality so cordial that one scarcely meets it elsewhere&quot; joined with &quot;the island air that is kept pure and sweet by the gentle trade winds&#x27; refreshing currents&quot;. Advanced technologies including cars, marketing, hotels, and shopping malls allow vacationers to visit a modernized tropical island, which contributes heavily to steady growth in tourism. Conversely, the Native Hawaiian population continues to decrease, resulting in a loss of authentic Hawaiian culture on the islands, similar to other Oceanian islands.

===20th century===

In 1907, Jack London and his wife Charmian sailed to Hawaii, learning the &quot;royal sport&quot; of surfing and travelling by horseback to Haleakalā and Hana, as chronicled in his book &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot;. 1929 saw 22,000 tourists visit Hawaii, while the number of tourists exceeded 1 million for the first time in 1967.

====Marine service====

The second , completed in 1908, was the first steamship built for Matson; she was designed to accommodate passengers (51) in addition to cargo. Matson added , which made her maiden voyage from San Francisco to Honolulu in February 1910. Both of these ships were named after the daughters of prominent executives: Lurline Matson, daughter of founder William Matson; and Wilhelmina Tenney, daughter of Edward Davies Tenney, the chairman of Castle &amp; Cooke, the Honolulu agent for Matson.

By 1913, Matson was building more passenger liners for the Honolulu run, and . Direct service from Hawaii to Los Angeles was established by &quot;Manoa&quot; in October 1914. Another Matson steamship, , sister to &quot;Matsonia&quot;, was launched in 1916 at San Francisco, the largest passenger ship then constructed on the West Coast. However, Matson&#x27;s Hawaiian routes were interrupted by World War I, as the government announced plans to requisition five ships in 1917; that was later reduced to three: &quot;Wilhelmina&quot;, &quot;Matsonia&quot;, and &quot;Maui&quot;, which served as troop transports before they were released in 1919. &quot;Maui&quot; made 13 roundtrips to France, carrying 37,344 troops; &quot;Matsonia&quot;, 14 roundtrips (38,974); and &quot;Wilhelmina&quot;, 13 roundtrips (23,014).

Growth in tourist travel followed World War I. Matson opened its eponymous headquarters on Market Street in 1924, and conducted marine operations via berths and warehouses at Piers 30–32 in San Francisco; Castle &amp; Cooke also moved into new offices in Honolulu at approximately the same time, and Matson ships docked at Aloha Pier, surrounding Aloha Tower. Matson acquired the Oceanic Steamship operation in May 1926, extending its reach past Hawaii to Australia and New Zealand, and introduced the , the first of its four &quot;White Fleet&quot; ocean liners for Hawaii service, in 1927; at the time, she was the largest passenger steamship built in the United States. &quot;Malolo&quot; was one part of a three-pronged effort devised by William P. Roth, the son-in-law of Captain Matson and Matson&#x27;s general manager, and E.D. Tenney, named president of Matson after Matson&#x27;s death in 1917, to develop the modern Hawaiian tourist industry; a luxury hotel (completed in 1927 as the Royal Hawaiian, in partnership with the Territorial Hotel Company) and golf course (Waialae Country Club) would also help transform Hawaii into a premier resort destination. However, &quot;Malolo&quot; had an inauspicious start to her career, colliding with the steamship in heavy fog during sea trials in May 1927; despite the delay to inaugurating modern ocean liner service, annual tourist traffic to Hawaii jumped from 17,500 (1927) to 22,000 (1929) until the Great Depression started, cutting annual traffic to less than 11,000 tourists in 1932 and 1933.
Matson would go on to build three sister ships to &quot;Malolo&quot;, all completed in 1932: , , and a third . After &quot;Lurline&quot; completed her complicated maiden voyage from New York around the Pacific Ocean in early 1933 Matson established regular Honolulu service with the four ships. Two-week voyages were operated by &quot;Malolo&quot; (&quot;clockwise&quot; on a Los Angeles—Hawaii—San Francisco route) and &quot;Lurline&quot; (&quot;counter-clockwise&quot; on a San Francisco—Hawaii—Los Angeles route); the subsidiary Matson-Oceanic lines operated &quot;Mariposa&quot; and &quot;Monterey&quot; on longer four-week cruises from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Australia and New Zealand via Hawaii. Matson purchased the assets of the Territorial Hotel Company in 1932, giving cruise passengers disembarking in Honolulu a choice from three hotels: the Moana, the Alexander Young, or the Royal Hawaiian. In 1934, a planned 88-day Pacific cruise aboard &quot;Malolo&quot; was canceled after heavy demand for passenger service to Hawaii tied up all of Matson&#x27;s available ships; by 1941, tourist traffic had rebounded past pre-Depression levels, with 31,000 tourists visiting Hawaii that year.

&quot;Lurline&quot; was steaming from Honolulu to San Francisco during the attack on Pearl Harbor; she proceeded at full speed and returned to San Francisco on December 10. The United States&#x27;s entry into World War II once again prompted the government to requisition Matson liners as troopships; all four &quot;White Fleet&quot; ships (&quot;Lurline&quot;, &quot;Mariposa&quot;, &quot;Matsonia&quot; [ex-&quot;Malolo&quot;], and &quot;Monterey&quot;) served along with the older &quot;Maui&quot;. &quot;Maui&quot; accommodated 1,650 passengers after refit; &quot;Lurline&quot;, 4,037; &quot;Matsonia&quot; (ex-&quot;Malolo&quot;), 2,976; &quot;Mariposa&quot;, 4,272; and &quot;Monterey&quot; was used to carry war brides and dependents. In addition, Matson converted a number of cargo vessels to troopships and operated others.
After the war, &quot;Matsonia&quot; (ex-&quot;Malolo&quot;) was the first to return to commercial service in May 1946, but she was laid up and sold in 1948 following the completion of the rebuild of &quot;Lurline&quot;. When &quot;Lurline&quot; arrived in Honolulu on April 21, 1948, after her maiden voyage following the rebuild, she was adorned with the longest lei ever made, long using of orange crêpe paper.

A rebuild of &quot;Mariposa&quot; and &quot;Monterey&quot; was also announced; the rebuild would have given each ship the capacity for 726 passengers (488 first class and 238 cabin class), served by 437 crew. However, the cost of the rebuild was higher than expected, and work was halted; both ships remained in the reserve fleets at Alameda and Suisun. &quot;Mariposa&quot; was sold in 1953 and &quot;Monterey&quot; was not repurchased by Matson until 1956; later that year a new (ex-&quot;Pine Tree Mariner&quot;) and (ex-&quot;Free State Mariner&quot;), both converted from cargo ships launched in 1952, entered service for Matson on their traditional California–Hawaii–Australia/New Zealand route. After &quot;Monterey&quot; (1932) was rebuilt at Newport News, she was renamed &quot;Matsonia&quot; and alternated with &quot;Lurline&quot; on the Hawaii run starting from June 1957 until &quot;Lurline&quot; was sold in 1963. &quot;Matsonia&quot; (ex-&quot;Monterey&quot;) was renamed &quot;Lurline&quot; in December 1963 to carry on the name. The advent of jetliner travel, cutting the five-day voyage from California to Hawaii down to a matter of hours and reducing the cost of travel, decimated cruise passenger traffic; Matson exited the passenger business altogether in 1970 and sold its last White Fleet liner, &quot;Lurline&quot; (ex-&quot;Matsonia&quot;, ex-&quot;Monterey&quot;).

====Air service====
The United States Navy used two PN-9 seaplanes to attempt the first nonstop flight to Hawaii from mainland America in 1925; the aircraft, designated PN-9 Nos. 1 and 3, departed San Francisco on August 31 for Kahului, Maui. A third seaplane, the Boeing PB-1, was intended to join the other two, but it was scrubbed at the last minute. No. 3 was forced down by engine trouble approximately from San Francisco; it capsized while being towed back to Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs. A tailwind that was predicted to aid the airplanes into the flight never materialized, and strong headwinds increased fuel consumption. No. 1 ran out of fuel approximately short of Hawaii as it was entering a squall. Commander John Rodgers had intended to land No. 1 at the (a seaplane tender), one of the picket ships stationed along the flight path, to refuel and then continue the flight to Hawaii. However, the crew was unable to find &quot;Aroostook&quot; and landed after exhausting their fuel; they fashioned a fabric sail from the plane&#x27;s lower wing and sailed towards Hawaii, averaging each day over the next nine days. The search for PN-9 No. 1 was called off by September 8, and the Navy began to prepare the PB-1 to re-attempt the nonstop flight to Hawaii. During its sail, the seaplane passed as close as from Oahu, then steered for Kauai, where they were finally spotted by the patrolling submarine off Nāwiliwili Bay. The submarine towed the PN-9 to the harbor, where they were greeted by the native population, 218 hours after being forced down.
Succeeding where the Navy had failed, on June 29, 1927, Lieutenants Lester Maitland and Albert Hegenberger of the United States Army Air Corps landed at Wheeler Field following the first successful non-stop flight to Hawaii, piloting the Fokker C-2 &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; from Oakland to Honolulu. Rumors of a Hawaiian flight attempt had followed the crew across the country as he piloted the Fokker to the West Coast in mid-June; they denied the rumors, claiming it was a transcontinental test of the trimotor Fokker, as it was laden with the equivalent weight of 30 men. &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; was flown to San Francisco on June 25 from San Diego to make final preparations for the Hawaii attempt, and the plane departed shortly after 7 AM on June 28 from Oakland Municipal Airport; a parallel competing attempt by a civilian pilot was scrubbed after the windshield was cracked. Maitland and Hegenberger returned to San Francisco aboard the Matson steamer ; &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; remained in Hawaii to provide inter-island service.

Inspired by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s successful transatlantic flight in April 1927, pineapple magnate James Dole announced the Dole Air Race in May 1927, which would award to the crew of the first airplane to complete a non-stop flight from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, within a 12-month period starting in August 1927. Eight aircraft eventually flew in the Dole Air Race; however, only two aircraft completed the flight and ten people were killed in the attempt.
The first commercial passenger aircraft service to the Hawaiian Islands from San Francisco commenced on October 21, 1936, with a once-weekly flight operated by Pan American Airways aboard the Martin M-130 Clipper; this first revenue service flight was taken by &quot;Hawaii Clipper&quot;. Pan Am introduced the larger Boeing 314 to the route in 1939; onboard accommodations included a lounge and sleeping berths.

In 1944, the Civil Aeronautics Board held hearings to break up the Pan Am monopoly on overseas flights from America and after World War II, other airlines were granted routes to Hawaii; United Airlines and Northwest Airlines soon began service to Honolulu from major West Coast cities: San Francisco (United, 1947), Los Angeles (United, 1950), Seattle (Northwest, 1949), and Portland (Northwest, 1949).

===21st century===
Widespread fear of flying after the September 11 attacks greatly reduced tourism in Hawaii. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote in March 2002 that &quot;at the Polynesian Cultural Center ... the barefoot guides seemed to outnumber visitors&quot;. Although 2006 and 2007 saw a big increase in tourism, it soon took a turn for the worse when Hawaii&#x27;s economy plummeted, but later recovered. Tourism officials said several factors have kept sightseers away: Two major airlines and two cruise ships stopped operating in the Aloha State, reducing options for visitors, high fuel prices last summer deterred travel, then recessions in Japan and the U.S., as well as California&#x27;s economic meltdown, slowed the flow of tourists.

In 2007, Japanese tourists on average used to spend more money than American tourists; because of this, tourism-related businesses in Hawaii used to value Japanese customers. However this has all changed with the collapse of the value of the yen and the Japanese economy. The average Japanese tourist now stays only 5 days, while the average East Asian tourist from China or Korea stays more than 9.5 days and spends 25% more.

Hawaii has been seeing increased numbers of visitors from South Korea and China.

In 2011, Hawaii saw increasing arrivals and share of foreign tourists from Canada, Australia and China increasing 13%, 24% and 21% respectively from 2010. In 2014 a record 8.3 million visitors arrived to Hawaii (39.4% from the U.S. West, 20.8% from the U.S. East, 18.3% from Japan, 6.3% from Canada, 15.2% others), spending $14.7 billion. The amount increased to 9.4 million visitors spending over $16 billion in 2017.

== Impacts of tourism in Hawaii ==
=== Economic ===
As Hawaii changed from a Kingdom to a Territory to a State, so too did the dominant industries change. Being a primarily agricultural land, producing around 80 percent of the world&#x27;s pineapples in the 1960s, the addition of Pan Am’s flight route to Hawaii rapidly increased the number of visitors going to the islands. The years following statehood led to more than double the number of passengers arriving at Honolulu airport. As this trend continues to increase, Hawaii&#x27;s economy has become heavily dependent on the tourism industry. Although the economy has seen significant growth with the addition of this industry, some researchers believe this will leave Hawaii susceptible to external economic forces. Some examples of these are an economic recession, airline strikes, or varying fuel prices which could devastate the local economy. The devastating national economic recession of 2008, hit Hawaii&#x27;s tourism industry hard. In 2008, hotel occupancy dropped to 60 percent, a level not seen since the terrorist attacks in 2001.

As the economy has returned to normal levels, the tourism industry has continued to grow in Hawaii with the majority of tourists visiting Oahu, Maui, Kauai and the big island of Hawaii. Job creation is another benefit of tourism to the islands. In 2017, reports say 204,000 jobs were related to tourism. This led to $16.78 billion in visitor spending with $1.96 billion generated in tax revenue in that year alone. Resorts and the airline business are the primary benefactors of this increase in tourism.

=== Environmental ===

The Sustainable Tourism Association of Hawaii (formerly the Hawaii Ecotourism Association) was founded in 1995 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to nurture the development of sustainable tourism in Hawaii. It offers a certification program to educate and recognize conservation-minded tour operators in Hawaii, the only such certification program of its kind in America. Based on a study on sustainable tourism, those traveling to Hawaii are interested in the conservation of the natural environment, marine life, and the minimization of plastic. A master’s student at the University of Hawai’i Manoa suggested the concept of regenerative tourism education to foster the relationships between residents, visitors, and the ʻāina, a Hawaiian word meaning “that which feeds” referring to the land and oftentimes the sea.

The long term environmental implications that Hawaii is facing due to mass tourism has raised concern. To combat this and help raise awareness, international environmental organizations have joined forces with local island communities. There are major benefits to this type of management, usually described as &quot;values-led management&quot;. By prioritizing the values and existing sustainable practices by local communities living on heavily visited islands, it preserves their interests and further respects their culture.

==== Water ====
Studies show that the tourism sector accounts for 44.7% of Hawaii’s water consumption. Global water usage resulting from tourism only directly takes up about 1% of global water consumption and studies show an insignificant anticipated increase.

Hotels are often placed near beaches, in areas with little rainfall, and guests use of water per person. Another study concluded that on average, a single guest uses approximately of water per day, divided approximately half between accommodations (laundry and sewer) and golf courses (irrigation). This is significantly more than the average resident and has led to a number of droughts throughout the islands.

==== Landscape ====
The number of hotel rooms from 1985 to 2010 nearly doubled from 65,000 to 132,000 rooms. Tourists visit destinations with developed infrastructure, groomed activities and pristine conditions, which boosts the economy and finances needed to uphold these facilities. The very creation of these institutions degrades the environmental factors tourists are drawn to. Having perfect conditions requires an amount of upkeep fueled by the revenue of the visitors. The visitors also degrade the environment at a faster rate than residents alone.

A direct effect of the increase in infrastructure is the depletion of the natural landscape. As buildings are constructed the amount of natural land becomes smaller and smaller. As hotels are constructed in prime real estate the environmental problems created are not weighed equally with the potential upside of profit. Those are quantitative variables that can be directly measured in terms of dollars and number of jobs. The impact to the environment or the indigenous people is harder to measure. Hawaii only holds 0.2 percent of the United States land but has a 72.1 percent extinction rate, and more than half of the natural communities in the islands are endangered by developments. An example of this is natural ponds being destroyed during construction of large buildings which were previously home to migrating birds. The ponds are no longer there, which throws off the natural flow of the ecosystem. Nearly 60 percent of the plant and animal species in Hawaii are endangered. This includes the loss of habitats for animals and the diverse flora that gives Hawaii its beauty.

Additionally, much of the tourism in Hawai&#x27;i surrounds its natural landscape. Tourists often participate in outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and lounging on beaches. These &#x27;tourist&#x27; activities can easily cause a significant amount of damage to the natural landscape of the island. Hiking, specifically in very tourist-attracting locations, causes damage to the local flora and fauna of the landscape, in addition to posing significant safety concerns. A common issue with the overuse of hiking trails as a result of tourism is trail erosion, which can lead to damaged soil health, plant damage, and safety concerns for hikers. The rise of tourism in Hawaii over the past 75 years also led to a decrease in agricultural land use on the islands.

Two other very common tourist activities in Hawaii are exploring beaches and snorkeling. Commercial marine tourism companies, such as dolphin watching and snorkeling trips, oftentimes do not proper educate and enforce environmental protection procedures to their guests, leading to environmental damage. Examples of environmental damage are marine animal harassment, pollution (on beaches and in waters), and coral damage. Coral damage is one of the most commonly observed environmental impacts of marine recreational activities which is caused by visitors sitting, standing, and kicking reefs, whether this be intentional or accidental.

==== Energy ====

Hawaii has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-fired thermal power plants for its electricity generation, although it has set a statewide goal of achieving 100% of electric generation via renewable sources by 2045; as a result, the average guest uses the equivalent of of oil per day, approximately of which is consumed by rental car operation. For electricity alone, the average guest uses 23.9 to 33.6 kW-hr per day.

Tourism accounts for about 60% of total energy and fuel usage in Hawaii. As global tourism has been rising since the COVID-19 pandemic, it is projected that the state&#x27;s energy demand continues to rise as well.

==== Refuse ====

Studies show that the tourism sector accounts for 10.7% of Hawaii’s waste generation. The average guest generates approximately of waste per day. In order to reduce the generation of plastic waste, Hawaii has begun to ban the use of single-use plastic and polystyrene foam on a county-by-county approach. A ban on polystyrene foam containers took effect in Maui County on December 31, 2018; a similar ban started in Hawaii County (the Big Island) on July 1, 2019. Oahu&#x27;s ban on single-use plastic and polystyrene went into effect on January 1, 2021. Two bills were considered by the Hawaii State Legislature in early 2019, which would have been the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in America. SB367 would ban the use of polystrene foam food containers statewide; that bill died in committee in March 2019. SB522 would ban single-use plastic beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws starting in 2021; that bill was modified in committee to create a working group to make recommendations on how to reduce plastic waste instead.

The beaches in Hawaii are becoming increasingly filled with trash, especially plastics. This becomes a problem not only environmentally, but also could have a negative impact on the economy as visitors come for the sandy beaches and pollutants such as trash or plastics decrease the appeal of Hawaii as a vacation destination. Kamilo Beach on the southeastern tip of the island of Hawaii has acquired the nickname &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; for its accumulation of plastic trash, much of it borne via ocean currents and trade winds from the nearby Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It is estimated that of trash, 96% of which is plastic, washes ashore here annually. An often unknown source of pollution near beaches is sunscreens that contain petrochemical-based UV filters. These chemicals can damage the beaches as well as nearby coral reef habitats.

=== Social effect ===
Some Native Hawaiians believe strongly in the independence of Hawaii and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. The creation of this grassroots organization leads to a negative view towards visitors and the disruption of the natural land. This leads to a strong contention between developers and natives who believe the land should not be transformed into a commercial or residential development. Many of these individuals are reliant on the land as a means of living. The loss of the environment affects the socio-psychological well-being of those reliant on land and marine resources. Native Hawaiians and residents alike become limited in job opportunities with a heavily skewed job-base in the tourism industry. Many Hawaiian residents and natives do understand the importance of the state’s tourism industry and that, unfortunately, it can come with negative environmental consequences.

The essay &quot;Lovely Hula Lands&quot; (later republished as &quot;Lovely Hula Hands&quot;) by native Hawaiian academic and activist Haunani-Kay Trask is severely critical of the huge influx of tourists to Hawaii, which she terms a &quot;prostitution&quot; of Hawaiian culture. She ends her essay with &quot;let me just leave this thought behind. If you are thinking of visiting my homeland, please don&#x27;t. We don&#x27;t want or need any more tourists, and we certainly don&#x27;t like them.&quot; However, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has condemned Trask for her anti-American statements, stating that such vitriol helps fuel racism in Hawaiʻi.

<text>The &quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot; (; ; ) is the national anthem of Sri Lanka. &quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot; was composed by Ananda Samarakoon and was originally titled &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot; (&quot;Salute! Salute! Motherland&quot;).

&quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot; was first performed at an official ceremony on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square during the national day ceremony. The anthem was given full constitutional recognition in the 1978 Second Republican Constitution.

== History ==
There are differing accounts as to the origin of the &quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot;. The most widely held view is that Sri Lankan composer Ananda Samarakoon wrote the music and lyrics to the song, inspired/influenced by the Indian Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. A minority suggest that Tagore wrote the anthem in full. Some have suggested that Tagore wrote the music whilst Samarakoon wrote the lyrics. Tagore being directly involved in the creation of the song has been denied by some historians like Indian Lipi Ghosh and Sri Lankan Sandagomi Coperahewa. Samarakoon had been a pupil of Tagore at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. After returning to Ceylon Samarakoon taught music at Mahinda College, Galle. The song, which was then known as &quot;Namo Namo Mata&quot;, was first sung by students at Mahinda College. After it was sung by the choir from Musaeus College, Colombo at a public event it became hugely popular in Ceylon and was widely played on radio.

Prior to Ceylon&#x27;s independence (1948) the Lanka Gandharva Sabha had organised a competition to find a national anthem. Among the entries were &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot; by Samarakoon and &quot;Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima&quot; by P. B. Illangasinghe and Lionel Edirisinghe. The latter won the competition but this was controversial as Illangasinghe and Edirisinghe were members of the judging panel. &quot;Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima&quot; was broadcast by Radio Ceylon on the morning of 4 February 1948, independence day, but it was not sung at the official Freedom Day celebrations. Ceylon continued to use the UK&#x27;s national anthem as its official national anthem after independence. At the first independence day ceremony held on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square both &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot; and &quot;Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima&quot; were sung, in Sinhala and Tamil, as &quot;national songs&quot;.

More specifically, in 1950 Minister of Finance J. R. Jayewardene requested that the government recognise Samarakoon&#x27;s &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot; as the official national anthem. The government appointed a committee headed by Edwin Wijeyeratne, Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development, to pick a new national anthem. The committee heard several songs but, after much deliberation, picked &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot;. The committee made a minor change to Samarakoon&#x27;s song, with his approval, changing the tenth line from &quot;Nawajeewana Damine Newatha Apa Awadi Karan Matha&quot; to &quot;Nawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apa Pubudu Karan Matha&quot;. The committee&#x27;s decision was endorsed by the government on 22 November 1951. The anthem was translated into the Tamil language by M. Nallathamby. &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot; was first sung as Ceylon&#x27;s official national anthem at the independence day parade in Colombo in 1952.

In the late 1950s controversy arose over its first line, &quot;Namo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka&quot;. It was deemed to be &quot;unlucky&quot; and blamed for the country&#x27;s misfortunes including the deaths of two prime ministers. In February 1961 the government changed the line to their present form, &quot;Sri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka&quot;, despite Samarakoon&#x27;s strong opposition. Samarakoon committed suicide in April 1962, leaving a note complaining that its lyrics had been mutilated.

The Second Republican Constitution of 1978 gave &quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot; constitutional recognition.

== Multilingual ==
The Sri Lankan national anthem is available in an identical version in two languages, Sinhala and Tamil, both official languages of the country. It is just one of a number that are sung in more than one language: Belgium (French, Dutch, and German), Canada (English, French and Inuktitut), Finland (Finnish, Swedish), New Zealand (English and Māori), South Africa (Xhosa, Zulu, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English), Suriname (Dutch and Sranan Tongo) and Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh).

&quot;Sri Lanka Thaaye&quot;, the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan national anthem, is an exact translation of &quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot;, the Sinhala version, and has the same music. Although it has existed since independence in 1948 it was generally only sung in the north and east of the country where the Tamil language predominates. The Sinhala version of the Constitution uses Sinhala lyrics while the Tamil version of the constitution uses Tamil lyrics. Per the constitution both Sinhala and Tamil are official and national languages and thus the anthem could be sung in both languages.

The majority of Sri Lankans (around 75%) speak the Sinhala language. More specifically, &quot;Tamil is the native language for the Tamil people, who constitute about 15% of Sri Lankans, and for Muslims who are nearly 10%&quot;, according to the BBC. Until early 2016, the Sinhala version was the only one to be used during official government events and it was the only version used during international sports and other events. Although the Sinhala version of the anthem was used at official/state events, the Tamil version was &quot;also&quot; sung at &quot;some&quot; events in spite of the unofficial ban which ended in early 2016. 

The Sinhala version of Sri Lanka Matha was used in all parts of the country with the exception of the North and the East which have a large Tamil population. Some reports indicate that the Tamil version was used at official events held in the Tamil speaking regions in the North and East of Sri Lanka. The Tamil version was sung at Tamil medium schools throughout the country. The Tamil version was even used during the period when Sinhala was the only official language of the country (1956–87). 
=== Tamil version controversy ===
On 12 December 2010 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the Cabinet of Sri Lanka headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa had taken the decision to scrap the Tamil translation of &quot;Sri Lanka Matha&quot; at official and state functions, as &quot;in no other country was the national anthem used in more than one language&quot; - even though the national anthems of Belgium, Switzerland, Canada and those of several other countries have more than one language version. The Cabinet&#x27;s decision had followed a paper on the national flag and national anthem produced by Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister W. D. J. Senewiratne. The paper had drawn on the Singaporean model where the national anthem is sung in the official lyrics and not any translation of the lyrics. Based on this the paper recommended that the Sri Lankan national anthem only be sung in Sinhala and the Tamil translation be abolished. The paper&#x27;s authors had failed to realise that the official lyrics of the Singaporean national anthem are in Malay, a minority language (75% of Singaporeans are Chinese).

Government minister Wimal Weerawansa had labelled the Tamil version a &quot;joke&quot; on Derana TV, and had cited India as an analogy. Some journalists, such as D. B. S. Jeyaraj, claimed that it was wrong of Weerawansa to cite India as an analogy because according to them the Indian national anthem was not in Hindi, which is the most widely spoken language of India, but in Bengali, a minority language. Although sources based on an official Government of India website state that the Indian National anthem was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly of India, the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India on 24 January 1950 does not mention that the National Anthem was &quot;adopted&quot;, nor does it mention that it was done so in its Hindi version. In actual practice the unaltered Bengali version is the version sung as the National Anthem, with its words in original Bengali Tatsama, a highly Sanskritized form of Bengali that has Sanskrit words common to both Hindi and Bengali.

The Cabinet&#x27;s December 2010 decision to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem (which was not subsequently enacted) caused much furore in Sri Lanka. Later, the government denied allegations that the Tamil translation was to be abolished. The Presidential Secretariat has stated that there was no basis to the media report and follow up reports which intimated the same. Nevertheless, an unofficial ban on the Tamil version came into being as fearful public officials in Tamil speaking areas stopped using the Tamil version or blocked attempts to use it. The Sri Lankan Army forcefully stopped any use of the Tamil version and taught school children to sing only the Sinhala version.

In March 2015 newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would be issuing a circular which would state that there was no ban on singing the national anthem in Tamil. Sirisena&#x27;s announcement was attacked by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists.

During Sri Lanka&#x27;s 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 February 2016, the Tamil version of the anthem was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event, the independence day celebrations. Lifting of the unofficial ban on the Tamil version had been approved by President Maithripala Sirisena (who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009) and by others in the government. This step was viewed as part of the plan for &quot;post-civil war ethnic reconciliation&quot;.

Naturally, Sri Lanka Matha was also sung in Sinhalese. Some groups, and Sri Lanka&#x27;s former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were opposed to the government officially allowing the Tamil version to be sung. 

In 2020, the Sri Lankan government stopped using the Tamil version of the national anthem at the main Independence Day celebration. However, regional independence day celebrations including those with government involvement in regions with significant Tamil populations continue to sing in both Tamil and Sinhala.

In 2024, the government once again reinstated the national anthem at the 76th Independence Day.

==History==

===1879 to 1914: the beginning of telephony in Belgium===
The Belgian telegraph services installed a telephone line in parliament in 1879, marking the start of telephony in the country. Subsequently, private entrepreneurs applied to operate telephone networks in various Belgian cities, leading to the establishment of a legislative framework by the government to regulate telephony. By 1896, the entire telephone sector came under government ownership.

By 1913 the most railway stations and post/telegraphoffices had a public telephone booth.

===From World War I to 1930: transition to an autonomous public company===
During World War I, telecommunications in Belgium came to an abrupt end due to the financial dependence of the state-owned company. The damage and dismantling of networks during the war required massive investments. On 19 July 1930, the RTT was founded, the Belgian national telegraph and telephone company. Increasingly, people started using telephones at home.

===1930 to World War II: RTT’s integration into the state&#x27;s industrial policy===
Through the RTT, the government invested huge sums in the Belgian telephone network. A growing portion of the population, from various social classes, now had access to telephony.

At the same time, another phenomenon emerged, which soon became a heavy burden for the company. During the economic crisis of the 1930s, the government used RTT in its industrial and employment policies. By forcing complete automation of the Belgian telephone network, the government tried to reduce the high unemployment rate in the sector. This strongly restricted the autonomy of the RTT.

The 1930 law clearly stated that the company could independently design and implement an investment program. However, by imposing its employment policy, the government directly contradicted the basic principle of the law. This led to a structural problem at the RTT soon after the war.

===From World War II to 1986: from high-tech company to crisis===
Immediately after World War II, the RTT faced significant damage and partial dismantling of its networks. To quickly revive the sector, the government decided to provide financial assistance. During this period, the demand for telecommunication services increased rapidly. The number of subscribers grew immensely: from about 350,000 in 1946 to 522,000 in 1951, to over a million in 1965. This growth in the customer base led to a high pace of investment, making RTT a leader in technological and social development by the end of the 1960s.

However, this expansion policy also had a downside. From the late 1960s, debts began to accumulate. The economic crisis gripping the world from 1973 onwards did not help. Furthermore, the company was caught up in a corruption scandal: the RTT scandal. The company&#x27;s financial situation only worsened and, from the mid-seventies, the RTT was forced to cut costs.

Throughout the 1980s, the conviction grew that the telecommunications sector would become one of the key development poles of the late twentieth century. Thus, from 1981 onwards, the RTT launched a major reorganisation to solve certain structural issues of the company.

===From 1987 to 2004: the Belgacom law and sector evolution under the influence of Europe===
In 1987, another player entered the scene: the European Commission introduced its Green Paper on the development of the common market for telecommunications services and equipment, focusing on market liberalisation. This Green Paper formed the basis of the Belgian Law of 21 March 1991, which created a new type of government-owned company with greater autonomy. The Belgian telecommunications sector was reorganized, and in 1992, the RTT was replaced by Belgacom PLC, an autonomous public-sector company. The company and the state entered into a management contract that ensured the provision of certain public services and granted the company more autonomy than was stipulated in the 1930 Act.

From 1994 onwards, European convergence processes were accelerated. The European Commission stated in a new Green Paper that network operation and telephony should also be open to competition. Belgacom PLC evolved into a company limited by shares under public law. On 1 July 1994, Belgacom launched the Proximus mobile network, entrusted to a subsidiary, Belgacom Mobile. Belgacom remained a 75% shareholder, with the remaining 25% owned by Air Touch (which became Vodafone in 1999).

In 1996, the Belgian government sold 50% minus 1 Belgacom share to the ADSB Telecommunications consortium. This consortium consisted of Ameritech (SBC), Tele Danmark, and Singapore Telecom, along with three Belgian financial institutions: Sofina, Dexia, and KBC.

In 1997, a carrier and wholesale department called Belgacom International Carrier Services (BICS) was born. With the complete liberalisation of the telecom market on 1 January 1998, Belgacom acquired Skynet, the first internet access provider in Belgium and one of the largest web portals in the country. Its internet activities were integrated into the Belgacom brand, which launched ADSL in the Belgian market. In 2000, BICS opened offices in Asia/Oceania, America, and the Middle East. In 2001, it launched its mobile offering.

In 2001, the BeST plan was introduced with the aim of restructuring the company by dividing it into four business units. Belgacom also divested certain activities, such as Belgacom France, Ben, its security activities, and the French activities of Infosources. The consequences of the BeST plan for the staff became apparent in 2002: a lot of employees were offered options to quit, work part-time, or retrain.

In an increasingly open market where competition was becoming more aggressive, Belgacom decided in 2003 to radically change its image. A new logo, new colours, and a desire to be closer to the customer were intended to bring a new momentum. These radical changes in the company&#x27;s philosophy foreshadowed the operator&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO). On 22 March 2004, Belgacom was listed on the stock market for the first time. The Belgian government remained the majority shareholder with 50% + 1 of all shares, while the ADSB consortium sold all its shares.

The IPO enabled the Belgian operator to release significant resources to finance its ambitions: offering fixed internet access via broadband or fibre optic (through the Broadway project).

2004 also saw the operator conducting the first tests of digital television in a few hundred households, aiming to tap into new revenue streams in a market where competition with triple-play packages (television, telephony, and internet) like IPTV was intensifying.

===From 2005 to 2009: consolidation, convergence, and the first bundled offers===
In 2005, Belgacom and Swisscom Fixnet signed an agreement to merge their international carrier activities to consolidate their position in the international market. Belgacom TV was launched in the Belgian market, acquiring broadcasting rights for Belgian football for three seasons. Belgacom introduced Belgium&#x27;s first digital TV service via ADSL, expanding its services to include fixed telephony, mobile telephony, high-speed internet, and television. This move aimed to diversify revenue streams amidst declining profit margins in its other activities. Additionally, in 2005, Proximus became the first mobile telephony provider in Belgium to offer 3G services to the public.

In 2006, Belgacom acquired Telindus, enhancing its range of ICT services and network integration solutions tailored for businesses and professionals. Belgacom also completed the acquisition of the remaining 25% stake in Proximus from Vodafone and acquired Euremis, a provider of mobile CRM solutions catering to companies in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and pharmaceutical sectors. In April 2007, Proximus and Belgacom introduced their initial bundled offerings, referred to as &#x27;packs&#x27;. Furthermore, Belgacom focused on advancing its digital television services during this period.

In 2008, Belgacom initiated the acquisitions of Scarlet and Tele2 Luxembourg. Belgacom acquired Scarlet NV. In June 2008, the provider also acquired Tango from Tele2, an operator active in Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.

===From 2010 to 2013: TV Everywhere and the first 4G network===
In 2010, Belgacom Group completed the full integration of its subsidiaries Belgacom Mobile SA/Proximus, Telindus NV, Telindus Sourcing SA, the activities of Belgacom Skynet SA, and the Belgian activities of Telindus Group NV into Belgacom SA to form a single legal entity. Partnerships were also signed with Jinni, In3Depth, Blinkx, and OnLive to further develop the Belgacom TV entertainment platform. Additionally, FON, the largest Wi-Fi community worldwide, became a partner.

After several incidents, CEO Didier Bellens was fired in 2011. Ray Stewart and Stefaan De Clerck were appointed temporary CEOs until a new CEO was found.

In 2011, Belgacom introduced Belgacom TV Everywhere, enabling customers to access Belgacom TV across various devices such as TV, PC, tablet, and smartphone through Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity. Additionally, Belgacom established an exclusive partnership with Deezer to enhance its content library with music streaming services. BICS initiated a roaming hub contract with MTN Group, the largest mobile operator in Africa and the Middle East. Concurrently, Telindus launched the Telindus Telecom brand, focusing on providing connectivity and data centre solutions for the business and professional sectors.

In 2012, Proximus inaugurated Belgium&#x27;s first 4G network, while Tango replicated the same in Luxembourg. Belgacom introduced Internet Everywhere, an integrated solution catering to both home and mobile internet needs. Belgacom Group also acquired The Phone House chain of stores that year.

In 2013, Proximus unveiled new mobile pricing plans tailored to different types of phones: Smart for smartphone users and Easy for customers using classic mobile phones. Belgacom acquired significant spectrum for the 800 MHz frequency band to advance its 4G capabilities. Through Home&amp;Care, the company provided security solutions enabling customers to remotely monitor their homes via smartphones or tablets. Meanwhile, Scarlet introduced TRIO, a triple-play package combining fixed telephony, broadband internet, and TV services.

In the same year, Belgacom, along with other telecommunications operators and Belgian banks, formed Belgian Mobile Wallet NV, a collaborative initiative aimed at creating a Belgian mobile payment solution named Sixdots. The objective was to promote the use of smartphones for payments instead of traditional bank cards and card readers. Despite efforts, the project faced challenges and was halted in 2015.

===From 2014 to 2019: Bye-bye Belgacom, hello Proximus===
On 9 January 2014, Dominique Leroy was appointed as the new CEO and chairwoman of the executive committee of the Proximus Group for a period of 6 years. Leroy focused on enhancing the company&#x27;s offerings and prioritised growth through her Fit for Growth strategy.

In 2014, it was decided to gradually phase out the Belgacom brand name. Starting from autumn 2014, Proximus became the new commercial name for all fixed, mobile, and IT products, while other brands such as Scarlet remained intact.

During the same year, Belgacom introduced Personal Cloud, enabling customers to securely store their documents with access from various devices including PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or Proximus TV. This facilitated easier sharing of content with family and friends and on social media platforms.

TV Replay was launched, allowing customers to rewind up to 36 hours on popular linear TV channels. Through partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung, customers gained access to a wide range of mobile devices. Additionally, a partnership with Netflix enabled customers to stream Netflix directly through Proximus TV. The company also pioneered innovative 4G technology deployment in Belgium, starting with roll-outs at the Belgian coast and major cities, including Brussels.

In April 2015, shareholders approved changing the company name from Belgacom to Proximus, effective from 22 June.

In 2016, Proximus established a unique Smart Mobility company named Be-Mobile. Commercial offerings were revamped with the introduction of new all-inclusive products: Tuttimus for residential customers and Bizz All-in for small businesses. Proximus invested in Citie, a smart retail platform supporting the local economy and facilitating closer interaction between merchants, shoppers, and local governments. In December 2016, Proximus announced Fibre for Belgium, a three billion euro investment plan aimed at delivering high-speed internet to residents and businesses. Proximus also introduced HD voice calls via 3G and 4G on mobile phones and conducted successful tests for the next generation mobile networks (4.5G and 5G).

Fibre for Belgium was deployed in 2017 for the first time in seven cities. Proximus extended its partnership with Vodafone for Belgium and Luxembourg, and acquired Davinsi Labs, enhancing its presence in the cybersecurity market. Starting from 12 June 2017, Proximus customers were able to surf, call, and text within the European Union without additional charges. The MyProximus app was launched, and Proximus acquired application developer Unbrace. Additionally, BICS completed the acquisition of Telesign, a communication platform and service company in the US. On 29 December 2017, Proximus discontinued its telegram service after over 150 years.

In 2018, Proximus acquired Umbrio to bolster its position in the expanding IT, network, and analytics market. The Dutch company ION-IP was also acquired to invest in the emerging Benelux Managed Security Market. Proximus successfully completed the acquisition of CODit and secured a commercial Fibre-to-the-Business wholesale deal with telecom operator Destiny. 2018 saw the first successful 5G outdoor trial in Belgium with Huawei, and the launch of the NB-IoT network for connecting digital gas and electricity meters for Fluvius.

Meanwhile, major Belgian banks and mobile operators, including Proximus, introduced Itsme. This digital identification app enables Belgian citizens to log in and verify their identities with government agencies, banks, insurers, and other private companies.

=== From 2019 to the present day: the digital shift ===
In 2019, Proximus unveiled the #shifttodigital strategy, aimed at expediting transformation efforts to ensure the company&#x27;s continued relevance in the Belgian market and safeguard its future. The strategy encompassed both operational enhancements and a social component, which sparked strikes and protests among some members of the workforce. Following extensive negotiations, an agreement was reached between management and trade unions, subsequently approved by the board of directors.

The brand promise &quot;Think possible&quot; was also launched in 2019, and the digital TV platform Proximus TV was rebranded as Proximus Pickx. Proximus and Orange Belgium collaborated under the name MWingz.

In September 2019, Proximus announced that Dominique Leroy had decided to leave the company on 1 December due to international career plans. CFO Sandrine Dufour temporarily took over as CEO. Guillaume Boutin was appointed as the new CEO on 1 December 2019. He had been with Proximus since August 2017 as Chief Consumer Market Officer.

Together with DPG Media and Rossel, Proximus launched a digital press offering called My e-Press and entered a partnership with construction firm Besix for smart buildings. The first 5G demonstrations focused on live video streaming, industrial robots, drones, virtual reality, and cloud gaming.

In February 2020, Proximus and the Port of Antwerp signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the project &quot;The Digital Schelde&quot; to prepare the port&#x27;s digital transformation by developing a private 5G network. In March, CEO Guillaume Boutin presented his new strategy #inspire2022.The long-term plan is based on four strategic pillars: the deployment of fixed and mobile gigabit technologies, the transformation into a digital native company, the development of partnerships and ecosystems, and a strengthened focus on sustainable and digital business operations.

Simultaneously, the company announced its intention to significantly accelerate the rollout of the fibre optic network through joint venture agreements with EQT and Eurofiber. It was deployed in sixteen cities in December 2020: Aalst, Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Hasselt, Kortrijk, Knokke-Heist, Leuven, Liège, Mechelen, Namur, Ostend, Sint-Niklaas, Roeselare, and Vilvoorde.

Proximus launched the first 5G network in Belgium and also introduced &quot;Flex&quot; to the market, a new range of packages. An agreement was reached with Eurofiber and DELTA Fiber to expand and accelerate the rollout of the fibre optic network in Belgium. In June 2020, Proximus entered into a strategic partnership with Belfius to establish a neobank - a fully digital internet bank named Banx. Proximus Codit and Unbrace merged and an agreement was reached with Disney+.

In 2021, Proximus provided COVID-19 vaccination centres with connectivity, IT support and advanced IoT solutions to monitor vaccine temperatures. Proximus also acquired Mobile Vikings while Banx, the digital sustainable banking app, entered the Belgian market. The teleconsultation app Doktr was launched, and DigitAll members signed the Digital Inclusion Charter. Antonietta Mastroianni, Chief Digital &amp; IT Officer, and Mark Reid, Chief Financial Officer, joined the executive committee.

BICS entered into new partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud and was further expanding existing partnerships with Amazon Web Services.

Telesign, in turn, announces its intention to go public and launches its Messaging API. The anti-fraud capabilities of its Score product have been enhanced, resulting in improved fraud detection accuracy and a significant decrease in the occurrence of false positives.

In 2022, approximately 1.28 million households and businesses have access to fibre connectivity. Proximus has forged partnerships with Odoo to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their digitalisation efforts, as well as with Microsoft to collaborate on the development of sovereign cloud solutions. Additionally, Proximus has established Proximus Ada, a centre of excellence focused on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Proximus has achieved recognition as the first BEL20 company to receive scientific validation for its environmental objectives through the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative), aligning with its new &#x27;Net-Zero Standard&#x27;.

In October of this year, Proximus becomes a partner of Living Tomorrow&#x27;s Innovation Campus 2030, where visitors can glimpse into the future of living and working.

The teleconsultation app Doktr and AG, a leader in collective health insurance in Belgium, collaborate to promote the accessibility of digital consultations.

In March 2023, Proximus and Google Cloud announce that they will offer sovereign cloud services in Belgium and Luxembourg. This five-year partnership aims to provide a disconnected cloud solution to governments, regulated enterprises, and international organisations in Europe.

Starting from July 2023, the name of Proximus Enterprise changes to Proximus NXT. Proximus NXT remains focused on the business market, delivering services through fibre and 5G networks with an ecosystem of partners.

Also in July, Proximus increases the speed of its fibre products and launches 10 Gbit/s technology nationwide. The Multigig technology is now available in all areas with fibre coverage. Existing fibre customers automatically receive higher speeds.

Proximus extends its agreement with UEFA regarding the broadcasting of Champions League matches via Pickx Sport or All Stars &amp; Sports until 2027.

In mid-December, the Flemish Government takes the initiative to facilitate investments in technological and innovative solutions for societal challenges by establishing the private limited company &#x27;Flanders Technology and Innovation&#x27;. Proximus, along with Brussels Airport Company, KBC, COI, Cronos, Cegeka, and Telenet, supports this project. The non-profit association &#x27;Flanders Technology International&#x27; owns the name and brand.

<doc id="287733" wikidata="Q1265836" url="?curid=287733" title="MetaPost">
<text>MetaPost refers to both a programming language and the interpreter of the MetaPost programming language. Both are derived from Donald Knuth&#x27;s Metafont language and interpreter. MetaPost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric/algebraic description. The language shares Metafont&#x27;s declarative syntax for manipulating lines, curves, points and geometric transformations. However,

* Metafont is set up to produce fonts, in the form of image files (in .gf format) with associated font metric files (in .tfm format), whereas MetaPost produces EPS, SVG, or PNG files
* The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster-based format, whereas MetaPost&#x27;s output is vector-based graphics (lines, Bézier curves)
* Metafont output is monochrome, whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors.
* The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams, either strings from a specified font, or anything else that can be typeset with TeX.
* Starting with version 1.8, Metapost allows floating-point arithmetic with 64 bits (default: 32 bit fixed-point arithmetic)

Many of the limitations of MetaPost derive from features of Metafont. For instance, MetaPost does not support all features of PostScript. Most notably, paths can have only one segment (so that regions are simply connected), and regions can be filled only with uniform colours. PostScript level 1 supports tiled patterns and PostScript 3 supports Gouraud shading.

==Availability and usage==
MetaPost is distributed with many distributions of the TeX and Metafont framework, for example, it is included in the MiKTeX and the TeX Live distributions.

The encapsulated postscript produced by Metapost can be included in LaTeX, ConTeXt, and TeX documents via standard graphics inclusion commands. The encapsulated postscript output can also be used with the PDFTeX engine, thus directly giving PDF. This ability is implemented in ConTeXt and in the LaTeX graphics package, and can be used from plain TeX via the supp-pdf.tex macro file.

ConTeXt and LuaTeX supports the inclusion of MetaPost code within the input file. Inclusion of MetaPost code in LaTeX is also possible by using LaTeX-packages, for example codice_1 or codice_2.

==Examples==
This is a single file &lt;samp&gt;example.mp&lt;/samp&gt; which when processed by the MetaPost interpreter (via the command codice_3 on Linux) produces three eps files &lt;samp&gt;example.1&lt;/samp&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;example.2&lt;/samp&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;example.3&lt;/samp&gt;. These are pictured on the right.

The resulting three eps files can be used in TeX via LaTeX&#x27;s codice_4 command, ConTeXt&#x27;s codice_5, Plain TeX&#x27;s codice_6 command, or (in Plain pdftex) the codice_7 command from &lt;samp&gt;supp-pdf.tex&lt;/samp&gt;. To view or print the third diagram, this inclusion is necessary, as the TeX fonts (Computer Modern) are not included in the eps files produced by MetaPost by default.
