<text>The NRG Astrodome, formerly and also known as the Houston Astrodome or simply the Astrodome, was the world&#x27;s first multi-purpose, domed sports stadium, located in Houston, Texas, United States. It seated around 50,000 fans, with a record attendance of 68,266 set by a George Strait concert in 2002.

It was financed and assisted in development by Roy Hofheinz, mayor of Houston and known for pioneering modern stadiums. Construction on the stadium began in 1963, more than a year after the ceremonial groundbreaking, and it officially opened in 1965. It served as home to the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1965 until 1999, and the home to the Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL)/National Football League (NFL) from 1968 until 1996, and also the part-time home of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1971 until 1975. Additionally, the Astrodome was the primary venue of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo from 1966 until 2002. When opened, it was named the Harris County Domed Stadium and was nicknamed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;.

After the original natural grass playing surface died, the Astrodome became the first major sports venue to install artificial turf in 1966, which became known as AstroTurf. In another technological first, the Astrodome featured the &quot;Astrolite&quot;, which was the first animated scoreboard. The stadium was renovated in 1988–1989, expanding seating and altering many original features.

By the 1990s, the Astrodome was becoming obsolete. Unable to secure a new stadium, Oilers owner Bud Adams moved the team to Tennessee after 1996, and became the Tennessee Titans in 1999. The Astros played at the dome through 1999, then relocated to Enron Field (now Daikin Park) in 2000.

The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo continued to be held at the Astrodome until the opening of the adjacent NRG Stadium in 2002 (which coincided with the debut of the Houston Texans, the team that replaced the Oilers). Although the Astrodome no longer had any primary tenants, it regularly hosted events during the early 2000s. It was used as a shelter for residents of New Orleans affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The Astrodome was declared non-compliant with fire code by the Houston Fire Department in 2008, and parts of it were demolished in 2013 after several years of disuse. In 2014, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, thus preventing the rest of the structure from being demolished. As of 2024, most of the Astrodome structure is still standing, but it has been closed to the public since 2009 and is currently being used as a storage facility for the surrounding NRG Park. Various plans to redevelop the Astrodome have been proposed since the structure was abandoned.

==History==
===Conception===
Major League Baseball expanded to Houston in 1960, when the National League agreed to add two teams. The Houston Colt .45s (renamed the Astros in 1965) were to begin play in 1962, along with their expansion brethren New York Mets. Roy Hofheinz, a former mayor of Houston, and his group were granted the franchise after they promised to build a covered stadium. It was thought a covered stadium was a must for a major league team to be viable in Houston due to the area&#x27;s subtropical climate and hot summers. Game-time temperatures are usually above in July and August, with high humidity and a likelihood of rain. Hofheinz claimed inspiration for what became the Astrodome from a tour of Rome, where he learned that the builders of the ancient Colosseum installed a giant &quot;velarium&quot; (fabric awning) to shield spectators from the sun.

The Astrodome was conceived by Hofheinz as early as 1952, when he and his daughter Dene were rained out once too often at Buffalo Stadium, home of Houston&#x27;s minor league baseball team, the Houston Buffs. Hofheinz abandoned his interest in The Galleria, and set his sights on bringing major league baseball to Houston.

===Design and construction===
The Astrodome was designed by architects Hermon Lloyd &amp; W. B. Morgan, and Wilson, Morris, Crain and Anderson (Morris Architects). Structural engineering and structural design were performed by Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants of Houston. Credit for the design work on the dome roof structural goes to Dr. G. R. Kiewitt and Mr. Louis O. Bass of Roof Structures, Inc. It was constructed by H. A. Lott, Inc. for Harris County. It stands 18 stories tall, covering . The dome is in diameter and the ceiling is above the playing surface, which itself sits below street level. The air conditioning system was designed by I. A. Naman; other aspects that were considered included visibility (which could be reduced by cigarette smoke), light admittance, and acoustics (requiring approximately the roof area to be covered with sound-absorbing materials), the air handling units were designed to move of air, with approximately 10% of that being fresh air from outside to limit carbon dioxide buildup.
The scoreboard, eventually known as the &quot;Astrolite&quot;, was designed by Fair Play Scoreboards of Des Moines, Iowa. Having designed the scoreboard for Dodger Stadium several years prior, team owner Roy Hofheinz was not impressed with the initial proposal for a much more generic type of scoreboard. Project designer Jack Foster teamed up with a creative professional based in Kansas City to create the first animated scoreboard. Its reported cost was $2.1 million.

The Dome was completed in November 1964, six months ahead of schedule. Many engineering changes were required during construction, including the modest flattening of the supposed &quot;hemispherical roof&quot; to cope with environmentally induced structural deformation and the use of a new paving process called &quot;lime stabilization&quot; to cope with changes in the chemistry of the soil. The air conditioning system was designed by Houston mechanical engineers Israel A. Naman and Jack Boyd Buckley of I. A. Naman + Associates.

The multi-purpose stadium, designed to facilitate both football and baseball, is nearly circular and uses movable lower seating areas. It also ushered in the era of other fully domed stadiums, such as the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, as well as the all now-demolished Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Kingdome in Seattle, and RCA Dome in Indianapolis.

To test what effect the enclosed air-conditioned environment might have on the delivery of breaking balls, Satchel Paige, in full Astros uniform, threw the first pitches at the Astrodome on February 7, 1965. He later concluded that it was a &quot;pitcher&#x27;s paradise&quot;, as the lack of wind allowed for sensitive pitches to maneuver more easily.

Hofheinz had an opulent apartment in the Dome, which was removed when the facility was remodeled in 1988. The seven-floor apartment was adjacent to the right field bleachers and included a shooting gallery, a bowling alley, a chapel, and a presidential suite.

===Opening and reception===
The stadium&#x27;s opening day took place on April 9, 1965. A sold-out crowd of 47,879 watched an exhibition game between the Astros and the New York Yankees. President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird were in attendance, as well as Governor John Connally and Mayor Louie Welch. Governor Connally tossed out the first ball for the first indoor MLB game. Dick &quot;Turk&quot; Farrell of the Astros threw the first pitch. Mickey Mantle had both the first hit (a single) and the first home run in the Astrodome, but the Astros won 2–1 in twelve innings.

President Johnson stopped at the Astrodome that evening en route to his home in Johnson City and paid his respects to baseball and Astros president Roy Hofheinz, a campaign manager for Johnson in the 1940s, just as the second inning got underway. He and Lady Bird watched the opening night game from behind the glass in Judge Hofheinz&#x27;s private box high in the right field just to the right of the giant scoreboard. LBJ ate hors d&#x27;œuvres and chicken and ice cream while watching the game. &quot;Roy, I want to congratulate you; it shows so much imagination&quot;, he was heard to say. Later, he called the stadium &quot;massive&quot; and &quot;beautiful.&quot; Although the president&#x27;s visit overshadowed all others, dignitaries swarmed through the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; during the three days of the exhibition series and for opening night against the Phillies on April 12. Chris Short of the Phillies shut out the Astros on four hits, with 12 strikeouts.

The first artist to play the Astrodome was Judy Garland on December 17, 1965; The Supremes were her opening act, and tickets were priced $1.00 to $7.50. The dome seated 48,000, and another 12,000 seats were added for this show. Paid $43,000 for the one show, Garland appeared on stage at 10 p.m. and sang for forty minutes, with her set of songs including: &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;; &quot;Just in Time&quot;; &quot;My Kind of Town, Houston Is&quot;/&quot;Houston&quot;; &quot;As Long As He Needs Me&quot;; &quot;Joey, Joey, Joey&quot;; &quot;Do it Again&quot;; &quot;What Now My Love?&quot;; &quot;By Myself&quot;; &quot;Rock-A-Bye Your Baby&quot;; &quot;San Francisco&quot;; &quot;Chicago&quot;; and &quot;Over the Rainbow.&quot; Mort Lindsey conducted.

===&quot;The Rainout&quot;===
The Astrodome suffered a rainout on June 15, 1976. The Astros&#x27; scheduled game against the Pittsburgh Pirates was called when massive flooding in the Houston area prevented all but a few fans from reaching the stadium. Both teams had arrived early for practice, but the umpires were several hours late. At 5 pm that day, with only a handful of fans on hand and already several hours behind, the umpires and teams agreed to call the game off. Tables were brought onto the field and the teams ate dinner together. Although the Astros still had a home series with Pittsburgh in August, this game was made up in Pittsburgh in July.

===Recent history===

In 1989, four cylindrical pedestrian ramp columns were constructed outside the Dome for accessibility. This enabled the Astrodome to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

The 1992 Republican National Convention was held at the Astrodome in August of that year. The Astros accommodated the convention by taking a month-long road trip. A manually operated scoreboard debuted that season.

On August 19, 1995, a scheduled preseason game between the Oilers and the San Diego Chargers had to be canceled due to the dilapidated condition of the playing field. Oilers owner Bud Adams demanded a new stadium, but the city of Houston refused to fund it. After years of threats, Adams moved the team to Nashville, Tennessee after the 1996 season. Around that time the Astros also threatened to leave the city unless a new ballpark was built. The retractable-roofed Enron Field (now known as Daikin Park) opened for the 2000 season in downtown Houston.

One of the largest crowds in the Astrodome&#x27;s history, more than 66,746 fans, came on Sunday, February 26, 1995, to see Tejano superstar Selena and her band Los Dinos perform for a sell-out crowd during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Selena y Los Dinos performed two consecutive times before at the Astrodome, breaking previous attendance records each time. This was Selena&#x27;s last televised concert before she was fatally shot on March 31, 1995, by her fan club president.
The Astrodome was joined by a new neighbor in 2002, the retractable-roofed Reliant Stadium (now known as NRG Stadium), which was built to house Houston&#x27;s new NFL franchise, the Houston Texans. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo moved to the new venue in 2003, leaving the Astrodome without any major tenants. The last concert at the Astrodome was George Strait &amp; the Ace in the Hole Band during the 2002 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, before a record crowd of 68,266; the performance was recorded in &quot;For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome&quot;.

===Hurricane Katrina===

On August 31, 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Harris County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the State of Louisiana came to an agreement to allow at least 25,000 evacuees from New Orleans, especially those that were sheltered in the Louisiana Superdome, to move to the Astrodome until they could return home. The evacuation began on September 1, 2005. All scheduled events for the final four months of 2005 at the Astrodome were cancelled. Overflow refugees were held in the surrounding Reliant Park complex. There was a full field hospital inside the Reliant Arena, which cared for the entire Katrina evacuee community.

The entire Reliant Park complex was scheduled to be emptied of hurricane evacuees by September 17, 2005. Originally, the Astrodome was planned to be used to house evacuees until December. However, the surrounding parking lots were needed for the first Houston Texans home game. Arrangements were made to help Katrina evacuees find apartments both in Houston and elsewhere in the United States. By September 16, 2005, the last of the hurricane evacuees living in the Astrodome had been moved out either to the neighboring Reliant Arena or to permanent housing north of Houston. As of September 20, 2005, the remaining Katrina evacuees were relocated to Arkansas due to Hurricane Rita.

==Closure==
In 2008, the facility was cited for numerous code violations. Since then, only maintenance workers and security guards have been allowed to enter the stadium while it is brought up to code. The city council rejected demolition plans on environmental grounds, over concerns that demolition of the Dome might damage the dense development that today closely surrounds it.

==Refurbishment plans==
Numerous renovation/refurbishment plans for the dome have been presented over the years. Houston&#x27;s plan to host the 2012 Summer Olympics included renovating the Astrodome for use as an Olympic Stadium hosting the ceremonies, athletics and soccer finals. Houston became one of the USOC&#x27;s bid finalists, but the organization chose New York City as its candidate city, and the 2012 Summer Olympic Games were held in London, Great Britain by the IOC.

Plans to convert the Astrodome into a luxury hotel were rejected. A proposal to convert the Astrodome into a movie production studio was also considered but rejected. Regardless of the type of renovation, all renovation plans must deal with the problem of occupancy code violations that have basically shuttered the Astrodome for the near future.

In June 2013, a comprehensive plan was unveiled that would have seen the aging structure undergo an almost $200 million renovation into a multi-purpose event/convention facility. The measure would have to have been approved first through a bond election in Harris County for the publicly funded project to go forward or else, officials warned, the iconic structure would be demolished. Voters ended up rejecting the measure on November 5, 2013.

===2013 referendum and aftermath===
On November 5, 2013, voters in Houston turned down a $213 million referendum to renovate and convert the Astrodome into a state-of-the-art convention center and exhibition space known as &quot;New Dome Experience&quot;. Until a final disposition is made, Harris County commissioners will not approve demolition of the dome. &quot;The building&#x27;s still there. There&#x27;s no formal plan or authorization to demolish the building, and until somebody brings such a plan to fruition, there&#x27;s a chance,&quot; according to Willie Loston, executive director of the Harris County Sports and Convention Corporation. &quot;The proposal was rejected by the voters. We&#x27;re back to where we were. Square one,&quot; according to Steve Radack, Harris County commissioner.

Three exterior pedestrian ramp towers were demolished on December 8, 2013. Around that time, the ramp bridges were disconnected from the main structure and the surrounding grass berms were lowered. The ticket booths were also removed along with the interior seats. The demolition was planned prior to the referendum.

===Astrodome Indoor City Park===
After the failed bond election of 2013, the county went back to the drawing board and in August 2014 the County Commissioners Court announced a new plan to save and rejuvenate the Astrodome. The new concept centered around leaving the Dome&#x27;s roof intact and converting the Astrodome&#x27;s vast central space into a covered semi-climate-controlled city park that could have flexible uses for both public recreation and gatherings such as festivals and concerts. The remainder of the complex would have been redeveloped over time using a combination of public and private funds and include elements such as an educational exploration area to encourage students to learn about the sciences and engineering and possibly meeting, exhibition, and restaurant areas that would not only serve the general public, but could also add value to the Houston Texans&#x27; Game Day Experiences and be used by the Rodeo. A key element of this proposal centered around the ability for the county to proceed with the initial phases of the project using existing funds without having to seek voter approval for an expensive bond referendum. However, this plan failed as well.

===Astrodome Revitalization Project===
After the failed plans of past years, the Astrodome Revitalization Project was proposed in September 2016. This plan would turn the dome into a massive underground parking garage. Specifically, the first step would raise the dome floor and use the space underneath that as parking, leaving the floor above for other uses. On September 27, 2016, the Harris County Commissioners approved the first part of the plan. This marked a major turning point for the dome, as some feared if the plan wasn&#x27;t approved the building would be demolished. On January 27, 2017, the Texas Historical Commission voted unanimously to designate the dome a State Antiquities Landmark. Under the designation, the Astrodome may no longer be removed, altered, damaged, salvaged, or excavated without a permit from the commission.
The Harris County Commissioners voted to approve a $105 million renovation plan on February 13, 2018. This plan keeps the parking garage from the Revitalization Project. Construction was set to start in October 2018 and would be completed sometime in 2020. The construction start date was later moved to early 2019 and was expected to finish in 2020. However, as of September 2019, the plan was put on hold with no word when construction might take place. It was announced in November 2019 that the Revitalization Project has been scrapped by Commissioners Court Judge Lina Hidalgo. Hidalgo explained that &quot;The plan that had been designed wouldn&#x27;t have yielded truly a usable building&quot;. As of November, there have been no new plans for the Astrodome.

==Notable events==
=== Baseball ===

*The first home run in the Astrodome was hit by Mickey Mantle off of pitcher Turk Farrell on April 9, 1965, in an exhibition game between the Astros and Yankees. The first official home run was hit by Dick Allen of the Philadelphia Phillies in a game on April 12 of that year—a 2–0 Astros loss.
* Lindsey Nelson, an announcer for the visiting New York Mets, broadcast a game on April 28, 1965, while perched in a gondola suspended from the roof above second base.
*At the beginning of the 1980 playoff series between the Astros and the Phillies, KILT AM radio announced that the Astros&#x27; number one fan &quot;Astroman&quot; would live on top of the Domed stadium and would not come down until the Astros won the World Series. Over the next 10 days Astroman, played by KILT salesman Denver Griffith, lived on top of the Astrodome in a six-man tent. On top of the Astrodome was also a telephone hot line back to KILT radio where Griffith as Astroman would give interviews throughout the day. Astroman was completely cut off and could only get food and drink by lowering a rope with a basket the 18 stories from the top of the Astrodome to the center of the playing field. At one point Griffith got so desperate for food and drink that his mother had to intervene and interrupt an Oilers practice so that the needed supplies could be delivered. Every night a local TV station would sign off with a shot of Astroman on top of the Astrodome waving to a circling news chopper. 
Although the Astros never played in a World Series while at the Dome, they have participated in five Fall Classics at Daikin Park (, , , , and ). By the time the Astros finally won the Series in 2017, they had switched to the American League.
*On October 15, 1986, the Astros and the visiting New York Mets played Game 6 of the 1986 NLCS. The 16-inning contest was at the time the longest game in MLB post season history. The Mets would take a 7–4 lead into the bottom of the 16th inning and hold on for a 7–6 victory over the Astros. Coincidentally, the record was broken in Houston 19 years later at Minute Maid Park during the 2005 NLDS when the Astros won an 18-inning game against the Atlanta Braves.
* On October 3, 1999, the Astros played their final regular season game at the Astrodome, clinching the NL Central Division title with a 9–4 win over the Dodgers. The final Astros game in the stadium occurred 6 days later when the Braves eliminated the Astros in Game 4 of the Division Series.

===Basketball===
*The &#x27;Game of the Century&#x27; between the University of Houston Cougars and the UCLA Bruins took place at the Astrodome on January 20, 1968, before a crowd of 52,963—the record for the largest attendance ever at a basketball game until 2003. The first NCAA regular-season game broadcast nationwide in prime time, the Game of the Century established college basketball as a sports commodity on television, and paved the way for the modern &quot;March Madness&quot; television coverage. The Cougars, coached by Guy V. Lewis, defeated coach John Wooden&#x27;s Bruins, led by Lew Alcindor, 71–69 behind a 39-point scoring effort from Elvin Hayes.
*The Astrodome hosted the 1989 NBA All-Star Game. Attendance was 44,735 and Karl Malone won MVP honors.

===Tennis===
The Battle of the Sexes tennis match occurred on September 20, 1973, aired on ABC with Billie Jean King defeating Bobby Riggs in three straight sets. While more of a publicity stunt than a serious match, it made national headlines and stands as a milestone in the progress of women&#x27;s sports. Scenes were filmed in the Astrodome for the 2017 film &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; which starred Emma Stone and Steve Carell, who played King and Riggs, respectively.

===Boxing &amp; WWE===
*Three-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Muhammad Ali fought Cleveland Williams in the Astrodome in November 1966; Ernie Terrell in February 1967; Jimmy Ellis (boxer) July 1971 and Buster Mathis November 1971.
*On April 1, 2001, WWE (then known as the WWF) hosted WrestleMania X-Seven, which set an all-time record attendance for the Astrodome of 67,925. The main event of the card saw Texas native &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin challenge and defeat WWF Champion The Rock in a No Disqualification Match for the WWF Championship. The card also featured the first of Houston native The Undertaker&#x27;s three WrestleMania victories over Triple H, and the second TLC match for the WWF Tag Team Championship with Edge &amp; Christian defeating WWF Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz. The event was met with universal acclaim, often rated the greatest WrestleMania of all time.

===Motorsports===
The Astrodome held several motorsports events throughout its lifetime. The AMA Grand National Championship held events starting in 1968 and running for 18 years, utilizing the Short Track and TT Steeplechase track configurations in their visits. The AMA Supercross Championship held its first ever indoor Supercross at the Astrodome in 1974, won by Jim Pomeroy. In the mid-1980s the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group held several Stadium Off-Road Racing Series events, showcasing such drivers as Ivan Stewart, Robby Gordon, and Walker Evans (racing driver). Beginning in the early 1980s, both TNT Motorsports and the United States Hot Rod Association held events showcasing mud bogging, truck and tractor pulling, and monster trucks in the Astrodome. After a buy-out of TNT Motorsports, the USHRA continued holding events that would later transform into the current Monster Jam events.

USAC held the Astro Grand Prix as part of the National Midget Championship in the Astrodome on a temporary -mile dirt oval—which was called the Eighth Wonder International Motor Speedway. Gary Bettenhausen and Lee Kunzman won the feature races in 1969, while Tom Bigelow won the overall event championship. The event returned for 1970, hometown favorite A. J. Foyt won the feature race. Bettenhausen won the final edition in 1972.

With the opening of NRG Stadium in late 2002, the events held in early 2002 by AMA Supercross and Monster Jam would be their last in the Astrodome before moving next door for 2003, where they continue to hold events every year.

==Features==

===Scoreboard===

The Astrodome was renowned for its four-story &quot;Astrolite&quot; scoreboard, composed of thousands of light bulbs that featured animation. After every Astros home run, the scoreboard played a minute-long animated celebration of pistols, bulls, and fireworks. The scoreboard remained intact until 1988, when Houston Oilers (now Tennessee Titans) owner Bud Adams suggested its removal to accommodate increased capacity for football, baseball and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Harris County spent $67 million of public funds on renovations. Approximately 15,000 new seats resembling the 1970s rainbow uniform pattern were installed to bring seating capacity to almost 60,000 for football. On September 6, 1988, a final celebration commemorating the scoreboard occurred prior to expansion renovations commencing.

===Playing surface===
The playing surface was originally Tifway 419 Bermuda grass, bred for indoor use. The dome ceiling contained thousands of semi-transparent Lucite panes. Players soon complained that glare from the panes made it hard for them to track fly balls; to solve the problem, two sections of panes were painted white in April. Unfortunately, within a few months the grass died from lack of sunlight. For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead grass. Even before then, the grass tended to hold, then release moisture. The resulting condensation often forced games to be delayed while the grounds crews cleaned up the playing surface.
The solution was to install a new type of artificial grass on the field, ChemGrass, which became known as AstroTurf, named after the stadium. Because the supply of AstroTurf was limited, only a small amount was available at the start of the 1966 season. There was not enough for the entire outfield, so the first phase covered only the traditional grass portion of the infield and foul territory, at a cost of $2 per square foot. It was installed in time to test out during exhibition games against the Dodgers in March. The outfield remained painted dirt until after the All-Star Game. The Astros completed a seven-game home stand on Wednesday, July 6, then went on a road trip on both sides of the All-Star break. The installation of the outfield portion of AstroTurf was completed for the three-game series with the Phillies starting on Tuesday, July 19, finally covering the entire field. Groundskeepers dressed as astronauts kept the turf clean with vacuum cleaners between innings. The infield design had the same large dirt arc and running paths as a traditional natural grass field.

In 1973, the Astros installed an all-AstroTurf infield, except for dirt patches around the bases. This &quot;sliding pit&quot; configuration was introduced by Cincinnati with the opening of Riverfront Stadium on June 30, 1970. It was then installed in the new stadiums in Philadelphia in 1971, and Kansas City in 1973. The artificial turf fields of Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and San Francisco, all installed in 1970, were traditionally configured like the Astrodome and later changed to sliding pits. San Francisco converted in 1971, Pittsburgh in 1973, and St. Louis in 1978. Rogers Centre in Toronto was the last park in the majors to have sliding pits; it opened in 1989 and switched to a traditional dirt skin infield in 2016.

Throughout its history, the Astrodome was known as a pitcher&#x27;s park. The power alleys were never shorter than from the plate; on at least two occasions they were as far as . Over time, it gave up fewer home runs than any other park in the National League. The Astrodome&#x27;s reputation as a pitcher&#x27;s park continued even in the mid-1980s, when the fences were moved in closer than the Metrodome, which had been long reckoned as a hitter&#x27;s park.

<text>is an agency of the city government of Kyoto, Japan that operates municipal subways and city buses within the city. Previously, it also operated trams and trolley buses.

==Subway==
The Kyoto Municipal Subway operates the following two lines:
*Karasuma Line
*Tōzai Line

==Bus==

The are a major means of public transport in Kyoto. The buses have been operating since 1928.

Besides the regular commuter routes, the city bus co-operated the city&#x27;s &quot;Regular Tour Bus&quot; with Keihan Bus.

==Tram==

Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau operated the until 1978.

Kyoto Electric Railway ( narrow gauge) opened in 1895 as the first electric streetcar in Japan in commercial operation. The city government launched separate network of streetcars of in 1912, which absorbed the lines of Kyoto Electric Railway in 1918. Subsequently, the narrow gauge lines were closed, rebuilt in standard gauge, or remained as is (Kitano Line).

In its peak of the 1960s, the network was as follows:
*Loop line
**Gaishū Line (Loop on Higashiyama, Kujō, Nishiōji, Kitaōji streets)
*East-West lines
**Imadegawa Line
**Marutamachi Line
**Shijō Line
**Shichijō Line
*North-South lines
**Senbon Line
**Karasuma Line
**Kawaramachi Line
**Shirakawa Line
**Fushimi Line
**Kitano Line (narrow gauge, closed in 1961)

Because of increasing congestion of road traffic, the tram was abolished in 1978. Part of disused cars were sold to other cities in Japan. As of 2010, Hiroshima Electric Railway and Iyo Railway still operate ex-Kyoto tram cars. One of the cars transferred to Hankai Tramway is now preserved at Old Pueblo Trolley in Tucson, Arizona.
==Trolley bus==
Between 1932 and 1969, the bureau also operated the Umezu Line, a trolley bus service connecting Shijō Ōmiya (Hankyu Ōmiya Station) and Matsuobashi.

==Public relations==
The bureau has had events that promote increased ridership of their transit system. In 2013, &quot;Get on! Kyoto City Subway&quot; campaign with anime-style characters began. The characters and logo are also used for Kyoto City Bus.

<text>Marginal demand in economics is the change in demand for a product or service in response to a specific change in its price. Normally, as prices for goods or services rise, demand falls, and conversely, as prices for goods or services fall, demand rises. A product or service for which price changes cause a relatively big change in demand is said to have &quot;elastic&quot; demand. A product or service where price changes cause a relatively small change in demand is said to have &quot;inelastic&quot; demand.

<text>The Mudi is a herding dog breed from Hungary. It is closely related to the Puli and Pumi, from which it was separated in the 1930s. They continue to be used in herding, as well as participating in a variety of dog sports.

==History== 
The Mudi was first discovered as a breed in 1936 by Dr. Dezso Fenyes in Hungary, where it became known as the &quot;driver dog.&quot; Mudis nearly disappeared shortly after their recognition, as many were killed off during World War II. The breed became recognized by The Federation Cynologique Internationale in 1966.
On Jan. 5th 2022, the Mudi was recognized by the AKC as a purebred breed.

== Description ==
Mudis are a high energy breed, and tend to succeed in herding and agility. Mudis have a lifespan of 12-14 years with proper care. Adult Mudis are 14-18 inches in height and usually weigh around 18-29 lbs.

=== Appearance ===

The Mudi has a medium coat length and a curly coat type. Mudis are born with various lengths of tails from bobtails to long full length tails. Dogs born with short or natural bobtail will be indicated on the FCI pedigree.

=== Exercise and activities ===
The Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

<doc id="274081" wikidata="Q13812" url="?curid=274081" title="Ifugao">
<text>Ifugao, officially the Province of Ifugao (; ), is a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Its capital is Lagawe and it borders Benguet to the west, Mountain Province to the north, Isabela to the east, and Nueva Vizcaya to the south.

The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras and Banaue Rice Terraces are the main tourist attractions in the province. These terraces are believed to have been hand-carved into the mountains 2,000 years ago to plant rice. However, recent research by carbon dating suggests that they were built much later. In 1995, the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras were declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2008 and 2015, the &quot;Hudhud chants of the Ifugao&quot; and the &quot;Punnuk (Tugging rituals and games)&quot; were inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

==Etymology==
Ifugao is named after the term &quot;i-pugo&quot; (&quot;i&quot; [from/people] and &quot;pugo&quot; [hill]), which translates to &quot;people of the hill&quot;. Alternatively, the province&#x27;s name may have come from the word &quot;pugaw&quot;, which means &quot;the cosmic earth&quot;, &quot;ipugaw&quot; then referring to &quot;mortals&quot;. Finally, the name may have been derived from &quot;ipugo&quot;, a type of grain in local mythology given to the people by Matungulan, the god of grains.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
The Spanish had great difficulty in taking over Ifugao, like most of the Cordilleras due to the fierce belief of the Cordillera people of their rights since ancient times. The Ifugao battled colonizers for hundreds of years, even after the state was colonized and was transformed into a part of Nueva Vizcaya province of the Spanish-administered Philippines. In 1891, the Spanish government established Quiangan as a &quot;comandancia-politico-militar&quot; for the Ifugao area. The Spanish occupation in the province ended with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.

In the Northern Philippines, the Ifugao people are one of many minority ethnolinguistic groups best documented by ethnohistoric and anthropological scholars. However, there is a dearth of historical information in the region particularly during the Spanish conquest. Changes in both demographics and cultural orientation among existing communities were to be expected during the time as certain groups resulted to migration towards the highlands. According to studies, the Ifugao succeeded multiple times resisting against the Spanish at conquest. The groups that migrated to the highlands were believed to be those that resisted the Spanish colonial control, which became prevalent in the lowlands. According to Acabado, the rugged nature of the highlands around the Ifugao region did not out rightly provide a hindrance to the Spanish conquest. Other regions that had similar rugged environment as found in Ifugao were subjected to colonial rule. Archeological research shows Ifugao practices of successful resistance by strengthening their political and economic resources. Spanish conquest and population increase was the source of shifting to wet-rice agriculture.

===American colonial era===

On August 18, 1908, Ifugao was separated from Nueva Vizcaya and, along with Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Bontoc, Kalinga and Lepanto, was annexed to the newly created Mountain Province established by the Philippine Commission with the enactment of &quot;Act No. 1876&quot;.

===Japanese occupation===
Ifugao became the center of warfare in the last year of World War II when Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita launched his last stand against the American and Philippine Commonwealth forces at Mount Napulawan. He informally surrendered to Captain Grisham of the 6th US Army in the Philippines based in Kiangan, then formally surrendered at Camp John Hay on September 3, 1945.

===Philippine independence===
On June 18, 1966, &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot; was enacted, and Ifugao was converted into a regular province when the huge Mountain Province was split into four (the other three being Benguet, Mountain Province, and Kalinga-Apayao). Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao were placed under the jurisdiction of the Cagayan Valley region. The capital was moved from Kiangan to Lagawe due to the harsh landscape of Kiangan which made it unsuitable for public transportation and as a capital.

====Post-martial law era====
On July 15, 1987, the Cordillera Administrative Region was established by then-President Corazon Aquino through &quot;Executive Order 220&quot;, and Ifugao was made one of its provinces.

===Contemporary===
In 1992, &quot;Republic Act No. 07173&quot; was enacted, separating several barangays from Kiangan and constituting them under a new municipality known as Asipulo.

Since 1992, the province has observed every September 2 as &quot;Victory Day&quot;, commemorating the valor of Philippine war veterans and the surrender of General Yamashita in the municipality of Kiangan on September 2, 1945.

In 1995, the Batad Rice Terraces, Bangaan Rice Terraces (both in Banaue), Mayoyao Rice Terraces (in Mayoyao), Hungduan Rice Terraces (in Hungduan) and Nagacadan Rice Terraces (in Kiangan, Ifugao) were inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site under the collective name &quot;Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras&quot;.

In 2001, the Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao was chosen as one of the 11 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It was then formally inscribed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.

In 2013, the official Intangible Heritage Book of the Philippine was published, and 13 of its elements were from Ifugao.

In 2014, the Philippines joined other Asian nations in establishing the support and submission of the &quot;Tug of war&quot; — a multinational cultural heritage or Tugging rituals and games, an Intangible Cultural Heritage that encompasses tug-of-war games in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The initial move of the Philippines started in 2013. The Philippines&#x27; part in the new element is represented by the tug-of-war of the Ifugaos (in Barangay Hapao, Municipality of Hungduan) called the &quot;punnuk&quot;. The element is expected to be declared as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2015.

Since the 20th century, the province has been central to the archaeological research of various international institutions, mostly from the United States and the Philippines. A major discovery was the archaeological site of Kiangan, which proved the oral tradition of the Ifugao that the first settlement in the province was in Kiangan.

==Geography==
Ifugao covers a total area of occupying the southeastern section of the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. The province is bordered by Benguet to the west, Mountain Province to the north, Isabela to the east, and Nueva Vizcaya to the south.

Situated within the Cordillera Central mountain range, Ifugao is characterized by rugged terrain, river valleys, and massive forests.

===Administrative divisions===
Ifugao comprises 11 municipalities, all encompassed by a lone legislative district.



==Barangays==
The 11 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 176 barangays, with &quot;Santa Maria&quot; in Alfonso Lista (&quot;Potia&quot;) as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Banga&quot; in Lagawe as the least.

===Climate===
The rainy season in Ifugao begins in July and runs through January. The weather remains cool from November to February.

==Demographics==

The population of Ifugao in the 2020 census was 207,498 people, with a density of .

===Ethnicity===

Based on the 2000 census survey, the Ifugao comprised of the total provincial population of 161,483. Other ethnic groups in the province included the Ilocanos at , Kalahan at , Ayangan at , and Kankanaey at .

The total number of Tinguian in the province of Ifugao is 2,609. (source: Philippine Statistics Authority)

===Languages===
The main dialects of Ifugao are Ifugao and Ilocano.

===Religion===
The Ifugao people have an indigenous religion unique to their traditional culture, and highly significant to the preservation of their life ways and valued traditions. They believe in the existence of thousands of gods, which may enter specific sacred objects such as the bul-ul.

Roman Catholicism has a growing influence in the province with approximately 60% of the population being converted by missionaries. In most areas, especially at the east and south of the province, indigenous traditions have degraded due to the influx of Christianity. In 2014, the Apostolic Vicariate of Bontoc-Lagawe recorded a 61.5% Roman Catholic adherence. The most significant religion other than Roman Catholicism is Protestantism that make up 20%-30% of the population and are mostly found in the central and south-western parts of this province. Other religions includes animism.

== Wet rice cultivation and ritual feasting ==
Shifting to wet rice cultivation is one factor that intensified the social ranking that was already present among the Ifugao society. Those who adopted wet rice cultivation were able to consolidate political resources. “In Ifugao, the adoption of wet-rice agriculture is at the forefront in discussions regarding social ranking vis-à-vis prestige economy.” The Ifugao social status is based on their rice lands and ability to sponsor feasts. One reason being is that an individual needs to be skilled in mobilizing rice terraces, and because rice terraces require labor-intensive work. Stephen Acabado states that since the village was increasing in population, the shift to wet rice cultivation, increase of exotic goods procurement, and finally increase in the distribution of ritual animals indicates “political elaboration as a response to Spanish conquest.” In addition, according to Queeny G. Lapeña and Stephen B. Acabado, in order to successfully resist against a colonizing power it requires a constructive military organization within a complete polity. The Spanish took conquest of the Magat Valley and between 1600 CE and 1700 CE it drove the Ifugao to strategically resettle in the interior of the Cordillera Mountains. Wet-rice agriculture was adopted soon after, and extensive rice terraces were built. This was a subsistence shift for the Ifugao because they cultivated taro before the start of the wet rice cultivation. The author emphasizes that the Ifugao people kept their culture and identity alive by spending large amounts of time in rice fields, since they treated them as ritual areas to “reinforce community solidarity.&quot;

Furthermore, archeologists state that there was an increase of pig consumption. This increase had to do with the increase in ritual feasting. In the Old Kiyyangan Village, there were morphometric evidence of the vast increase in pig consumption. Stephen Acabado states that since the village was increasing in population the shift to wet rice cultivation, increase of exotic goods procurement, and finally increase in the distribution of ritual animals indicates “political elaboration as a response to Spanish conquest”. In the article &quot;Resistance through rituals: The role of Philippine “native pig” (Sus scrofa) in Ifugao feasting and socio-political organization,&quot; the authors conclude that domesticated pigs were intertwined in the maintenance of a rank social order that came into view from the Ifugao&#x27;s resistance against Spanish colonialism.

The domestication of pigs and terrace cultivation within the Ifugao region provides a perfect scenario of how societies respond to challenges and needs in their immediate environment. Since wild pigs were considered unfit for rituals, emphasis was placed towards the domestication pigs, which illustrated an individual&#x27;s social status. The bigger the feast, the higher regard a person was likely to receive from both kin and non-kin members as the ceremony would involve the sharing of sacrificed pig meat. The relationship between the elites who in this case owned the land and the lower social classes worsened during the period after the Spanish conquest. Social immobility became more apparent, since to have enough rice to trade for a pig, one would need to own a rice terrace and vice versa. The cultural value attached to the pig and rice cultivation guaranteed the survival of the communities, in spite of moving to the highlands as they migrated further from the invading Spanish. The importance of rituals and ceremonies meant that people were pushed into practicing pig domestication not merely as a source of food, but as a way of honoring their culture. On the other hand, the cultivation of rice on the terraces required extensive organization of labor, which led to the creation of socio-political shifts. 
== Rice culture ==

The Spanish first described the Ifugao rice terraces in 1801. Though as William Scott notes, &quot;These impressive stone-walled fields, irrigated for both rice and taro, had been known from the time of the first expeditions in to Kiangan in the 1750s...&quot;

Ifugao culture revolves around rice, which is considered a prestige crop. There is an elaborate and complex array of rice culture feasts inextricably linked with taboos and intricate agricultural rites, from rice cultivation to rice consumption. Harvest season calls for grandiose thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites &quot;tungo&quot; or &quot;tungul&quot; (the day of rest) entail a strict taboo of any agricultural work. Partaking of the rice wine (&quot;bayah&quot;), rice cakes, and &quot;moma&quot; (mixture of several herbs, powdered snail shell and betel nut/arecoline which is used as a chewing gum to the Ifugaos) is an indelible practice during the festivities and ritual activities. Agricultural terracing and farming are the principal means of livelihood. Their social status is measured by the number of rice field granaries, family heirlooms, gold earrings, and carabaos (water buffaloes). Prestige is also conferred through time and tradition.

A prayer is said by an elderly woman when harvest begins, directed towards Cabunian, the goddess of rice. Then, a protective prayer is said before the rice is placed in the granary.

The Ifugao solar calendar included a 365-day year, broken down into 13 months of 28 days each, plus one extra day.

Ifugao culture values kinship, family ties, religious and cultural beliefs. Ifugao are unique among all ethnic groups in the mountain province for their narrative literature such as the &quot;hudhud&quot;, an epic dealing with hero ancestors sung in a poetic manner. Also unique to the Ifugao is their woodcarving art, most notably the carved granary guardians &quot;bulul&quot; and the prestige bench of the upper class, the &quot;hagabi&quot;. Their textiles are renowned for their sheer beauty, colorful blankets and clothing woven on looms.

Traditional attire for male Ifugaos consists of a simple G-string. Ifugao women, on the contrary, wear &quot;tapis&quot;, a wraparound skirt.

==UNESCO recognitions in Ifugao==
UNESCO has inscribed two Ifugao elements in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008 and 2015, respectively. UNESCO has also inscribed one Ifugao site with five properties in the World Heritage Site in 1995.

===Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras===

In 1995, the &quot;Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras&quot; was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. UNESCO states:

&quot;For 2,000 years, the high rice fields of the Ifugao have followed the contours of the mountains. The fruit of knowledge handed down from one generation to the next, and the expression of sacred traditions and a delicate social balance, they have helped to create a landscape of great beauty that expresses the harmony between humankind and the environment.&quot;

The inscription has five sites: the Batad Rice Terraces, Bangaan Rice Terraces (both in Banaue), Mayoyao Rice Terraces (in Mayoyao), Hungduan Rice Terraces (in Hungduan) and Nagacadan Rice Terraces (in Kiangan), all in the Ifugao Province, the Philippines. The Banaue Rice Terraces are not included in the inscription, but may be included through an extension nomination to UNESCO, along with other rice terraces sites in other Philippine Cordillera provinces.

===Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao===
In 2001, the Hudhud ni Aliguyon (or Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao) became one of the first 11 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001. The element was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. UNESCO describes the element as follows:

The Hudhud consists of narrative chants traditionally performed by the Ifugao community, which is well known for its rice terraces extending over the highlands of the northern island of the Philippine archipelago. It is practised during the rice sowing season, at harvest time and at funeral wakes and rituals. Thought to have originated before the seventh century, the Hudhud comprises more than 200 chants, each divided into 40 episodes. A complete recitation may last several days. Since the Ifugao’s culture is matrilineal, the wife generally takes the main part in the chants, and her brother occupies a higher position than her husband. The language of the stories abounds in figurative expressions and repetitions and employs metonymy, metaphor and onomatopoeia, rendering transcription very difficult. Thus, there are very few written expressions of this tradition. The chant tells about ancestral heroes, customary law, religious beliefs and traditional practices, and reflects the importance of rice cultivation. The narrators, mainly elderly women, hold a key position in the community, both as historians and preachers. The Hudhud epic is chanted alternately by the first narrator and a choir, employing a single melody for all the verses. The conversion of the Ifugao to Catholicism has weakened their traditional culture. Furthermore, the Hudhud is linked to the manual harvesting of rice, which is now mechanized. Although the rice terraces are listed as a World Heritage Site, the number of growers has been in constant decline.The few remaining narrators, who are already very old, need to be supported in their efforts to transmit their knowledge and to raise awareness among young people.

===Tugging Games and Ritual: Punnuk of the Ifugao===
The Punnuk of the Ifugao was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2015 under the multinational inscription of the &quot;Tugging Rituals and Games&quot; element.

<doc id="274095" wikidata="Q1235503" url="?curid=274095" title="Leonard Peikoff">
<text>Leonard Sylvan Peikoff (; born October 15, 1933) is a Canadian American philosopher. He is an Objectivist and was a close associate of Ayn Rand, who designated him heir to her estate. He is a former professor of philosophy and host of a nationally syndicated radio talk show. He co-founded the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI) in 1985 and is the author of several books on philosophy.

==Early life and career==
Leonard Peikoff was born on October 15, 1933 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to Samuel Peikoff, MD, a surgeon, and his wife Bessie, a band leader. He attended the University of Manitoba from 1950 to 1953 as a pre-med student. However, following his early discussions with Rand, he transferred to New York University to study philosophy, where he received his BA, MA, and PhD degrees in philosophy in 1954, 1957, and 1964, respectively. His doctoral dissertation adviser was the noted American pragmatist philosopher Sidney Hook, and his dissertation dealt with the metaphysical status of the law of noncontradiction. He taught philosophy for many years at various colleges.

==Early involvement in Objectivism==

Peikoff first met Ayn Rand through his cousin Barbara Branden (then Barbara Weidman) in California when he was 17. He reports that this meeting with Rand made him aware of the profound importance of philosophy. When Rand moved to New York City in 1951, Peikoff decided to study philosophy at New York University. While studying at NYU, he frequently discussed philosophy privately with Rand in depth across a range of issues.

Peikoff, along with Nathaniel Branden, Alan Greenspan, Barbara Branden, and a number of other close associates, who jokingly called themselves &quot;The Collective&quot;, met frequently with Rand to discuss philosophy and politics, as well as to read and discuss Rand&#x27;s then-forthcoming novel, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, in her Manhattan apartment. In 1958, Branden founded the Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later renamed the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Objectivism through lectures and educational seminars around the United States. Peikoff was among NBI&#x27;s first lecturers, teaching a course on the history of philosophy. By the early 1960s, NBI had representatives in multiple cities who replayed taped versions of the lectures to local audiences.

Discussions with Peikoff and Allan Gotthelf in the 1960s motivated Rand to complete an extended monograph on concept-formation, &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot;. Rand included Peikoff&#x27;s essay on the &quot;analytic–synthetic dichotomy&quot; when it was published in book form in 1979. Peikoff was also an active participant in Rand&#x27;s 1969–71 workshops on the monograph, as well as subsequent, smaller philosophy workshops at Rand&#x27;s apartment. Peikoff later used the transcripts of these workshops to create an expanded edition of &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot;, which he co-edited with Harry Binswanger.

Following the dissolution of NBI in 1968, Peikoff continued to give private lecture courses on a variety of topics to large Objectivist audiences, and recordings of these have been sold for many years. His lecture courses include: &quot;The History of Philosophy&quot; (in two &quot;volumes&quot; of lectures), &quot;An Introduction to Logic&quot;, &quot;The Art of Thinking&quot;, &quot;Induction in Physics and Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Moral Virtue&quot;, &quot;A Philosophy of Education&quot;, &quot;Understanding Objectivism&quot;, &quot;The Principles of Objective Communication&quot;, and &quot;Eight Great Plays&quot;. Rand endorsed his 1976 lecture series on Objectivism as the best exposition of her philosophy, the only one she knew to be accurate.

Peikoff&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Ominous Parallels&quot;, was both an Objectivist explanation of the rise of the Third Reich and The Holocaust, and a warning that America was being led down the road to totalitarianism because of far-reaching philosophical and cultural parallels between the Weimar Republic and the present-day United States. In her introduction, Rand said it was the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than herself.

==After Rand&#x27;s death==
Rand named Peikoff the legal heir to her estate. As the executor of Rand&#x27;s will, Peikoff handles the copyrights to all of her works, with the exception of &quot;Anthem&quot;, which has passed into the public domain. He has supervised the editing and release of Rand&#x27;s unpublished works in several volumes, which includes her letters, philosophical journals, and the fiction not published in her lifetime; he has also written forewords for all the current printings of her fiction. For several years, he continued Rand&#x27;s tradition of lecturing annually at Boston&#x27;s Ford Hall Forum, and his other lecture appearances have included an address to the cadets at West Point and another while cruising the Greek islands.

In 1985, Peikoff founded the Ayn Rand Institute. Peikoff revised his 1976 lecture course on Rand&#x27;s ideas into book form as &quot;&quot;, published in 1991, the first comprehensive presentation of Objectivism. In the mid-1990s, Peikoff taught courses at the Ayn Rand Institute&#x27;s Objectivist Graduate Center (which was renamed the Objectivist Academic Center in 2000), along with Harry Binswanger and Peter Schwartz.

From 1995 through 1999, Peikoff hosted a nationally syndicated talk-radio show focusing on philosophy and culture. From February 2006 to June 2007, Peikoff posted an online Q&amp;A featuring questions that had been e-mailed to him. This was replaced with a podcast that debuted on October 22, 2007, and continued until October 31, 2016.

Peikoff&#x27;s lectures or books have been used extensively in the works of Allan Gotthelf, Harry Binswanger, Andrew Bernstein, and Tara Smith, writers who are associated with the Ayn Rand Institute, and also in works such as David Kelley&#x27;s &quot;The Evidence of the Senses&quot;, George H. Smith&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and the treatise, &quot;What Art Is: the Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand&quot; by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kahmi, despite these authors&#x27; other differences with him.

Peikoff&#x27;s 1983 lecture course &quot;Understanding Objectivism&quot; was edited into a book of the same title by Michael Berliner, editor of the &quot;Letters of Ayn Rand&quot;, and Peikoff&#x27;s theory of logical induction, first presented in the lecture courses &quot;Induction in Physics and Philosophy&quot; and &quot;Objectivism Through Induction&quot;, has been developed further by David Harriman in his book, &quot;The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics&quot;. In his 2012 book &quot;The DIM Hypothesis,&quot; Peikoff defines the three approaches to cognitive integration—disintegration, integration, and misintegration—and applies the hypothesis to physics, philosophy, education, politics, and other fields.

His articles have appeared in publications as diverse as &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The New Scholasticism&quot;, and his television appearances have ranged from Bill Maher&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; and Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; to C-SPAN panel discussions. He also appears in &quot;Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life&quot;, the Academy Award-nominated documentary by Michael Paxton.

=== Split with David Kelley ===

Peikoff views Objectivism as a &quot;closed system&quot; that consists solely of the philosophical principles Rand herself had articulated, and he considers disagreement with any of these principles a departure from Objectivism. The Ayn Rand Institute promotes Peikoff&#x27;s view of Objectivism.

The closed vs. open issue came to the fore when David Kelley, a philosopher then affiliated with Peikoff and ARI, published his essay &quot;A Question of Sanction&quot;, arguing for greater open-mindedness in working with other groups. Kelley sees Objectivism as an &quot;open system&quot; that can evolve beyond Rand&#x27;s own writings and beliefs. Peikoff presented his objections to Kelley in an article called &quot;Fact and Value,&quot; arguing that Kelley&#x27;s case itself contradicted Rand&#x27;s understanding of the relationship between cognition and evaluation, facts, and moral values. Peikoff concluded that Kelley was not a genuine Objectivist and urged anyone agreeing with Kelley to leave the Objectivist movement. Ultimately, Kelley responded by founding the Institute for Objectivist Studies in 1990, which later changed its name to The Objectivist Center and finally The Atlas Society.

===Library of Congress dispute===
Peikoff inherited many of Rand&#x27;s manuscripts. During her lifetime, Rand had made a statement that she would bequeath her manuscripts to the Library of Congress. She later had reservations, and the bequest was not part of Rand&#x27;s will. However, after her death, the Library of Congress requested the manuscripts. In July 1991, Peikoff had an assistant deliver the manuscripts of Rand&#x27;s novels, except for the first and last pages of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, which he had framed. In their stead, he had the pages photocopied so that the manuscripts would be &quot;complete&quot;. On August 16, 1998, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an article about Peikoff, including a joke he made about &quot;stealing&quot; the pages from the Library of Congress. The library demanded that he deliver the pages to them, deeming them to be U. S. government property. A complaint from the United States Department of Justice followed in October 2000, claiming over a million dollars in damages unless Peikoff turned over the pages. After consulting his lawyer, Peikoff released the pages to a representative of the Library of Congress.

==Thought==

===Epistemology===
In his book &quot;The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics&quot; (which he co-wrote with physicist David Harriman), Peikoff argues that there is no problem of induction, because philosophy is itself an inductive science and, therefore, that any attempt to deny the validity of induction contradicts itself by implicitly accepting the validity of induction. Peikoff and Harriman also argue that scientific claims verified by induction should be considered true until new evidence warrants modifying or amending them because scientific knowledge derived from induction is contextual. In other words, those who on the basis of conclusive evidence make inductive scientific claims regarding science cannot argue that their claims are subject to no possible modification but can argue that they are the only rational claims that can be believed based on the available evidence. They conclude that the same process of induction is essential to every rational field (except mathematics) and that, as a result, truth in any such field possesses the same objectivity as that of physics.

===Politics===
Peikoff supports &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, arguing that the role of government in society should be limited to night-watchman state conceptions of protecting individuals from the initiation of force and fraud. He opposes taxation, public education, welfare, and business regulations. He also opposes laws regulating pornography, euthanasia, or stem cell research. He is a supporter of abortion rights but criticizes defenders of abortion who label themselves &quot;pro-choice&quot;, arguing that the term ignores the deeper philosophical issues involved. He believes that circumcision of a child too young to consent should be a crime and is evil.

He also continues Rand&#x27;s opposition to libertarianism, remaining sharply opposed to any description of Objectivist political philosophy as &quot;libertarian&quot; and to any collaboration with most libertarian groups. He has been critical of American foreign policy, considering both neoconservative and libertarian views self-sacrificial. He objects to the terms &quot;isolationist&quot; or &quot;interventionist&quot; to describe his foreign policy views, stating that the only &quot;intervention&quot; the United States should enact is war and &quot;only and when it is in self-defense.&quot;

====Elián González====
Peikoff campaigned for Elián González&#x27; to remain in Florida, rather than returning to his father in Cuba, stating, &quot;To send a child to rot in the prison of Cuba for the alleged sake of his own well-being is criminal hypocrisy. To send him there in order to preserve his father&#x27;s rights is absurdity, since there are no parental or other rights in Cuba. To send him there because &#x27;He needs a father, no matter what&#x27; is a mindless bromide. Does he need a father who has no choice but to watch his son being broken in mind and starved in body?&quot;

====Palestinians and Israel====
Peikoff claims that Palestinian people prior to the establishment of the State of Israel consisted solely of &quot;nomadic tribes meandering across the terrain,&quot; and that &quot;the Arabs&quot; today have no concept of property rights; indeed, that their &quot;primitivist&quot; antagonism to such rights is the root cause of Arab terrorism. He argues that Israel is a moral beacon which should not return any territory to Arabs or even negotiate with them.

====Iran and nuclear weapons====
Peikoff considers the nationalization of Middle Eastern oil properties developed by Western corporations—beginning with Iran in 1951—to be in violation of international law and refers to such efforts as &quot;confiscation&quot; and supports covert actions to reverse such efforts. He advocates bringing an end to what he claims are &quot;terrorist states&quot; and has routinely lobbied for regime change in Iran &quot;as quickly as possible and with the fewest U.S. casualties, regardless of the countless innocents caught in the line of fire,&quot; not ruling out the use of nuclear weapons, arguing that moral responsibility for innocent deaths would lie with their governments rather than the United States.

====Presidential endorsements====
In April 1992, Peikoff endorsed &quot;any Democrat nominated by his party for the Presidency&quot;, citing President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;truly disgraceful&quot; record, specifically tax hikes, support for new employee protections, his foreign trade policy, foreign aid to Russia, alleged hostility to Israel, the Gulf War, anti-abortion and anti-obscenity views, and alleged failure to defend Salman Rushdie&#x27;s freedom of speech during &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; controversy.

In 2004, Peikoff endorsed John Kerry (despite thinking of Kerry as a &quot;disgustingly bad&quot; candidate) against George W. Bush (whom he called &quot;apocalyptically bad&quot;), on the basis of Bush&#x27;s religiosity and his refusal to crush Islamic regimes, especially Iran, along with his &quot;doomed&quot; economic policies. In advance of the 2006 elections, Peikoff recommended voting only for Democrats, to forestall what he sees is a rise in influence of the religious right, adding:

Of the 2008 United States presidential election, Peikoff said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t dream of voting&quot;, saying that the Republicans should be &quot;wiped out&quot; or &quot;severely punished&quot; for their association with the religious right. Furthermore, he characterized Barack Obama as &quot;anti-American&quot; and a &quot;lying phoney&quot; with troubling connections to both Islam and Reverend Jeremiah Wright. He labelled Obama&#x27;s running mate Joe Biden an &quot;enjoyably hilarious windbag&quot;, and their Republican opponents John McCain and Sarah Palin as a &quot;tired moron&quot; and an &quot;opportunist&quot;, respectively.

In a 2010 podcast, Peikoff explained why he supports immigration restrictions in the current context of the welfare state, and why he does not see this as a contradiction to Objectivism&#x27;s general rejection of immigration restrictions. In another 2010 podcast, Peikoff explained that he does not support the building of a mosque near Ground Zero in New York City, arguing that property rights are always contextual and that preventing the construction is a wartime necessity. Similarly, he supported the French ban on the &quot;burqa&quot;.

In September 2012, Peikoff endorsed Mitt Romney for the Presidency, citing President Obama&#x27;s alleged nihilism, taxation, economic and energy policies, Obamacare, and his use of executive orders. However, Peikoff was not enthusiastic in his endorsement of Romney, calling him an &quot;appeasing, directionless&quot; candidate with &quot;no political convictions&quot; who would be useful for buying time. For the same reason, he endorsed the Republican Congressional nominees. Afterwards, he called Obama&#x27;s re-election a &quot;catastrophe&quot;, &quot;the worst political event ever to occur in the history of this continent&quot; and &quot;worse than the Civil War&quot;.

==Personal life==
Peikoff has been married four times and divorced three. By his second wife, Cynthia, Peikoff has a daughter, Kira Peikoff, a novelist. His third ex-wife is Objectivist philosopher Amy Lynn Peikoff. His fourth and current wife is Grace Davis.

<doc id="274097" wikidata="Q2241601" url="?curid=274097" title="Faces (1968 film)">
<text>Faces is a 1968 American drama film written, produced, and directed by John Cassavetes—his fourth directorial work. It depicts, shot in &quot;cinéma vérité&quot;-style, the final stages of the disintegrating marriage of a middle-aged couple, played by John Marley and newcomer Lynn Carlin. Cassavetes regulars Gena Rowlands, Seymour Cassel, Fred Draper, and Val Avery also star.

At the 29th Venice International Film Festival, the film won the Pasinetti Prize and the Best Actor Award (for Marley). At the 41st Academy Awards, it received three Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (for Cassel), and Best Supporting Actress (for Carlin). Initial critical reception to the film was somewhat polarized, but it went on to gain widespread acclaim, and is now considered one of the most demonstrative and influential works of the New Hollywood movement. In 2011, &quot;Faces&quot; was added to the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Richard Forst is the middle-aged chairman of the board of a finance corporation. After a meeting about potentially funding a film project, he and his coworker and friend Freddie go to a bar, where they meet some women and go home with Jeannie Rapp, a prostitute. The trio laugh and dance, until Freddie, sensing that Jeannie likes Richard more than him, breaks the mood by asking Jeannie how much she charges. An uncomfortable interaction follows, and Freddie leaves. Richard leaves shortly thereafter, but not before sharing a kiss with Jeannie.

At home, Richard and his wife, Maria, have a conversation about gender politics over dinner that is alternately cold and marked by hysterical laughter. They briefly touch on their relationship before tensely retiring to separate parts of the house, but, after a bit, Richard finds Maria and tells her that he wants a divorce. Her initial laughter fades when he says he is serious, and he calls Jeannie to arrange to meet her and leaves.

After Jeannie fails to meet Richard at a nightclub, he goes to her house, where he finds her and a friend entertaining two businessmen from out of town. As Jeannie had diplomatically been trying to leave to meet Richard, Jim McCarthy, the more senior of the out of town businessmen, invites Richard in, and the jealousy in the air leads to posturing between him and Richard—they even get physical before returning to verbal digs and exchanging old jokes. Eventually, the businessmen leave with Jeannie&#x27;s friend, who calls another woman for Jim, and Richard and Jeannie spend the night together. He tells her not to get serious, and she tells him that she is starting to have feelings for him.

Meanwhile, Maria and three of her married friends go to the Whisky a Go Go, where they sit and watch the dancers. A young man named Chet comes over and tries to get Maria to dance with him, but she refuses, and her friend Florence gets up instead. The quartet go back to Maria&#x27;s house, where Chet puts on some music and begins to dance, until Maria turns off the stereo and tries to have a polite conversation. They talk about social norms and the differences between the worldviews of their husbands and Chet&#x27;s younger generation, and Chet goes along, though he has a hard time keeping a straight face. Florence asks him to get up and dance, and he makes up songs about Florence and Billie Mae to fill the silence. Just as Louise, Freddie&#x27;s very prim wife, is starting to loosen up, Chet says he feels they are being foolish, offending Louise, who goes home. Billie Mae also leaves, and Florence asks Chet to drive her home. Alone, Maria closes up the house, but Chet returns, and he and Maria make love.

In the morning, Jeannie returns to her bedroom after doing some tidying up to see Richard getting dressed. Feeling that he is slipping away from her, she lightheartedly tries to remind him of how close they were the night before. He asks her to stop being silly and be herself, she says she does not know how else to be, and they part, reciting &quot;Peter Piper&quot; and laughing.

Chet awakens to find Maria unconscious in the bathroom, having attempted suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Deciding against calling for an ambulance, he puts her in the shower, gives her coffee, walks her around, makes her vomit, and repeatedly slaps her. She gradually revives, and they have a genuine conversation and hold each other. Richard arrives, surprising them, and he catches Chet jumping out the bedroom window. Hypocritically, he becomes furious with Maria for cheating on him, but, worn out after her suicide attempt, she is not intimidated and responds by saying that she hates her life and does not love him. Silent now, Richard gets cigarettes, and he and Maria sit on their staircase like strangers, get up and pass each other without acknowledgement, and go to different floors.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Faces&quot; was Cassavetes&#x27; fourth directorial work, and was entirely self-financed by him and Rowlands, his wife. The cast allegedly worked for no pay, but were promised profit participation. Filming, including protracted rehearsals, took place over the course of eight months in locations throughout Los Angeles, including Cassavetes&#x27; house. The film was shot on high-contrast 16 mm black and white film stock.

Lynn Carlin had no prior acting experience when she was cast as Maria Forst. She was working as a secretary for Robert Altman at the time, and Cassavetes often hired her as a script reader and casting assistant. After she was fired by Altman, Cassavetes cast her in &quot;Faces&quot;, and her debut performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Steven Spielberg worked as an unpaid runner on the film during part of production.

==Versions==
As is the case with several of Cassavetes&#x27; films, several different versions of &quot;Faces&quot; are known to exist (though it was generally assumed that, after creating the general release print, Cassavetes destroyed the alternative versions). The film was initially screened in Canada with a running time of 183 minutes, after which Cassavetes cut it down to 130 minutes.

While the 130-minute version of the film is the one preferred by Cassavetes and that went into general release, a print of a longer, 147-minute version of the film was accidentally later found by Ray Carney and deposited in the Library of Congress. The opening 17 minutes of this print were included as a special feature in The Criterion Collection&#x27;s box set &quot;John Cassavetes: Five Films&quot;, though Carney has said that there are numerous differences between the two films throughout their running times.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and wrote that it &quot;tenderly, honestly, and uncompromisingly examines the way we really live&quot;. Manny Farber wrote that &quot;Carlin is near perfection, playing the deepest well of unexplored emotions as the wife of a rubber-faced business wow who seems like a detestable ham walk-on until he surprisingly lodges into the film&#x27;s center for good.&quot; Paul Schrader, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot;, called &quot;Faces&quot; &quot;a film with a confused on-screen life, but with a rich cocktail party life-span.&quot; Pauline Kael, however, responded negatively to the film, criticizing the &quot;badly performed&quot; acting and &quot;crudely conceived&quot; scenes.

In a retrospective review for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, Jeremiah Kipp wrote: &quot;Cassavetes was interested in actors and their freak-show intensities, and their performances give his films a hyper-real quality.&quot; On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 26 critics&#x27; reviews of the film are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

=== Awards and nominations ===

===Recognition===
In 2011, &quot;Faces&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The Registry called the film &quot;an example of cinematic excess&quot;, whose extended confrontations revealed &quot;emotions and relations of power between men and women that rarely emerge in more conventionally structured films&quot;.

===Influence===
&quot;Faces&quot;—and other Cassavetes projects—had a significant creative impact on Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, and Robert Altman.

James Benning&#x27;s &quot;Faces&quot; (2010) is a found footage remake or reconstruction of Cassavetes&#x27; film. It is exactly as long as the original, but consists entirely of silent, slowed-down close-ups of the characters, which are on screen for as the same amount of time as they are in the original.

<doc id="274099" wikidata="Q855270" url="?curid=274099" title="Ancient Greek religion">
<text>Religious practices in ancient Greece encompassed a collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology, in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. The application of the modern concept of &quot;religion&quot; to ancient cultures has been questioned as anachronistic. The ancient Greeks did not have a word for &#x27;religion&#x27; in the modern sense. Likewise, no Greek writer is known to have classified either the gods or the cult practices into separate &#x27;religions&#x27;. Instead, for example, Herodotus speaks of the Hellenes as having &quot;common shrines of the gods and sacrifices, and the same kinds of customs&quot;.

Most ancient Greeks recognized the twelve major Olympian gods and goddesses—Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Ares, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Hephaestus, Hermes, and either Hestia or Dionysus—although philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to assume a single transcendent deity. The worship of these deities, and several others, was found across the Greek world, though they often have different epithets that distinguished aspects of the deity, and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-Hellenic scheme.

The religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of Ionia in Asia Minor, to Magna Graecia (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as Massalia (Marseille). Early Italian religions such as the Etruscan religion were influenced by Greek religion and subsequently influenced much of the ancient Roman religion.

==Beliefs==
&quot;There was no centralization of authority over Greek religious practices and beliefs; change was regulated only at the civic level. Thus, the phenomenon we are studying is not in fact an organized &quot;religion&quot;. Instead we might think of the beliefs and practices of Greeks in relation to the gods as a group of closely related &quot;religious dialects&quot; that resembled each other far more than they did those of non-Greeks.&quot;

===Theology===

Ancient Greek theology was polytheistic, based on the assumption that there were many gods and goddesses, as well as a range of lesser supernatural beings of various types. There was a hierarchy of deities, with Zeus, the king of the gods, having a level of control over all the others, although he was not almighty. Some deities had dominion over certain aspects of nature. For instance, Zeus was the sky-god, sending thunder and lightning, Poseidon ruled over the sea and earthquakes, Hades projected his remarkable power throughout the realms of death and the Underworld, and Helios controlled the sun. Other deities ruled over abstract concepts; for instance Aphrodite controlled love. All significant deities were visualized as &quot;human&quot; in form, although often able to transform themselves into animals or natural phenomena.

While being immortal, the gods were certainly not all-good or even all-powerful. They had to obey fate, known to Greek mythology as the Moirai, which overrode any of their divine powers or wills. For instance, in mythology, it was Odysseus&#x27; fate to return home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, and the gods could only lengthen his journey and make it harder for him, not stop him.
The gods had human vices and many behaved with arguably less morality than a typical human. They interacted with humans, sometimes even spawning children—called demigods—with them. At times, certain gods would be opposed to others, and they would try to outdo each other. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Aphrodite, Ares, and Apollo support the Trojan side in the Trojan War, while Hera, Athena, and Poseidon support the Greeks (see theomachy).

Some gods were specifically associated with a certain city. Athena was associated with Athens, Apollo with Delphi and Delos, Zeus with Olympia and Aphrodite with Corinth. But other gods were also worshipped in these cities. Other deities were associated with nations outside of Greece; Poseidon was associated with Ethiopia and Troy, and Ares with Thrace.

Identity of names was not a guarantee of a similar cultus; the Greeks themselves were well aware that the Artemis worshipped at Sparta, the virgin huntress, was a very different deity from the Artemis who was a many-breasted fertility goddess at Ephesus. Though worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another, and though most larger cities had temples to several major gods, the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end.
Ancient sources for Greek religion tell a good deal about cult but very little about creed, in no small measure because the Greeks in general considered what one believed to be much less importance than what one did.

===Afterlife===

The Greeks believed in an underworld inhabited by the spirits of the dead. One of the most widespread areas of this underworld was ruled by Hades, a brother of Zeus, and was also known as Hades (originally called &#x27;the place of Hades&#x27;). Other well-known realms are Tartarus, a place of torment for the damned, and Elysium, a place of pleasures for the virtuous. In the early Mycenaean religion all the dead went to Hades, but the rise of mystery cults in the Archaic age led to the development of places such as Tartarus and Elysium.

A few Greeks, like Achilles, Alcmene, Amphiaraus, Ganymede, Ino, Melicertes, Menelaus, Peleus, and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, were considered to have been physically immortalized and brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or beneath the ground. Such beliefs are found in the most ancient Greek sources, such as Homer and Hesiod. This belief remained strong even into the Christian era. For most people at the moment of death there was, however, no hope of anything but continued existence as a disembodied soul.

Some Greeks, such as the philosophers Pythagoras and Plato, also embraced the idea of reincarnation, though this was only accepted by a few. Epicurus taught that the soul was simply atoms which were dissolved at death, so one ceased to exist on dying.

===Mythology===

Greek religion had an extensive mythology. It consisted largely of stories of the gods and how they interacted with humans. Myths often revolved around heroes and their actions, such as Heracles and his twelve labors, Odysseus and his voyage home, Jason and the quest for the Golden Fleece and Theseus and the Minotaur.

Many species existed in Greek mythology. Chief among these were the gods and humans, though the Titans (who predated the Olympian gods) also frequently appeared in Greek myths. Lesser species included the half-man-half-horse centaurs, the nature-based nymphs (tree nymphs were dryads, sea nymphs were Nereids) and the half-man, half-goat satyrs. Some creatures in Greek mythology were monstrous, such as the one-eyed giant Cyclopes, the sea beast Scylla, whirlpool Charybdis, Gorgons, and the half-man, half-bull Minotaur.

There was no set Greek cosmogony, or creation myth. Different religious groups believed that the world had been created in different ways. One Greek creation myth was told in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. It stated that at first there was only a primordial deity called Chaos, after which came various other primordial gods, such as Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, who then gave birth to more gods, the Titans, who then gave birth to the first Olympians.

The mythology largely survived and was expanded to form the later Roman mythology. The Greeks and Romans were literate societies, and much mythology, although initially shared orally, was written down in the forms of epic poetry (such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the &quot;Argonautica&quot;) and plays (such as Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot; and Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Frogs&quot;). The mythology became popular in Christian post-Renaissance Europe, where it was often used as a basis for the works of artists like Botticelli, Michelangelo and Rubens.

===Morality===
One of the most important moral concepts to the Greeks was aversion to hubris. Hubris constituted many things, from rape to desecration of a corpse, and was a crime in Athens. Although pride and vanity were not considered sins themselves, the Greeks emphasized moderation. Pride only became hubris when it went to extremes, like any other vice. The same was thought of eating and drinking. Anything done to excess was not considered proper. Ancient Greeks placed, for example, importance on athletics and intellect equally. In fact many of their competitions included both. Pride was not evil until it became all-consuming or hurtful to others.

===Sacred texts===
The Greeks had no religious texts they regarded as &quot;revealed&quot; scriptures of sacred origin, but very old texts including Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the Homeric hymns (regarded as later productions today), Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; and &quot;Works and Days&quot;, and Pindar&#x27;s Odes were regarded as authoritative and perhaps inspired; they usually begin with an invocation to the Muses for inspiration. Plato even wanted to exclude the myths from his ideal state described in the &quot;Republic&quot; because of their low moral tone.

While some traditions, such as Mystery cults, upheld certain texts as canonic within their praxis, such texts were respected but not necessarily accepted as canonic outside their circle. In this field, of particular importance are certain texts referring to Orphic cults: multiple copies, ranging from between 450 BCE and 250 CE, have been found in various parts of the Greek world. Even the words of the oracles never became a sacred text. Other texts were specially composed for religious events, and some have survived within the lyric tradition; although they had a cult function, they were bound to performance and never developed into a common, standard prayer form comparable to the Christian Pater Noster. An exception to this rule were the already named Orphic and Mystery rituals, which, in this, set themselves aside from the rest of the Greek religious system. Finally, some texts called () (sacred texts) by the ancient sources, originated from outside the Greek world, or were supposedly adopted in remote times, representing yet more different traditions within the Greek belief system.

==Practices==
===Ceremonies===

The lack of a unified priestly class meant that a unified, canonic form of the religious texts or practices never existed; just as there was no unified, common sacred text for the Greek belief system, there was no standardization of practices. Instead, religious practices were organized on local levels, with priests normally being magistrates for the city or village, or gaining authority from one of the many sanctuaries. Pausanias notes that the priest of the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea was a boy, who held office only until reaching the age of puberty. Some priestly functions, like the care for a particular local festival, could be given by tradition to a certain family. To a large extent, in the absence of &quot;scriptural&quot; sacred texts, religious practices derived their authority from tradition, and &quot;every omission or deviation arouses deep anxiety and calls forth sanctions&quot;.

Greek ceremonies and rituals were mainly performed at altars, which were never inside temples, but often just outside, or standing by themselves somewhere. These were typically devoted to one or a few gods, and supported a statue of the particular deity. Votive deposits were left at the altar, such as food, drinks, as well as precious objects. Sometimes animal sacrifices were performed here, with most of the flesh taken for eating and the offal burnt as an offering to the gods. Libations, often of wine, would be offered to the gods as well, not only at shrines, but also in everyday life, such as during a symposium.

One rite of passage was the amphidromia, celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child. Childbirth was extremely significant to Athenians, especially if the baby was a boy. One ceremony was pharmakos, a ritual involving expelling a symbolic scapegoat such as a slave or an animal, from a city or village in a time of hardship. It was hoped that by casting out the ritual scapegoat, the hardship would go with it.

===Sacrifice===

Worship in Greece typically consisted of sacrificing domestic animals at the altar with hymn and prayer. The altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all. The animal, which should be perfect of its kind, was decorated with garlands and the like, and led in procession to the altar; a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife led the way. After various rituals, the animal was slaughtered over the altar. As it fell, all the women present &quot;[cried] out in high, shrill tones&quot;. Its blood was collected and poured over the altar. It was butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity&#x27;s portion of the offering, while the meat was removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasted it on the spot. The temple usually kept the skin to sell to tanners. That humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity did not escape the Greeks, and was often the subject of humor in Greek comedy.
The animals used were, in order of preference, bulls or oxen, cows, sheep (the most common sacrifice), goats, pigs (with piglets being the cheapest mammal), and poultry (but rarely other birds or fish). Horses and asses are seen on some vases in the Geometric style (900–750 BCE), but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to Greece, and it has been suggested that Greek preferences in this matter were established earlier. The Greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviors as showing this. Divination by examining parts of the sacrificed animal was much less important than in Roman or Etruscan religion, or Near Eastern religions, but was practiced, especially of the liver, and as part of the cult of Apollo. Generally, the Greeks put more faith in observing the behavior of birds.

For a smaller and simpler offering, a grain of incense could be thrown on the sacred fire, and outside the cities farmers made simple sacrificial gifts of plant produce as the &quot;first fruits&quot; were harvested. The libation, a ritual pouring of fluid, was part of everyday life, and libations with a prayer were often made at home whenever wine was drunk, with just a part of the cup&#x27;s contents, the rest being drunk. More formal ones might be made onto altars at temples, and other fluids such as olive oil and honey might be used. Although the grand form of sacrifice called the hecatomb (meaning 100 bulls) might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands.
The evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially Homer&#x27;s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the gods&#x27; favor. For example, in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; Eumaeus sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master Odysseus. But in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which partly reflects very early Greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice.

These sacrificial practices share much with recorded forms of sacrificial rituals known from later. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer&#x27;s epic poems may shed some light onto the view of gods as members of society, rather than external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.

It has been suggested that the Chthonic deities, distinguished from Olympic deities by typically being offered the holocaust mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native Pre-Hellenic religion, and that many of the Olympian deities may come from the Proto-Greeks who overran the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula in the late third millennium BCE.

===Festivals===
Various religious festivals were held in ancient Greece. Many were specific only to a particular deity or city-state. For example, the festival of Lykaia was celebrated in Arcadia in Greece, which was dedicated to the pastoral god Pan. Like the other Panhellenic Games, the ancient Olympic Games were a religious festival, held at the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. Other festivals centered on Greek theatre, of which the Dionysia in Athens was the most important. More typical festivals featured a procession, large sacrifices and a feast to eat the offerings, and many included entertainments and customs such as visiting friends, wearing fancy dress and unusual behavior in the streets, sometimes risky for bystanders in various ways. Altogether the year in Athens included some 140 days that were religious festivals of some sort, though they varied greatly in importance.

==Sanctuaries and temples==
The main Greek temple building sat within a larger precinct or temenos, usually surrounded by a peribolos fence or wall; the whole is usually called a &quot;sanctuary&quot;. The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there. The tenemos might include many subsidiary buildings, sacred groves or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves.

The earliest Greek sanctuaries probably lacked temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited, and the subject is controversial. A typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a tenemos, often around a sacred grove, cave, rock (baetyl) or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings. Many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities. This process was certainly under way by the 9th century, and probably started earlier.

The temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the sacrifices and rituals dedicated to the respective deity took place outside them, at altars within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large. As the centuries passed both the inside of popular temples and the area surrounding them accumulated statues and small shrines or other buildings as gifts, and military trophies, paintings and items in precious metals, effectively turning them into a type of museum.

Some sanctuaries offered oracles, people who were believed to receive divine inspiration in answering questions put by pilgrims. The most famous of these by far was the female priestess called the Pythia at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and that of Zeus at Dodona, but there were many others. Some dealt only with medical, agricultural or other specialized matters, and not all represented gods, like that of the hero Trophonius at Livadeia.

===Cult images===
The temple was the house of the deity it was dedicated to, who in some sense resided in the cult image in the &quot;cella&quot; or main room inside, normally facing the only door. The cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size. In early days these were in wood, marble or terracotta, or in the specially prestigious form of a chryselephantine statue using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework. The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and Phidias&#x27;s Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon in Athens, both colossal statues, now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from Delphi have been excavated. Bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until Hellenistic times. Early images seem often to have been dressed in real clothes, and at all periods images might wear real jewelry donated by devotees.

The acrolith was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body. A xoanon was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu lingam; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity, even when a new statue was the main cult image. Xoana had the advantage that they were easy to carry in processions at festivals. The Trojan Palladium, famous from the myths of the Epic Cycle and supposedly ending up in Rome, was one of these. The sacred boulder or baetyl is another very primitive type, found around the Mediterranean and Ancient Near East.
Many of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the Apollo Barberini, can be credibly identified. A very few actual originals survive, for example, the bronze Piraeus Athena ( high, including a helmet). The image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs.

It used to be thought that access to the &quot;cella&quot; of a Greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions. In recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules. Pausanias was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century CE who declares that the special intention of his travels around Greece was to see cult images, and usually managed to do so.

It was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender (with either men or women forbidden), or even more tightly. Garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity. In some places visitors were asked to show they spoke Greek; elsewhere Dorians were not allowed entry. Some temples could only be viewed from the threshold. Some temples are said never to be opened at all. But generally Greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the &quot;cella&quot;. Once inside the &quot;cella&quot; it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; Cicero saw a bronze image of Heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees. Famous cult images such as the Statue of Zeus at Olympia functioned as significant visitor attractions.

== Role of women ==

In addition to the role that women performed in sacrifices, the only public roles that Greek women could perform were priestesses; either &quot;hiereiai&quot;, meaning &quot;sacred women&quot;, or , a term for lesser attendants. As priestesses, they gained social recognition and access to more luxuries than other Greek women who worked or stayed in the home. They were mostly from local elite families; some roles required virgins, who typically only served for a year or so before marriage, while other roles went to married women. Women who voluntarily chose to become priestesses received an increase in social and legal status to the public, and after death, they received a public burial site. Greek priestesses had to be healthy and of a sound mind, the reasoning being that the ones serving the gods had to be as high-quality as their offerings. This was also true of male Greek priests.

It is contested whether there were gendered divisions when it came to serving a particular god or goddess, who was devoted to what god, gods and/or goddesses could have both priests and priestesses to serve them. Gender specifics did come into play when it came to who would perform certain acts of sacrifice or worship. Per the significance of the male or female role to a particular god or goddess, a priest would lead the priestess or the reverse. In some Greek cults priestesses served both gods and goddesses; Pythia, or female Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, and that at Didyma were priestesses, but both were overseen by male priests. The festival of Dionosyus was practiced by both and the god was served by women and female priestesses known as the Gerarai or the venerable ones.

There were segregated religious festivals in Ancient Greece; the Thesmophoria, Plerosia, Kalamaia, Adonia, and Skira were festivals that were only for women. The Thesmophoria festival and many others represented agricultural fertility, which was considered to be closely connected to women. It gave women a religious identity and purpose in Greek religion, in which the role of women in worshipping goddesses Demeter and her daughter Persephone reinforced traditional lifestyles. The festivals relating to agricultural fertility were valued by the polis because this is what they traditionally worked for; women-centered festivals that involved private matters were less important. In Athens the festivals honoring Demeter were included in the calendar and promoted by Athens. They constructed temples and shrines like the Thesmophorion, where women could perform their rites and worship.

==Mystery religions==
Those who were not satisfied by the public cult of the gods could turn to various mystery religions that operated as cults into which members had to be initiated in order to learn their secrets.

Here, they could find religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the afterlife, a communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship.

Some of these mysteries, like the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, were ancient and local. Others were spread from place to place, like the mysteries of Dionysus. During the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire, exotic mystery religions became widespread, not only in Greece, but all across the empire. Some of these were new creations, such as Mithras, while others had been practiced for hundreds of years before, like the Egyptian mysteries of Osiris.

==History==
===Origins===
Mainstream Greek religion appears to have developed out of Proto-Indo-European religion and although very little is known about the earliest periods there are suggestive hints that some local elements go back even further than the Bronze Age or Helladic period to the farmers of Neolithic Greece. There was also clearly cultural evolution from the Late Helladic Mycenaean religion of the Mycenaean civilization. Both the literary settings of some important myths and many important sanctuaries relate to locations that were important Helladic centers that had become otherwise unimportant by Greek times.

The Mycenaeans perhaps treated Poseidon, to them a god of earthquakes as well as the sea, as their chief deity, and forms of his name along with several other Olympians are recognizable in records in Linear B, while Apollo and Aphrodite are absent. Only about half of the Mycenaean pantheon seems to survive the Greek Dark Ages. The archaeological evidence for continuity in religion is far clearer for Crete and Cyprus than the Greek mainland.

Greek religious concepts may also have absorbed the beliefs and practices of earlier, nearby cultures, such as Minoan religion, and other influences came from the Near East, especially via Cyprus and Phoenicia. Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BCE, traced many Greek religious practices to Egypt. Robert G. Boling argues that Greek and Ugaritic/Canaanite mythology share many parallel relationships and that historical trends in Canaanite religion can help date works such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

The Great Goddess hypothesis, that a Stone Age religion dominated by a female Great Goddess was displaced by a male-dominated Indo-European hierarchy, has been proposed for Greece as for Minoan Crete and other regions, but has not been in favor with specialists for some decades, though the question remains too poorly evidenced for a clear conclusion; at the least the evidence from Minoan art shows more goddesses than gods. The Twelve Olympians, with Zeus as sky father, certainly have a strong Indo-European flavor; by the time of the epic works of Homer all are well-established, except for Dionysus, but several of the Homeric Hymns, probably composed slightly later, are dedicated to him.

===Archaic and classical periods===

Archaic and Classical Greece saw the development of flourishing cities and of stone-built temples to the gods, which were rather consistent in design across the Greek world. Religion was closely tied to civic life, and priests were mostly drawn from the local elite. Religious works led the development of Greek sculpture, though apparently not the now-vanished Greek painting. While much religious practice was, as well as personal, aimed at developing solidarity within the &quot;polis&quot;, a number of important sanctuaries developed a &quot;Panhellenic&quot; status, drawing visitors from all over the Greek world. These served as an essential component in the growth and self-consciousness of Greek nationalism. 
The mainstream religion of the Greeks did not go unchallenged within Greece. As Greek philosophy developed its ideas about ethics, the Olympians were found wanting. Several notable philosophers criticized belief in the gods. The earliest of these was Xenophanes, who chastised the gods&#x27; human vices and their anthropomorphic depiction. Plato wrote that there was one supreme god, whom he called the &quot;Form of the Good&quot;, which he believed was the emanation of perfection in the universe. Plato&#x27;s disciple Aristotle also disagreed that polytheistic deities existed, because he could not find enough empirical evidence for it. He believed in a Prime Mover, which had set creation going but was not connected to or interested in the universe.

===Hellenistic period===
In the Hellenistic period between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the Roman conquest of Greece (146 BCE), Greek religion developed in various ways, including expanding over at least some of Alexander&#x27;s conquests. The new dynasties of diadochi, kings and tyrants often spent lavishly on temples, often following Alexander in trying to insinuate themselves into religious cult; this was much easier for the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, where the traditional ancient Egyptian religion had long had deified monarchs. The enormous raised Pergamon Altar (now in Berlin) and the Altar of Hieron in Sicily are examples of unprecedentedly large constructions of the period.

New cults of imported deities such as Isis from Egypt, Atargatis from Syria, and Cybele from Anatolia became increasingly important, as well as several philosophical movements such as Platonism, stoicism, and Epicureanism; both tended to detract from the traditional religion, although many Greeks were able to hold beliefs from more than one of these groups. Serapis was essentially a Hellenistic creation, if not devised then spread in Egypt for political reasons by Ptolemy I Soter as a hybrid of Greek and local styles of deity. Various philosophical movements, including the Orphics and Pythagoreans, began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice, and whether the gods really appreciated it; from the surviving texts Empedocles and Theophrastus (both vegetarians) were notable critics. Hellenistic astrology developed late in the period, as another distraction from the traditional practices. Although traditional myths, festivals and beliefs all continued, these trends probably reduced the grip on the imagination of the traditional pantheon, especially among the educated, but also in the general population.

===Roman Empire===

When the Roman Republic conquered Greece in 146 BCE, it took much of Greek religion (along with many other aspects of Greek culture such as literary and architectural styles) and incorporated it into its own. The Greek gods were equated with the ancient Roman deities; Zeus with Jupiter, Hera with Juno, Poseidon with Neptune, Aphrodite with Venus, Ares with Mars, Artemis with Diana, Athena with Minerva, Hermes with Mercury, Hephaestus with Vulcan, Hestia with Vesta, Demeter with Ceres, Hades with Pluto, Tyche with Fortuna, and Pan with Faunus. Some of the gods, such as Apollo and Bacchus, had earlier been adopted by the Romans. There were also many deities that existed in the Roman religion before its interaction with Greece that were not associated with a Greek deity, including Janus and Quirinus.

The Romans generally did not spend much on new temples in Greece other than those for their Imperial cult, which were placed in all important cities. Exceptions include Antoninus Pius (r. 138–161 CE), whose commissions include the Baalbec Temple of Bacchus, arguably the most impressive survival from the imperial period (though the Temple of Jupiter-Baal next to it was larger). It could be said the Greek world was by this time well furnished with sanctuaries. Roman governors and emperors often pilfered famous statues from sanctuaries, sometimes leaving contemporary reproductions in their place. Verres, governor of Sicily from 73 to 70 BCE, was an early example who, unusually, was prosecuted after his departure.

After the huge Roman conquests beyond Greece, new cults from Egypt and Asia became popular in Greece as well as the western empire.

===Suppression and decline===
The initial decline of Greco-Roman polytheism was due in part to its syncretic nature, assimilating beliefs and practices from a variety of foreign religious traditions as the Roman Empire expanded. Greco-Roman philosophical schools incorporated elements of Judaism and Early Christianity, and mystery religions like Christianity and Mithraism also became increasingly popular. Constantine I became the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity, and the Edict of Milan in 313 CE enacted official tolerance for Christianity within the Empire. Still, in Greece and elsewhere, there is evidence that pagan and Christian communities remained essentially segregated from each other, with little mutual cultural influence. Urban pagans continued to use the civic centers and temple complexes, while Christians set up their own, new places of worship in suburban areas. Contrary to some older scholarship, newly converted Christians did not simply continue worshiping in converted temples; rather, new Christian communities formed as older pagan communities declined and were eventually suppressed and disbanded.

The Roman Emperor Julian, a nephew of Constantine, initiated an effort to end the ascension of Christianity within the empire and reorganize a syncretic version of Greco-Roman polytheism that he termed &quot;Hellenism&quot;. Later known as &quot;The Apostate&quot;, Julian had been raised Christian but embraced his ancestors&#x27; paganism in early adulthood. Taking notice of how Christianity ultimately flourished under suppression, Julian pursued a policy of marginalization but not destruction towards the Church; tolerating and at times lending state support to other prominent faiths (particularly Judaism) when he believed doing so would be likely to weaken Christianity. Julian&#x27;s Christian training influenced his decision to create a single organized version of the various old pagan traditions, with a centralized priesthood and a coherent body of doctrine, ritual, and liturgy based on Neoplatonism. On the other hand, Julian forbade Christian educators from utilizing many of the great works of philosophy and literature associated with Greco-Roman paganism. He believed Christianity had benefited significantly from not only access to but influence over classical education.

Julian&#x27;s successors Jovian, Valentinian I, and Valens continued Julian&#x27;s policy of religious toleration within the Empire, garnering them both praise from pagan writers. Official persecution of paganism in the Eastern Empire began under Theodosius I in 381 CE. Theodosius strictly enforced anti-pagan laws, had priesthoods disbanded, temples destroyed, and actively participated in Christian actions against pagan holy sites. He enacted laws that prohibited worship of pagan gods not only in public, but also within private homes. The last Olympic Games were held in 393 CE, and Theodosius likely suppressed any further attempts to hold the games. Western Empire Emperor Gratian, under the influence of his adviser Ambrose, ended the widespread, unofficial tolerance that had existed in the Western Roman Empire since the reign of Julian. In 382 CE, Gratian appropriated the income and property of the remaining orders of pagan priests, disbanded the Vestal Virgins, removed altars, and confiscated temples.

Despite official suppression by the Roman government, worship of the Greco-Roman gods persisted in some rural and remote regions into the early Middle Ages. A claimed temple to Apollo, with a community of worshipers and associated sacred grove, survived at Monte Cassino until 529 CE, when it was forcefully converted to a Christian chapel by Saint Benedict of Nursia, who destroyed the altar and cut down the grove. Other pagan communities, namely the Maniots, persisted in the Mani Peninsula of Greece until at least the 9th century.

===Modern revivals===
Greek religion and philosophy have experienced a number of revivals, firstly in the arts, humanities and spirituality of Renaissance Neoplatonism, which many believed had effects in the real world. During the period (14th–17th centuries) when ancient Greek literature and philosophy gained widespread appreciation in Europe, this new popularity did not extend to ancient Greek religion, especially the original theist forms, and most new examinations of Greek philosophy were written in a solidly Christian context.

Early revivalists, with varying degrees of commitment, were the Englishmen John Fransham (1730–1810), interested in Neoplatonism, and Thomas Taylor (1758–1835), who produced the first English translations of many Neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts.

More recently, a revival has begun with contemporary Hellenism, as it is often called. In Greece, the term is &quot;Hellenic National Religion&quot; (). Modern Hellenism reflects Neoplatonic and Platonic speculation (represented in Porphyry, Libanius, Proclus, and Julian), as well as classical cult practice. But it has far fewer followers than Greek Orthodox Christianity. According to estimates reported by the U.S. State Department in 2006, there were perhaps as many as 2,000 followers of the ancient Greek religion out of a total Greek population of 11 million, but Hellenism&#x27;s leaders place that figure at 100,000.

<text>Far Beyond Driven is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera, released on March 22, 1994, by Elektra Records and East West Records. Pantera&#x27;s fastest-selling album, it peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The album was also certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.

&quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; is the first album by Pantera where the band&#x27;s guitarist Darrell Abbott is credited as &quot;Dimebag Darrell&quot;, having changed his nickname from &quot;Diamond Darrell&quot; soon after &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; was released. The Japanese and the &quot;Driven Downunder Tour &#x27;94 Souvenir Collection&quot; editions contain a bonus thirteenth track, &quot;The Badge&quot;, a Poison Idea cover. This cover was also featured on &quot;The Crow&quot; soundtrack.

==Background==

In 1992, Pantera released their breakthrough album, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;. Despite the success of the album, the band would begin to experience turmoil in the two years following its release. Vocalist Phil Anselmo was injured with ruptured discs in his back and was suffering from chronic pain from degenerative disc disease. Anselmo began drinking heavily, abusing painkillers and muscle relaxants, and using heroin to alleviate the pain. Anselmo also begin to experience lower back pain, saying, &quot;I think this is one of the first times in my life, man, that I had this thing called &#x27;vulnerability&#x27; kick in, and that was a very uncomfortable feeling.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
The band tuned lower on the album than on previous efforts, with many songs going as low as C# standard. Several lyrical topics appear on &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;. The track &quot;Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills&quot; seems to be a reference to the song &quot;Good Friends and a Bottle of Wine&quot; on the Ted Nugent album &quot;Weekend Warriors&quot;. Phil Anselmo spoke about the track, saying:

Pantera&#x27;s bassist Rex Brown spoke about &quot;Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills&quot; saying:

Phil Anselmo talked about the song &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot;, saying:
Speaking about the song &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot;, drummer Vinnie Paul said:

Anselmo explained the meaning behind the song &quot;Becoming&quot;, saying: 

Anselmo talks about the meaning behind the song &quot;Shedding Skin&quot; saying, &quot;&#x27;Shedding Skin&#x27; was about me being in my 20s and any girlfriend, lady-friend of mine trying to tie me down at that age, at that particular time,&quot; begins Anselmo. &quot;Basically, &#x27;lay off, right now.&#x27; A relationship with me? A serious relationship with me at that age? Forget it, fuck off. Really, it&#x27;s impossible.&quot;

Anselmo talked about the song &quot;Slaughtered&quot; saying &quot;I&#x27;ve always had a distorted view of organized religion and I was never more confused than when I was in my 20s and whatnot,&quot; Anselmo says about &#x27;Slaughtered.&#x27; &quot;And still I like to use a fusion, if you will, of religions and fuck with them, so to speak. And then tear them down and piss all over them or build them up only to tip over.&quot;

Anselmo spoke about the song &quot;Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks&quot;, saying &quot;I think it was a foreshadowing of the fear that I felt of not being the same. ... I know for a fact, I guess, that I dabbled in pain pills and stuff like that because I was miserable, and that&#x27;s always a friggin&#x27; dead end, dead road, a terrible path to take. But at the time, I didn&#x27;t have any other answers.&quot;

The song &quot;25 Years&quot; is about Phil Anselmo&#x27;s father. Anselmo would later cover the topic, saying: 

In the liner notes of the album, all the songs&#x27; lyrics are printed apart from the cover of &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;. The liner note reads:

==Artwork==

The original album cover shows a drill going into someone&#x27;s anus, but the record label rejected it, worrying it would harm sales and would be rejected by stores like Walmart and Target. The band then changed it to a drill put in the frontal lobe of a human skull.
==Release and reception==
At midnight on March 22, 1994, Pantera launched the release of &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; with an extensive record store campaign. They traveled to 12 cities in almost five days with MTV documenting their progress. Band members signed autographs, met fans, and promoted the album. The band released &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single, which reached #19 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting single worldwide. The LP also contained the first cover song on one of their major-label releases—Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; which served as the album&#x27;s closing track and reached #21 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks and #26 on the UK Singles Chart. By March, the LP had sold over 185,000 copies and had reached #1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts and Australian charts upon release. It remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 29 weeks. Shane Mehling of &quot;Decibel&quot;, commenting on &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, called it &quot;the first extreme metal record to reach that level of popularity and, in maybe a more perfect world, would have opened the doors for other extreme bands to gain a foothold.&quot;

The album received positive reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four out of five stars. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would eventually rank &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; #39 on their list &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; wrote in April 1994 that the &quot;quartet has successfully transformed itself into a cross between the older, faster Metallica and today&#x27;s Rollins Band&quot;, adding that &quot;at times, Phil Anselmo is every bit as charismatic as Henry Rollins.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia had a more negative take on the album, stating &quot;&quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; may have been Pantera&#x27;s fastest selling album upon release, but it&#x27;s hardly their best. In fact, although it shot straight to the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; sales chart in its first week (arguably the most extreme album ever to do so), this incredible feat doesn&#x27;t so much reflect its own qualities as those of its predecessor, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;.&quot;

In November 2011, &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; was ranked number six on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1994. The album was also ranked at number twenty in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

==Reissue==
On March 24, 2014, a two-disc deluxe edition of &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; was released to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Disc one is a remastered version of the original album. Disc two is a live album featuring Pantera&#x27;s set at the 1994 Monsters of Rock Festival.

==Tour==
Pantera toured South America, and were accepted into another &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; billing. At that festival on June 4, 1994, the Abbott brothers got into a scuffle with journalists from the music magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; over unflattering cartoon depictions of drummer Vinnie Paul. Then in late June, Anselmo was charged with assault for hitting a security guard after he prevented fans from getting on stage, Anselmo was released on $5,000 bail the next day. The trial was delayed three times. In May 1995, he apologized in court and pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service. Pantera continued their tour of the United Kingdom and eventually the United States in mid to late 1994, where the band was opened for by fellow heavy metal bands Sepultura and Prong. The tour of &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; also took Pantera to Australia and New Zealand for the first time in November–December 1994. The tour ended in March of 1995 with another run through the United States, this time with Type O Negative opening.

<text>Shenlong, (, literally &quot;god dragon&quot; or &quot;divine dragon&quot;, Japanese: 神龍 Shinryū) is the spirit dragon from Chinese mythology who is the dragon god of the tempest and also a master of rain. He is of equal significance to other creatures such as Tianlong, the celestial dragon, Zhulong, the dragon of eruption, Qinglong, the azure dragon, and Yinglong, the responsive dragon.

The spiritual dragon is azure-scaled and governs the storms, clouds, and rain, on which all agricultural life depends. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese people would take great care to avoid offending him, for if he grew angry or felt neglected, the result was bad weather, drought, flood or thunderstorms.

Despite this, Shenlong appears to signify a special rank in the splendid robes and regalia of Chinese emperors. He was also five-clawed, which was iconic of the imperial dragon. Chinese empires have admired shenlong for centuries through festivals.

<doc id="274102" wikidata="Q500046" url="?curid=274102" title="Albert Gallatin">
<text>Abraham Alfonse Albert Gallatin (January 29, 1761 – August 12, 1849) was a Genevan-American politician, diplomat, ethnologist, and linguist. Often described as &quot;America&#x27;s Swiss Founding Father&quot;, he was a leading figure in the early years of the United States, helping shape the new republic&#x27;s financial system and foreign policy. Gallatin was a prominent member of the Democratic-Republican Party, represented Pennsylvania in both chambers of Congress, and held several influential roles across four presidencies, most notably as the longest serving U.S. secretary of the treasury. He is also known for his contributions to academia, namely as the founder of New York University and cofounder of the American Ethnological Society.

Gallatin was born in Geneva in present-day Switzerland and spoke French as a first language. Inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, he immigrated to the United States in the 1780s, settling in western Pennsylvania. He served as a delegate to the 1789 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention and won election to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Gallatin was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1793, emerging as a leading Anti-Federalist and opponent of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s economic policies. However, he was soon removed from office on a party-line vote due to not meeting requisite citizenship requirements; returning to Pennsylvania, Gallatin helped calm many angry farmers during the Whiskey Rebellion.

Gallatin won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1795, where he helped establish the House Ways and Means Committee. He became the chief spokesman on financial matters for the Democratic-Republican Party and led opposition to the Federalist economic program. Gallatin helped Thomas Jefferson prevail in the contentious 1800 U.S. presidential election, and his reputation as a prudent financial manager led to his appointment as Treasury Secretary. Under Jefferson, Gallatin reduced government spending, instituted checks and balances for government expenditures, and financed the Louisiana Purchase and advocated for internal improvements, most notably through his &quot;Report on Roads and Canals&quot;. He retained his position through James Madison&#x27;s administration until February 1814, maintaining much of Hamilton&#x27;s financial system while presiding over a reduction in the national debt. Gallatin served on the American commission that agreed to the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812. In the aftermath of the war, he helped found the Second Bank of the United States.

Declining another term at the Treasury, Gallatin served as U.S. Ambassador to France from 1816 to 1823, struggling with scant success to improve relations during the Bourbon Restoration. In the 1824 U.S. presidential election, Gallatin was nominated for Vice President by the Democratic-Republican Congressional caucus but never wanted the position and ultimately withdrew due to a lack of popular support. In 1826 and 1827, he served as the ambassador to Britain and negotiated several agreements, such as a ten-year extension of the joint occupation of Oregon Country. He thereafter retired from politics and dedicated the rest of his life to various civic, humanitarian, and academic causes. He became the first president of the New York branch of the National Bank from 1831 to 1839, and in 1842 joined John Russell Bartlett to establish the American Ethnological Society; his studies of Indigenous languages of North America have earned him the moniker &quot;father of American ethnology.&quot; Gallatin remained active in public life as an outspoken opponent of slavery and fiscal irresponsibility and an advocate for free trade and individual liberty.

== Early life ==
Gallatin was born on January 29, 1761, in Geneva, and was until 1785 a citizen of the Republic of Geneva. His parents were the wealthy Jean Gallatin and his wife Sophie Albertine Rollaz. Gallatin&#x27;s family had great influence in the Republic of Geneva, and many family members held distinguished positions in the magistracy and the army. Jean Gallatin, a prosperous merchant, died in 1765, followed by Sophie in April 1770. Now orphaned, Gallatin was taken into the care of Mademoiselle Pictet, a family friend and distant relative of Gallatin&#x27;s father. In January 1773, Gallatin was sent to study at the elite Academy of Geneva. While attending the academy, Gallatin read deeply the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire, along with the French Physiocrats; he became dissatisfied with the traditionalism of Geneva. A student of the Enlightenment, he believed in the nobility of human nature and that when freed from social restrictions, it would display admirable qualities and greater results in both the physical and the moral world. The democratic spirit of the United States attracted him and he decided to emigrate.

In April 1780, Gallatin secretly left Geneva with his classmate Henri Serre. Carrying letters of recommendation from eminent Americans (including Benjamin Franklin) that the Gallatin family procured, the young men left France in May, sailing on an American ship, &quot;the Kattie&quot;. They reached Cape Ann on July 14 and arrived in Boston the next day, traveling the intervening thirty miles by horseback. Bored with monotonous Bostonian life, Gallatin and Serre set sail with a Swiss female companion to the settlement of Machias, located on the northeastern tip of the Maine frontier. At Machias, Gallatin operated a bartering venture, in which he dealt with a variety of goods and supplies. He enjoyed the simple life and the natural environment surrounding him. Gallatin and Serre returned to Boston in October 1781 after abandoning their bartering venture in Machias. Friends of Pictet, who had learned that Gallatin had traveled to the United States, convinced Harvard College to employ Gallatin as a French tutor.

Gallatin disliked living in New England, instead preferring to become a farmer in the Trans-Appalachian West, which at that point was the frontier of American settlement. He became the interpreter and business partner of a French land speculator, Jean Savary, and traveled throughout various parts of the United States in order to purchase undeveloped Western lands. In 1785, he became an American citizen after he swore allegiance to the state of Virginia, fulfilling the requirements of citizenship as established under Article IV of the Articles of Confederation. Gallatin inherited a significant sum of money the following year, and he used that money to purchase a 400-acre plot of land in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. He built a stone house named Friendship Hill on the new property. Gallatin co-founded a company designed to attract Swiss settlers to the United States, but the company proved unable to attract many settlers.

==Marriage and family==
In 1789, Gallatin married Sophie Allègre, the daughter of a Richmond boardinghouse owner, but Allègre died just five months into the marriage. He was in mourning for a number of years and seriously considered returning to Geneva. However, on November 1, 1793, he married Hannah Nicholson, daughter of the well-connected Commodore James Nicholson. They had two sons and four daughters: Catherine, Sophia Albertine, Hannah Maria, Frances, James, and Albert Rolaz Gallatin. Catherine died of whooping cough and the measles before she was eight months old, Sophia and Hannah also died as infants. Gallatin&#x27;s marriage proved to be politically and economically advantageous, as the Nicholsons enjoyed connections in New York, Georgia, and Maryland. With most of his business ventures unsuccessful, Gallatin sold much of his land, excluding Friendship Hill, to Robert Morris; he and his wife would instead live in Philadelphia and other coastal cities for most of the rest of their lives.

==Early political career==

===Pennsylvania legislature and United States Senate===
In 1788, Gallatin was elected as a delegate to a state convention to discuss possible revisions to the United States Constitution. In the next two years, he served as a delegate to a state constitutional convention and won election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. As a public official, he aligned with Anti-Federalists and spent much of his time in the state and national capital of Philadelphia. His service on the Ways and Means Committee earned him a strong reputation as an expert in finance and taxation.

Gallatin won election to the United States Senate in early 1793, and he took his seat in December of that year. He quickly emerged as a prominent opponent of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s economic program but was declared ineligible for a seat in the Senate in February 1794 because he had not been a citizen for the required nine years prior to election. The dispute itself had important ramifications. At the time, the Senate held closed sessions. However, with the American Revolution only a decade ended, the senators were leery of anything which might hint that they intended to establish an aristocracy, so they opened up their chamber for the first time for the debate over whether to unseat Gallatin. Soon after, open sessions became standard procedure for the Senate. Gallatin was one of two senators to vote against the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Whiskey Rebellion===
Gallatin had strongly opposed the 1791 establishment of an excise tax on whiskey, as whiskey trade and production constituted an important part of the Western economy. In 1794, after Gallatin had been removed from the Senate and returned to Friendship Hill, the Whiskey Rebellion broke out among disgruntled farmers opposed to the federal collection of the whiskey tax. Gallatin did not join in the rebellion, but criticized the military response of the President George Washington&#x27;s administration as an overreaction. Gallatin helped persuade many of the angered farmers to end the rebellion, urging them to accept that &quot;if any one part of the Union are suffered to oppose by force the determination of the whole, there is an end to government itself and of course to the Union.&quot; The rebellion collapsed as the army moved near.

===House of Representatives===
In the aftermath of the Whiskey Rebellion, Gallatin won election to the United States House of Representatives, taking his seat in March 1795. Upon his return to Congress, Gallatin became the leading financial expert of the Democratic-Republican Party. In 1796, Gallatin published &quot;A Sketch on the Finances of the United States&quot;, which discussed the operations of the Treasury Department and strongly attacked the Federalist Party&#x27;s financial program. Some historians and biographers believe that Gallatin founded the House Ways and Means Committee in order to check Hamilton&#x27;s influence over financial issues, but historian Patrick Furlong argues that Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist allies were actually responsible for founding the committee. After James Madison declined to seek re-election in 1796, Gallatin emerged as the Democratic-Republican leader in the House of Representatives. During the Quasi-War with France, Gallatin criticized military expenditures and opposed passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. In the contingent election that decided the outcome of the 1800 presidential election, Gallatin helped Thomas Jefferson secure victory over his ostensible running mate, Aaron Burr.

==Secretary of the Treasury==
===Jefferson administration===

Gallatin&#x27;s mastery of public finance made him the obvious choice as Jefferson&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury; as Jefferson put it, Gallatin was &quot;the only man in the United States who understands, through all the labyrinths Hamilton involved it, the precise state of the Treasury.&quot; Gallatin received a recess appointment in May 1801 and was confirmed by the Senate in January 1802. Along with Secretary of State Madison and Jefferson himself, Gallatin became one of the three key officials in the Jefferson administration. As Jefferson and Madison spent the majority of the summer months at their respective estates, Gallatin was frequently left to preside over the operations of the federal government. He also acted as a moderating force on Jefferson&#x27;s speeches and policies, in one case convincing Jefferson to refrain from calling for the abolition of the General Welfare Clause.

In 1799, Gallatin made a speech advocating against normalizing relations with self-liberated slaves in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, arguing that if &quot;they were left to govern themselves, they might become more troublesome to us, in our commerce to the West Indies, than the Algerines ever were in the Mediterranean; they might also become dangerous neighbors to the Southern States, and an asylum for renegades from those parts.&quot; In the speech, Gallatin also expressed opposition to miscegenation. Hofstra University professor Alan Singer argued based on this speech that Gallatin &quot;was certainly not an abolitionist&quot; and that &quot;his claims to oppose slavery can also be read as racist attacks on the humanity of Africans, which was not uncommon among Whites during the antebellum era&quot;.

With Gallatin taking charge of fiscal policy, the new administration sought to lower taxation (though not import duties), spending, and the national debt; debt reduction in particular had long been a key goal of the party and Gallatin himself. When Gallatin took office in 1801, the national debt stood at $83 million. By 1812, the U.S. national debt had fallen to $45.2 million. One historian said of Gallatin:

His own fears of personal dependency and his small-shopkeeper&#x27;s sense of integrity, both reinforced by a strain of radical republican thought that originated in England a century earlier, convinced him that public debts were a nursery of multiple public evils—corruption, legislative impotence, executive tyranny, social inequality, financial speculation, and personal indolence. Not only was it necessary to extinguish the existing debt as rapidly as possible, he argued, but Congress would have to ensure against the accumulation of future debts by more diligently supervising government expenditures.

Shortly after taking office, Gallatin worked with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman John Randolph to reduce federal spending and reduce or abolish all internal taxes, including the tax on whiskey. He presided over dramatic reductions in military spending, particularly for the United States Navy. Despite his opposition to debt, Gallatin strongly supported and arranged the financing for the Louisiana Purchase, in which the U.S. bought French Louisiana. Both Jefferson and Gallatin regarded control of the port of New Orleans, which was ceded in the purchase, as the key to the development of the Western United States. Jefferson had doubts about the constitutionality of the purchase, but Gallatin helped convince the president that a constitutional amendment authorizing the purchase was impractical and unnecessary. Gallatin also championed and helped plan the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore lands west of the Mississippi River.

Before and after the Louisiana Purchase, Gallatin presided over a major expansion of public land sales. With the goal of selling land directly to settlers rather than to land speculators, Gallatin increased the number of federal land offices from four to eighteen. In 1812, Congress established the United States General Land Office as part of the Department of the Treasury, charging the new office with overseeing public lands. To help develop western lands, Gallatin advocated for internal improvements such as roads and canals, especially those that would connect to territories west of the Appalachian Mountains. In 1805, despite his earlier constitutional reservations, Jefferson announced his support for federally financed infrastructure projects. Three years later, Gallatin put forward his &quot;Report on Roads and Canals&quot;, in which he advocated for a $20 million federal infrastructure program. Among his proposals were canals through Cape Cod, the Delmarva Peninsula, and the Great Dismal Swamp, a road stretching from Maine to Georgia, a series of canals connecting the Hudson River with the Great Lakes, and various other canals to connect seaports like Charleston with interior regions. Resistance from many congressional Democratic-Republicans regarding cost, as well as hostilities with Britain, prevented the passage of a major infrastructure bill, but Gallatin did win funding for the construction of the National Road. The National Road linked the town of Cumberland, on the Potomac River, with the town of Wheeling, which sat on the Ohio River. Many of Gallatin&#x27;s other proposals were eventually carried out years later by state and local governments, as well as private citizens.

Throughout much of Jefferson&#x27;s presidency, France and Britain were engaged in the Napoleonic Wars. During Jefferson&#x27;s second term, both the British and French stepped up efforts to prevent American trade with their respective enemy. Particularly offensive to many Americans was the Royal Navy&#x27;s practise of impressing alleged deserters from the British navy off American merchantmen, which the U.S. public saw as an affront to America&#x27;s national honor. Jefferson sent James Monroe to Britain to negotiate a renewal and revision of the 1795 Jay Treaty, but Jefferson rejected the treaty that Monroe reached with the British. After the 1807 &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair, Jefferson proposed, over Gallatin&#x27;s strong objections, what would become the Embargo Act of 1807. That act forbade all American ships from engaging in almost all foreign trade, and it remained in place until its repeal in the final days of Jefferson&#x27;s presidency. Despite Gallatin&#x27;s objection to the embargo, he was tasked with enforcing it against smugglers, who were able to evade the embargo in various ways. The embargo proved ineffective at accomplishing its intended purpose of punishing Britain and France, and it contributed to growing dissent in New England against the Jefferson administration. Overcoming Jefferson&#x27;s declining popularity and the resentment at the embargo, Secretary of State Madison won the 1808 presidential election.

===Madison administration===

After taking office, Madison sought to appoint Gallatin as Secretary of State, which was generally seen as the most prestigious cabinet position. Opposition from the Senate convinced Madison to retain Gallatin as Secretary of the Treasury, and Robert Smith instead received the appointment as Secretary of State. Gallatin was deeply displeased by the appointment of Smith, and he was frequently criticized by Smith&#x27;s brother, Senator Samuel Smith, as well as journalist William Duane of the influential &quot;Philadelphia Aurora&quot;. He considered resigning from government service, but Madison convinced him to stay on as a key cabinet official and adviser.

In 1810, Gallatin published &quot;Report on the Subject of Manufactures&quot;, in which he unsuccessfully urged Congress to create a $20 million federal loan program to support fledgling manufacturers. He was also unable to convince Congress to renew the charter of the First Bank of the United States (commonly known as the national bank). Although the national bank had been established as part of Hamilton&#x27;s economic program, and Jefferson believed that it was &quot;one of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our Constitution,&quot; Gallatin saw the national bank as a key part of the country&#x27;s financial system. In a letter to Jefferson, Gallatin argued that the bank was indispensable because it served as a place of deposit for government funds, a source of credit, and a regulator of currency. In January 1811, the national bank was effectively abolished after the House and the Senate both defeated bills to recharter the national bank in extremely narrow votes. In response, Gallatin sent a letter to Madison, asking for permission to resign and criticizing the president for various actions, including his failure to take a strong stance on the national bank. Shortly afterwards, Madison replaced Secretary of State Smith with James Monroe, and Gallatin withdrew his resignation request.

Following the repeal of the Embargo Act of 1807, Gallatin was charged with enforcing the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809, which lifted parts of the trade embargo but still prevented American ships from engaging in trade with the British and French empires. In 1811, Congress replaced the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 with a law known as Macon&#x27;s Bill Number 2, which authorized the president to restore trade with either France or Britain if either promised to respect American neutrality. As with previous embargo policies pursued by the federal government under Jefferson and Madison, Macon&#x27;s Bill Number 2 proved to be ineffective at halting the attacks on American shipping. In June 1812, Madison signed a declaration of war against Britain, beginning the War of 1812.

Madison ordered an invasion of Canada by relying on mostly state militias, but British forces defeated the invasion. The U.S. experienced some successes at sea, but was unable to break the British blockade. With the abolition of the national bank, the drop in import duties due to the war, and the inability or unwillingness of state banks to furnish credit, Gallatin struggled to fund the war. Reluctantly, he drafted and won passage of several new tax laws, as well as an increase in tariff rates. He also sold U.S. securities to investors, and an infusion of cash from wealthy investors Stephen Girard, John Jacob Astor, and David Parish proved critical to the financing of the war. During the War of 1812, the national debt grew dramatically, going from $45 million in early 1812 to $127 million in January 1816.

==Diplomat==
In 1813, President James Madison sent Gallatin to St. Petersburg, Russia to serve as a negotiator for a peace agreement to end the War of 1812. He was one of five American commissioners who would negotiate the treaty, serving alongside Henry Clay, James Bayard, Jonathan Russell, and John Quincy Adams. Efforts at starting negotiations in Russia quickly collapsed. While waiting abroad in the hope of future negotiations, Gallatin was replaced as Secretary of the Treasury by George W. Campbell, with the expectation that Gallatin would take up his old post upon his return to the United States. Negotiations with the British finally commenced in Ghent in mid-1814.

Negotiations at Ghent lasted for four months. The British could have chosen to shift resources to North America after the temporary defeat of Napoleon in April 1814, but, as Gallatin learned from Alexander Baring, many in Britain were tired of fighting. In December 1814, the two sides agreed to sign the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially represented a return to the status quo ante bellum. The treaty did not address the issue of impressment, but that issue became a moot point after the British and their allies defeated Napoleon for a final time at the June 1815 Battle of Waterloo. Gallatin&#x27;s patience and skill in dealing with not only the British but also his fellow members of the American commission, including Clay and Adams, made the treaty &quot;the special and peculiar triumph of Mr. Gallatin.&quot; John Quincy Adams, head of the American negotiating team, described Gallatin:[H]e seldom yields to an ebullition of temper, and recovers from it immediately. He has a faculty, when discussion grows too warm, of turning off its edge by a joke, which I envy him more than all his other talents; and he has in his character one of the most extraordinary combinations of stubbornness and of flexibility that I ever met with in man. His greatest fault I think to be an ingenuity sometimes trenching upon ingenuousness. After the end of the war, Gallatin negotiated a commercial treaty providing for a resumption of trade between the United States and Britain. Though the war with Britain had at best been a stalemate, Gallatin was pleased that it resulted in the consolidation of U.S. control over western territories, as the British withdrew their support from dissident Native Americans who had sought to create an independent state in the Great Lakes region. He also noted that &quot;the war has laid the foundation of permanent taxes and military establishments...under our former system we were becoming too selfish, too much attached exclusively to the acquisition of wealth...[and] too much confined in our political feelings to local and State objects.&quot;

When Gallatin returned from Europe in September 1815, he declined Madison&#x27;s request to take up his old post as Secretary of the Treasury. He did, however, help convince Congress to charter the Second Bank of the United States as a replacement for the defunct First Bank of the United States. Gallatin considered going into business with his longtime friend, John Jacob Astor, but ultimately he accepted appointment as ambassador to France. He served in that position from 1816 to 1823. Though he did not approve of the prevailing ideology of the Bourbon Restoration, Gallatin and his family enjoyed living in Paris. While serving as ambassador to France, he helped negotiate the Rush–Bagot Treaty and the Treaty of 1818, two treaties with Britain that settled several issues left over from the War of 1812 and established joint Anglo-American control over Oregon Country.

Upon returning to the United States, Gallatin agreed to serve as William H. Crawford&#x27;s running mate in the 1824 presidential election, but later withdrew from the race at Crawford&#x27;s request. Crawford had originally hoped that Gallatin&#x27;s presence on the ticket would help him win the support of Pennsylvania voters, but the emergence of General Andrew Jackson as a presidential contender caused Crawford to refocus his campaign on other states. Though Gallatin had never wanted the role, he was humiliated when he was forced to withdraw from the race. He was alarmed at the possibility Jackson might win, as he saw Jackson as &quot;an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office.&quot; Ultimately, John Quincy Adams won the 1824 presidential election in a contingent election held in the House of Representatives. Gallatin and his wife returned to Friendship Hill after the presidential election, living there until 1826. That year, Gallatin accepted appointment as ambassador to Britain. After negotiating an extension of the Anglo-American control of Oregon Country, Gallatin returned to the United States in November 1827.

==Later life==

Gallatin moved to New York City in 1828 and became president of the National Bank of New York the following year. He attempted to persuade President Jackson to recharter the Second Bank of the United States, but Jackson vetoed a recharter bill and the Second Bank lost its federal charter in 1836. In 1831, Gallatin helped found New York University, and in 1843 he was elected president of the New York Historical Society. In the mid-1840s, he opposed President James K. Polk&#x27;s expansionist policies and wrote a widely-read pamphlet, &quot;Peace with Mexico&quot;, that called for an end to the Mexican–American War.

Gallatin was deeply interested in Native Americans, and he favored their assimilation into European-American culture as an alternative to forced relocation. He drew upon government contacts to research Native Americans, gathering information through Lewis Cass, explorer William Clark, and Thomas McKenney of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Gallatin developed a personal relationship with Cherokee tribal leader John Ridge, who provided him with information on the vocabulary and the structure of the Cherokee language. Gallatin&#x27;s research resulted in two published works: &quot;A Table of Indian Languages of the United States&quot; (1826) and &quot;Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of North America&quot; (1836). His research led him to conclude that the natives of North and South America were linguistically and culturally related and that their common ancestors had migrated from Asia in prehistoric times. Later research efforts included examination of the language of certain native societies in Mexico and Central America. In 1843, he co-founded the American Ethnological Society, serving as the society&#x27;s first president. Due to his studies of the languages of the Native Americans, he has been called &quot;the father of American ethnology.&quot;

The health of both Gallatin and his wife declined in the late 1840s, and Hannah died in May 1849. On Sunday, August 12, Gallatin died in Astoria, now in the Borough of Queens, New York at age 88. He is interred at Trinity Churchyard in New York City. Prior to his death, Gallatin had been the last surviving member of the Jefferson cabinet and the last surviving senator from the 18th century.

==Legacy==

In 1791, Gallatin was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Gallatin is commemorated in the naming of a number of counties, roads, and streets, as well as through his association with New York University. The Gallatin River, named by the Lewis and Clark expedition, is one of three rivers (along with the Jefferson River and the Madison River) that converge near Three Forks, Montana to form the Missouri River. The town of Three Forks is in Gallatin County, Montana, and Montana also hosts Gallatin National Forest and Gallatin Range. Gallatin, Tennessee, the seat of Sumner County and Gallatin County, Kentucky are also named for Gallatin. Gallatin&#x27;s home of Friendship Hill is maintained by the National Park Service. A statue of Gallatin stands at the northern entrance of the Treasury Building; a statue of Hamilton stands at the building&#x27;s southern entrance. The Albert Gallatin Area School District, located in southwestern Fayette County, Pennsylvania, and having contained within Gallatin&#x27;s home, Friendship Hill, is also named after Gallatin. Businessman Albert Gallatin Edwards (who founded his eponymous brokerage firm in 1887 which folded into Wachovia in 2007) was named after Gallatin.

Gallatin&#x27;s name is associated with NYU&#x27;s Gallatin School of Individualized Study. New York University&#x27;s internal course enrollment website for matriculating students is named &quot;NYU Albert&quot;, after Gallatin. Gallatin is featured on three U.S. stamps, including one issued in 1967 with the unusual denomination of 1¼¢. Gallatin is also portrayed in the center of the $500 denomination set of Greenbacks (series 1862–63) currency issue.

===Self-evaluation===
Gallatin said &quot;far too much credit has been given me for abilities at the expense of the purity of my motives.&quot;

<text>Kerbdog (also sometimes known as &#x27;Totally Switched&#x27; for the US release) is Kerbdog&#x27;s eponymous debut album. The album was recorded in 1993 at Rockfield Studios in Wales and released on 28 March 1994 through Vertigo. Though the band had various indie influences, with bands like Sonic Youth, Fugazi and Big Black, the album ended up having a Metallica influenced proto-grunge sound. The band said that this was simply the result of getting professional equipment, and turning everything up as loud as they could. What also might account for this is the fact that grunge pioneer Jack Endino recorded the album.

&quot;If I remember right the whole thing took five weeks. No problems except that Cormac was still writing lyrics right up to the next-to-last day of mixing. Dummy Crusher was literally the last thing finished, we cut the vocal and then I mixed it next day. We had about run out of time at that point. [I] liked almost all of it. Thought the intro to EOG should have been half as long, but band disagreed; and in retrospect I would have turned up the vocals on EOG just a teeny bit, though no one ever complained. Didn&#x27;t like Xenophobia much but that didn&#x27;t make the album. Thought Clock should have been a single.&quot;
&quot;Jack Endino&quot;
The album was fairly well received in Britain, Ireland, and Europe, reaching number 97 in the UK Albums Chart. It also got a lot of radio play on US college radio, but the album didn&#x27;t do as well as expected.

The album was originally released on LP, CD and cassette. It was re-released on CD in September 2012 on East World Records UK.

&quot;Kerbdog&quot; was finally re-released on green vinyl in November 2020 on Hassle Records. There was also a clear vinyl edition, limited to 300 hand-numbered copies.

<text>Savage Love is a syndicated sex-advice column by Dan Savage. The column appears weekly in several dozen newspapers, mainly free newspapers in the US and Canada, but also newspapers in Europe and Asia. It started in 1991 with the first issue of the Seattle weekly newspaper &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

Since October 2006, Savage has also recorded the &quot;Savage Lovecast&quot;, a weekly podcast version of the column, featuring telephone advice sessions. Podcasts are released every Tuesday.

== History ==
In 1991, Savage was living in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a manager at a local video store that specialized in independent film titles. There, he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of &quot;The Onion&quot;, who announced that he was moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Savage &quot;made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: &#x27;Make sure your paper has an advice column – everybody claims to hate &#x27;em, but everybody seems to read &#x27;em&#x27;.&quot; He typed up a sample column, and to his surprise Keck offered him the job.

Until 1999, the format of the conversation began with an advice seeker saying, &quot;Hey faggot&quot;, then asking their question. Savage&#x27;s intent was reappropriation of the word into a positive description for gay guys. Using this word worked when the readers were LGBT, but as the column grew popular, Savage changed to a generic greeting to better match the expectations of the general public.

Since 2002, he has written the column at Eppie Lederer&#x27;s desk, which he, a &quot;lifelong fan&quot; of her Ann Landers column, bought at auction after the noted advice columnist died.

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in &quot;The Onion&quot;″s &quot;A.V. Club&quot; (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were &quot;clueless&quot; when responding to letters from gay people.

== Language ==
During the run of Savage Love, Savage has popularized several neologisms and initialisms. He has also debunked several sexual neologisms for sex acts, including the &quot;donkey punch&quot;, the &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot;, the &quot;pirate&quot;, and the &quot;hot Karl&quot;, concluding &quot;they&#x27;re all fictions.&quot; He has objected to use of the term &quot;pussy&quot; as an insult, saying that vaginas were wonderful, &quot;popping out babies&quot;, and proposed &quot;scrotum&quot; (pl. &quot;scrota&quot;) as an insult.

Savage has also tried to reclaim many offensive words. For the first six years of the column, he had his readers address him with &quot;Hey, faggot&quot;, as a comment on previous efforts to reclaim offensive words. He was criticized for this by some gay activists. After receiving criticism for use of the word &quot;retarded&quot;—considered by many to be an offensive slur against those with intellectual disabilities—Savage suggested &quot;leotarded&quot; as an alternative, because &quot;leotard&quot; rhymes with &quot;retard&quot;.

=== Campsite rule ===
In any relationship, but particularly those with a large difference of age or experience between the partners, the older or more experienced partner has the responsibility to leave the younger or less experienced partner in at least as good a state (emotionally and physically) as before the relationship. The &quot;campsite rule&quot; includes things like leaving the younger or less experienced partner with no STDs, no unwanted pregnancies, and not overburdening them with emotional and sexual baggage.

==== Tea and sympathy rule ====
Shortly after a 2009 scandal in Portland, Oregon, involving openly gay mayor Sam Adams and Beau Breedlove, who had allegedly begun a sexual relationship with Adams almost immediately after turning 18, Savage created a companion rule to the &quot;campsite rule&quot;, now known as the &quot;tea and sympathy rule&quot;. The rule is a reference to a line in the play of the same name, in which a much older woman asks of a high-school-age boy, right before having sex with him: &quot;Years from now, when you talk about this – and you will – be kind.&quot; Savage claimed in an article in &quot;The Portland Mercury&quot; that, while Adams followed the &quot;campsite rule&quot; – Breedlove did not claim that Adams had given him any diseases or caused him emotional trauma, and in fact still refers to Adams as a friend – Breedlove violated the &quot;tea and sympathy&quot; rule by making public statements that he knew could ruin Adams&#x27; career.

=== CPOS ===
&quot;Cheating piece of shit&quot;, said of a cheater, but usually reserved for one who is chronic or abusive/passive-aggressive about it.

=== DTMFA and ITMFA ===
Savage often uses the expression &quot;dump the mother-fucker already&quot; (DTMFA), at the close of a response, recommending that the writer immediately end an abusive or worthless relationship.

A reader of Savage Love suggested the initialisation ITMFA, a take on DTMFA, meaning &quot;Impeach the Motherfucker Already!&quot; The initialisation was coined in reference to the presidency of George W. Bush in 2006, but was reintroduced in 2017 in reaction to the presidency of Donald Trump. Starting in 2018 Savage, through his website, sold clothing with ITMFA on it.

=== GGG ===
Savage coined &quot;GGG&quot;, &quot;good, giving, and game&quot;, and it means one should strive to be &quot;good&quot; in bed, &quot;giving&quot; &quot;equal time and equal pleasure&quot; to one&#x27;s partner, and &quot;game&quot; &quot;for anything – within reason&quot;. The term inspired the &quot;How GGG Are You? Test&quot; on dating site OkCupid, and the invention of a cocktail.

=== HTH ===
&quot;How&#x27;d that happen?&quot;, a mock-incredulous reply to those who write in and say they had certain (often sexual) things &quot;happen to&quot; them, as if they had no part or say in the incident, when they clearly did.

=== Lifting luggage ===

Following the &quot;rent boy&quot; allegations regarding George Rekers, who has widely promoted aversion therapy, Dan Savage, along with others including Stephen Colbert, promoted the use of the idiom &quot;to lift [some]one&#x27;s luggage&quot;, meaning to supply sexual pleasure to, or derive it from, one&#x27;s partner. This originated from Rekers who, when outed, insisted he had hired the escort only to assist him with lifting his luggage. Rekers also claimed he &quot;spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse&quot; and &quot;shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with him in great detail&quot;.

Originally Savage suggested that &quot;lifting my luggage&quot; refer to listening to the speaker expound on the &quot;desirability&quot; of converting oneself from homosexual to heterosexual. Later, after several political humorists started employing &quot;lifting your luggage&quot; as an implicit or explicit reference to various sexual acts, Savage suggested that &quot;whatever lifts your luggage&quot; supplant &quot;&quot; in common parlance.

=== Monogamish ===
In a July 20, 2011 column, Savage coined the term &quot;monogamish&quot;, applying it to his own relationship with his partner. The term describes couples who are &quot;mostly&quot; but not 100% monogamous; such couples have an understanding that allows for some amount of sexual activity outside the relationship. Savage believes that, of all the couples that people think are 100% monogamous, a lot of them are more &quot;monogamish&quot; than people realize. The term has since seen mainstream use.

=== Pegging ===

In 2001, Savage challenged readers of his column to coin a name for the sex act in which a woman uses a strap-on dildo to perform anal sex on her male partner. After multiple nominations and a reader vote, the verb &quot;peg&quot;, popularized by the sex education movie Bend Over Boyfriend released in 1998, was chosen, with a 43% plurality over runners-up &quot;bob&quot; and &quot;punt&quot;.

=== Saddlebacking ===
In 2009, after a controversy involving the Saddleback Church, the column defined &quot;saddlebacking&quot; as &quot;the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex in order to preserve their virginities&quot;. The term is a play on the word &quot;barebacking&quot;, referring to sexual intercourse, especially anal sex between men, with no condom (&quot;bare&quot;).

=== Santorum ===

Savage reacted strongly to statements made about homosexuality by former United States Senator Rick Santorum in an April 2003 interview with the Associated Press. Santorum included gay sex as a form of deviant sexual behavior, along with incest, polygamy, and bestiality, that he said threatens society and the family; he said that he believed consenting adults do not have a constitutional right to privacy with respect to sexual acts. Savage invited his readers to create a sex-related definition for &quot;santorum&quot; to &quot;memorialize the Santorum scandal [...] by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head.&quot; The winning definition was &quot;the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.&quot; Savage set up a website to spread the term, inviting bloggers and others to link to it, which caused it to rise to the top of a Google search for Santorum&#x27;s name.

=== Tolyamorous ===
A tolyamorous person is someone in a monogamous relationship who knows that their partner occasionally has sex with somebody else, and is willing to put up with it and turn a blind eye. The word is similar to polyamory, and is a portmanteau of the Latin words &quot;tolerare&quot; (to tolerate, to bear) and &quot;amor&quot; (love).

Savage introduced this neologism on episode 900 of &quot;Savage Lovecast&quot; in January 2024.

<doc id="274115" wikidata="Q677122" url="?curid=274115" title="Lockheed Constellation">
<text>The Lockheed Constellation (&quot;Connie&quot;) is a propeller-driven, four-engined airliner built by Lockheed Corporation starting in 1943. The Constellation series was the first civil airliner family to enter widespread use equipped with a pressurized cabin, enabling it to fly well above most bad weather, thus significantly improving the general safety and ease of commercial passenger air travel.

Several different models of the Constellation series were produced, although they all featured the distinctive triple-tail and dolphin-shaped fuselage. Most were powered by four 18-cylinder Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclones. In total, 856 were produced between 1943 and 1958 at Lockheed&#x27;s plant in Burbank, California, and used as both a civil airliner and as a military and civilian cargo transport. Among their famous uses was during the Berlin and the Biafran airlifts. Three served as the presidential aircraft for Dwight D. Eisenhower, one of which is at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

==Design and development==
===Initial studies===
Lockheed had been working on the L-044 Excalibur, a four-engined, pressurized airliner, since 1937. In 1939, Transcontinental and Western Airlines (TWA), at the instigation of major stockholder Howard Hughes, requested a 40-passenger transcontinental airliner with a range of —well beyond the capabilities of the Excalibur design. TWA&#x27;s requirements led to the L-049 Constellation, designed by Lockheed engineers, including Kelly Johnson and Hall Hibbard. Willis Hawkins, another Lockheed engineer, maintains that the Excalibur program was purely a cover for the Constellation.
===Development of the Constellation===
The Constellation&#x27;s wing design was close to that of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, differing mostly in size. The triple tail allowed the aircraft to fit into existing hangars, while features included hydraulically boosted controls and a deicing system used on wing and tail leading edges. The aircraft had a maximum speed over , faster than that of a Japanese Zero fighter, a cruise speed of , and a service ceiling of .

According to Anthony Sampson in &quot;Empires of the Sky&quot;, Lockheed may have undertaken the intricate design, but Hughes&#x27;s intercession in the design process drove the concept, shape, capabilities, appearance, and ethos. These rumors were discredited by Johnson. Howard Hughes and Jack Frye confirmed that the rumors were false in a letter dated November 1941.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
With the onset of World War II, the TWA aircraft entering production were converted to an order for C-69 Constellation military transport aircraft, with 202 aircraft intended for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The first prototype (civil registration NX25600) flew on January 9, 1943, a short ferry hop from Burbank to Muroc Field for testing. Edmund T. &quot;Eddie&quot; Allen, on loan from Boeing, flew left seat, with Lockheed&#x27;s own Milo Burcham as copilot. Rudy Thoren and Kelly Johnson were also aboard.

Lockheed proposed the model L-249 as a long-range bomber. It received the military designation XB-30, but the aircraft was not developed. A plan for a very long-range troop transport, the C-69B (L-349, ordered by Pan Am in 1940 as the L-149), was cancelled. A single C-69C (L-549), a 43-seat VIP transport, was built in 1945 at the Lockheed-Burbank plant.

The C-69 was mostly used as a high-speed, long-distance troop transport during the war. In total, 22 C-69s were built before the end of hostilities, but seven of these never entered military service, as they were converted to civilian L-049s on the assembly line. The USAAF cancelled the remainder of the order in 1945. Some aircraft remained in USAF service into the 1960s, serving as passenger ferries for the airline that relocated military personnel, wearing the livery of the Military Air Transport Service.

===Postwar use===

After World War II, the Constellation came into its own as a fast civilian airliner. Aircraft already in production for the USAAF as C-69 transports were finished as civilian airliners, with TWA receiving the first on 1 October 1945. TWA&#x27;s first transatlantic proving flight departed Washington, D.C., on December 3, 1945, arriving in Paris on December 4 via Gander and Shannon.

TWA transatlantic service started on February 6, 1946, with a New York-Paris flight in a Constellation. On June 17, 1947, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) opened the first-ever scheduled round-the-world service with its L-749 &quot;Clipper America&quot;. The famous flight &quot;Pan Am 1&quot; operated until 1982.

As the first pressurized airliner in widespread use, the Constellation helped establish affordable and comfortable air travel. Operators of Constellations included TWA, Eastern Air Lines, Pan Am, Air France, BOAC, KLM, Qantas, Lufthansa, Iberia Airlines, Panair do Brasil, TAP Portugal, Trans-Canada Air Lines (later renamed Air Canada), Aer Lingus, VARIG, Cubana de Aviación, Línea Aeropostal Venezolana, Northwest Airlines, and Avianca, the national airline of Colombia.

===Records===
Sleek and powerful, Constellations set many records. On April 17, 1944, the second production C-69, piloted by Howard Hughes and TWA president Jack Frye, flew from Burbank, California, to Washington, D.C., in 6 hours and 57 minutes (about at an average ). On the return trip, the aircraft stopped at Wright Field in Ohio to give Orville Wright his last flight, more than 40 years after his historic first flight near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. He commented that the Constellation&#x27;s wingspan was longer than the distance of his first flight.

On September 29, 1957, a TWA L-1649A flew from Los Angeles to London in 18 hours and 32 minutes—about at . The L-1649A holds the record for the longest-duration, nonstop passenger flight aboard a piston-powered airliner. On TWA&#x27;s first London-to-San Francisco flight on October 1–2, 1957, the aircraft stayed aloft for 23 hours and 19 minutes (about at ).

===Obsolescence===
Jet airliners such as the de Havilland Comet, Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, Convair 880, and Sud Aviation Caravelle rendered the Constellation obsolete. The first routes lost to jets were the long overseas routes, but Constellations continued to fly domestic routes. The last scheduled passenger flight of a Constellation in the contiguous United States was made by a TWA L749 on May 11, 1967, from Philadelphia to Kansas City, Missouri; the last scheduled passenger flight in North America was by Western Airlines&#x27; N86525 in Alaska, Anchorage to Yakutat to Juneau on 26 November 1968.

Constellations carried freight in later years, and were used on backup sections of Eastern Airlines&#x27; shuttle service between New York, Washington, and Boston until 1968. Propeller airliners were used on overnight freight runs into the 1990s, as their low speed was not an impediment. An Eastern Air Lines Connie holds the record for a New York–to–Washington flight from take off to touchdown in just over 30 minutes. The record was set prior to speed restrictions by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) below .

One of the reasons for the elegance of the aircraft was the dolphin-shaped fuselage, a continuously variable profile with no two bulkheads the same shape
and a skin formed into compound curves, which was expensive to build. Manufacturers have since favored tube-shaped fuselages in airliner designs, as the cylindrical cross-section design is more resistant to pressurization changes and less expensive to build.

After ending Constellation production, Lockheed chose not to develop a first-generation jetliner, sticking to its military business and production of the turboprop Lockheed L-188 Electra. Lockheed did not build a large passenger aircraft again until its L-1011 Tristar debuted in 1972. While a technological marvel, the L-1011 was a commercial failure, and Lockheed left the commercial airliner business permanently in 1983.

==Variants==


The initial military versions carried the Lockheed designation of L-049; as World War II came to a close, some were completed as civilian L-049 Constellations followed by the L-149 (L-049 modified to carry more fuel tanks).

The first purpose-built passenger Constellations were the more powerful L-649 and L-749 (which had more fuel in the outer wings), L-849 (an unbuilt model to use the R-3350 turbo-compound engines adopted for the L-1049 ), L-949 (an unbuilt, high-density seating-&quot;cum&quot;-freighter type, what would come to be called a &quot;combi aircraft&quot;).

These were followed by the L-1049 Super Constellation (with longer fuselage), L-1149 (proposal to use Allison turbine engines) and L-1249 (similar to L-1149, built as R7V-2/YC-121F), L-1449 (unbuilt proposal for L1049G, stretched , with new wing and turbines) and L-1549 (unbuilt project to stretch L-1449 ).

The final civilian variant was the L-1649 Starliner (all new wing and L1049G fuselage).

Military versions included the C-69 and C-121 for the Army Air Forces/Air Force and the R7O R7V-1 (L-1049B) EC-121 WV-1 (L-749A) WV-2 (L-1049B) (widely known as the Willie Victor) and many variant EC-121 designations for the Navy.

==Operators==
After TWA&#x27;s initial order was filled following World War II, customers rapidly accumulated, with over 800 aircraft built. In military service, the U.S. Navy and Air Force operated the EC-121 Warning Star variant until 1978, nearly 40 years after work on the L-049 began. Cubana de Aviación was the first airline in Latin America to operate Super Constellations.

Aero Fret bought it in 1968, brought it back home to France, registered it as F-BRAD, and operated it on cargo hauls until 1974. When the Constellation landed in Nantes one last time to be scrapped, it was ultimately saved by Mr. Gaborit, who revamped it somewhat by his own modest means to finally park it near the terminal, accessible to visitors for a few years, until the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Nantes-Atlantique Airport bought it, to contract the &quot;Amicale du Super Constellation&quot; to undergo a complete restoration of the aircraft.

Kennedy International Airport at the original TWA terminal designed by Eero Saarinen to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the airline with the paint scheme donated by TWA in Kansas City for the occasion. The &quot;Star of America&quot; has appeared at many airshows and was even used in &quot;The Aviator&quot;, the 2004 film depicting the life of TWA&#x27;s one-time owner Howard Hughes, the man often credited with helping design and develop the original Constellation series.
;;L-1649 Starliner
* N7316C – returned to airworthiness by Lufthansa Technik North America in Auburn, Maine. This aircraft was purchased at auction in 2007, along with C/N 1038, by the Deutsche Lufthansa Berlin Foundation. Lufthansa has built a hangar at the airport, which will allow the aircraft to be restored indoors. Lufthansa announced in March 2018 that it will be transported back to Germany and further restoration decisions will be made after it arrives. As of the end of 2019 the plan is to restore the aircraft for static display in a museum. According to reports from the US, the aircraft was dismantled (as apparently was the Ju-52 D-AQUI) without the requisite documentation that would have allowed the return-to-flight work to continue. 
* N8083H – This aircraft was purchased at auction in 2007, along with C/N 1018, by the Deutsche Lufthansa Berlin Foundation, and stripped of all usable spares to support the restoration of C/N 1018.

<text>The National Football League All-Star Game (1939–1942), Pro Bowl (1951–2022), or Pro Bowl Games (since 2023) is an annual event held by the National Football League (NFL) featuring the league&#x27;s star players.

The format has changed throughout the years. Between 1939 and 1942, the NFL experimented with all-star games pitting the league&#x27;s champion against a team of all-stars. The first official Pro Bowl was played in January 1951, matching the top players in the American/Eastern Conference against those in the National/Western Conference. From the merger with the rival American Football League (AFL) in 1970 up through 2013 and also in 2017, it was officially called the AFC–NFC Pro Bowl, matching the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC). From 2014 through 2016, the NFL experimented with an unconferenced format, where the teams were selected by two honorary team captains (who are each in the Hall of Fame), instead of selecting players from each conference. The players were picked in a televised &quot;schoolyard pick&quot; prior to the game.

For years, the game suffered from lack of interest for its perceived low quality, with observers and commentators expressing their disfavor with it. It drew lower television ratings than regular season NFL games, although the game drew similar ratings to the all-star games of the other major North American sports leagues, such as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. However, the biggest concern was to avoid injuries to the star players. The Associated Press wrote that players in the 2012 game were &quot;hitting each other as though they were having a pillow fight&quot;. Despite these criticisms, however, players who were selected to the Pro Bowl were nonetheless honored in a similar standing to their counterparts in the other leagues, and being named to it is considered to be a significant accomplishment for any player. In September 2022, the NFL announced that the Pro Bowl game would switch to a non-contact flag football game in 2023, as well as a partnership with Peyton Manning&#x27;s Omaha Productions to revamp Pro Bowl week as the &quot;Pro Bowl Games&quot;.

Unlike the other major North American sports leagues, which hold their all star weekends roughly midway through their regular seasons, the NFL has held theirs at or near the end of NFL season. Before the merger, the game was played annually after the NFL Championship Game. Between 1970 and 2009, the Pro Bowl was usually held the weekend after the Super Bowl. From 2010 to 2022, it was played on the Sunday before the Super Bowl and since 2023, it was played on the first Thursday and first Sunday of February; as a result, players from the two teams competing in the Super Bowl will not participate.

==History of the Pro Bowl==
The first &quot;Pro All-Star Game&quot;, featuring the all-stars of the 1938 season (as well as three players from the Los Angeles Bulldogs and Hollywood Bears, who were not members of the league), was played on January 15, 1939, at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. The NFL All-Star Game was played again in Los Angeles in 1940 and then in New York and Philadelphia in 1941 and 1942 respectively. Although originally planned as an annual contest, the all-star game was discontinued after 1942 because of travel restrictions put in place during World War II. During the first five all-star games, an all-star team would face that year&#x27;s league champion. The league champion won the first four games before the all-stars were victorious in the final game of this early series.

The concept of an all-star game was not revived until June 1950, when the newly christened &quot;Pro Bowl&quot; was approved. The game was sponsored by the Los Angeles Publishers Association. It was decided that the game would feature all-star teams from each of the league&#x27;s two conferences rather than the league champion versus all-star format which had been used previously. This was done to avoid confusion with the Chicago College All-Star Game, an annual game which featured the league champion against a &quot;collegiate&quot; all-star team. The teams would be led by the coach of each of the conference champions. Immediately prior to the Pro Bowl, following the 1949 season, the All-America Football Conference, which contributed three teams to the NFL in a partial merger in 1950, held its own all-star game, the Shamrock Bowl.

The first 21 games of the series (1951–1972) were played in Los Angeles. The site of the game was changed annually for each of the next seven years before the game was moved to Aloha Stadium in Halawa, Hawaii, for 30 straight seasons from 1980 through 2009. The 2010 Pro Bowl was played at Sun Life Stadium, the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins and host site of Super Bowl XLIV, on January 31, the first time ever that the Pro Bowl was held before the championship game (a decision probably due to increasingly low Nielsen ratings from being regarded as an anti-climax to the Super Bowl). With the new rule being that the conference teams do not include players from the teams that will be playing in the Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl then returned to Hawaii in 2011 but was again held during the week before the Super Bowl, where it remained for three more years.

The 2012 game was met with criticism from fans and sports writers for the lack of quality play by the players. On October 24, 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had second thoughts about the Pro Bowl, telling a Sirius XM show that if the players did not play more competitively [in the 2013 Pro Bowl], he was &quot;not inclined to play it anymore&quot;. During the ensuing off-season, the NFL Players Association lobbied to keep the Pro Bowl, and negotiated several rule changes to be implemented for the 2014 game. Among them, the teams would no longer be AFC vs. NFC, and instead be selected by captains in a fantasy draft. For the 2014 game, Jerry Rice and Deion Sanders were chosen as alumni captains, while their captains were Drew Brees and Robert Quinn (Rice), along with Jamaal Charles and J. J. Watt (Sanders).

On April 9, 2014, the NFL announced that the 2015 Pro Bowl would be played the week before the Super Bowl at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on January 25, 2015. The game returned to Hawaii in 2016, and the &quot;unconferenced&quot; format was its last.

For 2017, the league considered hosting the game at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which would have been the first time the game had been hosted outside the United States. The NFL was also considering future Pro Bowls in Mexico and Germany to leverage international markets. A report released May 19, 2016, indicated that the 2017 Pro Bowl would instead be hosted at a newly renovated Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida; Orlando beat out Brazil (which apparently did not make the final round of voting), Honolulu, Super Bowl host site Houston, and a bid from Sydney, Australia, for the hosting rights. On June 1, 2016, the league announced that it was restoring the old conference format.

Since the 2017 Pro Bowl, the NFL has also hosted a series of side events leading up to the game called the Pro Bowl Skills Showdown, which includes competitions like passing contests and dodgeball among the players.

The 2021 Pro Bowl game was canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic, and new host Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas was held over to the 2022 Pro Bowl. The roster was still voted on and named, and alternative broadcast and streaming events were held during the week of the game.

In May 2022, Commissioner Roger Goodell questioned the future of the Pro Bowl, arguing that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;, and that &quot;another way to celebrate the players&quot; was needed. On September 26, 2022, it was announced that the NFL would host the 2023 event as &quot;The Pro Bowl Games&quot;—in partnership with Peyton Manning&#x27;s Omaha Productions—which will replace the culminating event with a flag football game.

==Player selection==
 
Players are voted into the Pro Bowl by the coaches, the players themselves, and the fans. Each group&#x27;s ballots count for ⅓, or 33.3%, of the votes. Fans vote on their preferred players at NFL.com. Replacements are selected should any selected player be unable to play for injuries, self-withdrawal, or Super Bowl contention. Prior to 1995, only the coaches and the players made Pro Bowl selections.

In order to be considered a Pro Bowler for a given year, a player must either have been one of the initial players selected to the team, or a player who accepts an invitation to the Pro Bowl as an alternate; invited alternates who decline to attend are not considered Pro Bowlers. Since 2010, players of the two teams that advance to the Super Bowl will not play in the Pro Bowl, and they are replaced by alternate players. Players who would have been invited as an alternate but could not play because they were slated to play in that season&#x27;s Super Bowl are also considered Pro Bowlers (for example, Tom Brady in 2016).

From 2014 to 2016, players did not play according to conference; instead, they were placed in a draft pool and chosen by team captains.

==Coaching staff==
When the Pro Bowl was held after the Super Bowl, the head coaches were traditionally the head coaches of the teams that lost in the AFC and NFC championship games for the same season of the Pro Bowl in question. From 1978 through 1982, the head coaches of the highest ranked divisional champion that lost in the Divisional Playoff Round were chosen. For the 1983 Pro Bowl, the NFL resumed selecting the losing head coaches in the conference championship games. In the 1999 Pro Bowl, New York Jets head coach Bill Parcells, after his team lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game, had to decline for health reasons and Jets assistant head coach Bill Belichick took his place.

When the Pro Bowl was moved to the weekend between the Conference Championship games and the Super Bowl in 2009, the team that lost in the Divisional Playoff Round with the best regular season record would have their coaching staffs lead their respective conference Pro Bowl team returning to the format used from 1978 to 1982. It remained that way through 2013; it resumed in 2017. If the losing teams of each conference had the same regular season record the coaches from the higher-seeded team will get the Pro Bowl honor. From 2014 to 2016, the Pro Bowl coaches came from the two teams with the best records that lost in the Divisional Playoffs. (In the 2015 Pro Bowl, when John Fox left his coaching job with Denver after his playoff loss to Indianapolis that year, John Harbaugh of Baltimore took over. The next year saw Green Bay&#x27;s assistant coach Winston Moss took over as Mike McCarthy resigned from coaching for illness.)

After changing to the Pro Bowl Games format in 2022, Manningcast hosts Peyton Manning and Eli Manning served as the &quot;honorary&quot; coaches for the AFC and NFC respectively. Peyton spent his entire playing career exclusively in the AFC with the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, while Eli played his whole career with the New York Giants in the NFC.

==Game honors==

A Player of the Game was honored 1951–1956. 1957–1971, awards were presented to both an Outstanding Back and an Outstanding Lineman. In 1972 and since 2014, there are awards for both an Outstanding Offensive Player and an Outstanding Defensive Player. 1973–2007, only one Player of the Game award was honored (though thrice this award has been presented to multiple players in a single game). In 2008 the award was changed to Most Valuable Player (MVP).

Players are paid for participating in the game with the winning team receiving a larger payout. The chart below shows how much the players of their respective teams earn:

==Rule differences==

Although there is no official rule against tackling, the players in the Pro Bowl have come to a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement to do little if any tackling. On the vast majority of plays, the ball carrier either gives up as soon as a defensive player grabs him, or goes out of bounds to avoid contact. In that sense it is essentially a two-hand touch football game. 

In addition to the above, the Pro Bowl does have different rules from regular NFL games to make the game safer with a view towards incorporating some of these rules to future NFL regular season games.

*No motion or shifting by the offense
*Offense must have a running back and tight end in all formations
*Offense may have up to three receivers on the same side
*Intentional grounding is legal
*No rushing the passer
*More than one forward pass thrown on the same play is allowed
*Defense must run a 4–3 at all times, though the Cover 2 and press coverage is allowed
*No blitz; DEs and tackles can rush on passing plays, provided they are on same side of ball
*No blindside or below the waist blocks
*No rushing the punter
*No rushing the kicker
*No rushing the holder
*Coin toss determines who receives first; loser receives to start third period. Procedure repeats at the start of first overtime.
*Kickoffs are eliminated (including free kicks)
*Punt returns are eliminated by the automatic fair catch
*Teams will start on their own 25-yard line after any score or at the start of each half/odd overtime
*If a team that would otherwise be kicking off wants to attempt to retain possession (situations where an onside kick would be attempted if there were kickoffs), they may run a single scrimmage play from their own 25-yard line; should the ball be advanced 15 yards forward, the team retains possession
*Receivers may flinch or raise either foot without incurring penalty
*35-second play clock to run plays
*Deep middle safety must be aligned within hash marks
*Replay reviews are allowed
*44-player roster per team
*Two-minute warning in effect for all quarters, plus overtime
*Game clock runs on incompletions except at two minutes left in half or overtime period
*Very limited contact is allowed much like touch football, provided the ball carrier is surrounded by opponents

In case of a tie after regulation, multiple 15-minute OT periods will be played (with each team receiving two time outs per period), and in the first overtime teams receive one possession to score unless one of them scores a safety on its first possession. True sudden death rules apply thereafter if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. The Pro Bowl is not allowed to end in a tie, unlike preseason and regular season games. (In general, beyond the first overtime, whoever scores first wins. The first overtime starts as if the game had started over, like the NFL Playoffs.)

The 2023 Pro Bowl introduced a new format with new rules. The game is now a best-of-three flag football game played on a 50-yard by 28-yard field (like arena football) with seven players per team on the field. The games consist of two 10-minute halves and a 15-minute halftime. Teams can elect to attempt a 1 point conversion from the 5 yard line or a 2 point conversion from the 10 yard line. In overtime, no matter if a touchdown is scored or not, teams get one possession. If the teams are tied after one possession, true sudden death rules apply. Teams can elect to &quot;punt&quot; on fourth down, which places the ball at the opponent&#x27;s 5 yard line. 

==Pro Bowl uniforms==

The teams are made of players from different NFL teams, so using their own uniforms would be too confusing. However, the players do wear the helmet of their respective team, but the home jerseys and pants are either a solid blue for the NFC or solid red for the AFC, with white jerseys with blue or red accents, respectively, for the away team.

The early Pro Bowl, contested by the National Football League&#x27;s Eastern and Western Division stars and played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, featured the same uniforms from the 1950s to mid-1960s; the Eastern team wore scarlet jerseys with white numerals and a white crescent shoulder stripe, white pants with red stripe, red socks, and a plain red helmet. The Western team wore white jerseys with royal-blue numerals and a Northwestern University-style Ukon triple stripe on the sleeves, white pants with blue stripe and socks and a plain blue helmet. Perhaps oddly, the Eastern team wore home dark jerseys, although the host city team, the Los Angeles Rams, were members of the Western Conference. From January 1967 to January 1970 both teams wore gold helmets with the NFL logo on the sides; the Eastern helmets featured a red-white-red tri-stripe and the Western a similar blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In fact, the players brought their own game helmets to Los Angeles, which were then spray-painted and decorated for the contest. For the 1970 game the helmets featured the &#x27;50 NFL&#x27; logo, commemorating the league&#x27;s half-century anniversary.

In the earliest years of the AFC–NFC Pro Bowl, the players did not wear their unique helmets. The AFC All-Stars wore a solid red helmet with a white A on it, while the NFC players wore a solid white helmet with a blue N on it. The AFC&#x27;s red helmets were paired with white jerseys and red pants, while the NFC&#x27;s white helmets were paired with blue jerseys and white pants. Beginning with the 1979 game, players wore the helmets of their respective teams.

Two players with the same number who were elected to the Pro Bowl could wear the same number for that game, which was not always the case in the past.

The 2008 Pro Bowl included a unique example of several players from the same team wearing the same number in a Pro Bowl. For the game, Washington Redskins players T Chris Samuels, TE Chris Cooley, and LS Ethan Albright all wore the number 21 (a number normally inappropriate for their positions) in memory of their teammate Sean Taylor, who had been murdered during the 2007 season.

On October 7, 2013, Nike unveiled the uniforms for the 2014 Pro Bowl, which revealed that the red, white and blue colors that the game uniforms bore throughout its entire history would not be used for the game. As the NFC–AFC format was not used between 2014 through 2016, team 1 sported a white uniform with bright orange and team 2 sported a gray uniform with volt green. The new uniforms received mixed reviews from fans and sports columnists alike, one even mentioning that the game would look like an &quot;Oregon vs. Oklahoma State&quot; game.

Since 2017, when the conference format was restored, the league took an approach similar to the NFL Color Rush initiative, in which jerseys, pants, and socks were all a uniform color (red for the AFC, blue for the NFC).

With the switch to the Pro Bowl Games format in 2023, players are no longer required to wear standard football uniforms, helmets and pads. Instead they wore red (for AFC) or blue (for NFC) shirts and either gray shorts or pants. Some players would also wear caps as headgear and compression tights.

==Records==
===Players with most invitations===
As of the 2024 Pro Bowl, 29 players have been invited to at least 11 Pro Bowls in their careers. Except for those that are current active or not yet eligible, each of these players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. With his selection in the 2022 Pro Bowl, quarterback Tom Brady has the all-time invitations record at 15. Of currently active players, offensive lineman Trent Williams has the most Pro Bowl invitations with 11.

==Television==
The Pro Bowl was originally broadcast on an alternative basis by CBS and NBC from 1971 to 1974, while the other network broadcast the Super Bowl. The game was then broadcast as part of the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; package on ABC from 1975 to 1987. Sister network ESPN took it over as part of the &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Football&quot; package from 1988 to 1994. The game then returned to ABC for the 1995 through 2003 games. In the early 2000s, after suffering through several years of dwindling ratings ABC considered moving the game to Monday night, but the network instead decided to sell off the rights for the 2004–2006 games to ESPN.

For the 2007 to 2014 Pro Bowls, the network which aired the Super Bowl that season also aired the Pro Bowl. The 2007 game on CBS was held on the Saturday after Super Bowl XLI because of the 49th Grammy Awards. The 2008 game was on Fox, broadcaster of Super Bowl XLII. Likewise, the 2009 game was on NBC, broadcaster of Super Bowl XLIII. CBS sold off their rights to the 2010 game to ESPN, which was played a week before the Super Bowl at the Super Bowl site, Sun Life Stadium. CBS also declined to broadcast the 2013 game, which was instead shown on NBC. The 2014 game, also shown on NBC, was the final Pro Bowl on network television for four years.

ESPN then began holding exclusive rights to the Pro Bowl starting in 2015. In 2018, the Pro Bowl returned to network television for the first time in four years as part of a joint ABC/ESPN simulcast (both sister networks are owned by The Walt Disney Company). Disney XD was added to the simulcast for 2019. The ESPN/ABC simulcasts of the game continued through 2022.

Throughout his broadcasting career, the late John Madden declined to be part of the announcing crew when his network carried the Pro Bowl for his aviatophobia and claustrophobia (a joke referencing both is made in the &quot;Madden NFL &#x27;97&quot; video game before the beginning of the Pro Bowl in season mode, where Madden quips that he drove his &quot;Madden Bus&quot; to Hawaii, rather than flying). Until Madden&#x27;s retirement from broadcasting after the 2009 Pro Bowl, it had only occurred twice: Former San Diego Chargers quarterback and &quot;MNF&quot; personality Dan Fouts, whom Madden had replaced, took his place on ABC in 2003, and Cris Collinsworth took his place on NBC in 2009 (Collinsworth ended up replacing Madden permanently upon the latter&#x27;s retirement).

In conjunction with the Professional Bowlers Association, the Pro Bowl also sponsors a charity bowling tournament the occurs during the weekend leading up to the game. The tournament is open to all NFL players regardless of whether they have been selected to play in the Pro Bowl. Winners are announced at halftime, and are presented with a check in their name payable to their favorite charity. 

===Most watched Pro Bowls===
:&quot;Since 2000&quot;
===Blackout policy===
Prior to 2015, the Pro Bowl was still subject to the NFL&#x27;s blackout policies, requiring the game to be blacked out within of the stadium site if the game does not sell out all of the stadium&#x27;s seats. However, with the lifting of the NFL&#x27;s blackout rules in 2015, the game can be shown within the host stadium regardless of attendance.

==Criticism==

===Quality===
For decades, the Pro Bowl has been criticized as a glamour event more than a football game. This is due to the voluntary nature of the game, the arbitrary voting process, and the fear of player injury.

While players are financially compensated for participating in the Pro Bowl, for a star player, the pay can be less than 1% of their salary. Many star players have excused themselves from participation over the years, meaning that the very best players are not necessarily featured. Not having the best players in the Pro Bowl was exacerbated by the introduction of fan voting (see section below).

Another criticism of the game is that the players—particularly on defense—are not competing at the same level of intensity as they would during the regular season or the playoffs. This is because player injury plays a much greater part in a team&#x27;s success in the NFL as compared to the other major American sports. For this reason, unlike the NBA, NHL, and MLB (which host their all-star events as a mid-season break), the Pro Bowl was historically held after the completion of the season and playoffs. This means that a player injured in the Pro Bowl would have at least six months to rehab before the next season begins. However, starting in 2010, the Pro Bowl was moved from the week after the Super Bowl to the week before it. Because of the above-noted fear of injury, players from the two teams participating in the Super Bowl were banned from participation, thus increasing the absence of star players.

In the 2012 game, the lack of defensive effort was apparent, not only to anyone watching, but additionally evidenced by the combined score of 100 points. Brett Keisel, an NFL player watching the game said, &quot;They probably should have just put flags on them,&quot; indicating that the quality was about on the level of flag football. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the game needed to improve, otherwise it would be eliminated. It is worth noting that entire teams have declined to participate after losing the conference championship, like the 2015 New England Patriots, which had seven starters on the Pro Bowl roster. This, among other factors, caused the 2016 Pro Bowl to be more of a game featuring emerging players, with a record of 133 players selected overall (including those who were absent), and ended up including rookie quarterback Jameis Winston instead of recognized veterans Tom Brady and Carson Palmer, who were both in the conversation for the 2015 NFL season MVP before losing in their respective conference finals. In 2022 and 2023, Josh Allen turned down invitations to the Pro Bowl in favor of playing in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament, decisions that he stated were to allow himself to recover from several minor injuries. In 2023, Las Vegas Raiders running back Josh Jacobs called the event &quot;stupid&quot; and stated that he would prefer to go on vacation rather than play in the game. The event was set to be hosted in Las Vegas that year.

===Selection process===
Voting by fans makes up 1/3 of the vote for Pro Bowl players. Some teams earn more selections of their players because fans often vote for their favorite team and not necessarily the best player. In the 2008 Pro Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys had thirteen players on the NFC roster, an NFL record. &quot;If you&#x27;re in a small market, no one really gets to see you play&quot;, said Minnesota Vikings cornerback Antoine Winfield, who spent much of his early career with the small-market Buffalo Bills. &quot;If you&#x27;re a quiet guy, it&#x27;s hard to get the attention. You just have to work hard and play.&quot; Winfield made the Pro Bowl in 2008 after ten seasons of being shut out.

The player voting has also been subject to significant criticism. It is not uncommon for players to pick the same players over and over again; former offensive lineman (and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; analyst) Ross Tucker has cited politics, incumbency, personal vendettas, and compensation for injury in previous years as primary factors in players&#x27; choices. Thus, players who have seen their play decline with age can still be perennially elected to the Pro Bowl for their popularity among other players, something particularly common among positions such as the offensive line, where few statistics are available. For example, in 2010, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs admitted voting for Ryan Fitzpatrick (then the backup quarterback of the Buffalo Bills) over eventual league most valuable player Tom Brady not because he thought Fitzpatrick was the better player but as a vote of disrespect toward Brady&#x27;s team, the New England Patriots.

Some players have had a surprisingly small number of Pro Bowl selections despite distinguished careers. Hall of Fame fullback John Riggins was selected only once in his career from 1971 to 1985. He was not selected in the year after which he set the record for rushing touchdowns in a season and his team made it to the Super Bowl (although he did make the All-Pro team). Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Nitschke only made the Pro Bowl once, despite being named All-Pro seven times and being the MVP of the 1962 NFL Championship Game. Defensive back Ken Riley never made the Pro Bowl in his 15 seasons, even though he recorded 65 interceptions, the fourth-highest total in NFL history at the time of his retirement. Former Jacksonville Jaguars halfback Fred Taylor, who is 15th in all-time rushing yards, was elected to his only Pro Bowl in 2007, despite averaging 4.6 yards per carry for his career, better than all but five running backs ranked in the top 30 in all-time rushing. Aaron Smith made it to the Pro Bowl once in 13 years (2004) despite winning two Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers and being named to the &quot;Sports Illustrated 2000s All Decade Team&quot; and defensive teammates such as Troy Polamalu, Casey Hampton, and James Harrison being named to multiple Pro Bowls during his career; Smith would often be ranked as one of the NFL&#x27;s most underrated players during his career.

<text>Peoples&#x27; Global Action (PGA) was the name of a worldwide co-ordination of radical social movements, grassroots campaigns and direct actions in resistance to capitalism and for social and environmental justice. PGA was part of the anti-globalization movement.

== History ==
The initial inspiration for the formation of PGA came from a global meeting called in 1996 by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN).

The Zapatistas called for a gathering, called an &#x27;encuentro&#x27; (encounter), of international grassroots movements to meet in specially constructed arenas in the Chiapas jungle to discuss common tactics, problems and solutions. Six thousand people attended, from over 40 countries, and declared that they would form &quot;a collective network of all our particular struggles and resistances... an intercontinental network of resistance against neoliberalism... (and) for humanity&quot;.

In August 1997, the European Zapatista support network called for a Second &#x27;Encuentro&#x27; in Spain, which it had planned with the Zapatistas during the 1996 encuentro. Delegates came again of movements from around the world, such as the Brazilian Landless Workers&#x27; Movement (MST) who occupies unused land to create farms, and the other Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha-KRRS (Karnataka State Farmers Association) from India, renowned for their &quot;cremate Monsanto&quot; campaign, which involved burning fields of genetically modified crops. 

In February 1998, movements from all continents met again, this time in Geneva, where Peoples&#x27; Global Action was launched.

== Horizontalist Structure and Organizing Model ==
The PGA used a horizontalist form of organizing, influenced by anarchist political models that saw the means and the ends as aligned. In part its structure and mode of organizing was developed as a critique of ‘vertical’ or authoritarian movements.

== Major activities ==
Peoples&#x27; Global Action had three main types of activities. Global Days of Action, Intercontinental/International and Regional Conferences, and Caravans through which activists from one part of the world, would travel to another part of the world to build solidarity.

== Global Days of Action ==
So far, PGA&#x27;s major function has been to serve as a political space for coordinating decentralised Global Action Days around the world, to highlight the global resistance of popular movements to capitalist globalisation. The first Global Action Days, during the 2nd WTO ministerial conference in Geneva in May 1998, involved tens of thousands of people in more than 60 demonstrations and street parties on five continents.

Subsequent Global Action Days have included the Carnival Against Capital (June 18, 1999), the 3rd World Trade Organization summit in Seattle, USA (November 30, 1999), the International Monetary Fund / World Bank meeting in Prague, Czech Republic (September 26, 2000), the G8 meeting in Genoa, Italy (June 21, 2000) the 4th WTO summit in Qatar (November 9, 2001), etc.

== Conferences ==
Groups involved in PGA have also organised global and regional conferences, workshops and other events in many regions of the world. Since the 1998 event in Geneva, Global PGA conferences have been held before WTO ministerials: in Bangalore, India (1999), and in Cochabamba, Bolivia (2001). 
Regional Conferences have been held in Europe (Athens, Milan, Belgrade, Barcelona, Dijon, Leiden), Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Brazil, Bangladesh, New Zealand (Aotearoa) and the United States.

===European Conference in 2008===
A Peoples&#x27; Global Action gathering in Europe took place from August 19 to September 3, in France, in a decentralised fashion in 2006. The first nine days were distributed over five sites, each with specific themes, while the last five days took place in a central location, the autonomous space « Les Tanneries » in Dijon.

== Caravans ==
In 1999, the PGA organized an Intercontinental Caravan that brought 450 representatives of grassroots movements from the Global South (particularly India, but also Brazil, Mexico, Bangladesh and Chile) to visit 12 European countries, meet with grassroots European movements and conduct joint solidarity actions. The &quot;Totally Crazy Project&quot; was initiated by MD Nanjundaswamy and European activists. 
An interview with an Indian participant from Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha
(KRRS), explained, 
&quot;We took part in 63 direct actions and 85 public meetings, and visited 38 farms ending at the G8 summit in Köln, Germany. In France we uprooted a GM rice trial with René Riesel and José Bové of the radical Confédération Paysanne (French Farmers Union), who were arrested and
sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. In Geneva we marched at the WTO office,
shouting “Kill the WTO”. In Rome we protested at the FAO headquarters, and at the G8
Summit in Germany we engaged in a laughing protest as part of a global day of action.&quot;

In 1999, there were two caravans of activists in the leadup to the anti-World Trade Organization (WTO) conference in Seattle One travelled across the U.S., including activists from Chiapas, Mexico, the other across Canada. The later ended at the congress organised by the non-partisan International Forum on Globalisation, described by De Fabel van de illegaal as a right-wing elite think tank.

== Criticism ==
===Right Wing Anti-Globalization===
The first version of the first PGA hallmark called for &quot;A very clear rejection of the WTO and other trade liberalisation agreements (like APEC, the EU, NAFTA, etc.) as active promoters of a socially and environmentally destructive globalisation;)&quot; This was critiqued for being too broad, and allowing the participation of right wing/nationalist movements within the PGA. Some criticized the participation of Mike Dolan, who worked for Ralph Nader&#x27;s Public Citizen consumer watchdog group, who raised funds for the PGA Caravan, and who later spoke in support of the right-wing presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. Dolan sent around a newspaper article in which Buchanan openly says: &quot;American workers and people first.&quot; When Dolan&#x27;s actions and viewpoint were criticised from the grassroots level, Michael Morrill, the coordinator of the American PGA caravan, took his side. &quot;Let&#x27;s work together when we can, work in parallel when we must, but never work against each other when our goal is the elimination of the WTO and its corporate benefactors.&quot;

As a result, the PGA Hallmarks were edited in order to make opposition to capitalism, colonialism, racism and patriarchy more explicit.

Nonetheless, until at least 2004, PGA events continued to attract right wing anti-globalist activists. The 2004 European PGA conference in Jajinci, Belgrade agreed that &quot;a fascist coming as an interested individual, respecting the hallmarks and whose behaviour during the conference was fine wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&quot; Although a rider was subsequently added, this controversy was fuelled by the sympathies held by Leonid Savin (the co-ordinator of the Ukraine PGA info-point) with politics of Alexander Dugin. After Savin was shown to be an activist associated with the Eurasia Party, the PGA Ukraine info-point was removed from the PGA website. See also National anarchism.

===Racism===
The PGA, like the global justice movement more generally, was criticized for racism and Eurocentrism. One important intervention argued that people of color were marginalized in the Seattle mobilisation against the World Trade Organization. 
In 2001, Raj Patel and Kala Subbuswamy discussed the problem of groups like the PGA in dealing with issues of race:

:The principles of decentralisation and autonomy adopted by many within radical movements can also, unintentionally and remediably, be exclusionary. Many radical groups have anarchist principles behind them - non-hierarchical, consensus decision-making, often no formal structure. One problem with this is that it is often used to dismiss talk of what &#x27;the movement&#x27; can do about issues of race and gender, on the grounds that we&#x27;re not a movement, we&#x27;re a collection of individuals and so we can&#x27;t make decisions about the &#x27;movement&#x27;. But UK EF!, or Peoples&#x27; Global Action, for example *are* movements, or at least networks with informal hierarchies and structures and unwritten rules. Every action involves a decision and a choice and it is important that these are open. For example, saying that we cannot exclude fascists from gatherings involves a choice - if people are allowed to say overtly racist comments, you exclude people of color, or at least prevent any chance of us feeling comfortable. This why at its last conference made explicit moves to overtly condemn discrimination
In 2002, Maria Theresa Santana, Chairperson of Moyo wa Taifa (UK) - Pan-Afrikan Women&#x27;s Association attended the European PGA Conference in Leiden and expressed her anger at the Eurocentric standpoint of the PGA discussions.

At the PGA regional conference in Panama (August 2003), further concerns were raised that despite anti-hierarchical intentions, a leadership was emerging which only occasionally &quot;got down the informations to their bases&quot;, that decisions were being made by meetings in Europe &quot;that Europeans were imposing their political reality and way to work&quot;, and that prominent activists were promoting sexist attitudes rooted in religious fundamentalism.

<doc id="274120" wikidata="Q631289" url="?curid=274120" title="Reversed field pinch">
<text>A reversed-field pinch (RFP) is a device used to produce and contain near-thermonuclear plasmas. It is a toroidal pinch that uses a unique magnetic field configuration as a scheme to magnetically confine a plasma, primarily to study magnetic confinement fusion. Its magnetic geometry is somewhat different from that of a tokamak. As one moves out radially, the portion of the magnetic field pointing toroidally reverses its direction, giving rise to the term &quot;reversed field&quot;. This configuration can be sustained with comparatively lower fields than that of a tokamak of similar power density. One of the disadvantages of this configuration is that it tends to be more susceptible to non-linear effects and turbulence. This makes it a useful system for studying non-ideal (resistive) magnetohydrodynamics. RFPs are also used in studying astrophysical plasmas, which share many common features.

The largest Reversed Field Pinch device presently in operation is the RFX (R/a = 2/0.46) in Padua, Italy. Others include the MST (R/a = 1.5/0.5) in the United States, EXTRAP T2R (R/a = 1.24/0.18) in Sweden, RELAX (R/a = 0.51/0.25) in Japan, and KTX (R/a = 1.4/0.4) in China.

==Characteristics==
Unlike the Tokamak, which has a much larger magnetic field in the toroidal direction than the poloidal direction, an RFP has a comparable field strength in both directions (though the sign of the toroidal field reverses). Moreover, a typical RFP has a field strength approximately one half to one tenth that of a comparable Tokamak. The RFP also relies on driving current in the plasma to reinforce the field from the magnets through the dynamo effect.

=== Magnetic topology ===
The reversed-field pinch works towards a state of minimum energy.

The magnetic field lines coil loosely around a center torus. They coil outwards. Near the plasma edge, the toroidal magnetic field reverses and the field lines coil in the reverse direction.

Internal fields are bigger than the fields at the magnets.

==RFP in Fusion Research: comparison with other confinement configurations==
The RFP has many features that make it a promising configuration for a potential fusion reactor.

=== Advantages ===
# Superconducting Magnets:
#* RFPs may not need superconducting magnets, providing a significant advantage over tokamaks.
#* Superconducting magnets are delicate, expensive, and must be shielded from the neutron-rich fusion environment.
# Shell as a Magnetic Coil:
#* Some RFP experiments, like the Madison Symmetric Torus, use a close-fitting shell as a magnetic coil.
#* Driving current through the shell itself is attractive for reactor design.
#* A solid copper shell could be robust against high-energy neutrons compared to superconducting magnets.
# Surface Instabilities:
#* RFPs are susceptible to surface instabilities, necessitating a close-fitting shell.
# Beta Limit:
#* There is no established beta limit for RFPs.
# Ignition Possibility:
#* There&#x27;s a possibility that a reversed field pinch could achieve ignition solely with ohmic power.
#* This involves driving current through the plasma and generating heat from electrical resistance rather than through electron cyclotron resonance, potentially simplifying reactor design compared to tokamaks.
#* However, it may not be operated in a steady state.

=== Disadvantages ===
Several key areas present challenges in the development of RFP reactors. Researchers are actively working on solutions for these issues:

* Current Drive Mechanisms: Current RFP devices rely on a method known as ohmic current drive, which has limitations. Researchers are exploring alternative current drive techniques to improve efficiency and control.
* Tearing Mode Mitigation: RFP plasmas are susceptible to tearing modes, which can negatively impact performance. Development of active control methods for these modes is crucial for achieving stable plasma confinement.
* Plasma Confinement Optimization: Current RFP devices achieve lower plasma confinement times compared to tokamaks. Research is ongoing to optimize plasma confinement in RFPs, including investigating the impact of device size through projects like the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST).
* Shell Design Considerations: The RFP design necessitates a conductive shell positioned close to the plasma, which presents engineering challenges for reactor design. Research is focused on optimizing the shell configuration to balance performance and practicality.
* Maintenance Strategies for Plasma Control Systems: Certain RFP designs utilize complex coil systems for plasma control. The proximity of these coils to the high-temperature plasma environment necessitates the development of robust maintenance strategies to ensure their long-term functionality.

==Plasma Physics Research==
The Reversed Field Pinch is also interesting from a physics standpoint. RFP dynamics are highly turbulent. RFPs also exhibit a strong plasma dynamo, similar to many astrophysical bodies. Basic plasma science is another important aspect of Reversed Field Pinch research.

<doc id="274123" wikidata="Q37856" url="?curid=274123" title="American Water Spaniel">
<text>The American Water Spaniel (often abbreviated to AWS) is a breed of spaniel which originated in the United States. It was developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.

They are medium-sized dogs, and have a double layered coat, which comes in a variety of brown related shades. A versatile hunting dog, they are also suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament. The AWS may have been involved in the development of the Boykin Spaniel.

==History==

Originating in Wisconsin, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed originated in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing in a variety of game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin&#x27;s cold water temperatures. Breeds involved in the creation of the American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.

This little brown dog created was known at the time as the American Brown Spaniel, and weighed around . It had a thick curly coat that protected it from the cold temperatures of the water and winter. It was used to hunt waterfowl, ruffed grouse, greater prairie chicken and a variety of fur–bearing animals.

Over the years the numbers of the breed began to dwindle due both to a reduction in the duck population through those valley areas, and because of a switch in hunting – from a means to gather food for survival to that of recreation. Additionally, following World War II, new types of dogs became available in Wisconsin such as setters, pointers and other spaniels, allowing additional specialization in hunting.

Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels in order to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs. He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20. Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to prospective dog owners read, &quot;The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man.&quot;

Due to Pfeifer&#x27;s work, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) as the American Water Spaniel in 1920, and by the Field Dog Stud Book in 1938. Pfeifer&#x27;s own dog, named &quot;Curly Pfeifer&quot; was the first American Water Spaniel to be registered with UKC. John Scofield of Missouri and Thomas Brogdan of Rush Lake, Wisconsin worked together with the American Water Spaniel Club (AWSC), gaining the breed recognition with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1940. Prior to recognition by the AKC, the breed had not been shown in the show ring.

The breed has links to the Boykin Spaniel, and is thought to have been the main breed used to develop the Boykin. The differences between the Boykin and the AWS are negligible with some dog historians suggesting that the original Boykin, called &quot;Dumpy&quot;, who was found on the streets of Spartanburg, South Carolina, was actually an American Water Spaniel who had been misplaced in transit. However the breed clubs for the Boykin do not agree with this account.

The breed was made the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were registered with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States, in particular in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. In 2010, the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when the breed was ranked 125th. The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials, but may compete in AKC hunt tests (spaniel and retriever tests) and retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC, the breed club in the United States. The American Water Spaniel Field Association was set up in 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of the breed. In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep the breed unclassified.

==Appearance==

The limited popularity of the American Water Spaniel restricted development, resulting in the breed being relatively unchanged since its origins in the 19th century. They are a medium-sized dog, with a curly liver, brown, or chocolate colored coat. The average height at the withers for the breed is , and their weight around . They have similar features to the Irish Water Spaniel, but the Irish breed is larger at between and weighing . The coat of the American Water Spaniel can fall in two different patterns, either tightly curled or in the &quot;marcel pattern&quot; where the fur falls in waves. Working and show lines have not diverged as with some other breeds of spaniel, and both appear the same, with show dogs of this breed being rare.

The coat has a coarse outside layer which keeps water away and protects the dog from foliage such as briers. The inside layer provides insulation to keep the dog warm. The coat has an oily feel to it, which gives off a &quot;doggy smell&quot;. The breed standard specifies color of the eyes should harmonize with the color of the coat, and should never be yellow. The skull is broad, and carries long, wide ears. The tail is not typically docked.

==Temperament==

In the field, the AWS is less exuberant than the English Springer Spaniel, but it is as skilled in retrieval as Labrador or Golden Retriever. It is versatile regardless of the type of terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed is also good at agility and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.

Members of the breed enjoy being the center of attention, and can be quite vocal at times. It is a one family dog, and will often bond with one particular individual. For many years the breed was &quot;pack bred&quot;, where they were allowed to live in a group. Since these times, breeders have been working to breed even tempered dogs that are suitable for both hunting and family life.

The AWS has a mind of its own at times and reaches peak performance with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.

==Health==
Pack breeding early in its development led to a level of genetic variation, so the hereditary conditions of more popular breeds are not common in the AWS. The breed however is known to suffer from eye issues including cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy. Inheritance is suspected in both conditions, with the average age of cataract onset at under one year old.

Additional concerns are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabetes and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around six months of age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This was one of the lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 10–13 years.

<text>Trailer is a mini album by the band Ash featuring their first three singles. An expanded edition also includes four B-sides. The album was released in October 1994 through Infectious Records. The band considered it a &quot;trailer&quot; for their future debut album proper, and named it accordingly.

&quot;Uncle Pat&quot; was featured in a Heineken advert, which helped to raise the profile of the band, both in Ireland and Britain.

==Background==
&quot;Trailer&quot; was produced by Mark Waterman. Tim Russell mixed &quot;Season&quot;, &quot;Intense Thing&quot;, &quot;Uncle Pat&quot; and &quot;Get Out&quot;.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Trailer&quot; has been tagged as groove rock, noise rock and pop-punk. AllMusic review Ralph Heibutzki suggested listeners should &quot;imagine classic punk maneuvers crossed with Nirvana- and Dinosaur Jr.-style leanings, goosed by a bolt of Mega City Four&quot;. Author Dave Thompson wrote in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000): &quot;A hint of Brit-pop savvy, a dash of older Indy-American fuzz, beaten and blended into something which cites The Buzzcocks as an influence, but can also sound like Black Sabbath.&quot; Dialogue was culled from Oscar Wilde and Patrick the Brewer for the recordings.

&quot;Season&quot;, the opening track to &quot;Trailer&quot;, discusses the topics of love and suicide. Heibutzki said &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot;, alongside the bonus track &quot;Punk Boy&quot;, &quot;could give Green Day a run for its pop-punk roses&quot;. &quot;Uncle Pat&quot; details an exploration to a grave site via woods; Chris Molanphy, writing in &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, remarked that the group &quot;shows admirable restraint by pulling back the feedback at key points and letting the pretty notes ring out.&quot; &quot;Hot Press&quot; writer Liam Fay called &quot;Petrol&quot; an &quot;unleaded geyser of melody, attitude and general weirdness&quot;. &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot; is named after the 1963 film of the same name, which Heibutzki felt &quot;points to the band&#x27;s love of all things extraterrestrial&quot;. Kayley Kravitz of &quot;Vanyaland&quot; said the chorus section, which includes elements of doo-wop, serves as a &quot;stark contrast to a song that is otherwise about the annihilation of planet Earth by alien lifeforms.&quot;

The &#x27;noise&#x27; at the end of the track &quot;Get Out&quot;, when reversed, slowed down and the pitch altered, is a low quality demo version of the song &quot;Intense Thing&quot;. This track wasn&#x27;t discovered until June 2006 by 2 fans experimenting around with running different effects through Ash songs.

==Release==
&quot;Trailer&quot; was issued in October 1994, during the emergence of Britpop; Wheeler said they were instead labelled under new wave of new wave. One vinyl repressing of it was issued with a 7&quot; containing BBC recordings of &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; and &quot;Jazz 59&quot;. Around this, Marshall was attended a CMJ convention in New York City, looking for potential options for the band in the United States. Of the various labels, Marshall said Tim Carr, the A&amp;R vice-president of Reprise Records, was enthusiastic about the group &quot;from Day One,&quot; going as far to fly to the UK to watch the band perform twice. By May 1995, Ash had signed to Reprise; the deal only covered North and South America, which differed from typical major label contracts with indie labels in the UK. It was intentional on Infectious Records&#x27; part, who wanted to boost their brand by licensing their artists to labels for particular markets. Prior to the US release of &quot;1977&quot;, &quot;Trailer&quot; had sold 7,162 copies in that territory. &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; was released as a single there on August 15, 1995, to promote the soundtrack to the film &quot;Angus&quot; (1995). &quot;Trailer&quot; was released in the US on 12 September 1995. They re-recorded &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; again for their 2011 &quot;The Best of Ash&quot; compilation.

==Reception==

Several critics complimented the songwriting. Heibutzki praised Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;relentlessly catchy confections&quot; for &quot;stand[ing] up to the Britpop vanguard&#x27;s finest hours&quot;, and mentioned that the band &quot;emphasizes stripped-down velocity over finesse.&quot; Fay added to this, saying that it served as a &quot;measure of these three guys’ confidence and musical acumen that they manage to transform such workaday ingredients into such a tasty and inspired brew.&quot; He said that the album &quot;proves conclusively that, by any standards, Ash are a rock band of genuine stature&quot;, regardless of the members&#x27; ages. Imran Ahmed of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said it offers a valuable snapshot of a growing songwriting talent.&quot; &quot;Consumable Online&quot; write Tim Mohr added to this, saying said it &quot;yielded a catch of sloppy punk-pop songs, loud, fast, and fun ... certifying that the album was made by real teenagers and that certain songs were written in 5 minutes.&quot; Joachim Hiller of &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; noted that they were &quot;a bit punky, a bit noisy, but they can&#x27;t hide the fact that they&#x27;re just another boring band from the island.&quot;

Other reviewers commented on it in the context of Ash&#x27;s influences. Scott Hefflon of &quot;Lollipop Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;Starting with a pleasant pop/punk formula similar to the Buzzcocks and adding a flavoring of Dino Jr-esque guitar noise, Ireland’s Ash are a band on the move.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; Cherly Botchick wrote that despite the band&#x27;s geographical origins, &quot;Trailer&quot; &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more steeped in delightfully familiar American rock traditions. She added that they created an album &quot;packed with enough hooks and melodies to make&quot; their US contemporaries &quot;green with envy.&quot; Molanphy said &quot;for all the (not unfounded) comparisons Ash has drawn to the Buzzcocks, its better numbers ... display a formidable talent for weaving hummable tunes and picaresque lyrics in the sonic assault.&quot; Fay felt that the references to other bands were a &quot;little overly deferential&quot; and said that the lyrics were &quot;too often trite and predictable&quot;.

<text>Wei Jingsheng (; born 20 May 1950) is a Chinese human rights activist and dissident. He is best known for his involvement in the Chinese democracy movement. He is most prominent for having authored the essay &quot;The Fifth Modernization&quot;, which was posted on the Democracy Wall in Beijing in 1978. As punishment from the government for writing his manifesto, Wei was arrested and convicted of &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; activities, and was detained as a political prisoner from 1979 to 1993. Briefly released in 1993, Wei continued to engage in his dissident activities by speaking to visiting journalists, and as punishment, he was imprisoned again from 1994 to 1997, making it a total of 18 years he has spent in various prisons. He was deported to the United States of America on 16 November 1997, on medical parole. Still a Chinese citizen, in 1998 Wei established the Wei Jingsheng Foundation in New York City (now based in Washington, D.C.) whose stated aim is to work to improve human rights and advocate democratisation in China.

==Early years==
Wei was the oldest of four children, brought up by Chinese Communist Party cadres. In 1966, Wei joined the Red Guards as a 16-year-old student during the Cultural Revolution. He lived in remote rural areas in Northern China and was able to speak with peasant farmers about the widespread famines that had occurred a few years before, during the Great Leap Forward. He uncovered the role that the communist government under Mao Zedong played in causing the famines, and it forced Wei to start questioning the nature of the system under which he lived. Wei would later write about this period: &quot;I felt as if I had suddenly awakened from a long dream, but everyone around me was still plunged in darkness.&quot; In 1973, he began working as an electrician at the Beijing Zoo.

==Democracy Wall==
Wei did not publicly voice his feelings until 1978, when he decided to take part in the newly emerging Democracy Wall movement which was then taking place in Beijing. On 5 December 1978, he posted an essay which he authored on the wall. Entitled &quot;The Fifth Modernization,&quot; Wei&#x27;s essay was a response to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s essay, the Four Modernizations. The basic theme of Wei&#x27;s essay is that democracy should also be a modernization goal for China along with the other four modernizations which were proposed by Deng (industry, agriculture, science and technology, and national defense).

Wei signed the essay with his real name and address. The essay immediately caused a stir because of its boldness and because its author was not anonymous. It was also the only essay which addressed Deng Xiaoping by name, and it was also the only essay which referred to him as a dictator. 

Wei differed from the mainstream of the Democracy Wall movement (which believed that the primary conflict was between a bureaucratic class and the people) because unlike the majority of movement participants, he argued that a totalitarian political system was the source of the people&#x27;s grievances. He was one of the few activists who explicitly argued against Marxism and the leadership of a Marxist party.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
Wei is also known for his editorial work in the short-lived magazine &quot;Explorations&quot; () in 1979. He published a letter under his name in March 1979 in which he denounced the inhuman conditions which existed in Beijing&#x27;s Qincheng Prison, where the 10th Panchen Lama was imprisoned.

His dissident writings eventually led him to be tried and imprisoned. Orville Schell, a writer and academic who specializes in China, wrote:

Wei ultimately spent a total of 18 years in different prisons in China. During this time, he wrote letters explaining his views which were compiled into a book, &quot;The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings&quot;. Some of the letters were directly addressed to Deng Xiaoping, other letters were addressed to different family members of Wei. He remained imprisoned until 14 September 1993, when he was released just one week before the International Olympic Committee held a vote over whether it should award the 2000 Summer Olympics to Beijing or Sydney. Wei continued to speak out, despite the threat of arrest.

On 27 February 1994, Wei met with United States Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck to discuss human rights conditions in China, and he also met with journalists. Wei was arrested the following week along with fifteen other democracy and labor activists. Although he was released shortly afterward and sent into exile in Tianjin, Wei was arrested once more on 1 April 1994 when he tried to return to Beijing. Charged with plotting against the state, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison, but he would only remain in prison until 16 November 1997, when he was released, ostensibly for medical reasons, and promptly deported to the United States. He was sent to the United States due to international pressure, especially the request by US President Bill Clinton.

== COVID-19 ==
In a September 2021 documentary titled &quot;What Really Happened in Wuhan&quot; by Australian journalist and author Sharri Markson, Wei claimed that he attempted to warn American authorities about COVID-19 in October 2019 after being informed of an outbreak by contacts in Beijing. He also claims that China was aware of the virus much sooner than they admitted and intentionally spread the virus during the World Military Games in Wuhan when they were held between 19 and 27 October 2019.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Wei Jingsheng was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. He is a winner of numerous other human rights and democracy awards, including the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award in 1996, the National Endowment for Democracy Award in 1997, the Olof Palme Memorial Prize in 1994, and the International Activist Award by the Gleitsman Foundation in 1993.

<doc id="274137" wikidata="Q1503674" url="?curid=274137" title="Apache SpamAssassin">
<text>Apache SpamAssassin is a computer program used for e-mail spam filtering. It uses a variety of spam-detection techniques, including DNS and fuzzy checksum techniques, Bayesian filtering, external programs, blacklists and online databases. It is released under the Apache License 2.0 and is a part of the Apache Foundation since 2004.

The program can be integrated with the mail server to automatically filter all mail for a site. It can also be run by individual users on their own mailbox and integrates with several mail programs. Apache SpamAssassin is highly configurable; if used as a system-wide filter it can still be configured to support per-user preferences.

==History==
Apache SpamAssassin was created by Justin Mason, who had maintained a number of patches against an earlier program named &quot;filter.plx&quot; by Mark Jeftovic, which in turn was begun in August 1997. Mason rewrote all of Jeftovic&#x27;s code from scratch and uploaded the resulting codebase to SourceForge on April 20, 2001.

In Summer 2004 the project became an Apache Software Foundation project and later officially renamed to &quot;Apache SpamAssassin&quot;.

==Methods of usage==
Apache SpamAssassin is a Perl-based application ( in CPAN) which is usually used to filter all incoming mail for one or several users. It can be run as a standalone application or as a subprogram of another application (such as a Milter, SA-Exim, Exiscan, MailScanner, MIMEDefang, Amavis) or as a client () that communicates with a daemon (). The client/server or embedded mode of operation has performance benefits, but under certain circumstances may introduce additional security risks.

Typically either variant of the application is set up in a generic mail filter program, or it is called directly from a mail user agent that supports this, whenever new mail arrives. Mail filter programs such as procmail can be made to pipe all incoming mail through Apache SpamAssassin with an adjustment to a user&#x27;s file.

==Operation==
Apache SpamAssassin comes with a large set of rules which are applied to determine whether an email is spam or not. Most rules are based on regular expressions that are matched against the body or header fields of the message, but Apache SpamAssassin also employs a number of other spam-fighting techniques. The rules are called &quot;tests&quot; in the SpamAssassin documentation.

Each test has a score value that will be assigned to a message if it matches the test&#x27;s criteria. The scores can be positive or negative, with positive values indicating &quot;spam&quot; and negative &quot;ham&quot; (non-spam messages). A message is matched against all tests and Apache SpamAssassin combines the results into a global score which is assigned to the message. The higher the score, the higher the probability that the message is spam.

Apache SpamAssassin has an internal (configurable) score threshold to classify a message as spam. Usually a message will only be considered as spam if it matches multiple criteria; matching just a single test will not usually be enough to reach the threshold.

If Apache SpamAssassin considers a message to be spam, it can be further rewritten. In the default configuration, the content of the mail is appended as a MIME attachment, with a brief excerpt in the message body, and a description of the tests which resulted in the mail being classified as spam. If the score is lower than the defined settings, by default the information about the tests passed and total score is still added to the email headers and can be used in post-processing for less severe actions, such as tagging the mail as suspicious.

Apache SpamAssassin allows for a per-user configuration of its behavior, even if installed as system-wide service; the configuration can be read from a file or a database. In their configuration users can specify individuals whose emails are never considered spam, or change the scores for certain rules. The user can also define a list of languages which they want to receive mail in, and Apache SpamAssassin then assigns a higher score to all mails that appear to be written in another language.

Apache SpamAssassin is based on heuristics (pattern recognition), and such software exhibits false positives and false negatives.

==Network-based filtering methods==
Apache SpamAssassin also supports:
* DNS-based blacklists and DNS-based whitelists
* Fuzzy-checksum-based spam detection filters such as the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse, Vipul&#x27;s Razor and the Cloudmark Authority plugins (commercial)
* Hashcash email stamps based on proof-of-work
* Sender Policy Framework and DomainKeys Identified Mail
* URI blacklists such as SURBL or URIBL which track spam websites

More methods can be added reasonably easily by writing a Perl plug-in for Apache SpamAssassin.

==Bayesian filtering==
Apache SpamAssassin reinforces its rules through Bayesian filtering where a user or administrator &quot;feeds&quot; examples of good (ham) and bad (spam) into the filter in order to learn the difference between the two. For this purpose, Apache SpamAssassin provides the command-line tool , which can be instructed to learn a single mail or an entire mailbox as either ham or spam.

Typically, the user will move unrecognized spam to a separate folder, and then run on the folder of non-spam and on the folder of spam separately. Alternatively, if the mail user agent supports it, can be called for individual emails. Regardless of the method used to perform the learning, SpamAssassin&#x27;s Bayesian test will help score future e-mails based on this learning to improve the accuracy.

==Licensing==
Apache SpamAssassin is free/open source software, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Versions prior to 3.0 are dual-licensed under the Artistic License and the GNU General Public License.

Many commercially available anti-spam packages integrate SpamAssassin as part of their products, such as SpamKiller by McAfee and Kerio MailServer by Kerio.

==sa-compile==
codice_1 is a utility distributed with Apache SpamAssassin that compiles a SpamAssassin ruleset into a deterministic finite automaton that allows Apache SpamAssassin to use processor power more efficiently.

==Testing==
Apache SpamAssassin is designed to trigger on the GTUBE, a 68-byte string similar to the antivirus EICAR test file. If this string is inserted in an RFC 5322 formatted message and passed through the Apache SpamAssassin engine, Apache SpamAssassin will trigger with a weight of 1000.

<text>Thomas Sheridan (1719 – 14 August 1788) was an Irish stage actor, an educator, and a major proponent of the elocution movement. He received his M.A. in 1743 from Trinity College in Dublin, and was the godson of Jonathan Swift. He also published a &quot;respelled&quot; dictionary of the English language (1780). He was married (1747) to Frances Chamberlaine. His sons were the better known Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Charles Francis Sheridan, while his daughters were also writers - Alicia, a playwright, and Betsy Sheridan a diarist. His work is very noticeable in the writings of Hugh Blair.

==Life==
Thomas Sheridan was the third son of Dr Thomas Sheridan, an Anglican divine, noted for his close friendship with Jonathan Swift, and his wife Elizabeth McFadden His parents&#x27; marriage was notoriously unhappy, and they lived apart much of the time. Thomas attended Westminster School in 1732–1733 but, because of his father&#x27;s financial problems, he had to finish his initial education in Dublin. In 1739, he earned his BA from Trinity College, Dublin and he went on to earn his MA from Trinity in the early 1740s. He had his début in acting when he played the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; in Dublin. Soon after, he was noted as the most popular actor in Ireland, being compared often with David Garrick. Not only an actor, but he also wrote &quot;The Brave Irishman or Captain O&#x27;Blunder&quot; which premièred in 1738. He became the manager of the Dublin theatre sometime in the 1740s.

Sheridan left his acting career, although he continued to manage theatre companies and occasionally play bit parts, and moved permanently to England with his family in 1758. There, his time was spent as a teacher and an educator offering a very successful lecture course. In 1762 Sheridan published &quot;Lectures on Elocution&quot;. Following that work, he published &quot;A Plan of Education&quot; (1769), &quot;Lectures on the Art of Reading&quot; (1775), and &quot;A General Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1780). Each of these works was based on some form of an argument taken in an earlier work &quot;British Education: Or, The source of the Disorders of Great Britain. Being an Essay towards proving, that the Immorality, Ignorance, and false Taste, which so generally prevail, are the natural and necessary Consequences of the present to defective System of Education. With an attempt to shew, that a revival of the Art of Speaking, and the Study of Our Own Language, might contribute, in a great measure, to the Cure of those Evils&quot; (1756).

He lived in London for a number of years before moving to Bath where he founded an academy &quot;for the regular instruction of Young Gentlemen in the art of reading and reciting and grammatical knowledge of the English tongue&quot;. This venture apparently proving to be unsuccessful, he returned to Dublin and the theatre in 1771. Thomas&#x27;s son Richard became a partial owner of the Theatre Royal in London in 1776. Two years later Thomas was appointed manager of the theatre, a position he held until 1781.

==Beliefs==
Sheridan attempted to supply the willing student with a guide to public speaking that was correct, appropriate, and successful. What he actually wanted was a total reform of the British education system, as he saw it disregarding elocution and/or rhetorical delivery. In his work &quot;British Education&quot;, Sheridan claimed that poor preaching was negatively affecting religion itself.

Sheridan&#x27;s belief in the valuable effects of strong and correct public speaking was so strong that he was sure studying elocution would help ensure perfection in all of the arts. In &quot;British Education&quot;, Sheridan writes that preaching from the pulpit &quot;must either effectually support religion against all opposition, or be the principal means of its destruction&quot;.

Convinced that English preaching was not done as well as it should be, Sheridan focused on delivery as the principal avenue toward delivering effective messages to an audience: &quot;Before you can persuade a man into any opinion, he must first be convinced that you believe it yourself. This he can never be, unless the tones of voice in which you speak come from the heart, accompanied by corresponding looks, and gestures, which naturally result from a man who speaks in earnest.&quot; Sheridan believed that elocution was not restricted to the voice, but embodied the entire person with facial expressions, gestures, posture, and movement.

== &quot;A Course of Lectures on Elocution&quot; ==
Published in 1762, this work is considered by many to be Sheridan&#x27;s most well-known. He established a niche for his insights through decrying the current state of public speaking, as he often did: &quot;so low is the state of elocution amongst us, that a man who is master even of these rudiments of rhetoric, is comparatively considered, as one of excellent delivery&quot;. Besides establishing the points previously mentioned, the quote also offers a more narrow definition of rhetoric that seems to be influenced by Peter Ramus.

Central to Sheridan&#x27;s work was his emphasis on the importance of tones to eloquence. These tones, which correlated with the expressive effects one can give to their speaking, were something Sheridan considered an important part of persuasion. He stated, &quot;The tones expressive of sorrow, lamentation, mirth, joy, hatred, anger, love, &amp;c. are the same in all nations, and consequently can excite emotions in us analogous to those passions, when accompanying words which we do not understand: nay the very tones themselves, independent of words, will produce the same effects&quot;. For Sheridan, how a message was communicated was apparently as important as the message itself. He uses the example of someone saying in a calm demeanour, &quot;My rage is rouzed to a pitch of frenzy, I can not command it: Avoid me, be gone this moment, or I shall tear you to pieces&quot; to show the importance of tones to a message.

Because of this, Sheridan set out to address what he thought John Locke had left out in his treatment of language: &quot;(t)he nobler branch of language, which consists of the signs of internal emotions, was untouched by him as foreign to his purpose&quot;.

<text>The Voyager Mars Program was a planned series of uncrewed NASA probes to the planet Mars. The missions were planned, as part of the Apollo Applications Program, between 1966 and 1968 and were scheduled for launch in 1974–75. The probes were conceived as precursors for a crewed Mars landing in the 1980s.

Originally, NASA had proposed a direct lander using a variant of the Apollo Command Module launched atop of a Saturn IB rocket with a Centaur upper stage. With the discovery by Mariner 4 in 1965 that Mars had only a tenuous atmosphere, the mission was changed to have both an orbiter and lander. This required the use of a Saturn V to launch two probes at once. The orbiter would have been a modified Mariner probe identical to that employed for Mariner 8 and Mariner 9, while the landers would have been Surveyor moon probes modified with the use of aeroshells and a combination parachute/retrorocket landing systems.

Funding for the program, like that of the entire AAP, was cut in 1968 and the mission itself was cancelled entirely in 1971, mainly on the grounds that launching both probes on a single rocket was both risky and expensive. Voyager was the first major space science project to be cancelled by the U.S. Congress.

Despite the cancellation, the planning and development of the Voyager Mars program was eventually carried out by NASA&#x27;s Viking program in the mid-1970s. Cheaper and simpler than the Voyager Mars program (using the same Mariner 8/9 design for the orbiter, but with an automobile-sized lander with a very expensive microbiology lab), the Viking 1 and Viking 2 probes were launched to Mars on separate Titan IIIE/Centaur rockets in 1975 and reached Mars in 1976.

After the cancellation, the &quot;Voyager&quot; name was recycled for the Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 probes to the outer planets, with the latter probe, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; (Mariner 12), completing another ambitious post-Apollo project, the &quot;Grand Tour&quot;. The Saturn V had also been planned at one point as the launch vehicle for an upscaled probe for this mission.

<doc id="274142" wikidata="Q21206" url="?curid=274142" title="Alaskan Malamute">
<text>The Alaskan Malamute () is a large breed of dog that was originally bred for its strength and endurance, to haul heavy freight as a sled dog. It is similar to other arctic breeds such as the husky, the spitz, the Greenland Dog, Canadian Eskimo Dog, the Siberian Husky, and the Samoyed.

== Lineage ==
Although it is believed that the first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago, followed by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, with both originating from Siberia. Malamutes were thought to be bred by the Malimiut Inupiaq people of Alaska&#x27;s Norton Sound region.

The Malamute has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. A study in 2013 showed that the Alaskan Malamute has a similar east Asian origin to, but is not clearly related to, the Greenland Dog and the Canadian Eskimo Dog, but contains a possible admixture of the Siberian Husky.

In 2015, a study using several genetic markers indicated that the Malamute, the Siberian Husky, and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled-dogs from Siberia. They were separate from the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Malamute and the Siberian Husky both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that was consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America. DNA extracted from a 9,500-year-old dog, Zhokhov, named after the Siberian island, was found to have shared a common ancestor with the Greenland sledge dog, the Alaskan Malamute and the Siberian Husky.

== Appearance ==

The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard describes a natural range of size, with a desired size of tall and for females, tall and for males. Heavier individuals () and dogs smaller than are commonly seen. There is often a marked size difference between males and females. Weights upwards of are also seen.

The Alaskan Malamute is double-coated. The undercoat has an oily and woolly texture and can be as thick as two inches. The outer guard coat is coarse and stands off the body longer at the withers but not more than one inch off the sides of the body. Ears are small in proportion to the head and stand firmly erect when at attention. The Alaskan Malamute is a heavy dog, with a more formidable nature and structure than the Siberian Husky, which is bred for speed. The Alaskan Malamute is bred for power and endurance, which is its original function and what the standard of the breed requires of Alaskan Malamute breeders.

The usual colors are various shades of grey and white, sable and white, black and white, seal and white, red and white, or solid white. There are a wide range of markings in the breed including face markings, blazes, a splash at the nape of the neck, and a collar or half collar. White is often the predominant color on the body, parts of the legs, feet, and part of the markings of the face. In terms of color variants, some Malamutes exhibit a dark grey to buff-colored undertone around their trimmings and white areas, presenting with a color-linked gene known as Agouti. Two agouti alleles, with the possibility of a third, appear to be found in Malamutes: aw (Agouti Pattern or Wolf/Wild Pattern), at (Tan Point Pattern or Black Pattern), and awat (Heterozygous Agouti or Dark Agouti).

The eyes of the Alaskan Malamute are almond-shaped and are varied shades of brown; however, the darker eye is preferred. Purebred Alaskan Malamutes will not have blue eyes. The physical build of the Malamute is compact and strong with substance, bone and snowshoe feet.

According to the AKC breed standard, the Malamute&#x27;s tail is well furred and is carried over the back like a waving plume. Corkscrew tails are occasionally seen but are faulted in the AKC breed standard (a corkscrew tail is commonly seen in the Akita). The Malamutes well-furred tails aid in keeping them warm when they curl up in the snow. They are often seen wrapping the tail around their nose and face, which presumably helps protect them against harsh weather such as blowing snow. Their ears are generally upright, wedge-shaped, small in proportion to the head and set to the side of the skull. The muzzle is deep and broad, tapering slightly from the skull to the nose. Nose and gums are black but some Malamutes have a snow nose, which is black with a pink undertone that can get darker or lighter, depending on the season.
== Health ==
A 2024 study in the UK found an average life expectancy of 11.3 years compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The most commonly reported health problems of Alaskan Malamutes, in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey (based on a sample size of 64 dogs) were musculoskeletal (hip dysplasia), and hereditary cataracts. There are additional health issues in the breed, the origins of which are unknown, including seizure disorders, found in young puppies as well as adults, epilepsy, congenital heart problems, kidney problems and skin disorders.

Other health issues in Malamutes include elbow dysplasia, inherited polyneuropathy, osteochondrodysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia, heart defects, and eye problems (particularly cataract and progressive retinal atrophy). A growing problem among arctic dog breeds, including the Alaskan Malamute, is canine diabetes, with onset occurring typically in middle age (5 to 7 years).

Another health issue with Malamutes is zinc deficiency. This breed cannot easily absorb zinc, and infections, skin, and coat problems can arise.

Thyroid disorders are the most common hormonal issue in dogs, and hypothyroidism is common in Malamutes.

== History ==
The Alaskan Malamute had a prominent role with their human companions as a utilitarian dog, working, hunting, and living alongside humans. The dogs were renowned for their excellent hunting abilities and were used to hunt large predators such as bears. They also aided their owners in finding seals by alerting them to seal blowholes. The interdependent relationship between the Malamute and their dogs fostered prosperity among both and enabled them to flourish in the inhospitable land above the Arctic Circle.

For a brief period during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, the Malamute and other sled dogs became extremely valuable to recently landed prospectors and settlers and were frequently crossbred with imported breeds.

The Malamute dog has had a distinguished history; aiding Rear Admiral Richard Byrd to the South Pole, and the miners who came to Alaska during the Gold Rush of 1896, as well as serving in World War II primarily as search and rescue dogs in Greenland, although also used as freighting and packing dogs in Europe. This dog was never destined to be a racing sled dog; it was used for heavy freighting, pulling hundreds, perhaps thousands of pounds of supplies to villages and camps in groups of at least four dogs for heavy loads.

The University of Washington&#x27;s Husky mascot is an Alaskan Malamute. In 2010, the Alaskan Malamute was named the official state dog of Alaska. Lathrop High School in Fairbanks, Alaska uses a Malamute as its official mascot.

<doc id="274144" wikidata="Q818391" url="?curid=274144" title="Home directory">
<text>A home directory is a file system directory on a multi-user operating system containing files for a given user of the system. The specifics of the home directory (such as its name and location) are defined by the operating system involved; for example, Linux / BSD (FHS) systems use codice_1 or codice_2 and Windows systems since Windows Vista use codice_3.

==Description==
A user&#x27;s home directory is intended to contain that user&#x27;s files; including text documents, music, pictures, videos, etc. It may also include their configuration files of preferred settings for any software they have used there and might have tailored to their liking: web browser bookmarks, favorite desktop wallpaper and themes, stored passwords to any external services accessed via a given software, etc. The user can install executable software in this directory, but it will only be available to users with permission to execute files in this directory. The home directory can be organized further with the use of sub-directories.

The content of a user&#x27;s home directory is protected by file-system permissions, and by default is accessible to all authenticated users and administrators. Any other user that has been granted administrator privileges has authority to access any protected location on the file system including other users&#x27; home directories.

==Benefits==
Separating user data from system-wide data avoids redundancy (the same system files can be used by between different users) and makes backups of files that are important for a specific user simpler.

Furthermore, Trojan horses, viruses, and worms running under the user&#x27;s name and with their privileges will in most cases only be able to alter the files in the user&#x27;s home directory, and perhaps some files belonging to workgroups the user is a part of, but not actual system files, reducing the chances of harming the functioning of the operating system.

==Location==

===Subdirectories===
The file on many Linux systems defines the subdirectories created for users by default. Creation is normally done with the first login by Xdg-user-dirs, a tool to help manage &quot;well known&quot; user directories like &quot;desktop&quot;, &quot;downloads&quot;, &quot;documents&quot;, &quot;pictures&quot;, &quot;videos&quot;, or &quot;music&quot;. The tool is also capable of localization (i.e. translation) of the folders&#x27; names.

==Other features==

===Unix===
In Unix, the working directory is automatically set to a user&#x27;s home directory when they log in. In many built-in commands, typing the (tilde) character is equivalent to specifying the current user&#x27;s home directory.

The Unix superuser has access to all directories on the file system, and hence can access home directories of all users. The superuser&#x27;s home directory on older systems was , but on many newer systems it is located at (Linux, BSD), or (Mac OS X).

===VMS===
In the OpenVMS operating system, a user&#x27;s home directory is called the &quot;root directory&quot;, and the equivalent of a Unix/DOS/Windows/AmigaOS &quot;root directory&quot; is referred to as the &quot;Master File Directory&quot;.

==Single-user operating systems==
Single-user operating systems simply have a single directory or partition for all user files, there is no individual directory setup per user (though users can still setup and maintain directories inside this main working directory manually).
* AmigaOS versions 2 and up have &quot;System&quot; and &quot;Work&quot; partitions on hard disks by default.
* BeOS (and its successors) have a /home directory which contains the files belonging to the single user of the system.
* Versions of Windows prior Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 did not have a user folder but, since that release, became in-effect the single user&#x27;s home directory.
* NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP in a single-user, non-networked setup, is used, as well as when logged in as superuser.

<doc id="274147" wikidata="Q2301964" url="?curid=274147" title="Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star">
<text>Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is the eighth studio album by American experimental rock band Sonic Youth, released on May 10, 1994, by DGC Records. It was produced by Butch Vig and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Sister&quot; was recorded. Unlike its predecessor &quot;Dirty&quot;, &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; features a more low-key approach and references the band&#x27;s earlier work on the independent record label SST Records. The album contains quieter and more relaxed songs that deal with personal and political topics.

Upon release, &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; reached No. 34 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart and No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart. It was the band&#x27;s highest peak on the US charts until their 2009 album &quot;The Eternal&quot; reached No. 18. The song &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot; was released as a single and as a music video featuring Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who highlighted the band&#x27;s ability to create both noise and melody. However, some felt that the album&#x27;s anti-commercial style was difficult to appreciate.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star&quot; is the follow-up to Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Dirty&quot;, which was released by DGC in the wake of Nirvana&#x27;s breakthrough into the mainstream. &quot;Dirty&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s most commercially successful albums, selling around 500,000 copies worldwide as of May 1994. The album also reached No. 83 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. After &quot;Dirty&quot;, Sonic Youth decided to step away from major-label alternative rock acts, which singer and guitarist Thurston Moore thought the media associated the band with. Touring with indie rock bands like Pavement, Sebadoh, and Royal Trux inspired Sonic Youth to write a quieter and more subtle album.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; was produced by the band and alternative rock veteran Butch Vig. According to the band, &quot;The idea this time was to cut as much of it live as we could, and not labor over polishing and overdubbing in the usual big-rock manner.&quot; Similarly, guitarist Lee Ranaldo explained that the band wanted to achieve a more lo-fi approach: &quot;None of [&quot;Experimental Jet set&quot;″s] music was labored, some of it was done in people&#x27;s bedrooms, even. [... We wanted] to write the songs and record them simply and basically.&quot; Additionally, the band ordered Vig to refrain from his desire to apply a buzz remover to several tracks. The album was engineered by John Siket and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Sister&quot; was recorded. The band claimed that the album was recorded over the master tapes of &quot;Sister&quot; to save costs, and it is possible to hear some parts of &quot;Sister&quot; during quiet sections of the final recording. The album was recorded on a two-inch 16-track analog tape recorder through antiquated equipment.

==Music and lyrics==
Unlike &quot;Dirty&quot;, which features a loud and &quot;dense blast of noise&quot;, &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; was considered warmer and more relaxed. Singer and bassist Kim Gordon described the sound of the album as &quot;art-core&quot; and Bradley Bambarger of &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that the album references the band&#x27;s earlier work on the independent record label SST Records, stating that it features &quot;a sparse, bracingly dichotomous work of &#x27;quiet noise&#x27; that, with its wayward tonalities and laconic grooves, speaks to the future while thinking of the past.&quot; In fact, the song &quot;Screaming Skull&quot; is about the band&#x27;s nostalgia for their days on SST Records, which is mentioned frequently throughout the song. It also references fellow bands Hüsker Dü and The Lemonheads. The song was inspired by a conversation Moore had with film director Dave Markey about the SST Superstore, a shop located on Sunset Strip which supplies SST records and skateboard-related products.

Most of the lyrics on &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; deal with political and personal topics. Gordon explained that the song &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot; is about &quot;using passiveness as a form of rebellion—like, I&#x27;m not going to participate in your male-dominated culture, so I&#x27;m just going to be passive.&quot; Similarly, the song &quot;Androgynous Mind&quot; addresses traditional gender roles, while &quot;Self-Obsessed and Sexxee&quot; is an observation on an anonymous riot grrrl. Moore explained that the latter is not about Courtney Love of Hole or Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill; it is about &quot;being attracted to somebody who&#x27;s obviously out of control with self-obsession in the high-profile alternative-rock world.&quot; The track &quot;Quest for the Cup&quot; deals with a person who desires more than it is needed. The opening track, &quot;Winner&#x27;s Blues&quot;, alludes to the pressure of fame and has been described as an acoustic and sad lullaby. The song was originally intended to be an outtake designated for the compilation &quot;DGC Rarities Vol. 1&quot;, but the band ultimately decided to include it in the album at the last minute during the mixing sessions. Another outtake, &quot;Compilation Blues&quot;, was instead included on the compilation.

&quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; was also the first Sonic Youth album to feature a hidden track on the CD release; just over a minute after the closing track &quot;Sweet Shine&quot; finishes, there is 1:30 of &quot;bonus noise&quot; featuring a looped speech of a Japanese gas attendant. Unlike on previous Sonic Youth albums, Ranaldo did not write or sing any songs because he did not like how his compositions were treated and assembled for &quot;Dirty&quot; and its predecessor &quot;Goo&quot;. David Browne, author of &quot;Goodbye 20th Century: A Biography of Sonic Youth&quot;, remarked that &quot;a sense of ambivalence and impermanence hung over [&quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot;], even down to the cover&quot;, which &quot;for the first time since &quot;Sonic Youth&quot; in 1982, featured their faces instead of a piece of art.&quot;

==Promotion and release==
To promote the album, the song &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot; was released as a single in April 1994. The single features an outtake, &quot;Razor Blade&quot;, which was recorded at the same sessions as &quot;Winner&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;Compilation Blues&quot;, and an alternate version of &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot; as B-sides. The song reached No. 13 on the US Modern Rock Tracks and No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart. The track &quot;Self-Obsessed and Sexxee&quot; was intended to be the second single from the album. A promo CD was issued, but plans for a regular release were eventually canceled. The remaining copies were sold off through the &quot;Sonic Death&quot; fan club magazine. The CD includes the same B-sides as &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot;. A music video featuring Kathleen Hanna was made for &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot; under the direction of Tamra Davis.

&quot;Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star&quot; was released on May 10, 1994, by DGC, which also released the band&#x27;s previous two albums. The album peaked at No. 34 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart and No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart. It was the band&#x27;s highest position on the US charts until their 2009 album &quot;The Eternal&quot; reached No. 18. The album also charted in several other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands and Sweden. The band did not support the album with a tour due to Gordon&#x27;s advanced pregnancy at the time. As of 2005, the album had sold 246,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Barbara O&#x27;Dair of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that the album was &quot;quietly confident; more ambitious and weirder than &quot;Dirty&quot;&quot;. However, she remarked that the band &quot;saved their integrity at the expense of quality; with a little more grease, their grit might get across better.&quot; Lorraine Ali, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, praised Gordon&#x27;s dynamic singing and the guitar playing for giving the album a sleepy and dreamy mood, concluding that Sonic Youth &quot;transcends the confining roles of pretentious art-rock band or palatable alternative group, and instead offers a penetrating album that&#x27;s all its own.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; also praised the album, saying that it offered both noise and melody that &quot;cohabitate exceedingly well&quot;.

In a mixed review, AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier criticized &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; for its stripped-down sound, saying that the album only contains &quot;odd lyrics and unique guitar nuance.&quot; Similarly, Evelyn McDonnell of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that the songs &quot;never quite emerge from the sketch stage&quot; and that newcomers may find it difficult to appreciate. In contrast, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; highlighted the album&#x27;s anti-commercial aesthetic, claiming that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t get much cooler than this&quot;. &quot;The Advocate&quot; criticized the album and the band for not taking risks, concluding: &quot;Sonic Youth is stuck repeating the same experience. And this time around, the songs don&#x27;t stick.&quot; Mike Rubin, writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, described &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; as a &quot;low-key, mellow affair&quot;, but highlighted the guitar playing and the audio feedback on some songs.

In a positive review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau highlighted the band&#x27;s ability to create unexpected noises, which he described as &quot;marks of flesh-and-blood creatures thinking and feeling things neither you nor they have ever thought or felt before. If they can&#x27;t quite put those things into words, that&#x27;s what unexpected noises are for.&quot; Unlike previous Sonic Youth albums, &quot;Experimental Jet Set&quot; was not ranked in the Top 40 of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1994, but Christgau placed it at No. 3 in his own &quot;Dean&#x27;s List&quot;. In a retrospective review for About.com, 90s rock expert Melissa Bobbitt wrote: &quot;Though it might not be as universally celebrated as 1988&#x27;s &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; or &quot;Dirty&quot;, this record represented the triumphant rise of the Alternative Nation and its progressive nature.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star&quot; at No. 44 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

<text>The Rich Man&#x27;s Eight Track Tape is an album by American punk rock band Big Black. It was released in 1987 by Touch and Go Records. The album is a CD compilation of Big Black&#x27;s &quot;Atomizer&quot; album (minus the song &quot;Strange Things&quot;), &quot;Heartbeat&quot; single and &quot;Headache&quot; EP. &quot;Atomizer&quot; is pictured on the cover artwork as an eight-track tape playing in a Panasonic TNT portable player.

The title of the album, and the liner notes by Steve Albini, show the band&#x27;s low regard for compact discs, drawing parallels between CD and the 8-track tape of 1970s, preferring to release all of their material on vinyl LP records.

==Reception==
 AllMusic called it &quot;An indispensable compilation&quot; and gave it a rating of 4.5/5

<doc id="274157" wikidata="Q735771" url="?curid=274157" title="Foo Fighters (album)">
<text>Foo Fighters is the debut studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on July 4, 1995, through Roswell and Capitol Records. Former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl wrote the entire album. He recorded it himself in six days with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington, in 1994. Grohl said that he recorded the album just for fun, describing it as a cathartic experience to recover from the suicide of Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain. The album is considered to have started the post-grunge genre.

After Grohl completed the recordings, he chose the name &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; for the project to hide his identity, and passed cassette copies of the sessions to personal friends. When the tapes attracted record label interest, Grohl signed with Capitol and recruited a full band to perform the songs live. The album was promoted through extensive tours and six singles, two of which were accompanied by music videos.

Upon its release, &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; earned positive reviews, praising its songwriting and performances, and was also a commercial success, becoming the band&#x27;s second-best-selling album in the United States. It also peaked within the top five of charts of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

==Background==
In 1990, Dave Grohl joined the grunge band Nirvana as drummer. During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs, but was too intimidated to share them with the band, as he was &quot;in awe&quot; of the songs written by frontman Kurt Cobain. Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos and covers, issuing an album of demos, &quot;Pocketwatch&quot;, under the pseudonym Late! in 1992.

Following Cobain&#x27;s suicide in April 1994, Grohl entered a state of depression, and found it difficult to both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, and despite being invited to drum for bands like Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Grohl almost decided to abandon his musical career: &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t imagine [playing in other bands]&quot;, he explained in a 2005 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, &quot;because it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time I sat down at a drum set, I would think of that.&quot;

Grohl&#x27;s first musical performance after the demise of Nirvana was with The Backbeat Band at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards in June. Soon thereafter, Mike Watt invited Grohl to play drums on his album &quot;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&quot; (1995). Grohl enjoyed these experiences and thus decided to work on his own musical project, which he believed could serve as a &quot;some sort of cathartic therapy.&quot; Grohl consequently booked six days at Seattle&#x27;s Robert Lang Studios, which were located near his house, where he recorded several of his favorite personal compositions with the assistance of &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; producer Barrett Jones. Although Grohl played all the instruments on the album, he intended to release it under a name that would make people believe it to be the work of a full band, similar to Stewart Copeland&#x27;s 1980 EP &quot;Klark Kent&quot;.

==Recording==
Grohl and Jones produced the record across a period of one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive in the morning at Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, &quot;still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [then] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song&quot;. The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on &quot;X-Static&quot; provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album&#x27;s track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was &quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot;. Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in &quot;Floaty&quot;, and tried to enhance the performance through double track – &quot;You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled.&quot;

In an attempt to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters, a name he took from a ufology book he was reading at the time, &quot;Above Top Secret&quot;, that in a chapter described the &quot;foo fighter&quot; phenomena. It would be a very low-key release, with only 100 LP records being pressed after the sessions were finished. Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started handing them to friends for feedback and &quot;I&#x27;d give tapes to everybody. Kids would come up to me and say &#x27;Nirvana was my favourite band&#x27; and I&#x27;d say &#x27;well here, have this&#x27;&quot;. Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995, during his &quot;Self-Pollution&quot; radio broadcast. The recordings quickly circulated amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana&#x27;s label Geffen Records.

The mixing sessions of the album began in Robert Lang Studios (which were used on the 100 tapes Grohl gave away) but eventually those mixes were discarded and the sessions moved to Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock&#x27;s &quot;The Shop&quot; studio in Arcata, California. Mixes were done on a 32 channel API DeMedio console, custom built by Frank DeMedio in 1972 for Wally Heider Recording&#x27;s &#x27;Studio 4&#x27;. A Stephen&#x27;s 24 track 2&quot; tape machine was used for playback. Processors used in the mixes included an Eventide Omnipressor compressor for vocals and guitar solos, an Alan Smart stereo compressor for &quot;squashing&quot; the drums and mixing them back in as well as being used over the entire mix. Other processors included UREI 1176 and LA3A compressors as well as an Echoplex for delays and a &quot;crappy digital reverb&quot;. Mixes were &quot;nothing that crazy&quot; Rob described, adding that he &quot;mixed &#x27;Big Me&#x27; in 20 minutes&quot;.

During the sessions, Grohl was invited by Tom Petty to perform with The Heartbreakers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; one month later. The performance was followed by an invitation to be a full-time member of the Heartbreakers, but once Petty heard about the Foo Fighters, he instead encouraged Grohl to move on with this solo project. Grohl soon recruited a full band, which included bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith of the recently disbanded Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist, and former Germs member, Pat Smear.

==Music and composition==

Nine of the songs in the album were composed before or during Grohl&#x27;s tenure with Nirvana, and existed in demos created by Grohl on his home 8-track tape recorder. The only compositions done after Cobain&#x27;s death were &quot;This Is a Call&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot;, &quot;X-Static&quot; and &quot;Wattershed&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound has been primarily described as punk rock, grunge, alternative rock, melodic hardcore, and post-grunge. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that the album was a &quot;handful of punk-pop gems that show, given the right musicians and songwriters, the genre had not entirely become a cliché by the middle of the &#x27;90s.&quot; The music mostly followed a hard rock sound with the soft-loud dynamics seen in Nirvana tracks such as &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. Variants include the melancholic &quot;Exhausted&quot;, which Grohl defined as a song that&#x27;s &quot;sad but makes you feel good&quot;.
Most of the lyrics on &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; are nonsensical lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As Grohl later explained, &quot;I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn&#x27;t too much time spent sitting in a chair thinking.&quot; Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that &quot;there was too much to say&quot; following Cobain&#x27;s death and &quot;a lot of emphasis [was] placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album.&quot; Grohl still considered that &quot;the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning&quot;, and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by &quot;personal experiences of the last four or five years&quot;, with the standout being &quot;Big Me&quot;, an &quot;out-and-out love song&quot; to Grohl&#x27;s then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as &quot;This Is a Call&quot;, defined as &quot;a &#x27;hello&#x27; and a &#x27;thank you&#x27;&quot; to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl&#x27;s life; the playful &quot;For All the Cows&quot;; and &quot;Wattershed&quot;, with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl&#x27;s &quot;love of hardcore and old school punk rock&quot;.

==Title and packaging==

The name &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; was taken from the description World War II aircraft pilots would use to describe various UFOs. This science fiction theme is further continued with the name of Grohl&#x27;s Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city of Roswell, New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of 1947; and the album cover done by Grohl&#x27;s then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol.&lt;ref name=&quot;/story714&quot;&gt;Apter, 2006. pp. 271-4&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers considered the gun on the cover as insensitive, given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence. Goldsmith later explained, &quot;It was all pretty much based on the whole Foo Fighters thing—Roswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. It&#x27;s really a completely separate thing. Dave wasn&#x27;t even conscious of that.&quot; Despite Grohl being the album&#x27;s only contributor, at Capitol&#x27;s insistence the liner notes included a picture of the full band that Grohl had recruited.

==Release and promotion==

In spring 1995, Foo Fighters embarked on their first ever United States tour, supporting Mike Watt on his Ring Spiel Tour along with fellow tour newbies Hovercraft, whose line-up included Vedder at the time. As well as performing with their own bands, Grohl and Vedder each picked up a role as a member of Watt&#x27;s backing band throughout the tour, supplying drums and guitar respectively. In May 1995, radio stations KROQ-FM and KNDD started playing some tracks of the then-unreleased album before receiving a cease-and-desist from Capitol. That June, &quot;Exhausted&quot; and &quot;This Is a Call&quot; were sent to college and modern rock radio stations. One week later, &quot;This Is a Call&quot; became the band&#x27;s first commercial single.

&quot;Foo Fighters&quot; was released July 4, 1995, on Roswell Records, distributed by Capitol Records. The band promoted the release that summer by completing another US tour with Wool and Shudder to Think, with 25 concerts in little over a month. Foo Fighters also made their network television debut on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on August 14, performing &quot;This Is a Call&quot;. Afterwards, the band played several of their largest shows up to that point, making their debut on the European festival circuit with performances at Pukkelpop, Reading and Lowlands.

&quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot; was issued as the second single on September 4, 1995, and would also mark Foo Fighters&#x27; music video debut, directed by Gerald Casale. That fall, the band continued to tour extensively, with a European tour with Built to Spill, and visits to Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The tour was wrapped with a performance at the Phoenix Festival on July 20, 1996. The Foo Fighters performed nearly 100 concerts throughout 1995, and over 70 dates the following year.

Three more songs of the album were issued as singles: &quot;For All the Cows&quot; in 1995, and both &quot;Big Me&quot; and &quot;Alone + Easy Target&quot; in 1996. &quot;Big Me&quot; was the band&#x27;s first commercial single to be made available in the US; it was also the second song on the album to receive a music video. Directed by Jesse Peretz, the music video parodies the distinctive commercials used to advertise Mentos candy.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Foo Fighters&quot; earned mostly positive reviews upon release. Many critics compared the album to Nirvana. Reviewer David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered that &quot;[Grohl&#x27;s] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, and his voice has Kurt Cobain&#x27;s lunging, over-the-top passion.&quot; Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, saying that &quot;the album&#x27;s first half [...] owes much to &quot;Nevermind&quot;, and it&#x27;s tempting to hear it in the way &quot;Nevermind&quot; taught us to hear.&quot; Paul Rees of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; admitted that &quot;&quot;Foo Fighters&quot; cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain&#x27;s memory, whether if through Grohl&#x27;s ragged howl of a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud&quot;, but ultimately considered the record &quot;more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented the &quot;inspired songwriting and passionate performances&quot;, adding the album could please grunge fans and &quot;also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and the Offspring to Better than Ezra.&quot;

The album received minor criticism for its lack of intensity, which many proposed was because Grohl played all the instruments himself. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;Since he recorded the album by himself, they aren&#x27;t as powerful as most band&#x27;s primal sonic workouts, but the results are damn impressive for a solo musician.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Alex Foege described the record as a &quot;remarkable yet coolly understated solo debut&quot; and felt that &quot;the album&#x27;s only disappointment is that despite its home-studio feel, it ultimately reveals little about its creator.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; described both the overall melodies and Grohl&#x27;s singing as derivative of the grunge sound, but praised the &quot;tight Beatlesesque harmonies&quot; and lyrics that &quot;key into the more poetic moments of dudespeak.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the band shows &quot;spirit&quot; but lacks an &quot;identity&quot; and cited the songs &quot;Big Me&quot; and &quot;This Is a Call&quot; as highlights. He later rated the album a three-star honorable mention in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; book, indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure&quot;.

The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1996 Grammy Awards ceremony, but lost to &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, an album by Grohl&#x27;s former band Nirvana. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; the best album of the year, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; put it second on their list, behind PJ Harvey&#x27;s &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;. It also ranked sixth on the &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop poll, and 20th on &quot;Spin&quot;″s list.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Foo Fighters&quot; was a commercial success. In the United States, it debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number twenty-three, with first-week sales of 40,000 units. The album debuted at number two in New Zealand&#x27;s album chart, three in the UK Albums Chart, where it was the highest new entry of the week, and fifth in Australia&#x27;s ARIA Charts. It also peaked at number five in the Canadian Albums Chart. By December, it had reached 900,000 units domestically and 2 million worldwide. On September 27, 1995, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), being later certified Platinum on January 26, 1996. By 2011, &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; had sold 1.468 million units in North America, being the second most successful release of the band behind follow-up &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;. It was also certified Platinum in Canada, and Platinum in the United Kingdom.

<text>Clarence Rivers King (January 6, 1842 – December 24, 1901) was an American geologist, mountaineer, and author. He was the first director of the United States Geological Survey from 1879 to 1881. Nominated by Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes, King was noted for his exploration of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

==Early life and education==
Clarence King was born on January 6, 1842, the son of James Rivers King and Florence Little King. Clarence&#x27;s father was part of a family firm engaged in trade with China, which kept him away from home a great deal, and he died in 1848, so Clarence was brought up primarily by his mother. By 1848, his two sisters, named Florence King and Grace King, had passed away early in their lives.

Clarence developed an early interest in outdoor exploration and natural history, which was encouraged by his mother and by Reverend Dr. Roswell Park, head of the Christ Church Hall school in Pomfret, Connecticut, that Clarence attended until he was ten. He then attended schools in Boston and New Haven and, at age thirteen, was accepted to the prestigious Hartford High School. He was a good student and a versatile athlete, of short stature but unusually strong.

His mother received an income from the King family business until it met with a series of problems and dissolved in 1857. After a few years of straitened circumstances, during part of which Clarence suffered from a serious depression, his mother married George S. Howland in July 1860 and had a daughter with him named Marian Howland. Howland financed Clarence&#x27;s enrollment in the Sheffield Scientific School affiliated with Yale College in 1860.

== College life ==

At Yale, King specialized in &quot;applied chemistry&quot; and also studied physics and geology. One inspiring teacher was James Dwight Dana, a highly regarded geologist who had participated in the United States Exploring Expedition, a scientific expedition to the South Atlantic, South Pacific and the west coasts of South and North America. At Yale, King enjoyed many sports, as he was a skilled athlete, but rowing was his main passion. He joined the rowing team at the university, and eventually became its captain. The &quot;Undine&quot; team competed on a four-man rowing boat, with King at the stroke oar. King later graduated with a Ph.B. in July 1862. That summer, he and several friends borrowed one of Yale&#x27;s rowboats for a trip along the shores of Lake Champlain and a series of Canadian rivers, then returned to New Haven for the fall regatta.

In October 1862, on a visit to the home of his former professor, George Jarvis Brush, King heard Brush read aloud a letter he had received from William Henry Brewer telling of an ascent of Mount Shasta in California, then believed to be the tallest mountain in the United States. King began to read more about geology, attended a lecture by Louis Agassiz, and soon wrote to Brush that he had &quot;pretty much made up my mind to be a geologist if I can get work in that direction&quot;. He was also fascinated by descriptions of the Alps by John Tyndall and John Ruskin.

In late 1862 or early 1863, King moved to New York City to share an apartment with James Terry Gardiner, a close friend from high school and college (who spelled his last name Gardner at the time). They associated with a group of American artists, writers and architects who were admirers of Ruskin. In February 1863, King became one of the founders, along with John William Hill, Clarence Cook and others, of the Ruskinian Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, an American group similar to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was elected its first secretary. But he was anxious to see the mountains of the American West, and his friend Gardiner was miserable in law school.

== Heading west ==
As Gardiner and King started to quickly plan for the journey, their final destination being San Francisco, another friend named William Hyde became interested and decided to join them. So, they all met in April 1863 at Niagara, New York, and boarded a train. On the train King met the Speers family and being the friendly person, he was known to be, he decided to entertain the Speers children while they traveled to St. Joseph, Missouri. The Speers, grateful for King&#x27;s help with entertaining their children, invited King, Gardiner, and Hyde to join their wagon party. The three men would be provided food as long as they helped care for the livestock that the Speers were bringing.

On May 1, 1863, with St. Joseph as their starting point the three men officially started to travel west. Five days later just past Troy, Kansas the party succeeded in hunting two buffalo, which was a welcomed treat. Near Fort Kearny, 200 miles into their journey, King tried hunting buffalo, but he did not succeed and ended up with a wounded leg and a dead horse. On May 29, the traveling party passed the very large 325-foot landmark called Chimney Rock in northwest Nebraska and a few days after that they arrived at Fort Laramie in what is now Wyoming. On June 29 the party crested the ridge of the Wasatch Mountains in Utah to see the Great Salt Lake below them, a place of refuge before they began to travel across the desert to the west of the lake. More than a month later, on August 6, the wagon train arrived at Carson City, Nevada which is when King, Gardiner, and Hyde decided to leave the wagon party to head towards Gold Hill a town nearby because Hyde&#x27;s dad owned a ranch and foundry there.

That night the foundry caught on fire burning everything the three guys owned, including King&#x27;s letter to William Henry Brewer at the California Geologic Survey. As they helped rebuild the foundry King and Gardiner were able to save up enough supplies to continue on while Hyde decided to stay with his father. Planning to walk the rest of the way by foot, Gardiner and King left Gold Hill near the end of August 1863. On September 1, the two friends boarded a steamboat heading towards San Francisco. While on the steamboat King met Brewer and explained to him what happened to the letter which then led to them spending the evening trading stories with Brewer. King during this time expressed his willingness to work for the survey without pay because he liked Brewer and knew it would be a good experience. Little did King know at the time but joining the California Geological Survey was a good choice because it ended up being the first step in King&#x27;s career.

== Early career ==
Once Gardner and King arrived at the California Geological Society&#x27;s office, they met the director of the survey Josiah Whitney. In 1863, with the permission of Whitney, King was asked by Brewer to accompany him on his exploration of the northern part of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. While King is on this expedition, Gardner would stay in San Francisco. On this trip with Brewer and King was a mule packer named John Hoesch. As the group traveled, they passed through the Sierra gold fields, and at a creek named Genesee, Brewer found fossils of the Jurassic or Triassic age. This find would help them pinpoint the age of the Mother Lode gold belt, which was one of their goals on this journey. Near Lassen Peak in northern California, Brewer and King investigated hot springs and other thermal features. At nights around the campfire, geologic concerns such as the young Cascade volcanoes, the age of gold veins, and the action of glaciers was discussed. During one of these conversations, Brewer brought up Whitney&#x27;s plan to propose a geologic study across the continent, and King thought that there may be a chance of funding this because as Whitney noted railroad companies would really benefit from it.

As soon as he got back from this first expedition of his, King immediately began preparing to do another one. This time he was traveling with a mining engineer named William Ashburner, and a topographer named Charles Hoffmann. The trio&#x27;s job was to survey the Mariposa Estate, a place that was one of the most important gold-vein regions in the area. During this job, King had a habit of staring at views as opposed to working like he was supposed to which irritated his fellow team members. Eventually, after his coworkers brought their concerns to him, he refocused on his assigned work for the rest of the job. King&#x27;s next big job would be a scientific exploration into the southern Sierra mountains.

Leaving in May 1864, the party consisted of Brewer, Hoffmann, Gardner, King and a man named Dick Cotter. During the early stages of this journey, in Visalia, King was able to acquire a new horse, a decision that would later save his life. Leaving Visalia, the team ended up at what is the present site of Sequoia Lake, where they stayed for a week studying the Sequoia trees. The party used triangulation as their main method of mapping the areas they traveled through. At one point they reached a spot where the animals could not continue so they made base at an unknown mountain lake. The next day Hoffmann and Brewer climbed the unknown peak nearby (now known as Mount Brewer) and soon they sadly discovered that they were not on the main Sierra Nevada Crest like they thought they were. Brewer and Hoffmann also named Mount Tyndall, Mount Goddard, and Mount Whitney while they were up there. King upon hearing what Hoffmann and Brewer saw begged to be allowed to backpack up Mount Whitney with Cotter. In King&#x27;s own words, &quot;It was a trying moment for Brewer when we found him and volunteered to attempt a campaign for the top of California, because he felt a certain fatherly responsibility over our youth.&quot; Brewer eventually gave his permission even though King had no real plan. The duo, however, started to run out of provisions before they even made it to Mount Whitney so, they had to turn back. After reuniting back at camp, they discover that Brewer is suffering from an awful toothache, so King took him to Visalia to get it pulled. During this King got permission to attempt to climb Mount Whitney again but he had to rendezvous with the main group in two weeks at Clark&#x27;s Station. King did not end up making it to the top on this expedition, which greatly disappointed him. On his way to the meeting point, King ran into some trouble with bandits but his new horse was able to outrun them saving his life. He made it to the rendezvous point on time, but the rest of the group ran into trouble and was three weeks late. Both Gardner and King were unpaid volunteers for this expedition, but they had helped create the first topographic, botanical, and geologic survey of a vast area.

In September 1864, upon the designation by President Abraham Lincoln of the Yosemite Valley area as a permanent public reserve, King and Gardiner were appointed to make a boundary survey around the rim of Yosemite Valley. They returned to the East Coast by way of Nicaragua the following winter. King suffered from several bouts of malaria in the spring and summer of 1865 while Whitney, also in the East, worked on securing funding for further survey projects. King, Gardiner, Whitney, and Whitney&#x27;s wife sailed back to San Francisco in the fall, where Whitney lined up a survey project for King and Gardiner in the Mojave Desert and Arizona under U.S. Army auspices. 

They returned to San Francisco in the spring. King returned to Yosemite in the summer of 1866 to make more field notes for Whitney. When King heard of the death of his stepfather, he and Gardiner resigned from the Whitney survey and once again sailed to New York. They had been developing a plan for an independent survey of the Great Basin region for some time and, in late 1866, King went to Washington to secure funding from Congress for such a survey. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1871.

== Fortieth Parallel Survey and diamond hoax discovery ==

King made a persuasive argument for how his research would help develop the West. He received federal funding and was named U.S. Geologist of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, commonly known as the Fortieth Parallel Survey, in 1867. He persuaded Gardiner to be his second in command and they assembled a team that included, among others, Samuel Franklin Emmons, Arnold Hague, A. D. Wilson, the photographer Timothy H. O&#x27;Sullivan and guest artist Gilbert Munger.

Over the next six years, King and his team explored areas from eastern California to Wyoming. During that time he also published his famous &quot;Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada&quot; (1872). 
While King was finishing the Fortieth Parallel Survey, the western U.S. was abuzz with news of a secret diamond deposit. King and some of his crew tracked down the secret location in northwest Colorado and exposed it as a fraud, now known as the diamond hoax of 1872. He became an international celebrity through exposing the hoax.

In 1878, King published &quot;Systematic Geology&quot;, numbered Volume 1 of the Report of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, although it appeared later than all but one of the other seven volumes. In this work he narrated the geological history of the West as a mixture of uniformitarianism and catastrophism. This book was well received at the time and has been called &quot;one of the great scientific works of the late nineteenth century&quot;.

In 1879, the US Congress consolidated the number of geological surveys exploring the American West and created the United States Geological Survey. King was chosen as its first director. He took the position with the understanding that it would be temporary and he resigned after twenty months, having overseen the organization of the new agency with an emphasis on mining geology. James Garfield named John Wesley Powell as his successor.

During the remaining years of his life, King withdrew from the scientific community and attempted to profit from his knowledge of mining geology, but the mining ventures he was involved in were not successful enough to support his expensive tastes in art collecting, travel and elegant living, and he went heavily into debt. He had a busy social life, with close friendships including Henry Brooks Adams and John Hay, who admired him tremendously. But he suffered from physical ailments and depression.

==Beliefs and views==
King grew up in the North and his grandmother, Sophia Little, influenced his views on slavery. She would not eat fruits and other Southern grown products because they were grown with slave labor. Because of this, King was against slavery and African American injustice. While at Yale, he was known as an enthusiastic abolitionist and had lots of rage against the Confederates. He aligned with the militant anti-slavery advocate Wendell Phillips. King even considered joining the war efforts to fight for his beliefs. But by the time King was graduating, he decided to go back to his pacifist ways, and renounced his anger against the South. He decided that he would help the nation by exploring and mapping the West for his fellow Americans to later live.

King was known to be an avid thinker and daydreamer. Because of this, he had many views on art and science. He couldn&#x27;t ever decide if he was an artist or scientist, because he thought geology had both art and science involved with it. King seemed to embrace that the two were intertwined and learned about the art of science and the science of art. In his scientific reflections, he would vividly explain natural things that he encountered in his adventures in an artistic manner, blending the two subjects together. King wanted people to admire the beauty of his findings of the land in the West. He didn&#x27;t like when the mountains and plains were described as dull or bland. King respected nature very much and thought it to be the key to science and art.

==Common law marriage and passing as African-American==
King spent his last thirteen years leading a double life. In 1887 or 1888, he met and fell in love with Ada Copeland, an African-American nursemaid and former slave from Georgia, who had moved to New York City in the mid-1880s. As interracial marriage was strongly discouraged in the nineteenth century, and illegal in many places, King hid his identity from Copeland. Despite his blue eyes and fair complexion, King convinced Copeland that he was an African-American Pullman porter named James Todd.

The two entered into a common law marriage in 1888. Throughout the marriage, King never revealed his true identity to Ada, pretending to be Todd, a black railroad worker, when at home, and continuing to work as King, a white geologist, when in the field. Their union produced five children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Their two daughters married white men. Their two sons served, classified as black during World War I. King finally revealed his true identity to Copeland in a letter he wrote to her while on his deathbed in Arizona.

==Death and legacy==
King died on December 24, 1901, of tuberculosis in Phoenix, Arizona. Kings Peak in Utah, Mount Clarence King and Clarence King Lake at Shastina, California, are named in his honor, as is King Peak in Antarctica.
The US Geological Survey Headquarters Library in Reston, Virginia, is also known as the Clarence King Library.

<doc id="274161" wikidata="Q968646" url="?curid=274161" title="The Colour and the Shape">
<text>The Colour and the Shape is the second studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on May 20, 1997, by Roswell and Capitol Records. It was the first album by the Foo Fighters to be recorded as a full band, as the previous self-titled album (1995) was both written and recorded entirely by frontman Dave Grohl. &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; is widely considered a defining album of the post-grunge genre, with its three singles becoming staples of rock-oriented radio in the United States. It was among the highest-selling rock albums of 1997 and 1998, and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.

After the debut became an international success, Grohl recruited guitarist Pat Smear, bassist Nate Mendel, and drummer William Goldsmith to form the band&#x27;s full lineup. The group convened in the fall of 1996 for pre-production on a second album, and brought in Gil Norton as producer to establish a pop sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, contrary to music press predictions that it would be another grunge offshoot.

Primarily inspired by Grohl&#x27;s divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; is more lyrically introspective and musically developed than the Foo Fighters&#x27; debut. The album&#x27;s track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between uptempo tracks and ballads to reflect conflicting emotions. Early sessions at the Bear Creek Studio in Washington went poorly and the band discarded most of those recordings. The band regrouped without Goldsmith in early 1997 to record at Hollywood&#x27;s Grandmaster Recordings studio, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled that most of his material had been re-recorded, and he left the band shortly thereafter.

The singles &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;Everlong&quot;, and &quot;My Hero&quot; peaked within the top ten of US rock radio charts, and the album charted at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was also a commercial success on an international level, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom. Critics deemed the album a significant American rock release of its era, and it continues to be viewed as a seminal modern rock album in retrospective assessments. &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; remains the Foo Fighters&#x27; biggest seller in the U.S., having sold more than two million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was remastered and reissued in 2007 with several bonus tracks for its tenth anniversary.

&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; was Foo Fighters&#x27; last album to be released and marketed by Capitol Records. After the band, along with their label Roswell Records, signed to RCA Records, its distribution, along with their debut album, has switched to RCA.

==Background==
The album was the debut of Foo Fighters as a full band. On the first album under the Foo Fighters name, frontman Dave Grohl had performed and recorded all of the parts by himself, with the exception of one guitar part played by Greg Dulli. The band&#x27;s original lineup assembled for their exhaustive touring schedule throughout 1995 and 1996, during which the band became an international sensation on the strength of singles &quot;This Is a Call&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot;, and &quot;Big Me&quot;. Although the music press generally speculated the band&#x27;s sophomore record would showcase grunge-inspired garage rock, the band&#x27;s intention was to make a more straightforward rock record. The deal the band struck with Capitol Records afforded them a large degree of creative control over the band&#x27;s true &quot;debut.&quot; The songs on the record were composed during soundchecks during their extensive touring over the previous eighteen months. Mendel said &quot;the germ of every song is Dave&#x27;s,&quot; with the frontman providing a riff and a basic song structure. The band would then jam and each member would contribute to some aspect of the song.

Grohl recruited producer Gil Norton to provide additional pop polish to the material. He especially wanted to hear guitar overdubs and harmonies with significant clarity. Grohl said he admired Norton for his earlier work with the Pixies and his ability to &quot;distill a coherent pop song out of all [the Pixies&#x27;] multi-layered weirdness.&quot; Norton was highly demanding of the band&#x27;s performance, prompting bassist Nate Mendel to practice and improve his musical skill. Grohl said &quot;it was frustrating and it was hard and it was long, but at the end of the day you listened back to what you&#x27;d done and you understood why you had to do it one million times.&quot;

==Recording and production==

&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; was recorded over the period of two months, primarily at Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood from January to February 1997. The band spent two weeks in pre-production the previous autumn, rehearsing the tracks and changing arrangements. Norton had his greatest impact during pre-production, during which he spent days with Grohl in his hotel room &quot;stripping the songs back to their absolute basics.&quot; His role in production taught the band the importance of self-editing and gave them confidence to see &quot;the larger picture in a song.&quot; Afterward, the band set off for Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, where the first recording sessions for &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; began on November 18, 1996. Mendel described Bear Creek as &quot;a converted barn with a salmon stream running through it&quot;. The studio was located on a farm and, for the duration of these sessions, the band lived in a cabin adjacent to the studio.

Grohl, who described the sessions at Bear Creek as a &quot;bad experience,&quot; decided to scrap nearly all of the recorded tracks. The band took a break for the holidays, during which Grohl returned to Virginia and wrote several new songs. He recorded two of these songs by himself at WGNS Studios in Washington, D.C.: &quot;Walking After You&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Everlong&quot;.

In February 1997, the band—minus drummer William Goldsmith—relocated to Hollywood&#x27;s Grandmaster Recorders, which Mendel said was &quot;a small studio that sometimes moonlighted as a porn set, and looked the part.&quot; For a period of four weeks, the band re-recorded most of the album with Grohl playing the drum tracks. Grohl&#x27;s drumming started with only &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, as Grohl and Norton felt the drums on that song needed more work, but by the end of the sessions recordings of Goldsmith&#x27;s drumming remained on only two tracks, &quot;Doll&quot; and &quot;Up in Arms&quot;. According to Grohl, Goldsmith&#x27;s drumming had good moments, but his performances mostly did not fit what Grohl had conceived for the drum track, so the frontman decided to redo them himself. Goldsmith even asked if he should go to Los Angeles, but Grohl declined and said he was only performing overdubs. Eventually, Mendel told Goldsmith the situation. Grohl said that he still wanted Goldsmith as a member of the band, despite replacing his tracks, but the disgruntled drummer decided to leave the Foo Fighters instead. Speaking in 2011 about the tension that surrounded Goldsmith&#x27;s departure, Grohl said, &quot;There were a lot of reasons it didn&#x27;t work out […] but there was also a part of me that was like, you know, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m finished playing the drums yet. […] I wish that I would have handled things differently.&quot;

After the move to Los Angeles, the album&#x27;s budget ballooned and deadlines became a more pressing concern. Studio time was expensive and the group was pressured by Capitol to deliver the record in a timely fashion. However, the pressure never adversely affected the band members, whose main priorities were to make &quot;music for its own sake […] and let the commercial concerns take care of themselves.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title came from the band&#x27;s tour manager of the time, who would often spend afternoons rummaging thrift stores and purchasing strange memorabilia; on one occasion, he purchased a bowling pin with red and white stripes, remarking to the band he rather liked &quot;the colour and the shape&quot; of the object. The group found the phrase arbitrary and hilarious and decided to use it as the title rather than trying to choose a title based on the music&#x27;s themes or moods. They chose the British spelling of &quot;colour&quot; with a &quot;u&quot; as a tribute to Norton, who is British. A title track was written and recorded for &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; during the Bear Creek sessions, but like most of the other songs attempted there, it did not reach the album&#x27;s final track list. Noted as &quot;rawer, noisier and thrashier&quot; than the rest of the songs on the album by &quot;Louder Sound&quot;″s Paul Brannigan, it later became a b-side to the album&#x27;s eventual lead single, &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;. After settling on a track sequence, Grohl was struck by the impression that the album&#x27;s flow from start to finish resembled a therapy session, moving from fear and anxiety at the start to self-assurance and resolve by the end. He even considered placing a therapist&#x27;s couch on the album cover.

==Composition==
Professional reviewers have characterized the musical genre of &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; as alternative rock, grunge, post-grunge, punk rock, and hard rock. Writing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Victoria Segal said the album was more cohesive than the debut and was unified by a theme of &quot;battered romanticism&quot;. More specifically, many of the lyrics address the dissolution of Grohl&#x27;s marriage to Jennifer Youngblood during the winter of 1996, which Grohl said had been &quot;the winter of my discontent.&quot; The album&#x27;s track sequence reflects this sentiment, chronicling his change from chaos to newfound happiness. Grohl admitted the lyrics of the previous album had been &quot;obscure&quot; and &quot;nonsense,&quot; but Norton challenged Grohl to write lyrics that were more meaningful and comprehensible. Grohl delved deeper into his feelings with the lyrics and said &quot;there was a new freedom: &#x27;Wow, I can actually write about things I feel strongly about and things that mean something to me and things I wouldn&#x27;t normally say in everyday conversation.&#x27;&quot; The frontman stated that the experience was &quot;kind of liberating,&quot; comparing the album to going to a weekly visit to the therapist &quot;and then the rest of the week feel pretty good about everything.&quot; Grohl also found new strength in his singing, overcoming insecurities he had about his singing voice on the debut. Three types of songs permeate the record: ballads, up-tempo tracks and combinations of the two. Grohl felt they were representative of the specific emotions he would feel after the divorce.

===Track information===
The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Doll&quot;, involves the fear of entering into situations unprepared. Regarding &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, Grohl stated that it was &quot;a song about realizing that you are the source of all of the problems in a relationship and you love the other person so much, you want to free them of the problem, which is actually yourself. It was a riff that turned into another riff that turned into another riff and ended up being a nice little power punk song.&quot; In another interview, Grohl stated his pride in the song: &quot;With Monkey Wrench I remember I had the main riff, but I didn&#x27;t have the little jangly riff that goes over the top of it and I thought it needed something. So I came up with the jangly riff and thought &#x27;Oh my God this is never gonna fly! Everyone&#x27;s gonna hate it&#x27;. But I was really excited the first time I heard it on the radio—it was in the middle of a load of mid-&#x27;90s grunge shit and I thought it was so killer.&quot; The song was released as the first single from the album in 1997.

The lyrics to &quot;Hey, Johnny Park!&quot; song follow a series of different themes (&quot;about 15 different things&quot;, according to Grohl). Johnny Park is the name of one of Grohl&#x27;s childhood friends; he noted, &quot;we were like brothers from the age of 5 to 12&quot; and that he named the song after Park in hopes that he might restore contact with him. &quot;My Poor Brain&quot; experiments with different dynamics, both musically and lyrically in nature. Grohl likened the disparity in sounds to changes from Jackson Five to Black Sabbath. Grohl described the concept of &quot;Wind Up&quot; as about successful musicians who constantly complain about their lives to the press. He elaborated, &quot;It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don&#x27;t understand how fortunate they are that they don&#x27;t have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band... there are two sides: there&#x27;s the reluctant rock-star, and then there is the prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it&#x27;s just talking &quot;about the hand you&#x27;ve been dealt.&quot; Every time I hear about &quot;the hand you&#x27;ve been dealt,&quot; it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions... I&#x27;ve had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life—you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses—and it&#x27;s a lot more fun to play music.&quot;

Grohl described &quot;Up in Arms&quot; as &quot;A typical love song. It&#x27;s almost like a Knack song, just a simple pop song.&quot; Also in the song, Dave changed the last line which is meant to sing &quot;always coming back I cannot forget you girl&quot; to &quot;always coming back I cannot forget you &quot;Gil&quot;&quot; in reference to their producer Gil Norton. &quot;My Hero&quot; criticizes idolatry and instead extolls friends who are ordinary heroes, which has been considered a statement on fame and partially inspired by former bandmate Kurt Cobain. In Grohl&#x27;s own words, the song is, &quot;(his) way of saying that when I was young, I didn&#x27;t have big rock heroes, I didn&#x27;t want to grow up and be some big sporting hero. My heroes were ordinary people and the people that I have a lot of respect for are just solid everyday people—people you can rely on.&quot; This was the third single to be released from the album. &quot;See You&quot; was a song that, according to Grohl, only he liked out of the rest of the band. When Grohl entered the studio, he changed Goldsmith&#x27;s original drum part to resemble Queen&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; so the rest of the group would be satisfied with putting it on the record.

&quot;Enough Space&quot; is about Emir Kusturica&#x27;s &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993), one of Grohl&#x27;s favorite films. He also said the song emerged from his desire to create a song that would be a good opener on their set lists, with a tempo that mimicked the jumping and bouncing of European crowds in the beginning of sets. The lyrics of &quot;February Stars&quot; are said to be about &quot;hanging on by the tips of your fingers and hoping you don&#x27;t slip and fall.&quot; This song dates back to at least January 1994, when an early take of the song with alternate lyrics, titled &quot;Dave/Acoustic + Voc&quot; was recorded by Grohl and Krist Novoselic on Harmonium during Nirvana&#x27;s last recording session. &quot;Everlong&quot; was written when the band took a break from recording after the initial sessions. Grohl reworked &quot;Everlong&quot; by himself at his home in Virginia. It is considered to be one of the best songs by the band and is highly acclaimed. In 2000, David Letterman revealed that it is his favorite song.

&quot;Walking After You&quot; was written and recorded by Grohl on his own in a studio in Washington. This version appears on the album. The band would later re-record the song with all the members for &quot;The X-Files&quot; soundtrack, and this version was released as a single. Grohl stated that &quot;Walking After You&quot; was &quot;an emotional, sappy song about getting dumped.&quot; On the record&#x27;s closing track, &quot;New Way Home,&quot; Grohl longs for his hometown and recalls the drive there on Highway 99. Through this journey, &quot;I realise that it’s OK, I can make my way through all of this, and I’m not that freaked out at the end.&quot;

==Release==

&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; was released on May 20, 1997, preceded the month before by lead single &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;. The promotional campaign emphasized the band&#x27;s group identity as well as each band member&#x27;s individual personality. This strategy contrasted with the marketing approach for the prior album, which had centered Grohl at a time before Mendel and Smear felt comfortable being marketed as personalities. Each member gave interviews with press discussing their interests, with guitarist Pat Smear talking to guitar and fashion magazines. Just as recording was finished and Taylor Hawkins was hired as the new drummer (he was the former touring drummer for Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; in 1995), Smear expressed his own plans to leave the band, claiming he was exhausted and not motivated to go through with another extended tour. This information was not yet highly publicized, and spokespeople for the band denied that the rumors of Smear&#x27;s impending departure were true. The promotional tour started in May 1997. Smear departed during a September 4 concert at Radio City Music Hall, right before that year&#x27;s 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, giving his instrument for the new guitarist, Franz Stahl, to finish the set.

&quot;Everlong&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in August 1997. It was the most commercially successful single from the record, being certified double platinum in the United States and being one of only three Foo Fighters songs to reach that status. Smear remained with the group until September 4, the night of the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. After playing &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; during the &quot;pregame show&quot; to the event, Smear announced that it was the final song he would play with the band, introducing Franz Stahl as the band&#x27;s new guitarist before the band began playing &quot;Everlong&quot; later that evening. &quot;My Hero&quot; was released as the third and final single from the album in 1998. All three singles peaked inside the top ten of the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock charts.

To commemorate &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;″s tenth anniversary, it was reissued on July 10, 2007, with six additional tracks: the B-sides &quot;Dear Lover&quot; and &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;, plus covers of Killing Joke&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Down in the Park&quot;, Gerry Rafferty&#x27;s &quot;Baker Street&quot; and Vanity 6&#x27;s &quot;Drive Me Wild&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Critical response to the record was generally positive. Victoria Segal at the UK-based &quot;Melody Maker&quot; viewed &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; as a significant American rock release, writing that it was &quot;a great rock album at a time when great rock albums are viewed with increasing suspicion.&quot; Segal&#x27;s review described the album as leagues ahead of other post-grunge acts: &quot;The first album might have been a collection of loveable songs, but lacked the sheer visceral attack that thrills this time round,&quot; Segal wrote, calling it &quot;[a]n attack that would have[…] almost any other US rock band biting their nails in anguish and embarrassment.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Adam Sweeting found that the &quot;glorious&quot; album saw the band tempering their grunge sound with a more developed flair for pop songwriting.

Christina Kelly of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was largely positive, although she singled out Norton&#x27;s production as distracting: &quot;&quot;Colour&quot; has a big, radio-ready, modern-rock sound. Some might even call the album overproduced: On the ballads, the vocals are overprocessed and fake sounding.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the band&#x27;s growth, but criticized the sound, which journalist David Browne described as &quot;like much current alt-rock: been there, grunged that.&quot; In contrast, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described that production as revolutionary: &quot;everything here wound up defining the sound of post-grunge modern rock, and it remains as perhaps the best example of its kind.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said the music was routine but elevated by Grohl&#x27;s &quot;marital breakup content/concept,&quot; which allowed him to &quot;fully inhabit the music that meant so much to him and millions of other Kurt Cobain fans.&quot; Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was less favorable, rating the album 3.4 out of 10 and calling the music &quot;sorely dated.&quot;

Reviewing the tenth anniversary re-release, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was mildly more favorable. Scoring the release a 5.8 out of 10, Stuart Berman stated, &quot;&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; presented a true picture of the kind of group Grohl wanted to be in, had he not been sidetracked by the job of drumming for the biggest American rock band of the early 1990s [...] that band would turn out to be much more formulaically mall-punk than the Foos&#x27; torn &#x27;n&#x27; frayed debut suggested.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Mike Schiller reviewed the re-release with the opposite opinion, citing the self titled record&#x27;s single &quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot; as an example of &quot;Grohl&#x27;s strikingly non-aggressive (read: bland) vocal style&quot; from the 1995 album; he then described &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; as proof that Grohl &quot;knew how to rock out&quot; by comparison.

In 2020, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it in their list of the top 10 albums of 1997.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, up from a peak of 23 for the 1995 self-titled debut. It also managed to reach the top ten in Australia, Canada, Greece, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The album has also been certified Platinum in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="274165" wikidata="Q2164998" url="?curid=274165" title="Dead space (physiology)">
<text>Dead space is the volume of air that is inhaled that does not take part in the gas exchange, because it either remains in the conducting airways or reaches alveoli that are not perfused or poorly perfused. It means that not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Mammals breathe in and out of their lungs, wasting that part of the inhalation which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur.

==Components==

&quot;Total dead space&quot; (also known as physiological dead space) is the sum of the anatomical dead space and the alveolar dead space.

Benefits do accrue to a seemingly wasteful design for ventilation that includes dead space.
#Carbon dioxide is retained, making a bicarbonate-buffered blood and interstitium possible.
#Inspired air is brought to body temperature, increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, improving O2 uptake.
#Particulate matter is trapped on the mucus that lines the conducting airways, allowing its removal by mucociliary transport.
#Inspired air is humidified, improving the quality of airway mucus.

In humans, about a third of every resting breath has no change in O2 and CO2 levels. In adults, it is usually in the range of 150 mL.

Dead space can be increased (and better envisioned) by breathing through a long tube, such as a snorkel. Although one end of the snorkel is open to the air, when the wearer breathes in, they inhale a significant quantity of air that remained in the snorkel from the previous exhalation. Therefore, a snorkel increases the person&#x27;s dead space by adding even more airway that does not participate in gas exchange.

===Anatomical dead space===
Anatomical dead space is the volume of the conducting airways (from the nose, mouth and trachea to the terminal bronchioles). These conduct gas to the alveoli but no gas exchange occurs here. In healthy lungs where the alveolar dead space is small, Fowler&#x27;s method accurately measures the anatomic dead space using a single breath nitrogen washout technique.

The normal value for dead space volume (in mL) is approximately the lean mass of the body (in pounds), and averages about a third of the resting tidal volume (450-500 mL). In Fowler&#x27;s original study, the anatomic dead space was 156 ± 28 mL (n=45 males) or 26% of their tidal volume. Despite the flexibility of the trachea and smaller conducting airways, their overall volume (i.e. the anatomic dead space) changes little with bronchoconstriction or when breathing hard during exercise.

As birds have a longer and wider trachea than mammals the same size, they have a disproportionately large anatomic dead space, reducing the airway resistance. This adaptation does not impact gas exchange because birds flow air through their lungs - they do not breathe in and out like mammals.

===Alveolar dead space===
Alveolar dead space is defined as the difference between the physiologic dead space and the anatomic dead space. It is contributed to by all the terminal respiratory units that are over-ventilated relative to their perfusion. Therefore it includes, firstly those units that are ventilated but not perfused, and secondly those units which have a ventilation-perfusion ratio greater than one. 

Alveolar dead space is negligible in healthy individuals, but it can increase dramatically in some lung diseases due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

==Calculating==

Just as dead space wastes a fraction of the inhaled breath, dead space dilutes alveolar air during exhalation. By quantifying this dilution, it is possible to measure physiological dead space, employing the concept of mass balance, as expressed by the Bohr equation.
::formula_1
:where formula_2 is the dead space volume and formula_3 is the tidal volume;
::formula_4 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, and 
::formula_5 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the mixed expired (exhaled) air.

===Physiological dead space===

The Bohr equation is used to measure physiological dead space. Unfortunately, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in alveoli is required to use the equation but this is not a single value as the ventilation-perfusion ratio is different in different lung units both in health and in disease. In practice, the arterial partial pressure of CO2 is used as an estimate of the average alveolar partial pressure of CO2, a modification introduced by Henrik Enghoff in 1938 (Enghoff H. Volumen inefficax. Bemerkungen zur Frage des schadlichen Raumes. Upsala Läkarefören Forhandl., 44:191-218, 1938). In effect, the single arterial pCO2 value averages out the different pCO2 values in the different alveoli, and so makes the Bohr equation useable. 

The quantity of CO2 exhaled from the healthy alveoli is diluted by the air in the conducting airways (anatomic dead space) and by gas from alveoli that are over-ventilated in relation to their perfusion. This dilution factor can be calculated once the mixed expired pCO2 in the exhaled breath is determined (either by electronically monitoring the exhaled breath or by collecting the exhaled breath in a gas impermeant bag (a Douglas bag) and then measuring the pCO2 of the mixed expired gas in the collection bag). Algebraically, this dilution factor will give us the physiological dead space as calculated by the Bohr equation:

:formula_6

===Alveolar dead space===

The alveolar dead space is determined as the difference between the physiological dead space (measured using the Enghoff modification of the Bohr equation) and the anatomic dead space (measured using Fowler&#x27;s single breath technique). 

A clinical index of the size of the alveolar dead space is the difference between the arterial partial pressure of CO2 and the end-tidal partial pressure of CO2.

===Anatomic dead space===

A different maneuver is employed in measuring anatomic dead space: the test subject breathes all the way out, inhales deeply from a 0% nitrogen gas mixture (usually 100% oxygen) and then breathes out into equipment that measures nitrogen and gas volume. This final exhalation occurs in three phases. The first phase (phase 1) has no nitrogen as that is gas that is 100% oxygen in the anatomic dead space. The nitrogen concentration then rapidly increases during the brief second phase (phase 2) and finally reaches a plateau in the third phase (phase 3). The anatomic dead space is equal to the volume exhaled during the first phase plus the volume up to the mid-point of the transition from phase 1 to phase 3.

==Ventilated patient==

The depth and frequency of our breathing is determined by chemoreceptors and the brainstem, as modified by a number of subjective sensations. When mechanically ventilated using a mandatory mode, the patient breathes at a rate and tidal volume that is dictated by the machine.
Because of dead space, taking deep breaths more slowly (e.g. ten 500 ml breaths per minute) is more effective than taking shallow breaths quickly (e.g. twenty 250 ml breaths per minute). Although the amount of gas per minute is the same (5 L/min), a large proportion of the shallow breaths is dead space, which does not help oxygen to get into the blood.

==Mechanical dead space==

Mechanical dead space or external dead space is volume in the passages of a breathing apparatus in which the breathing gas flows in both directions as the user breathes in and out, causing the last exhaled gas to be immediately inhaled on the next breath, increasing the necessary tidal volume and respiratory effort to get the same amount of usable air or breathing gas, and increasing the accumulation of carbon dioxide from shallow breaths. It is in effect an external extension of the physiological dead space.

It can be reduced by:
* Using separate intake and exhaust passages with one-way valves placed in each passage, usually between each passage and the mouthpiece. This limits the dead space to between the non return valves and the user&#x27;s mouth or nose. Not all of the volume between the non-return valves is necessarily dead space, as exhaled gas in narrow ducting will not necessarily mix well with fresh gas from inhalation ducting, but exhaled gas beyond the exhaust non-return valves can reasonably be assumed to not mix with fresh gas if the valves function correctly. The total effective dead space can be minimized by keeping the volume of this external dead space as small as possible, but this should not unduly increase the work of breathing, which can become critical in breathing apparatus used at high ambient pressure.
* With a full face mask or demand diving helmet:
** Keeping the inside volume small
** Having a small internal orinasal mask inside the main mask or helmet, which separates the external respiratory passage from the rest of the mask interior.
**In a few models of full face mask a mouthpiece like those used on diving regulators is fitted, which has the same function as an orinasal mask, but can further reduce the volume of the external dead space, at the cost of forcing mouth-breathing (and acting like a gag, preventing clear talking).

===Effects===
Dead space reduces the amount of fresh breathing gas which reaches the alveoli during each breath. This reduces the oxygen available for gas exchange, and the amount of carbon dioxide that can be removed. The buildup of carbon dioxide is usually the more noticeable effect unless the breathing gas is hypoxic as occurs at high altitude. The body can compensate to some extent by increasing the volume of inspired gas, but this also increases work of breathing, and is only effective when the ratio of dead space to tidal volume is reduced sufficiently to compensate for the additional carbon dioxide load due to the increased work of breathing.
Continued buildup of carbon dioxide will lead to hypercapnia and respiratory distress.

==Changes with exercise==
In healthy people, Vd is about one-third of Vt at rest and decreases with exercise to about one-fifth mainly due to an increase in Vt, as anatomic dead space does not change much and alveolar dead space should be negligible or very small.

External dead space for a given breathing apparatus is usually fixed, and this volume must be added to tidal volume to provide equivalent effective ventilation at any given level of exertion.

<text>Genetic linkage is the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other are unlikely to be separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more &quot;linked&quot; than markers that are far apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and the more likely they are to be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly &quot;unlinked&quot;, although the penetrance of potentially deleterious alleles may be influenced by the presence of other alleles, and these other alleles may be located on other chromosomes than that on which a particular potentially deleterious allele is located.

Genetic linkage is the most prominent exception to Gregor Mendel&#x27;s Law of Independent Assortment. The first experiment to demonstrate linkage was carried out in 1905. At the time, the reason why certain traits tend to be inherited together was unknown. Later work revealed that genes are physical structures related by physical distance.

The typical unit of genetic linkage is the centimorgan (cM). A distance of 1 cM between two markers means that the markers are separated to different chromosomes on average once per 100 meiotic product, thus once per 50 meioses.

==Discovery==
Gregor Mendel&#x27;s Law of Independent Assortment states that every trait is inherited independently of every other trait. But shortly after Mendel&#x27;s work was rediscovered, exceptions to this rule were found. In 1905, the British geneticists William Bateson, Edith Rebecca Saunders and Reginald Punnett cross-bred pea plants in experiments similar to Mendel&#x27;s. They were interested in trait inheritance in the sweet pea and were studying two genes—the gene for flower colour (&quot;P&quot;, purple, and &quot;p&quot;, red) and the gene affecting the shape of pollen grains (&quot;L&quot;, long, and &quot;l&quot;, round). They crossed the pure lines &quot;PPLL&quot; and &quot;ppll&quot; and then self-crossed the resulting &quot;PpLl&quot; lines.

According to Mendelian genetics, the expected phenotypes would occur in a 9:3:3:1 ratio of PL:Pl:pL:pl. To their surprise, they observed an increased frequency of PL and pl and a decreased frequency of Pl and pL:

Their experiment revealed linkage between the &quot;P&quot; and &quot;L&quot; alleles and the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;l&quot; alleles. The frequency of &quot;P&quot; occurring together with &quot;L&quot; and &quot;p&quot; occurring together with &quot;l&quot; is greater than that of the recombinant &quot;Pl&quot; and &quot;pL&quot;. The recombination frequency is more difficult to compute in an F2 cross than a backcross, but the lack of fit between observed and expected numbers of progeny in the above table indicate it is less than 50%. This indicated that two factors interacted in some way to create this difference by masking the appearance of the other two phenotypes. This led to the conclusion that some traits are related to each other because of their near proximity to each other on a chromosome.

The understanding of linkage was expanded by the work of Thomas Hunt Morgan. Morgan&#x27;s observation that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs led to the idea that crossover frequency might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The centimorgan, which expresses the frequency of crossing over, is named in his honour.

==Linkage map==

A linkage map (also known as a genetic map) is a table for a species or experimental population that shows the position of its known genes or genetic markers relative to each other in terms of recombination frequency, rather than a specific physical distance along each chromosome. Linkage maps were first developed by Alfred Sturtevant, a student of Thomas Hunt Morgan.

A linkage map is a map based on the frequencies of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between the markers, the smaller the physical distance between them. Historically, the markers originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, eye colour) derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.

Linkage maps help researchers to locate other markers, such as other genes by testing for genetic linkage of the already known markers. In the early stages of developing a linkage map, the data are used to assemble linkage groups, a set of genes which are known to be linked. As knowledge advances, more markers can be added to a group, until the group covers an entire chromosome. For well-studied organisms the linkage groups correspond one-to-one with the chromosomes.

A linkage map is not a physical map (such as a radiation reduced hybrid map) or gene map.

==Linkage analysis==
Linkage analysis is a genetic method that searches for chromosomal segments that cosegregate with the ailment phenotype through families. It can be used to map genes for both binary and quantitative traits. Linkage analysis may be either parametric (if we know the relationship between phenotypic and genetic similarity) or non-parametric. Parametric linkage analysis is the traditional approach, whereby the probability that a gene important for a disease is linked to a genetic marker is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the probability that a given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, is due to the existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance. Non-parametric linkage analysis, in turn, studies the probability of an allele being identical by descent with itself.
===Parametric linkage analysis===
The LOD score (logarithm (base 10) of odds), developed by Newton Morton, is a statistical test often used for linkage analysis in human, animal, and plant populations. The LOD score compares the likelihood of obtaining the test data if the two loci are indeed linked, to the likelihood of observing the same data purely by chance. Positive LOD scores favour the presence of linkage, whereas negative LOD scores indicate that linkage is less likely. Computerised LOD score analysis is a simple way to analyse complex family pedigrees in order to determine the linkage between Mendelian traits (or between a trait and a marker, or two markers).

The method is described in greater detail by Strachan and Read. Briefly, it works as follows:
# Establish a pedigree
# Make a number of estimates of recombination frequency
# Calculate a LOD score for each estimate
# The estimate with the highest LOD score will be considered the best estimate

The LOD score is calculated as follows:

: formula_1

NR denotes the number of non-recombinant offspring, and R denotes the number of recombinant offspring. The reason 0.5 is used in the denominator is that any alleles that are completely unlinked (e.g. alleles on separate chromosomes) have a 50% chance of recombination, due to independent assortment. &quot;θ&quot; is the recombinant fraction, i.e. the fraction of births in which recombination has happened between the studied genetic marker and the putative gene associated with the disease. Thus, it is equal to .

By convention, a LOD score greater than 3.0 is considered evidence for linkage, as it indicates 1000 to 1 odds that the linkage being observed did not occur by chance. On the other hand, a LOD score less than −2.0 is considered evidence to exclude linkage. Although it is very unlikely that a LOD score of 3 would be obtained from a single pedigree, the mathematical properties of the test allow data from a number of pedigrees to be combined by summing their LOD scores. A LOD score of 3 translates to a &quot;p&quot;-value of approximately 0.05, and no multiple testing correction (e.g. Bonferroni correction) is required.

=== Limitations ===
Linkage analysis has a number of methodological and theoretical limitations that can significantly increase the type-1 error rate and reduce the power to map human quantitative trait loci (QTL). While linkage analysis was successfully used to identify genetic variants that contribute to rare disorders such as Huntington disease, it did not perform that well when applied to more common disorders such as heart disease or different forms of cancer. An explanation for this is that the genetic mechanisms affecting common disorders are different from those causing some rare disorders.

==Recombination frequency==
Recombination frequency is a measure of genetic linkage and is used in the creation of a genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (&quot;θ&quot;) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we&#x27;re analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases one could systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci, unless one used an appropriate mathematical model.

Double linkage is more of a historical concern for plants. In animals, double crossover happens rarely. In humans, for example, one chromosome has two crossovers on average during meiosis. Furthermore, modern geneticists have enough genes that only nearby genes need to be linkage-analyzed, unlike the early days when only a few genes were known.

During meiosis, chromosomes assort randomly into gametes, such that the segregation of alleles of one gene is independent of alleles of another gene. This is stated in Mendel&#x27;s Second Law and is known as the law of independent assortment. The law of independent assortment always holds true for genes that are located on different chromosomes, but for genes that are on the same chromosome, it does not always hold true.

As an example of independent assortment, consider the crossing of the pure-bred homozygote parental strain with genotype &quot;AABB&quot; with a different pure-bred strain with genotype &quot;aabb&quot;. A and a and B and b represent the alleles of genes A and B. Crossing these homozygous parental strains will result in F1 generation offspring that are double heterozygotes with genotype AaBb. The F1 offspring AaBb produces gametes that are &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;Ab&quot;, &quot;aB&quot;, and &quot;ab&quot; with equal frequencies (25%) because the alleles of gene A assort independently of the alleles for gene B during meiosis. Note that 2 of the 4 gametes (50%)—&quot;Ab&quot; and &quot;aB&quot;—were not present in the parental generation. These gametes represent recombinant gametes. Recombinant gametes are those gametes that differ from both of the haploid gametes that made up the original diploid cell. In this example, the recombination frequency is 50% since 2 of the 4 gametes were recombinant gametes.

The recombination frequency will be 50% when two genes are located on different chromosomes or when they are widely separated on the same chromosome. This is a consequence of independent assortment.

When two genes are close together on the same chromosome, they do not assort independently and are said to be linked. Whereas genes located on different chromosomes assort independently and have a recombination frequency of 50%, linked genes have a recombination frequency that is less than 50%.

As an example of linkage, consider the classic experiment by William Bateson and Reginald Punnett. They were interested in trait inheritance in the sweet pea and were studying two genes—the gene for flower colour (&quot;P&quot;, purple, and &quot;p&quot;, red) and the gene affecting the shape of pollen grains (&quot;L&quot;, long, and &quot;l&quot;, round). They crossed the pure lines &quot;PPLL&quot; and &quot;ppll&quot; and then self-crossed the resulting &quot;PpLl&quot; lines. According to Mendelian genetics, the expected phenotypes would occur in a 9:3:3:1 ratio of PL:Pl:pL:pl. To their surprise, they observed an increased frequency of PL and pl and a decreased frequency of Pl and pL (see table below).

Their experiment revealed linkage between the &quot;P&quot; and &quot;L&quot; alleles and the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;l&quot; alleles. The frequency of &quot;P&quot; occurring together with &quot;L&quot; and with &quot;p&quot; occurring together with &quot;l&quot; is greater than that of the recombinant &quot;Pl&quot; and &quot;pL&quot;. The recombination frequency is more difficult to compute in an F2 cross than a backcross, but the lack of fit between observed and expected numbers of progeny in the above table indicate it is less than 50%.

The progeny in this case received two dominant alleles linked on one chromosome (referred to as coupling or cis arrangement). However, after crossover, some progeny could have received one parental chromosome with a dominant allele for one trait (e.g. Purple) linked to a recessive allele for a second trait (e.g. round) with the opposite being true for the other parental chromosome (e.g. red and Long). This is referred to as repulsion or a trans arrangement. The phenotype here would still be purple and long but a test cross of this individual with the recessive parent would produce progeny with much greater proportion of the two crossover phenotypes. While such a problem may not seem likely from this example, unfavourable repulsion linkages do appear when breeding for disease resistance in some crops.

The two possible arrangements, cis and trans, of alleles in a double heterozygote are referred to as gametic phases, and &quot;phasing&quot; is the process of determining which of the two is present in a given individual.

When two genes are located on the same chromosome, the chance of a crossover producing recombination between the genes is related to the distance between the two genes. Thus, the use of recombination frequencies has been used to develop linkage maps or genetic maps.

However, it is important to note that recombination frequency tends to underestimate the distance between two linked genes. This is because as the two genes are located farther apart, the chance of double or even number of crossovers between them also increases. Double or even number of crossovers between the two genes results in them being cosegregated to the same gamete, yielding a parental progeny instead of the expected recombinant progeny. As mentioned above, the Kosambi and Haldane transformations attempt to correct for multiple crossovers.

===Linkage of genetic sites within a gene===

In the early 1950s the prevailing view was that the genes in a chromosome are discrete entities, indivisible by genetic recombination and arranged like beads on a string. During 1955 to 1959, Benzer performed genetic recombination experiments using rII mutants of bacteriophage T4. He found that, on the basis of recombination tests, the sites of mutation could be mapped in a linear order. This result provided evidence for the key idea that the gene has a linear structure equivalent to a length of DNA with many sites that can independently mutate.

Edgar et al. performed mapping experiments with r mutants of bacteriophage T4 showing that recombination frequencies between rII mutants are not strictly additive. The recombination frequency from a cross of two rII mutants (a x d) is usually less than the sum of recombination frequencies for adjacent internal sub-intervals (a x b) + (b x c) + (c x d). Although not strictly additive, a systematic relationship was observed that likely reflects the underlying molecular mechanism of genetic recombination.

==Variation of recombination frequency==
While recombination of chromosomes is an essential process during meiosis, there is a large range of frequency of cross overs across organisms and within species. Sexually dimorphic rates of recombination are termed heterochiasmy, and are observed more often than a common rate between male and females. In mammals, females often have a higher rate of recombination compared to males. It is theorised that there are unique selections acting or meiotic drivers which influence the difference in rates. The difference in rates may also reflect the vastly different environments and conditions of meiosis in oogenesis and spermatogenesis.

===Genes affecting recombination frequency===

Mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the processing of DNA often affect recombination frequency. In bacteriophage T4, mutations that reduce expression of the replicative DNA polymerase [gene product 43 (gp43)] increase recombination (decrease linkage) several fold. The increase in recombination may be due to replication errors by the defective DNA polymerase that are themselves recombination events such as template switches, i.e. copy choice recombination events. Recombination is also increased by mutations that reduce the expression of DNA ligase (gp30) and dCMP hydroxymethylase (gp42), two enzymes employed in DNA synthesis.

Recombination is reduced (linkage increased) by mutations in genes that encode proteins with nuclease functions (gp46 and gp47) and a DNA-binding protein (gp32) Mutation in the bacteriophage uvsX gene also substantially reduces recombination. The uvsX gene is analogous to the well studied &quot;recA&quot; gene of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; that plays a central role in recombination.

==Meiosis indicators==
With very large pedigrees or with very dense genetic marker data, such as from whole-genome sequencing, it is possible to precisely locate recombinations. With this type of genetic analysis, a meiosis indicator is assigned to each position of the genome for each meiosis in a pedigree. The indicator indicates which copy of the parental chromosome contributes to the transmitted gamete at that position. For example, if the allele from the &#x27;first&#x27; copy of the parental chromosome is transmitted, a &#x27;0&#x27; might be assigned to that meiosis. If the allele from the &#x27;second&#x27; copy of the parental chromosome is transmitted, a &#x27;1&#x27; would be assigned to that meiosis. The two alleles in the parent came, one each, from two grandparents. These indicators are then used to determine identical-by-descent (IBD) states or inheritance states, which are in turn used to identify genes responsible for diseases.

<text>Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when an injury to the innermost layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart. In most cases, this is associated with a sudden onset of agonizing chest or back pain, often described as &quot;tearing&quot; in character. Vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may also occur. Damage to other organs may result from the decreased blood supply, such as stroke, lower extremity ischemia, or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from insufficient blood flow to the heart or complete rupture of the aorta.
AD is more common in those with a history of high blood pressure; a number of connective tissue diseases that affect blood vessel wall strength including Marfan syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome; a bicuspid aortic valve; and previous heart surgery. Major trauma, smoking, cocaine use, pregnancy, a thoracic aortic aneurysm, inflammation of arteries, and abnormal lipid levels are also associated with an increased risk. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms with medical imaging, such as CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound used to confirm and further evaluate the dissection. The two main types are Stanford type A, which involves the first part of the aorta, and type B, which does not.
Prevention is by blood pressure control and smoking cessation. Management of AD depends on the part of the aorta involved. Dissections that involve the first part of the aorta (adjacent to the heart) usually require surgery. Surgery may be done either by an opening in the chest or from inside the blood vessel. Dissections that involve the second part of the aorta can typically be treated with medications that lower blood pressure and heart rate, unless there are complications which then require surgical correction.
AD is relatively rare, occurring at an estimated rate of three per 100,000 people per year. It is more common in men than women. The typical age at diagnosis is 63, with about 10% of cases occurring before the age of 40. Without treatment, about half of people with Stanford type A dissections die within three days and about 10% of people with Stanford type B dissections die within one month. The first case of AD was described in the examination of King George II of Great Britain following his death in 1760. Surgery for AD was introduced in the 1950s by Michael E. DeBakey.
==Signs and symptoms==
About 96% of individuals with AD present with severe pain that had a sudden onset. The pain may be described as a tearing, stabbing, or sharp sensation in the chest, back, or abdomen. About 17% of individuals feel the pain migrate as the dissection extends down the aorta. The location of pain is associated with the location of the dissection. Anterior chest pain is associated with dissections involving the ascending aorta, while interscapular back pain is associated with descending aortic dissections. If the pain is pleuritic in nature, it may suggest acute pericarditis caused by bleeding into the sac surrounding the heart. This is a particularly dangerous eventuality, suggesting that acute pericardial tamponade may be imminent. Pericardial tamponade is the most common cause of death from AD.

While the pain may be confused with that of a heart attack, AD is usually not associated with the other suggestive signs, such as heart failure and ECG changes. Less common symptoms that may be seen in the setting of AD include congestive heart failure (7%), fainting (9%), stroke (6%), ischemic peripheral neuropathy, paraplegia, and cardiac arrest. If the individual fainted, about half the time it is due to bleeding into the pericardium, leading to pericardial tamponade. Neurological complications of aortic dissection, such as stroke and paralysis, are due to the involvement of one or more arteries supplying portions of the central nervous system.

If the AD involves the abdominal aorta, compromise of one or both renal arteries occurs in 5–8% of cases, while ischemia of the intestines occurs about 3% of the time.

===Blood pressure===
People with AD often have a history of high blood pressure. The blood pressure is quite variable at presentation with acute AD. It tends to be higher in individuals with a distal dissection. In individuals with a proximal AD, 36% present with hypertension, while 25% present with hypotension. Proximal AD tends to be associated with weakening of the vascular wall due to cystic medial degeneration. In those who present with distal (Stanford type B) AD, 60–70% present with high blood pressure, while 2–3% present with low blood pressure.

Severe hypotension at presentation is a grave prognostic indicator. It is usually associated with pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the brachiocephalic artery (supplying the right arm) or the left subclavian artery (supplying the left arm).

===Aortic insufficiency===
Aortic insufficiency (AI) occurs in half to two-thirds of ascending AD, and the diastolic heart murmur of aortic insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur depends on the blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of low blood pressure.

Multiple causes exist for AI in the setting of ascending AD. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the aortic valve, preventing the leaflets of the valve from coapting. The dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. Alternatively, following an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the left ventricular outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the aortic valve, thereby preventing proper valve closure.

===Myocardial infarction===
Heart attack occurs in 1–2% of aortic dissections. Infarction is caused by the involvement of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with oxygenated blood, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the myocardial infarction is treated with thrombolytic therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac, causing cardiac tamponade.

===Pleural effusion===
A pleural effusion (fluid collection in the space between the lungs and the chest wall or diaphragm) can be due to either blood from a transient rupture of the aorta or fluid due to an inflammatory reaction around the aorta. If a pleural effusion were to develop due to AD, it is more common in the left hemithorax rather than the right hemithorax.

== Predisposing factors ==
Aortic dissection is associated with hypertension (high blood pressure) and many connective tissue disorders. Vasculitis (inflammation of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also be the result of chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension. Illicit drug use with stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine is also a modifiable risk factor for AD. It can also be caused by smoking.

A bicuspid aortic valve (a type of congenital heart disease involving the aortic valve) is found in 7–14% of individuals who have an aortic dissection. These individuals are prone to dissection in the ascending aorta. The risk of dissection in individuals with bicuspid aortic valves is not associated with the degree of stenosis of the valve.

Connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and Loeys–Dietz syndrome increase the risk of aortic dissection. Similarly, vasculitides such as Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis, giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Behçet&#x27;s disease have been associated with a subsequent aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome is found in 5–9% of individuals who had an aortic dissection. In this subset, the incidence in young individuals is increased. Individuals with Marfan syndrome tend to have aneurysms of the aorta and are more prone to proximal dissections of the aorta.

Turner syndrome also increases the risk of aortic dissection, by aortic root dilatation.

Chest trauma leading to aortic dissection can be divided into two groups based on cause: blunt chest trauma (commonly seen in car accidents) and iatrogenic. Iatrogenic causes include trauma during cardiac catheterization or due to an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Aortic dissection may be a late sequela of heart surgery. About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection have a history of open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency are at particularly high risk because aortic regurgitation causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta. This can cause dilatation and weakening of the walls of the ascending aorta.

Syphilis only potentially causes aortic dissection in its tertiary stage.

==Pathophysiology==

As with all other arteries, the aorta is made up of three layers, the intima, the media, and the adventitia. The intima is in direct contact with the blood inside the vessel, and mainly consists of a layer of endothelial cells on a basement membrane; the media contains connective and muscle tissue, and the vessel is protected on the outside by the adventitia, comprising connective tissue.

In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima and enters the media layer. The high pressure rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate along the length of the aorta for a variable distance forward or backward. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100 mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.
The initiating event in aortic dissection is a tear in the intimal lining of the aorta. Due to the high pressures in the aorta, blood enters the media at the point of the tear. The force of the blood entering the media causes the tear to extend. It may extend proximally (closer to the heart) or distally (away from the heart) or both. The blood travels through the media, creating a false lumen (the true lumen is the normal conduit of blood in the aorta). Separating the false lumen from the true lumen is a layer of intimal tissue known as the intimal flap.

The vast majority of aortic dissections originate with an intimal tear in either the ascending aorta (65%), the aortic arch (10%), or just distal to the ligamentum arteriosum in the descending thoracic aorta (20%).

As blood flows down the false lumen, it may cause secondary tears in the intima. Through these secondary tears, the blood can re-enter the true lumen.

While it is not always clear why an intimal tear may occur, quite often it involves degeneration of the collagen and elastin that make up the media. This is known as cystic medial necrosis and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

In about 13% of aortic dissections, no evidence of an intimal tear is found. In these cases, the inciting event is thought to be an intramural hematoma (caused by bleeding within the media). Since no direct connection exists between the true lumen and the false lumen in these cases, diagnosing an aortic dissection by aortography is difficult if the cause is an intramural hematoma. An aortic dissection secondary to an intramural hematoma should be treated the same as one caused by an intimal tear.

==Diagnosis==
Because of the varying symptoms of aortic dissection, the diagnosis is sometimes difficult to make. Concern should be increased in those with low blood pressure, neurological problems, and an unequal pulses.

While taking a good history from the individual may be strongly suggestive of an aortic dissection, the diagnosis cannot always be made by history and physical signs alone. Often, the diagnosis is made by visualization of the intimal flap on a diagnostic imaging test. Common tests used to diagnose an aortic dissection include a CT scan of the chest with iodinated contrast material and a transesophageal echocardiogram. The proximity of the aorta to the esophagus allows the use of higher-frequency ultrasound for better anatomical images. Other tests that may be used include an aortogram or magnetic resonance angiogram of the aorta. Each of these tests has pros and cons, and they do not have equal sensitivities and specificities in the diagnosis of aortic dissection.

In general, the imaging technique chosen is based on the pretest likelihood of the diagnosis, availability of the testing modality, patient stability, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

===D-dimer===
A measurement of blood D-dimer level may be useful in diagnostic evaluation. A level less than 500 ng/ml may be considered evidence against a diagnosis of aortic dissection, although this guideline is only applicable in cases deemed &quot;low risk&quot; and within 24 hours of symptom onset. The American Heart Association does not advise using this test in making the diagnosis, as evidence is still tentative.

===Chest X-ray===

Chest radiography may although demonstrate a change in the morphology of the thoracic aorta which can be seen in aortic dissection. Classically, new widening of the mediastinum on radiograph is of moderate sensitivity for detecting an ascending aortic dissection; however, this finding is of low specificity, as many other conditions can cause apparent widening of the mediastinum.

There are several other associated radiographic findings:
* The &quot;calcium sign&quot; describes an apparent separation of the intimal calcification from the outer aortic margin by greater than 10 mm.
* Pleural effusions, more commonly in descending aortic dissections, and typically left-sided.
* Other: the obliteration of the aortic knob, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, loss of the paratracheal stripe, and tracheal deviation.
Importantly, about 12 to 20% of aortic dissections are not detectable by chest radiograph; therefore, a &quot;normal&quot; chest radiograph does not rule out aortic dissection. If there is high clinical suspicion, a more sensitive imaging test (CT angiogram, MR angiography, or transesophageal echo) may be warranted.

===Computed tomography===
Computed tomography angiography is a fast, non-invasive test that gives an accurate three-dimensional view of the aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta to the accuracy necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated contrast material is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a bolus tracking method. This type of scan is timed to injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows through the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%. Disadvantages include the need for iodinated contrast material and the inability to diagnose the site of the intimal tear.
===MRI===

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also used for the detection and assessment of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. An MRI examination of the aorta produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the aorta, allowing the physician to determine the location of the intimal tear and the involvement of branch vessels, and to locate any secondary tears. It is a noninvasive test, does not require the use of iodinated contrast material, and can detect and quantitate the degree of aortic insufficiency.

The disadvantage of the MRI scan in the face of aortic dissection is that it may be available only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which could be dangerous in people who are already very unwell. Due to the high-intensity magnetic fields used during MRI, it cannot be used on individuals with metallic implants. In addition, some individuals experience claustrophobia while surrounded by the MRI magnet.

===Ultrasound===

The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a good test in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97%. It has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected aortic dissection. It is a relatively noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the echocardiography probe. It is especially good in the evaluation of AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal echocardiography for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the aortic arch), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the stomach. A TEE may be technically difficult to perform in individuals with esophageal strictures or varices.
===Aortogram===

An aortogram involves the placement of a catheter in the aorta and injection of contrast material while taking X-rays of the aorta. The procedure is known as aortography. Previously thought to be the diagnostic gold standard, it has been supplanted by other, less-invasive imaging modalities.

== Classification ==
Several different classification systems have been used to describe aortic dissections. One such classification is based on chronicity and labels aortic dissections as hyperacute (&lt;24 hours duration), acute (2–7 days), subacute (8–30 days), and chronic (&gt;30 days). The systems commonly in use are based on either the anatomy of the dissection or the duration of onset of symptoms before the presentation. The Stanford system is used more commonly now, as it is more attuned to the management of the patient.

=== DeBakey ===
The DeBakey system, named after cardiothoracic surgeon Michael E. DeBakey, is an anatomical description of the aortic dissection. It categorizes the dissection based on where the original intimal tear is located and the extent of the dissection (localized to either the ascending aorta or descending aorta or involving both the ascending and descending aorta).
* Type I – originates in ascending aorta, and propagates at least to the aortic arch and often beyond it distally. It is most often seen in patients less than 65 years of age and is the most lethal form of the disease.
* Type II – originates in the ascending aorta and is confined to it.
* Type III – originates in the descending aorta and rarely extends proximally, but will extend distally. It most often occurs in elderly patients with atherosclerosis and hypertension.

=== Stanford ===
The Stanford classification is divided into two groups, A and B, depending on whether the ascending aorta is involved.
* A – TAAD involves the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch, and possibly the descending aorta. The tear can originate in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, or more rarely, in the descending aorta. It includes DeBakey types I and II.
* B – TBAD involves the descending aorta or the arch (distal to the left subclavian artery), without the involvement of the ascending aorta. It includes DeBakey type III.

The Stanford classification is useful as it follows clinical practice, as type A ascending aortic dissections generally require primary surgical treatment, whereas type B dissections generally are treated medically as initial treatment with surgery reserved for any complications.

The main indication for surgical repair of type A dissections is the prevention of acute hemorrhagic pericardial tamponade due to leakage of blood through the dissected layers of the intrapericardial proximal aorta. A secondary indication is acute aortic valve insufficiency (regurgitation): ascending aortic dissections often involve the aortic valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes down into the aortic root, resulting in aortic incompetence. The valve must be resuspended to be reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a Dacron graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.

==Prevention==
Among the recognized risk factors for aortic dissection, hypertension, abnormally high levels of lipids (such as cholesterol) in the blood, and smoking tobacco are considered preventable risk factors.

Repair of an enlargement of the ascending aorta from an aortic aneurysm or previously unrecognized and untreated aortic dissections is recommended when greater than in size to decrease the risk of dissection. Repair may be recommended when greater than in size if the person has one of the several connective-tissue disorders or a family history of a ruptured aorta.

==Management==
In an acute dissection, treatment choice depends on its location. For Stanford type A (ascending aortic) dissection, surgical management is superior to medical management. For uncomplicated Stanford type B (distal aortic) dissections (including abdominal aortic dissections), medical management is preferred over surgery. Complicated Stanford type B aortic dissections require surgical intervention after initiation of medical therapy, with endovascular stent-grafting (TEVAR) available as a less invasive alternative to surgery.

The risk of death due to aortic dissection is highest in the first few hours after the dissection begins, and decreases afterward. Because of this, the therapeutic strategies differ for the treatment of an acute dissection compared to a chronic dissection. An acute dissection is one in which the individual presents within the first two weeks. If the individual has managed to survive this window period, their prognosis is improved. About 66% of all dissections present in the acute phase. Individuals who present two weeks after the onset of the dissection are said to have chronic aortic dissections. These individuals have been self-selected as survivors of the acute episode and can be treated with medical therapy as long as they are stable.

===Medication===
Aortic dissection generally presents as a hypertensive emergency, and the prime consideration of medical management is to decrease the shear stress in the aortic wall (dP/dt (force of ejection of blood from the left ventricle)) by decreasing blood pressure and the heart rate. The target blood pressure should be a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 to 75 mmHg, or the lowest blood pressure tolerated. Initial decreases should be by about 20%. The target heart rate is less than 65 beats per minute. Long-term blood pressure control is required for every person who has experienced aortic dissection. 

Beta blockers are the first-line treatment for patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection. In acute dissection, fast-acting agents can be given intravenously and have doses that are easier to adjust (such as esmolol, propranolol, or labetalol) is preferred. Vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside can be considered for people with ongoing high blood pressure, but they should never be used alone, as they often stimulate a reflexive increase in the heart rate.

Calcium channel blockers can be used in the treatment of aortic dissection, particularly if a contraindication to the use of beta-blockers exists. The calcium channel blockers typically used are verapamil and diltiazem, because of their combined vasodilator and negative inotropic effects.

If the individual has refractory hypertension (persistent hypertension on the maximum doses of three different classes of antihypertensive agents), involvement of the renal arteries in the aortic dissection plane should be considered.

===Surgical===
Indications for the surgical treatment of aortic dissection include an acute proximal aortic dissection and an acute distal aortic dissection with one or more complications. Complications include compromise of a vital organ, rupture or impending rupture of the aorta, retrograde dissection into the ascending aorta. These are more common with a history of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The objective in the surgical management of aortic dissection is to resect (remove) the most severely damaged segments of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and any secondary tears along the vessel). While excision of the intimal tear may be performed, it does not significantly change mortality.

The particular treatment used depends on the segment or segments of the aorta involved. Some treatments are:
* Open aortic surgery with replacement of the damaged section of the aorta with a tube graft (often made of Dacron) when no damage to the aortic valve is seen
* Bentall procedure – replacement of the damaged section of the aorta and replacement of the aortic valve
* David procedure – replacement of the damaged section of the aorta and reimplantation of the aortic valve
* Thoracic endovascular aortic repair, a minimally invasive surgical procedure usually combined with ongoing medical management
* Frozen elephant trunk procedure (FET) is one-stage procedure for the repair of acute aortic dissection that permits concurrent total aortic arch replacement with antegrade delivery of a descending aortic stent-graft which itself functions as a proximal landing zone to facilitate prospective endovascular intervention (TEVAR) to treat residual or de novo disease in the more distal aorta.

A number of comorbid conditions increase the surgical risk of repair of an aortic dissection. These conditions include the following:
* Prolonged preoperative evaluation (increased length of time prior to surgery)
* Advanced age
* Comorbid disease states (e.g.: coronary artery disease)
* Aneurysm leakage
* Cardiac tamponade
* Shock - obstructive shock
* Past history of myocardial infarction 
* History of kidney failure (either acute or chronic kidney failure)

===Follow-up===

Patients who have suffered aortic dissection are at risk of Aortic aneurysm formation at the site of the dissection, thought to be due to weakening of the aortic wall. The risk of this aneurysm degeneration is 10 times higher in individuals who have uncontrolled hypertension, compared to individuals with a systolic pressure below 130 mmHg.

The risk of death is highest in the first two years after the acute event, and individuals should be followed closely during this time period. About 29% of late deaths following surgery are due to rupture of either a dissecting aneurysm or another aneurysm. In addition, a 17% to 25% incidence exists of new aneurysm formation, typically due to dilatation of the residual false lumen. These new aneurysms are more likely to rupture, due to their thinner walls.

Serial imaging of the aorta is recommended, although guidelines on modality (CT vs MRI vs ultrasound) and interval (timing of imaging tests) do not exist.

==Prognosis==
Of all people with aortic dissection, 40% die immediately and do not reach a hospital in time. Of the remainder, 1% die every hour, making prompt diagnosis and treatment a priority. Even after diagnosis, 5–20% die during surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. In ascending aortic dissection, if surgery is decided to be not appropriate, 75% die within 2 weeks. With aggressive treatment, 30-day survival for thoracic dissections may be as high as 90%.

==Epidemiology==
Establishing the incidence of aortic dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may have been attributed to another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. Aortic dissection affects an estimated 2.0–3.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest that the incidence of aortic dissection may be rising. Men are more commonly affected than women: 65% of all people with aortic dissection are male. The mean age at diagnosis is 63 years. In females before the age of 40, half of all aortic dissections occur during pregnancy (typically in the third trimester or early postpartum period). Dissection occurs in about 0.6% of pregnancies.

==History==
The earliest fully documented case of aortic dissection is attributed to Frank Nicholls in his autopsy report of King George II of Great Britain, who had been found dead on 25 October 1760; the report describes a dissection of the aortic arch and into the pericardium. The term &quot;aortic dissection&quot; was introduced by the French physician J. P. Maunoir in 1802, and René Laennec labeled the condition &quot;dissecting aneurysm&quot;. London cardiologist Thomas Bevill Peacock contributed to the understanding of the condition by publishing two series of the cases described in the literature so far: 19 cases in an 1843 review, and 80 in 1863. The characteristic symptom of tearing pain in the chest was recognized in 1855 when a case was diagnosed in life.

Surgery for aortic dissection was first introduced and developed by Michael E. DeBakey, Denton Cooley, and Oscar Creech, cardiac surgeons associated with the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, in 1954. DeBakey developed aortic dissection himself at age 97 in 2005, and underwent surgery in 2006. Endovascular treatment of aortic dissection was developed in the 1990s.

==Well-known patients==
*Lucille Ball was diagnosed with dissecting aortic aneurysm on April 18, 1989 and underwent a seven hour surgery to repair her aorta and replace her aortic valve. Early Wednesday morning, April 26, she awoke in her hospital room complaining of severe back pain. She quickly lost consciousness and died at 5:47 a.m. PDT. Ball was 77. Doctors determined that she had died very quickly from an abdominal aortic aneurysm that had burst. This area was not directly related to her surgery the week prior. Unknowingly, Lucille Ball may have increased her risk of aortic aneurysm by having been a heavy cigarette smoker for at least six decades.
*Playwright Jonathan Larson, best known for the musical &quot;Rent&quot;, died in 1996 of an aortic dissection believed to be due to undiagnosed Marfan syndrome.
*Ritter Rules are a compilation of reminders, symptoms, and risk factors designed to prevent the misdiagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection. The rules were named after &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; star John Ritter, who died from a thoracic aortic dissection in 2003 after he was misdiagnosed and mistakenly treated for a heart attack by his two doctors. The rules were developed by Dianna Milewicz of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston seven years after Ritter&#x27;s death, and were jointly published by the non-profit organization in Ritter&#x27;s honor and the Thoracic Aortic Disease Coalition. Ritter&#x27;s brother, Tom, went in for evaluation once his brother&#x27;s cause of death was determined. He was found to have the same defect and underwent surgery to repair it. The procedure was a success. The Ritter family now feels that their patriarch, Tex, may have died from aortic dissection as well. 
*&quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot; actor Richard Biggs died in 2004, at the age of 44 due to complications from aortic dissection.
*Lux Interior of The Cramps died at the Glendale Memorial Hospital in 2009, at the age of 62, following an aortic dissection which, contrary to initial reports about a pre-existing condition, was &quot;sudden, shocking and unexpected&quot;.
*Alan Thicke died in 2016 of type-A aortic dissection at the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, at the age of 69.
*Japanese actress Hiromi Tsuru died in her car from aortic dissection in 2017 at the age of 57.
*Taiwanese entertainer Alien Huang died in 2020 at the age of 36.
*Kentaro Miura, writer and artist of the manga &quot;Berserk&quot;, died from aortic dissection in 2021 at the age of 54.
*In August 2021, New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns was put on full life support following an aortic dissection in his home in Canberra, Australia. He was transferred to Sydney, and became paralysed from the waist down due to sustaining a stroke during surgery.
*41-year-old guitarist Richie Faulkner of the heavy metal band Judas Priest had an aortic aneurysm on September 27, 2021, in the middle of the final song of their 50-minute set at a music festival. He underwent hours of open heart surgery to repair the aortic dissection.
*In 2022, keyboardist Andy Fletcher, a founding member of the UK band Depeche Mode, died unexpectedly at home from an aortic dissection, at the age of 60.

<doc id="274197" wikidata="Q2081549" url="?curid=274197" title="Key of Solomon">
<text>The Key of Solomon (; ), also known as the Greater Key of Solomon, is a pseudepigraphical grimoire attributed to King Solomon. It probably dates back to the 14th or 15th century Italian Renaissance. It presents a typical example of Renaissance magic.

It is possible that the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; inspired later works, particularly the 17th-century grimoire also known as &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; or &quot;Lemegeton&quot;, although there are many differences between the books.

==Manuscripts and textual history==
Many such grimoires attributed to King Solomon were written during the Renaissance, ultimately being influenced by earlier works of Jewish theosophical kabbala and Muslim magicians. These, in turn, incorporated aspects of the Greco-Roman magic of late antiquity.

Several versions of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; exist, in various translations, with minor to significant differences. The original type of text was probably a Latin or Italian text dating to the 14th or 15th century. Most surviving manuscripts date from the late 16th, 17th or 18th century. 
There is also an early Greek manuscript dating to the 15th century (British Library, Harley MS 5596) that is closely associated with the text. The Greek manuscript is referred to as &quot;The Magical Treatise of Solomon&quot;, and was published by Armand Delatte in &quot;Anecdota Atheniensia&quot; (Liège, 1927, pp. 397–445.) Its contents are very similar to the &quot;Clavicula&quot;.

An important Italian manuscript is (Bodleian Library, Michael MS 276) an early Latin text survives in printed form, dated to ca. 1600 (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Memorial Library, Special Collections). There are a number of later (17th century) Latin manuscripts. One of the oldest existing manuscripts (besides Harley MS 5596) is a text in English translation, entitled &quot;The Clavicle of Solomon, revealed by Ptolomy the Grecian&quot; and dated to 1572 (British Library, Sloane MS 3847). There are a number of French manuscripts, all dated to the 18th century, with the exception of one dated to 1641 (P1641, ed. Dumas, 1980).
A Hebrew text survives in two versions, one kept at the British Library, on a parchment manuscript, separated in BL Oriental MSS 6360 and 14759. The BL manuscript was dated to the 16th century by its first editor Greenup (1912), but is now thought to be somewhat younger, dating to the 17th or 18th century. The discovery of a second Hebrew text in the library of Samuel H. Gollancz was published by his son Hermann Gollancz in 1903, who also published a facsimile edition in 1914. Gollancz&#x27;s manuscript had been copied in Amsterdam, in the Sephardic cursive Solitreo script, and is less legible than the BL text. The Hebrew text is not considered the original. It is rather a late Jewish adaptation of a Latin or Italian &quot;Clavicula&quot; text. The BL manuscript is probably the archetype of the Hebrew translation, and Gollancz&#x27;s manuscript a copy of the BL one.

A French edition titled &quot;La véritable Magie Noire ou Le secret des secrets&quot; (&quot;The True Black Magic or The secret of secrets&quot;) is kept at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. It is a translation from Hebrew by Iroé-Grego, dated 1750.

An English edition based on the manuscripts of the British Library was published by S. L. MacGregor Mathers in 1889. L. W. de Laurence in 1914 published &quot;The Greater Key of Solomon&quot;, directly based on Mathers&#x27; edition, to which he made alterations in an attempt to advertise his mail-order business (for example by inserting instructions like &quot;after burning one-half teaspoonful of Temple Incense&quot; along with ordering information for the incense).

==Contents==
===Summary===
The &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; is divided into two books. It describes the necessary drawings to prepare each &quot;experiment&quot; or, in more modern language, magical operations.

Unlike later grimoires such as the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (16th century) or the &quot;Lemegeton&quot; (17th century), the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; does not mention the signature of the 72 spirits constrained by King Solomon in a bronze vessel. As in most medieval grimoires, all magical operations are ostensibly performed through the power of God, to whom all the invocations are addressed. Before any of these operations (termed &quot;experiments&quot;), the operator must confess his sins and purge himself of evil, invoking the protection of God.

Elaborate preparations are necessary, and each of the numerous items used in the operator&#x27;s &quot;experiments&quot; must be constructed of the appropriate materials obtained in the prescribed manner, at the appropriate astrological time, marked with a specific set of magical symbols, and blessed with its own specific words. All substances needed for the magic drawings and amulets are detailed, as well as the means to purify and prepare them. Many of the symbols incorporate the Transitus Fluvii occult alphabet.

===Introduction===
According to the mythical history of the document, as recorded in its introduction, Solomon wrote the book for his son Rehoboam, and commanded him to hide the book in his sepulchre upon his death. After many years the book was discovered by a group of Babylonian philosophers repairing Solomon&#x27;s tomb. None could interpret the text, until one of them, Iohé Grevis, suggested that they should ask the Lord for understanding. The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and extracted a promise that he would keep the text hidden from the unworthy and the wicked, after which he was able to read it plainly. Iohé Grevis then placed a spell on the book that the unworthy, the unwise or those who did not fear God would not attain the desired effect from any of the workings contained in the book.

===Book I===
Book I contains conjurations, invocations, and curses to summon and constrain spirits of the dead and demons in order to compel them to do the operator&#x27;s will. It also describes how to find stolen items, become invisible, gain favour and love, and so on.

===Book II===
Book II describes various purifications which the operator (termed &quot;exorcist&quot;) should undergo, how they should clothe themselves, how the magical implements used in their operations should be constructed, and what animal sacrifices should be made to the spirits.

==Cultural references==
The book is mentioned in Goethe’s Faust I, in the scene where the poodle transforms himself into the devil Mephistopheles.

The Key of Solomon is mentioned in H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;, where Lovecraft says it &quot;illustrates the power of the weird over the Eastern mind&quot;. It&#x27;s also mentioned in Ricardo Palma&#x27;s Tradiciones peruanas (1897), in the story &quot;Don Dimas de la Tijereta&#x27;.

Along with Johannes Kepler’s Astronomia Nova, the Key of Solomon is one of two real-world texts the fictional character Dr. Stephen Strange returns to the Kamar-Taj library in the Marvel Studios film Doctor Strange. In the scene, Kamar-Taj Librarian and current Marvel Cinematic Universe Sorcerer Supreme Wong reads the titles Strange is returning.
In &quot;Supernatural&quot; the tv Series Season 1 episode 22 Devil&#x27;s Trap; Sam tells Bobby has never seen anything like this. Which Bobby responds &quot;Key of Solomon? It&#x27;s the real deal, all right.&quot; He says the protective circles trap demons.

<doc id="274199" wikidata="Q375612" url="?curid=274199" title="Richard Florida">
<text>Richard L. Florida (born 1957) is an American urban studies theorist focusing on social and economic theory. He is a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto and a Distinguished Fellow at NYU&#x27;s School of Professional Studies.

Florida taught at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Heinz College in Pittsburgh from 1987 to 2005, before moving to George Mason University&#x27;s School of Public Policy, where he taught for two years. He was named a Senior Editor at &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in March 2011 after serving as a correspondent for TheAtlantic.com for a year.

== Early life and education ==
Florida was born in Newark, New Jersey. He graduated from Rutgers College in 1979 with a B.A. in political science. He then attended Columbia University, where he studied urban planning (M.Phil. in 1984 and Ph.D. in 1986).

== Research and theories ==
Florida&#x27;s early work focused on innovation by manufacturers, including the continuous-improvement systems implemented by such automakers as Toyota.

===Creative class===
Florida is best known for his concept of the creative class and its implications for urban regeneration. This idea was expressed in Florida&#x27;s best-selling books &quot;The Rise of the Creative Class&quot; (2002), &quot;Cities and the Creative Class&quot;, and &quot;The Flight of the Creative Class&quot;, and later published a book focusing on the issues surrounding urban renewal and talent migration, titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Your City?&quot; 

Florida&#x27;s theory asserts that metropolitan regions with high concentration of technology workers, artists, musicians, lesbians and gay men, and a group he describes as &quot;high bohemians&quot;, exhibit a higher level of economic development. Florida refers to these groups collectively as the &quot;creative class.&quot; He posits that the creative class fosters an open, dynamic, personal, and professional urban environment. This environment, in turn, attracts more creative people, as well as businesses and capital. He suggests that attracting and retaining high-quality talent versus a singular focus on projects such as sports stadiums, iconic buildings, and shopping centers, would be a better primary use of a city&#x27;s regeneration of resources for long-term prosperity. He has devised his own ranking systems that rate cities by a &quot;Bohemian index,&quot; a &quot;Gay index,&quot; a &quot;diversity index&quot;, and similar criteria.

In 2004, following the rise of Google, the gurus of Web 2.0, and the call from business leaders (often seen in publications such as Business 2.0) for a more creative, as well as skilled, workforce, Florida asserted that the contemporary relevance of his research is easy to see. One author characterizes him as an influence on radical centrist political thought.

==== Reception and criticism ====

Florida&#x27;s ideas have been criticized from a variety of political perspectives and by both academics and journalists. His theories have been criticized as being elitist, and his conclusions have been questioned. Researchers have also criticized Florida&#x27;s work for its methodology. Terry Nichols Clark of the University of Chicago used Florida&#x27;s own data to question the correlation between the presence of significant numbers of gay men in a city and the presence of high-technology knowledge industries.
Harvard economist Edward Glaeser analyzed Florida&#x27;s data and concluded that educational levels, rather than the presence of bohemians or gay people, is correlated with metropolitan economic development. 
Other critics have said that the conditions it describes may no longer exist, and that his theories may be better suited to politics, rather than economics. Florida has gone on to directly reply to a number of these objections.

Some scholars have voiced concern over Florida&#x27;s influence on urban planners throughout the United States. A 2010 book, &quot;Weird City&quot;, examines Florida&#x27;s influence on planning policy in Austin, Texas. The main body of the book treats Florida&#x27;s creative class theory in an introductory and neutral tone, but in a theoretical &quot;postscript&quot; chapter, the author criticizes what he describes as Florida&#x27;s tendency to &quot;whitewash&quot; the negative externalities associated with creative city development.

Thomas Frank criticizes Florida&#x27;s &quot;creative class&quot; formulation as one of &quot;several flattering ways of describing the professional cohort,&quot; this particular one being &quot;the most obsequious designation of them all.&quot; Frank places the creative class within a broader critique of the Democratic Party: &quot;Let us be clear about the political views Florida was expounding here. The problem with, say, George W. Bush&#x27;s administration was not that it favored the rich; it was that it favored the &quot;wrong&quot; rich—the &#x27;old-economy&#x27; rich... Florida wept for unfairly ignored industries, but he expressed little sympathy for the working people whose issues were now ignored by both parties.&quot;

Florida lives in Toronto and Miami and is married to Rana Florida.

<doc id="274202" wikidata="Q5872729" url="?curid=274202" title="Hitzig v Canada">
<text>Hitzig v Canada is a 2003 civil case that challenged the constitutionality of the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR), now the Medical Marihuana Access Division. MMAR provided for exemptions from the law for approved medicinal users while allowing for no legal source of therapeutic cannabis products. The case was brought by Warren Hitzig, along with seven medical marijuana users (Alison Myrden, Stephen J Vandekemp, Marco Renda, Marylynne Chamney, Catherine Devries, Jari Dvorak and Debbie Stultz-Giffen).

Warren Saul Hitzig co-founded the (originally the &#x27;Medical Marijuana Resource Centre&#x27;) in 1997 to provide high quality cannabis products to those with a documented medicinal need and to act as a medical marijuana information resource for the Canadian general public. The Centre&#x27;s formation was announced in early 1998 with a press conference and letter to the Canadian government requesting authorization for their activities.

The Hitzig applicants argued that the MMAR provided an illusory access to cannabis medicine, and effectively encouraged sick Canadians to look to the black market for their legal medication, and/or the seeds/plants needed to &#x27;grow their own.&#x27; Ontario Superior Court judge Sidney Lederman agreed that this situation violated the rights of the applicants as set out by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982). He gave the Canadian government six months from January 9, 2003 to remedy the situation, which prompted the controversial announcement on July 8 that Health Canada would begin distribution of marijuana grown under contract to Prairie Plant Systems in Flin Flon, Manitoba.

==Details on plaintiff Alison Myrden==
Alison Myrden first approached Law Professor Alan Young in the Spring of 1999 to form and submit a lawsuit to sue the Government of Canada for a safe, clean, and affordable source of marijuana. This became the &#x27;Hitzig et al.&#x27; Lawsuit. Warren was the only person involved who was not a medical user and could front the suit as a Cannabis Compassion Club.

In 1995, Alison retired from law enforcement and was given her first prescription for Medical Marijuana by a Canadian Physician. She was sent to the street to buy her medicine by the government of Canada before there was such a thing as &#x27;The Medical Marijuana Access Regulations&#x27; (MMAR). Alison was one of the first twenty people in Canada to receive a Federal Licence to smoke, possess and grow medical marijuana for health reasons. Battling multiple sclerosis from the age of 13 years, Alison&#x27;s worst physical problem today is a stabbing pain in her face 24 hours a day associated with MS, called &#x27;Tic Douloureux&#x27;.

Having been allotted one of the largest prescriptions in the country for cannabis and having not to depend on 32 pills a day and 2000 mg of morphine everyday any more from the past 15 years, Alison&#x27;s life has dramatically improved. So much so, that in 2004 Alison ran for the New Democratic Party in Oakville, Ontario, more than doubling the votes for the New Democratic Party from the previous federal election.

<text>USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, a 1240-ton, 36-gun frigate, was the second vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the city of Philadelphia. Originally named &quot;City of Philadelphia&quot;, she was built in 1798–1799 for the United States government by residents of that city. Funding for her construction was raised by a drive that collected $100,000 in one week, in June 1798. She was designed by Josiah Fox and built by Samuel Humphreys, Nathaniel Hutton and John Delavue. Her carved work was done by William Rush of Philadelphia. She was laid down about November 14, 1798, launched on November 28, 1799, and commissioned on April 5, 1800, with Captain Stephen Decatur, Sr. in command. She was captured by Barbary pirates in Tripoli with William Bainbridge in command. Stephen Decatur led a raid that burned her down, preventing her use by the pirates.

==Service history==

Quasi War: USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; put to sea for duty in the West Indies and was off Newcastle on 23 April, 1800 waiting for favorable wind. She arrived on the Guadeloupe Station in May 1800 and relieved the frigate . During this cruise she captured five French armed vessels and recaptured six merchant ships that had been taken by French ships. On 22 May she recaptured schooner &quot;Betsy&quot;. On 15 July, was with USS Connecticut when Connecticut captured French Letter of Marque ketch &quot;Le Chouchou&quot;. On 26 July she recaptured brig &quot;Diligence&quot;. On 26 November she recaptured British sloop &quot;Eliza&quot;, that had been captured by privateer &quot;Rosalie&quot; (or possibly &quot;La Resolute&quot; or &quot;Resolie&quot;). On 27 November recaptured schooner &quot;Sally&quot;. A few days later captured privateer &quot;Hare&quot;(?). On 3 December captured privateer &quot;La Levrette&quot; off Bassaterre, Guadalupe. On 26 December she recaptured American brig &quot;Dove&quot; and sloop &quot;Lucy&quot;, both captured by privateer schooner &quot;Patriot&quot;. On 27 December she recaptured American schooner &quot;Ann and Susan&quot;, captured by privateer &quot;Flambeau&quot;. On 29 December she recaptured British brig &quot;Sir John Wentworth&quot;, captured by privateer schooner &quot;Patriot&quot;.

First Barbary War:Returning home in March 1801, she was ordered to prepare for a year&#x27;s cruise in the Mediterranean in a squadron commanded by Commodore Richard Dale. At his own request, Decatur was relieved of the command of &quot;Philadelphia&quot; by Captain Samuel Barron. The squadron cleared the Cape on 2 June. The squadron arrived at Gibraltar on July 1, with Commodore Dale in the frigate . &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was directed to cruise the Straits and blockade the coast of Tripoli, since in May 1801 the Pasha Yusuf Karamanli had threatened to wage war on the United States and had seized U.S. merchant vessels for ransom.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; departed Gibraltar for the United States in April 1802, arriving in mid-July. Her crew was discharged and she was placed under command of Lt. John Cassin, Cassin in turn was furloughed until further notice with command going to her Sailing Master and put in ordinary in a letter dated 28 July. He was ordered to return and assume command again in a letter dated 21 August, 1802. Captain William Bainbridge was ordered to take command and get her ready to sail in a letter dated 21 May, 1803. On May 21, 1803, she recommissioned (having her sixteen 9-pounder long guns replaced with sixteen 32-pounder carronades at this time), and sailed for the Mediterranean on July 28, 1803. She arrived in Gibraltar on August 24 with Captain William Bainbridge in command. Two days later she captured Moroccan ship-of-war &quot;Mirboka&quot; (24 guns and 100 men) off Cape de Gatt, Spain and the next day recaptured the American brig &quot;Celia&quot;, captured by Mirboka on 17 August, and brought them both into Gibraltar. At the end of the brief war between the U. S. And Morocco, that had been started by the Governor of Tangier without permission of the Emperor of Morocco, Mirboka was returned on 12 October, 1803.

==Capture==
During the First Barbary War, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, accompanied by , cruised off Tripoli until October 31, 1803. While giving chase and firing upon a Tripoli navy ship, it ran aground on an uncharted reef off Tripoli Harbor. The captain, William Bainbridge, tried to refloat the ship, first laying the sails aback, and casting off three bow anchors and shifting the guns aftward, but a strong wind and rising waves drove her further aground.

He ordered the crew to jettison many of the cannons, barrels of water, and other heavy articles overboard in order to lighten the ship, but this too failed. They sawed off the foremast in one last desperate attempt to lighten it. In order not to resupply the Tripoli pirates (navy soldiers of Tripoli government), Captain Bainbridge ordered holes drilled in the ship&#x27;s bottom, magazine flooded, pumps sabotaged, and all other weapons thrown overboard before he surrendered. The Pasha&#x27;s officials enslaved the American officers and men as war captives.

==Burning==

The Tripoli pirates had finally managed to refloat &quot;Philadelphia&quot; on 2 November. The Bey communicated with his Consuls to see if there was any interest in purchasing her, where Tripoli couldn&#x27;t man her properly. Americans believed that the warship was too great a prize to be allowed to remain in foreign hands, so the Navy decided to recapture or destroy it. After the United States had captured the Tripolitan ketch &quot;Mastico&quot;, they renamed her as , but re-rigged the ship with short masts and triangular sails to look like a local ship.

Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, son of USS &quot;Philadelphia&#x27;s&quot; first captain, led a party of 83 volunteers to carry out this task. On February 16, 1804, under the cover of night and in the guise of a ship in distress that had lost all anchors in a storm and needed a place to tie up, Decatur sailed &quot;Intrepid&quot; next to &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. The Americans boarded the prize and, after making sure that she was not seaworthy, burned the ship where she lay in Tripoli Harbor. Decatur&#x27;s force suffered only one wounded member and killed at least 20 Tripolitans.

Britain&#x27;s Viscount Nelson is said to have called this feat &quot;the most bold and daring act of the Age&quot;. The authenticity of this quote remains in doubt.

The crewmen captured in 1803 were released pursuant to the 1805 Treaty of Tripoli, which ended the war. &quot;Philadelphia&#x27;s&quot; anchor was returned to the United States on April 7, 1871, when Mehmed Halet Pasha, the Ottoman governor, presented it to the captain of the visiting .

==Local account of the destruction==

In 1904, Charles Wellington Furlong, an American adventurer, went to Tripoli to investigate the sinking of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. He later wrote about the history in his book, &quot;The Gateway to the Sahara: Observations and Experiences in Tripoli&quot; (1909).

Based on records from a local synagogue, Furlong wrote:
Furlong later reported in the same book that other Arabs in Tripoli had said that the ship was not burned, but moved to the Lazaretto. There it was decorated as a trophy and its guns were fired to mark the end of Ramadan, the major Muslim holiday. According to the detailed account of Hadji-Mohammed Gabroom, an American ketch sneaked into the harbor, its crew killed some of the 10 guards, and allowed the others to flee. It set &quot;Philadelphia&quot; on fire.

==Popular culture==

The burning of the USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; appears in the US DLC of the RTS game Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition.

<text>Christopher John Matthews (born December 17, 1945) is an American political commentator, retired talk show host, and author. Matthews hosted his weeknight hour-long talk show, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, on America&#x27;s Talking and later on MSNBC, from 1997 until March 2, 2020. He announced on his final episode that he was retiring, following an accusation that he had made inappropriate comments to a &quot;Hardball&quot; guest four years earlier.

==Early life and education==
Matthews was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Mary Teresa (née Shields) and Herb Matthews, a court reporter. Matthews&#x27;s father was, he has written, &quot;raised Episcopalian—Church of England,&quot; of English and Scots-Irish ancestry, and his mother was from an Irish Catholic family; Matthews and his siblings were raised in the Catholic faith.

Matthews attended La Salle College High School. Matthews is a 1967 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and did graduate work in economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Matthews was also a visiting fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics.

Matthews served in the United States Peace Corps in Swaziland from 1968 to 1970 as a trade development adviser.

Matthews holds 34 honorary degrees from numerous universities and colleges.

==Career==

===Political career===

When Matthews first arrived in Washington, D.C., he worked as an officer with the United States Capitol Police. Subsequently, Matthews served on the staffs of four Democratic Members of Congress, including Senators Frank Moss and Edmund Muskie. In 1974, Matthews mounted an unsuccessful campaign for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 4th congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in which he received about 24% of the vote in the primary. Matthews was a presidential speechwriter during the Carter Administration, and later worked for six years as Chief of Staff to longtime Speaker of the House of Representatives Tip O&#x27;Neill, playing a direct role in many key political battles with the Reagan Administration.

Matthews has said, &quot;I&#x27;m more conservative than people think I am ... I voted for George W. in 2000.&quot; &quot;Salon.com&quot; called him the &quot;most conservative voice&quot; on MSNBC&#x27;s primetime lineup. Matthews has been accused by Media Matters for America of having panels of guests that skew to the right and of supporting Republicans in his own questions and comments.

On the April 14, 2008, edition of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, Matthews alluded to a possible run for the United States Senate from Pennsylvania. On November 28, 2008, Matthews contacted senior staffers of Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign about a possible Senate run. On January 7, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Matthews told his staffers that he would not run for the Senate.

===Newspaper journalist===

Matthews worked in print media for 15 years, spending 13 years as Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; (1987–2000) and two years as a nationally syndicated columnist for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first all-races election in South Africa, and the Good Friday Peace Talks in Northern Ireland. In 1997 and 1998, his research in the National Archives produced a series of exclusives on the Nixon presidential tapes. Matthews covered American presidential election campaigns from 1988 until his retirement in 2020.

===Author===

He is the author of eight best-selling books:
* &quot;Hardball: How Politics is Played, Told by One Who Knows the Game&quot; (1988)
* &quot;Kennedy &amp; Nixon: The Rivalry that Shaped Postwar America&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Now, Let Me Tell You What I Really Think&quot; (2001)
* &quot;American: Beyond our Grandest Notions&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Life&#x27;s a Campaign: What Politics Has Taught Me About Friendship, Rivalry, Reputation, and Success&quot; (2007)
* &quot;Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero&quot; (2011)
* &quot;Tip and the Gipper: When Politics Worked&quot; (2013)
* &quot;Bobby Kennedy: A Raging Spirit&quot; (2017)

&quot;Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero&quot; spent 12 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list. The book was lauded by critics. &quot;Matthews excels in capturing the tribalism of the Irish Catholic culture and experience Kennedy both absorbed and overcame as he made his way ... [and] is at his best in describing political dynamics,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said. &quot;Matthews proves a compelling storyteller,&quot; said &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. &quot;Matthews has produced a valuable addition to the literature about the life and career of our 35th president,&quot; said &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. &quot;Matthews&#x27;s stirring biography reveals Kennedy as a &#x27;fighting prince never free from pain, never far from trouble, and never accepting the world he found,&#x27;&quot; said &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;.

===Television talk show host===

In 1997, Matthews began his own weeknight talk show, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, which originally aired on America&#x27;s Talking and then moved to MSNBC. &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; featured pundits and elected officials as guests.

&quot;The Chris Matthews Show&quot; aired in syndication on weekends from 2002 until 2013. The show was formatted as a political roundtable consisting of four journalists and Matthews, who served as the moderator. 

In 2004, at the Democratic National Convention, Matthews predicted that he had &quot;just seen the first Black president.&quot; The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; reported on Matthews&#x27;s emotional expressions of support for Barack Obama during the 2008 Presidential election, quoting him as saying: &quot;I have to tell you, you know, it&#x27;s part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama&#x27;s speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don&#x27;t have that too often.&quot;

While discussing proposed healthcare reform on the December 17, 2009, edition of &quot;Hardball&quot;, Matthews stated, &quot;The Republicans will know they have lost ... Let them keep score and it&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s complicated when liberals get to keep score. We&#x27;re always arguing. Well, I&#x27;m a liberal, too.&quot;

In March 2012, Matthews described himself as a centrist during an episode of his MSNBC talk show &quot;Hardball&quot;. That statement was questioned by &quot;Mediaite&quot;″s Josh Feldman directly afterward, based on Matthews&#x27;s frequent condemnation of right-wing political figures and his emotional expression of support for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. Feldman observed that Matthews has criticized liberals such as Hillary Clinton and occasionally even Barack Obama, and that this could explain Matthews&#x27;s description of himself as a &quot;centrist&quot;.

In 2013, Matthews announced that he had signed a long-term contract extension with MSNBC but that he would no longer host &quot;The Chris Matthews Show&quot; in order to focus his efforts on &quot;Hardball,&quot; writing books, and producing documentaries. The final episode of &quot;The Chris Matthews Show&quot; aired on July 21.

In December 2018, Matthews interviewed U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who stated she was &quot;seriously considering&quot; running for President.

On February 7, 2020, during a panel discussion following a Democratic Party presidential candidate debate in New Hampshire, Matthews referenced Bernie Sanders&#x27;s praise for aspects of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, saying &quot;if Castro and the Reds had won the Cold War, there would [have been] executions in Central Park and I might have been one of the ones getting executed and certain other people would be there cheering, OK? So I have a problem with people who took the other side.&quot; His remarks were mocked by left-wing commentators.

During the opening monologue of his Monday, March 2, 2020, show, Matthews announced his immediately effective retirement from &quot;Hardball&quot;. Matthews alluded to claims of inappropriate comments that trailed him for years, resurfacing when freelance journalist Laura Bassett accused Matthews of making sexist remarks when she was a guest on “Hardball” in 2016. MSNBC had executed a long-term contract with Matthews, in 2013, to retain him with the network at least through the 2016 election, and he was expected to retire after the 2020 election cycle, with an exit after Election Day in November 2020 likely. Following his resignation, Matthews garnered well-wishes from professional colleagues in the news media and others, including from Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who noted Matthews&#x27;s willingness to &quot;criticize the neocon pro-war agenda.&quot;

In September 2022, Matthews returned to MSNBC as a political analyst making appearances on the network&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program.

==Controversies==
===Inappropriate comments===
Throughout Matthews&#x27;s career he has been criticized for making sexist comments about women in politics including Melania Trump, Sarah Palin, and Erin Burnett.

In October 2016, Bassett appeared on Matthews&#x27;s program to comment on sexual assault allegations against then candidate Donald Trump. In February 2020, Bassett alleged that prior to that program, Matthews made inappropriate remarks about her makeup, clothing, and dating life. As she was having her television studio makeup applied, Matthews purportedly asked her: &quot;Why haven&#x27;t I fallen in love with you yet?&quot; Bassett claims that when she laughed nervously and said nothing, Matthews followed up to the makeup artist with: &quot;Keep putting makeup on her, I&#x27;ll fall in love with her.&quot; In 2017, Bassett had previously published a text about the incident, which did not identify Matthews by name.

In December 2017, details surfaced of a 1999 settlement Matthews&#x27;s employer, MSNBC, reached with a female producer of Matthews&#x27;s program who alleged Matthews made inappropriate comments about her in front of colleagues in the workplace. MSNBC denied making a settlement, but acknowledged Matthews had been reprimanded for the comments. 

In 2018 during a setup for a television interview with Hillary Clinton, Matthews stated out loud &quot;where was the Cosby pill&quot; that he brought with him.

===Nazi metaphors===
On February 22, 2020, commenting on the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses, Matthews invoked Winston Churchill&#x27;s feeling of disbelief following the fall of France to the Nazis in 1940 as a metaphor for the feeling of disbelief experienced by establishment figures in the Democratic Party to Bernie Sanders&#x27;s victory in the state. As members of Sanders&#x27;s family were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust, his comparison was viewed as insensitive and prompted widespread negative reactions on Twitter calling for him to be removed from MSNBC. Amid mounting criticism, Matthews issued an on-air apology to Sanders and his supporters on February 24. Sanders did not directly respond to the remarks.

==Personal life==

Matthews has been married since 1980 to Kathleen Matthews, who was a news anchor at WJLA-TV, the ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., before accepting a position as an executive vice president with Marriott International. In 2015, Kathleen Matthews launched an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination to run for a House seat in Maryland&#x27;s 8th congressional district, which has been represented by progressive Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin since 2016. The couple have three children: Michael, Thomas, and Caroline. One of his four brothers Jim Matthews, a Republican, is a former county commissioner in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

In 2002, Matthews was hospitalized with malaria, which he contracted on one of his visits that year to Africa.

Matthews was the commencement speaker at Ohio State University on May 4, 2014 and Merrimack College on May 15, 2015.

== Awards ==
Matthews is the recipient of several awards, including The Pennsylvania Society&#x27;s Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement in 2005, the Abraham Lincoln Award from the Union League of Philadelphia, the David Brinkley Award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Award, and the 2016 Tip O&#x27;Neill Irish Diaspora Award.

==Honorary degrees==
Chris Matthews has received over 30 honorary degrees, among which are:

<text>The Shanghai clique (), also referred to as the Shanghai gang, Jiang clique, or Jiang faction, refers to an informal group of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials who rose to prominence under former CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin while he served as the party chief and mayor of Shanghai.

Chinese politics have long been defined by the competition between intra-party factions&#x27; ability to place key members and allies in positions of power within the CCP and Chinese government. In the 1990s when Jiang Zemin was the CCP General Secretary, Chinese politics was dominated by the Shanghai gang as Jiang attempted to place cultivated ideological followers in senior positions within the government. Under Hu Jintao, the Shanghai gang balanced Hu&#x27;s Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL) faction in government and under Xi Jinping, the Shanghai gang continues to contend with Xi&#x27;s faction wherein both factions attempt to obtain the political upper-hand through the nomination of chosen officials to senior roles.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Shanghai clique originated in June 1989, when Jiang Zemin, then Party secretary of Shanghai, was elevated as General Secretary of Communist Party after Tiananmen Square protests. However, in the first few years, Jiang was under heavy influence of party elders such as Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun. During this time, Jiang only elevated Zeng Qinghong, then Deputy Party secretary of Shanghai, into Beijing to become deputy director of Central Office. After the 14th Party Congress in 1992, some of Jiang&#x27;s close associates such as Li Lanqing and Wu Bangguo were able to earn a seat in the Politburo. In the following years, some of the Jiang&#x27;s close associates were placed in important positions. Wu Bangguo became Vice Premier in 1994, and Huang Ju became Party Secretary of Shanghai as well as entered Politburo in the same year. Jia Qinglin, another close associate with Jiang Zemin, became Party secretary of Fujian in 1993. Zeng Qinghong also took over the Central Office in 1993, when he took over the position of director of the office from Wen Jiabao. Some of Jiang&#x27;s political opponent was removed from the key position. Chen Xitong, then Party secretary of Beijing and a member of Politburo, was arrested due to the corruption charge in 1995, but many thought that Chen&#x27;s downfall was mainly due to his bad relationship with Jiang Zemin and opposing some of Jiang&#x27;s policy. Shanghai Clique became the dominant force in Chinese politics after the death of Deng Xiaoping in 1997, where some of Jiang&#x27;s close associates such as Li Lanqing gained a seat in the powerful Politburo Standing Committee and others like Huang Ju, Zeng Qinghong, Li Changchun, and Jia Qinglin all entered politburo. Qiao Shi, the main political rival to Jiang Zemin, was retired in the same year after the Shanghai clique used Qiao&#x27;s age as the reason to ask him to step down. However, Jiang could not choose his successor since Deng Xiaoping already handpicked Hu Jintao as Jiang&#x27;s successor in 1992.

Outside mainland China, after Hu Jintao became general secretary of the CCP Central Committee in 2002, there have been many commentary books on the relationship between the Shanghai Gang and the central government headed by Hu at that time. It is still taboo to talk about within the mainland. In the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee elected by the 16th and 17th CCP National Congresses, the &quot;Shanghai Gang&quot; occupied several positions on the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. Jiang Zemin himself also continued to serve as the chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission after Hu Jintao became the general secretary of the CCP Central Committee. In 2004, he resigned as chairman of the Military Commission at the fourth plenary session of the 16th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on September 19, 2004, but still retained his office of the Chairman of the Military Commission until the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012.

=== Jiang&#x27;s retirement ===

Upon Jiang&#x27;s retirement in 2004, it was widely believed that he stuffed the Politburo Standing Committee with his &#x27;own men&#x27;, and was making it difficult for Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao to carry out their own policies. Evidence for this theory included the 5th Plenary Meeting of 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, when Hu&#x27;s efforts to reshuffle the Politburo was blocked by members of the Shanghai Clique. Wen&#x27;s macro-economic measures aimed at slowing down infrastructure growth and nationwide overheating in the property sector received great resistance from alleged members of this clique until the fall of Chen Liangyu in September 2006.

However, as Jiang had retired from all of his positions at the 4th Plenary Meeting of 16th National Congress of the CCP, Hu Jintao became the legitimate Paramount leader. There were signs of important members of the Shanghai Clique defecting to Hu&#x27;s camp, thereby strengthening Hu&#x27;s position. In addition, in a bold move in September 2006, Hu acted to purge prominent rival Chen Liangyu, former Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary and Mayor of Shanghai, for alleged corruption, thus strengthening his position both within the party and in China. Following Chen Liangyu&#x27;s downfall, Hu Jintao also removed some other officials appointed during Jiang Zemin&#x27;s time in office. Zhang Dingfa, then commander of PLA navy who was named by Jiang Zemin in 2003, was removed from office in August 2006 and replaced by Wu Shengli. You Xigui, then director of Central Guard Bureau named by Jiang Zemin in 1994 and also a close associate of Jiang Zemin, was removed by Hu Jintao in September 2007 and replaced by Cao Qing. Follow the death of Huang Ju and retirement of Zeng Qinghong in 2007, the Shanghai clique was no longer as powerful as before after the 17th Party Congress. Hu Jintao also blocked Han Zheng, then mayor of Shanghai and a former deputy of Chen Liangyu, to become the Party Secretary of Shanghai and earn a seat in the Politburo. Instead, Hu transferred then Party Secretary of Hubei Yu Zhengsheng to take over the Party Secretary of Shanghai position from Xi Jinping. However, the clique still held key positions in Beijing. Zhou Yongkang, who has been seen as a member of the Shanghai clique and close associate with Jiang Zemin, entered the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007 and became secretary of Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, giving him the authority to command China&#x27;s courts, law enforcement, prosecution agencies, paramilitary forces, and domestic intelligence agencies. Other close associates of Jiang Zemin such as Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, and Li Changchun still remain in the PSC. But with members of Tuanpai such as Li Keqiang, Li Yuanchao, and Wang Yang entering Politburo, the power is more balanced between Jiang and Hu faction. In the issue of choosing Hu Jintao&#x27;s successor, however, the Shanghai clique successfully blocked Li Keqiang, a core member of Tuanpai and protege of Hu Jintao, from being selected as Hu&#x27;s successor. Instead, Xi Jinping, who has connections with both Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, are being selected as Hu&#x27;s successor.

After July 2009 Ürümqi riots, Hu Jintao successfully removed Wang Lequan from the position of Party secretary of Xinjiang, where he served since 1994 and was appointed Jiang Zemin. Zhang Chunxian, a member of Tuanpai, was transferred from Hunan to Xinjiang to take over the position.

After Hu left office in 2012, the influence of the Shanghai clique was no longer a visible feature of the Chinese political landscape. Some of the inner members of Shanghai clique including Zhou Yongkang and Guo Boxiong were being prosecuted under the anti-corruption started after the 18th Party Congress leading by Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan. China Leadership Monitor, which calls the group the &quot;Shanghai Gang&quot;, has identified Han Zheng and Wang Huning (who both joined the Politburo Standing Committee in 2017) as members.

=== Under Hu Jintao ===
On September 24, 2006, Chen Liangyu, secretary of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee, who was an important member of the Shanghai Gang, was dismissed for his involvement in the Shanghai Social Security Fund case; overseas media pointed out that this was the &quot;(Communist Youth) Youth League, headed by Hu Jintao, then General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee. Faction&#x27;s campaign against the Shanghai Gang in the name of anti-corruption led to the resignation of Chen Liangyu. After Chen Liangyu stepped down, Xi Jinping, then secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007 to serve as the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, becoming the first municipal Party secretary to be parachuted from other places since 1985.

On June 2, 2007, Huang Ju, then a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, passed away, which was another important blow to the Shanghai Gang. Faguang quoted Taiwan&#x27;s Central News Agency as saying that Huang Ju was an important member of the Shanghai Gang, whose &quot;disappearance&quot; was full of political connotations, and was regarded as an important indicator to observe the current CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao and his predecessor Jiang Zemin&#x27;s strength. Huang Ju&#x27;s wife, Yu Huiwen, was accused of illegally using billions of yuan in Shanghai social security funds. Less than two months after Huang Ju&#x27;s death, Wang Weigong, deputy general manager of Shanghai Shenergy Group, who had served as Huang Ju&#x27;s secretary, was also arrested for his involvement in the Shanghai Social Security Fund case.

On October 15, 2007, the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held. After that, Zeng Qinghong, who was considered to be the core figure of the Shanghai Gang, retired, and Li Keqiang, the former first secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, joined the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, marking the beginning of the Youth League faction.

In 2011, Commonwealth magazine stated that the power struggle between the central government of the Chinese Communist Party controlled by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and the local forces in Shanghai led by Jiang Zemin had worsened because the Shanghai Gang advocated that economic development in coastal areas should not be affected by overemphasizing the development of rural areas.

=== Under Xi Jinping ===

In November 2012, Xi Jinping took over as General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, and Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun and Zhou Yongkang, who were regarded as important members of the Shanghai Gang among the 17th Central Political Bureau Standing Committee, retired after the 18th CCP National Congress. Among the newly elected members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 18th Central Committee, the Jiang faction is still considered to have the majority. However, after Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan launched an anti-corruption campaign after the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, many Jiang faction officials were sacked in this anti-corruption campaign, including Zhou Yongkang, the former secretary of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Guo Boxiong and Guo Boxiong, the former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. Xu Caihou and others.

==== 2014 Investigations in Shanghai ====
According to a BBC report, on July 29, 2014, after Zhou Yongkang was announced to be under investigation, the Central Inspection Team was stationed in Shanghai. Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, is regarded as Jiang Zemin&#x27;s confidant, and Shanghai is Jiang Zemin&#x27;s base. After the central inspection team arrived in Shanghai, Wang Zongnan, the former chairman of Shanghai Bright Food Group, was put on file. Wang Zongnan was one of Jiang Zemin&#x27;s confidants. Zhou Yongkang is the target of Xi Jinping&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign. On August 1, 2014, the Liberty Times quoted the Financial Times as saying that Jiang Zemin, who was 87 years old at the time, had stepped down as General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2002 and resigned from the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. The gang&quot; still retains huge influence within the party. Four or five of the seven standing members of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee are members of the Jiang faction. The current general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign will turn to Jiang Zemin&#x27;s stronghold, the Shanghai Gang. The inspection team of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was stationed in Shanghai, and people with knowledge of the matter told the Financial Times that Jiang Zemin&#x27;s influence in the party and the military had angered Xi, and the anti-corruption investigation had targeted many of Jiang Zemin&#x27;s associates, including Xu Caihou, the former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, who served as Wang Zongnan, chairman of Bright Food Group, was also investigated on suspicion of embezzling public funds and accepting bribes. On October 29, 2014, Zhang Wenyue, head of the second inspection team of the Central Committee, reported to Han Zheng, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the problems existing in Shanghai&#x27;s officialdom, and handed over some leading cadres&#x27; clues to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Central Organization Department and other departments.

==== 19th National Congress ====

In October 2017, the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held. Among the members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 18th Central Committee, Zhang Dejiang, Liu Yunshan, Zhang Gaoli, who were regarded as members of the Jiang faction, and Yu Zhengsheng, a former secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Guo Boxiong, who were regarded as important members of the Jiang faction. Fan Changlong, the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, all retired after the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. Han Zheng, who was the last member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 19th CCP Central Committee, was regarded by some as a member of the Shanghai Gang. Li Qiang and Ying Yong, Xi Jinping&#x27;s former ministries in Zhejiang, broke the convention that since 1991, all the mayors of Shanghai have been local officials.

==== 2020 Investigations in Shanghai ====
From October to December 2020, the sixth round of inspections of the 19th Central Committee was officially launched, and the fourth inspection team of the Central Committee will visit Shanghai again after a lapse of six years. On February 3, 2021, Zhao Fengtong, the leader of the Fourth Inspection Team of the Central Committee, reported to Li Qiang, Secretary of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee, the problems existing in Shanghai&#x27;s officialdom, and handed over the clues of some leading cadres to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Central Organization Department.

<doc id="274227" wikidata="Q208221" url="?curid=274227" title="Sunbird">
<text>Sunbirds and spiderhunters make up the family Nectariniidae of passerine birds. They are small, slender passerines from the Old World, usually with downward-curved bills. Many are brightly coloured, often with iridescent feathers, particularly in the males. Many species also have especially long tail feathers. Their range extends through most of Africa to the Middle East, South Asia, South-east Asia and southern China, to Indonesia, New Guinea and northern Australia. Species diversity is highest in equatorial regions.

There are 151 species in 16 genera. Their family name is from most sunbirds feeding largely on nectar, but they will also catch insects and spiders, especially when feeding their young. Flowers that prevent access to their nectar because of their shape (for example, very long and narrow flowers) are simply punctured at the base near the nectaries, from which the birds sip the nectar. Fruit is also part of the diet of some species. Their flight is fast and direct, thanks to their short wings.

The sunbirds have counterparts in two very distantly related groups: the hummingbirds of the Americas and the honeyeaters of Australia. The resemblances are due to convergent evolution brought about by a similar nectar-feeding lifestyle. Some sunbird species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but they usually perch to feed.

==Description==
The family ranges in size from the 5-gram black-bellied sunbird to the spectacled spiderhunter, at about 45 grams. Like the hummingbirds, sunbirds are strongly sexually dimorphic, with the males usually brilliantly plumaged in iridescent colours. In addition to this the tails of many species are longer in the males, and overall the males are larger. Sunbirds have long thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding. The spiderhunters, of the genus &quot;Arachnothera&quot;, are distinct in appearance from the other members of the family. They are typically larger than the other sunbirds, with drab brown plumage that is the same for both sexes, and long, down-curved beaks.

In metabolic behaviour similar to that of Andes hummingbirds, species of sunbirds that live at high altitudes or latitudes will enter torpor while roosting at night, lowering their body temperature and entering a state of low activity and responsiveness.

The moulting regimes of sunbirds are complex, being different in different species. Many species have no eclipse plumage, but do have juvenile plumage. Some species do show duller plumage in the off-season. In the dry months of June−August, male copper sunbirds and variable sunbirds lose much of their metallic sheen. In some instances different populations of the same species can display variation in different molting regimes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sunbirds are a tropical Old World family, with representatives in Africa, Asia and Australasia. In Africa, they occur mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar and in Egypt. In Asia, the group occurs along the coast of the Red Sea to the Palestine region and along the Mediterranean up to Beirut, with a gap in their distribution across inland Syria and Iraq, and resuming in Iran, from where the group occurs continuously as far as southern China and Indonesia. In Australasia, they occur in New Guinea, north eastern Australia and the Solomon Islands. They are generally not found on oceanic islands, with the exception of the Seychelles. The greatest variety of species is found in Africa, where the group probably arose. Most species are sedentary or short-distance seasonal migrants. Sunbirds occur over the entire family&#x27;s range, whereas the spiderhunters are restricted to Asia.

The sunbirds and spiderhunters occupy a wide range of habitats, with a majority of species being found in primary rainforest, but other habitats used by the family including disturbed secondary forest, open woodland, open scrub and savannah, coastal scrub and alpine forest. Some species have readily adapted to human modified landscapes such as plantations, gardens and agricultural land. Many species are able to occupy a wide range of habitats from sea level to .

==Behaviour and ecology==
Sunbird are active diurnal birds that generally occur in pairs or occasionally in small family groups. A few species occasionally gather in larger groups, and sunbird will join with other birds to mob potential predators, although sunbirds will also aggressively target other species, even if they are not predators, when defending their territories.

===Breeding===

Sunbirds that breed outside of the equatorial regions are mostly seasonal breeders, with the majority of them breeding in the wet season. This timing reflects the increased availability of insect prey for the growing young. Where species, like the buff-throated sunbird, breed in the dry season, it is thought to be associated with the flowering of favoured food plants. Species of sunbird in the equatorial areas breed throughout the year. They are generally monogamous and often territorial, although a few species of sunbirds have lekking behaviour.
The nests of sunbirds are generally purse-shaped, enclosed, suspended from thin branches with generous use of spiderweb. The nests of the spiderhunters are different, both from the sunbirds and in some cases from each other. Some, like the little spiderhunter, are small woven cups attached to the underside of large leaves; that of the yellow-eared spiderhunter is similarly attached but is a long tube. The nests of spiderhunters are inconspicuous, in contrast to those of the other sunbirds which are more visible. In most species the female alone constructs the nest. Up to four eggs are laid. The female builds the nest and incubates the eggs alone, although the male assists in rearing the nestlings. In the spiderhunters both sexes help to incubate the eggs. The nests of sunbirds and spiderhunters are often targeted by brood parasites such as cuckoos and honeyguides.

=== Pollination ===

As nectar is a primary food source for sunbirds, they are important pollinators in African ecosystems. Sunbird-pollinated flowers are typically long, tubular, and red-to-orange in colour, showing convergent evolution with many hummingbird-pollinated flowers in the Americas. A key difference is that sunbirds cannot hover, so sunbird-pollinated flowers and inflorescences are typically sturdier than hummingbird-pollinated flowers, with an appropriate landing spot from which the bird can feed. Sunbirds are critical pollinators for many iconic African plants, including proteas, aloes, &quot;Erica&quot;, &quot;Erythrina&quot; coral trees, and bird-of-paradise flowers. Specialization on sunbirds vs other pollinators is thought to have contributed to plant speciation, including the exceptionally high floral diversity in southern Africa.

==Relationship with humans==
Overall the family has fared better than many others, with only seven species considered to be threatened with extinction. Most species are fairly resistant to changes in habitat, and while attractive the family is not sought after by the cagebird trade, as they have what is considered an unpleasant song and are tricky to keep alive. Sunbirds are considered attractive birds and readily enter gardens where flowering plants are planted to attract them. There are a few negative interactions, for example the scarlet-chested sunbird is considered a pest in cocoa plantations as it spreads parasitic mistletoes.

==List of genera==
The family contains 151 species divided into 16 genera: For more detail, see list of sunbird species.

<doc id="274231" wikidata="Q10468" url="?curid=274231" title="Cepheus (constellation)">
<text>Cepheus is a constellation in the deep northern sky, named after Cepheus, a king of Aethiopia in Greek mythology. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the second century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 constellations in the modern times.

The constellation&#x27;s brightest star is Alderamin (Alpha Cephei), with an apparent magnitude of 2.5. Delta Cephei is the prototype of an important class of star known as a Cepheid variable. RW Cephei, an orange hypergiant, together with the red supergiants Mu Cephei, MY Cephei, VV Cephei, V381 Cephei, and V354 Cephei are among the largest stars known. In addition, Cepheus also has the hyperluminous quasar S5 0014+81, which hosts an ultramassive black hole in its core, reported at 40 billion solar masses, about 10,000 times more massive than the central black hole of the Milky Way, making this among the most massive black holes currently known.

==History and mythology==
Cepheus was the King of Aethiopia. He was married to Cassiopeia and was the father of Andromeda, both of whom are immortalized as modern day constellations along with Cepheus.

==Features==

Alderamin, also known as Alpha Cephei, is the brightest star in the constellation, with an apparent magnitude of 2.51. Gamma Cephei, also known as Errai, is the second-brightest star in the constellation, with an apparent magnitude of 3.21. It is a binary star, made up by an orange giant or subgiant and a red dwarf. The primary component hosts one exoplanet, Gamma Cephei Ab (Tadmor). Delta Cephei is a yellow-hued supergiant star 980 light-years from Earth and the prototype of the class of the Cepheid variables. It was discovered to be variable by John Goodricke in 1784. It varies between 3.5m and 4.4m over a period of 5 days and 9 hours. The Cepheids are a class of pulsating variable stars; Delta Cephei has a minimum size of 40 solar diameters and a maximum size of 46 solar diameters. It is also a double star; the primary star also has a wide-set blue-hued companion of magnitude 6.3.

There are four red supergiants in the constellation that are visible to the naked eye. Mu Cephei is also known as Herschel&#x27;s Garnet Star due to its deep red colour. It is a semiregular variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.4. Its period is approximately 2 years. The star&#x27;s radius has been estimated to be from to . If it were placed at the center of the Solar System, it would likely extend past the orbit of Jupiter. The second, VV Cephei A, is a semiregular variable star, located approximately 5,000 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 5.4 and a maximum magnitude of 4.8, and is paired with a blue main sequence star called VV Cephei B. The red supergiant primary is around 1,050 times larger than the Sun. VV Cephei is also an unusually long-period eclipsing binary, but the eclipses, which occur every 20.3 years, are too faint to be observed with the unaided eye. The third, Zeta Cephei, is not as large as Mu Cephei and VV Cephei A with a diameter less than 200 times that of the Sun; however, its surface would lie between the orbits of Venus and Earth if placed at the center of the Solar System. Zeta Cephei has an apparent magnitude of 3.35, being the fourth-brightest star in the constellation. The last and faintest is V381 Cephei Aa with a maximum magnitude of 5.5. It is part of a triple star system similar to VV Cephei, and has a diameter 980 times that of the Sun. All four stars have initial masses more than eight times that of the Sun and are accepted core-collapse supernova candidates.

Nu Cephei is a blue supergiant similar to Deneb with an initial mass of over 20 solar masses. It belongs to the Cepheus OB2 stellar association along with Mu Cephei and VV Cephei, which have similar initial masses.

There are several prominent double stars and binary stars in Cepheus. Omicron Cephei is a binary star with a period of 800 years. The system, 211 light-years from Earth, consists of an orange-hued giant primary of magnitude 4.9 and a secondary of magnitude 7.1. Xi Cephei is another binary star, 102 light-years from Earth, with a period of 4,000 years. It has a blue-white primary of magnitude 4.4 and a yellow secondary of magnitude 6.5.

Krüger 60 is an 11th-magnitude binary star consisting of two red dwarfs. The star system is one of the nearest, being only 13 light-years away from Earth. It was once proposed as a possible home system for 2I/Borisov, the first accepted interstellar comet, but this was later rejected.
===Deep-sky objects===

* NGC 188 is an open cluster that has the distinction of being the closest open cluster to the north celestial pole, as well as one of the oldest-known open clusters.
* NGC 6946 is a spiral galaxy in which ten supernovae have been observed, more than in any other galaxy. It is sometimes called the Fireworks Galaxy.
* IC 469 is another spiral galaxy, characterized by a compact nucleus, of oval shape, with perceptible side arms.
* The nebula NGC 7538 is home to the largest-yet-discovered protostar.
* NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula with an associated star cluster (Collinder 429); it has an overall magnitude of 7.7 and is 1,400 light-years from Earth. The nebula and cluster are located near Beta Cephei and T Cephei.
* S 155, also known as the Cave Nebula, is a dim and very diffuse bright nebula within a larger nebula complex containing emission, reflection, and dark nebulosity.
* The quasar 6C B0014+8120 is one of the most powerful objects in the universe, powered by a supermassive black hole which is as massive as 40 billion Suns.

==Visualizations==

Cepheus is most commonly depicted as holding his arms aloft, praying for the deities to spare the life of Andromeda. He also is depicted as a more regal monarch sitting on his throne.

==Equivalents==
In Chinese astronomy, the stars of the constellation Cepheus are found in two areas: the Purple Forbidden enclosure (紫微垣, &quot;Zǐ Wēi Yuán&quot;) and the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, &quot;Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ&quot;).

<doc id="274238" wikidata="Q910252" url="?curid=274238" title="United States federal executive departments">
<text>The United States federal executive departments are the principal units of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States. They are analogous to ministries common in parliamentary or semi-presidential systems but (the United States being a presidential system) they are led by a head of government who is also the head of state. The executive departments are the administrative arms of the president of the United States. There are currently 15 executive departments.

==Overview==
===Structure===
Each department is headed by a secretary whose title echoes the title of their respective department, with the exception of the Department of Justice, whose head is known as the attorney general. The heads of the executive departments are appointed by the president and take office after confirmation by the United States Senate, and serve at the pleasure of the president. The heads of departments are members of the Cabinet of the United States, an executive organ that normally acts as an advisory body to the president. In the Opinion Clause (Article II, section 2, clause 1) of the U.S. Constitution, heads of executive departments are referred to as &quot;principal Officer in each of the executive Departments&quot;.

The heads of executive departments are included in the line of succession to the president, in the event of a vacancy in the presidency, after the vice president, the speaker of the House, and the president pro tempore of the Senate. They are included in order of their respective department&#x27;s formation, with the exception of the Secretary of Defense, whose position in the line of succession is based on when the Department of War was formed.

===Separation of powers===
To enforce a strong separation of powers, the federal Constitution&#x27;s Ineligibility Clause expressly prohibits executive branch employees (including heads of executive departments) from simultaneously serving in Congress, and vice versa. Accordingly, in sharp contrast to parliamentary systems where ministers are often selected to form a government from members of parliament, U.S. legislators who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve as heads of executive departments must resign from Congress before assuming their new positions. If the emoluments for a new appointee&#x27;s executive branch position were increased while the appointee was previously serving in Congress (e.g., cost of living adjustments), the president must implement a Saxbe fix.

===Contracting and grantmaking roles===
As is evident from the chart below, several executive departments (Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation) have disproportionately small employee headcounts in contrast to the size of their budgets. This is because many of their employees merely supervise contracts with private independent contractors or grants (especially categorical grants) to state or local government agencies who are primarily responsible for providing services directly to the general public. In the 20th century, when the federal government began to provide funding and supervision for matters which were historically seen as the domain of state governments (i.e., education, health and welfare services, housing, and transportation), Congress frequently authorized only funding for grants which were voluntary, in the sense that state or local government agencies could choose to apply for such grants (and accept conditions attached by Congress) or they could decline to apply. In the case of HHS&#x27;s Medicare program, Congress chose to contract with private health insurers because they &quot;already possessed the requisite expertise for administering complex health insurance programs&quot;, and because American hospitals preferred to continue dealing with private insurers instead of a new federal bureaucracy.

<text>John Llewellyn Davies (25 May 1938 – 21 July 2003) was a New Zealand Olympic bronze medallist and president of the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC).

==Biography==
Davies was born in London, England, to Welsh parents, and in 1953 moved to New Zealand with his family. The family settled in Tokoroa. He won a bronze medal in the 1500 metres at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games, and a silver medal in the one mile event at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth.

Davies retired due to long-term injuries, and after that coached middle- and long-distance athletes, including 1976 Olympic 5000 m silver medallist Dick Quax, 1982 Commonwealth Games 3000m Gold Medalist Anne Audain who also broke the World 5000m record the same year. 1992 Olympic Marathon bronze medallist Lorraine Moller and 1996 Olympic 800 m finalist Toni Hodgkinson. He also contributed to sport as administrator and television commentator.

In the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Davies was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to athletics. In October 2000, Davies succeeded Sir David Beattie to become the NZOC president. In 2003 he was awarded the Leonard Cuff medal by the International Olympic Academy for promoting olympism, only weeks before he died of melanoma.

<doc id="274242" wikidata="Q6277211" url="?curid=274242" title="Jordanhill College">
<text>Jordanhill College of Education was a higher education college in Jordanhill, Glasgow, Scotland. It opened as a teacher training college in 1921. The college merged with the University of Strathclyde in 1993, becoming its Faculty of Education. In 2012 all educational activities were moved to the John Anderson Campus and the campus closed.

==History==

===Jordanhill Teacher Training College: 1913–1993===
In 1913 Glasgow Corporation agreed a deal to buy the Jordanhill Estate from James Parker Smith, the former Liberal Unionist MP for Partick, and build both a teacher training college and the associated Jordanhill School on the site. After the outbreak of World War I, developments for the teacher training college were put on hold, as the former manor house was taken over as a temporary military hospital.

After the cessation of hostilities, a new building was planned to provide teacher training. With the new school completed in 1920 and the college in 1921, the now Grade B listed David Stow Building facilitated all teacher training provided under the unified University of Glasgow. Centrally funded and with no ties with churches, the college was largely non-residential (two small hostels were built, one in 1921 and the second in 1931); and its range of work was wider.

From 1921 to 1959 the regime at the college changed very little. The Scottish Education Department (SED) authorised only a two-year course for primary teachers, and a one-year post-graduate course for secondary teachers. In addition the college provided in-service courses for qualified teachers. The only important changes both took place in 1931 when the two-year primary course was extended to three years (and limited exclusively to women), and the Scottish School of Physical Education (SSPE) was created to train all the male PE teachers in Scotland.

In 1959, SED approved a Board of Governors and the right for each college to award their own qualifications. In part this was because of expected teacher shortages in the 1960s, with 1,927 students in 1959–1960, the number grew to 2,813 in 1963–1964, reaching a peak of 3,713 in 1975–1976, making Jordanhill at that time the largest teacher training institution in Britain. This expansion far outstripped the capacity of the original 1921 Stow building and college (former manor house) building, and hence an extensive building programme which included the 1961 demolition of the original manor house had to be undertaken, to provide new accommodation (inter alia) for the SSPE and the School of Further Education. Part of the increase in student numbers was due to diversification. In 1964, the college began courses to train students for the youth and community service; in 1967 it began courses for social workers; in 1968 the Glasgow School of Speech Therapy moved to Jordanhill and became the Department of Speech Therapy; and in 1970 all the training of teachers for further education colleges in Scotland was centralised in a School of Further Education. In addition, in-service training expanded rapidly in response to the curriculum reform movements of the 1960s.

The period of expansion came to an abrupt end in 1976, when SED realised that there was an over supply of teachers. The smaller Hamilton College was closed in line with UK national policy, with most of its staff absorbed into Jordanhill. The 1980s brought about the degree level four year degree qualifications, and latterly accreditation under the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA), with all students hence following degree or post-graduate diploma courses which were externally validated.

===Faculty of Education, University of Strathclyde: 1993-2012===
Anticipating the end of its independence, in 1991 the college approached the University of Glasgow with a proposal that it should become its Faculty of Education. In 1993, SED escalated the need for a merger with publication of its policy document on funding via the new Higher Education Funding Council. The University of Strathclyde approached the college, and an agreement between both institutions was reached. In 1993 Jordanhill College became the University of Strathclyde Faculty of Education.

With better use of facilities, and an ageing campus at Jordanhill which was highly protected by preservation orders, in 2010 the decision was made to close Jordanhill campus and move all courses to its John Anderson Campus. The academic year 2011-2012 was the last before this move took place.

The archives of Jordanhill College are maintained by the Archives of the University of Strathclyde.

==Redevelopment==
Working with Glasgow City Council and Historic Scotland to prepare a plan for the future of the former campus, in March 2015 the university announced a plan to sell the residual estate via land agents JLL. The &quot;minded-to-grant&quot; planning permission in principle plans propose that:
*Three-storey David Stow building could be converted for up to 71 residential apartments
*Graham House and Douglas House could house up to 23 apartments each

The remaining 1960s buildings on the site are recommended for demolition, and then divided into 12 plots could be used to develop up to 364 further residential units.

<doc id="274244" wikidata="Q7235416" url="?curid=274244" title="Pottsylvania">
<text>Pottsylvania is a fictional country that appeared in the television series &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;, collectively referred to as &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;. Its name is a parody of the US State of Pennsylvania.

Pottsylvania is a parody of a Cold War-era eastern European country (possibly intended as a satire on East Germany: Pottsylvanian characters often use German words, and the Iron Cross can be seen on military aircraft). It was noted for being a nation dedicated to all matters related to espionage and deceitfulness; children were taught in schools how to commit crimes, for instance, while casual conversations would have double meanings.

Populated entirely by government agents and saboteurs, Pottsylvania is the one nation where the cold war never thawed. Its highest honor was the Double Cross, and its newspaper, &quot;The Pottsylvania Eavesdropper&quot;, was printed in invisible ink. While many considered Pottsylvania to be a spoof, it was considered offensive by the government of the Soviet Union, which banned &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; as anti-Soviet propaganda.

Pottsylvania&#x27;s industries, besides espionage, included production of a vehicle called the &quot;Assassin-8&quot;. Millions were built despite Pottsylvania having only 12 miles of road. The nation&#x27;s economy was almost non-existent, with no raw materials, consumer goods or cultural works to provide to the global economy, requiring the nation to use force and trickery to stay afloat. As described in &quot;Goof Gas Attack,&quot; Pottsylvania&#x27;s only actual product is &quot;mean.&quot; Thus, Fearless Leader reasons, &quot;We have more mean per square inch than other countries have in a square mile! We must &#x27;export mean&#x27; to every other country!&quot; (i.e., declare war). Unfortunately, they can&#x27;t even get &quot;that&quot; right. &quot;But &quot;anybody&quot; could beat us!&quot; his military commanders plead. &quot;Besides being mean, we&#x27;re all cowards!&quot;

Natural landmarks included &quot;Whynchatakea Peak&quot;, a large mountain. The geography of Pottsylvania varies widely from episode to episode, and even scene to scene; this was typical of the utter lack of regard for consistency that Gamma Productions, the low-budget Mexican studio responsible for animating the series, had shown throughout the show&#x27;s run. Sometimes it appears to be a peninsula, while in others it appears to be either a coastal nation (with seaports) or completely landlocked. Nevertheless, it is accessible by submarine, which appears to be the main form of entry.

Flora and fauna in Pottsylvania included the man-eating Venus flytrap-like plant known as the &quot;Pottsylvania Creeper,&quot; and one of the world&#x27;s few supplies of mooseberry bushes—mooseberries being an ingredient used (in Rocky and Bullwinkle&#x27;s world) for the production of rocket fuel.

The government of Pottsylvania had been headed by a uniformed dictator known as Fearless Leader and a clique of sycophantic advisers. (In some episodes, another important government figure is Mr. Big.) Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale seemed to be Fearless Leader&#x27;s most frequently used secret agents, often sent to execute the country&#x27;s schemes for gaining global power. This is mainly because, as Fearless Leader once remarked to Boris: &quot;You work cheap.&quot;

==National anthem==
&quot;Hail Pottsylvania&quot; is the national anthem of Pottsylvania, which appears in &quot;Missouri Mish Mash&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;.

Lyrics:&lt;poem&gt;
Hail, Pottsylvania
Hail to the black and the blue!
Hail, Pottsylvania
Sneaky and crooked through and through,
Down with the good guys, up with the boss
Under the sign of the triple cross, hey!
Hail, Pottsylvania,
Hail, hail, hail!&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="274246" wikidata="Q10353800" url="?curid=274246" title="Primacy of Ireland">
<text>The Primacy of Ireland belongs to the diocesan bishop of the Irish diocese with highest precedence. The Archbishop of Armagh is titled Primate of All Ireland and the Archbishop of Dublin Primate of Ireland, signifying that they are the senior clerics on the island of Ireland, the Primate of All Ireland being the more senior. The titles are used by both the Catholic Church in Ireland and Church of Ireland. &quot;Primate&quot; is a title of honour, and in the Middle Ages there was an intense rivalry between Armagh and Dublin as to seniority. The Archbishop of Armagh&#x27;s leading status is based on the belief that his see was founded by St. Patrick, making Armagh the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland. On the other hand, Dublin is the political, cultural, social, economic and secular centre of Ireland, and has been for many centuries, thus making the Archbishop of Dublin someone of considerable influence, with a high national profile. The dispute between the two archbishoprics was settled by Pope Innocent VI in 1353, with occasional brief controversy since. The distinction mirrors that in the Church of England between the Primate of All England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Primate of England, the Archbishop of York.

==Pre-Reformation==
The episcopal see of Dublin was created in the eleventh century, when Dublin was a Norse city state. Its first bishop, Dúnán (or Donatus), was described at his death as &quot;chief bishop of the Foreigners&quot;. From the first, Dublin had close ties to the see of Canterbury. The fifth bishop of Dublin, Gregory, was only a subdeacon when he was elected bishop by what Aubrey Gwynn called &quot;the Norse party in the city&quot;. He was sent to England where he was consecrated by Archbishop Ralph of Canterbury, but on his return, he was prevented from entering his see by those who wanted Dublin integrated with the Irish hierarchy. A compromise was reached by which Gregory was recognised as bishop of Dublin, while he in turn accepted the authority of Cellach, archbishop of Armagh, as primate. In 1152, the Synod of Kells divided Ireland between the four archdioceses of Armagh, Dublin, Cashel and Tuam. Gregory was appointed archbishop of Dublin. The papal legate, Cardinal John Paparo, also appointed the archbishop of Armagh &quot;as Primate over the other bishops, as was fitting.&quot;

Henry de Loundres, archbishop of Dublin from 1213 to 1228, obtained a bull from Pope Honorius III prohibiting any archbishop from having the cross carried before him (a symbol of authority) in the archdiocese of Dublin without the consent of the archbishop of Dublin. A century later, this bull led to a confrontation between Richard FitzRalph, archbishop of Armagh, and Alexander de Bicknor, archbishop of Dublin, when FitzRalph, acting on letters of King Edward III specifically allowing him to do so, entered Dublin in 1349 &quot;with the cross erect before him&quot;. He was opposed by the prior of Kilmainham on the instructions of Bicknor, and forced to withdraw to Drogheda. On Bicknor&#x27;s death, and the succession of John de St Paul to the see of Dublin, King Edward revoked his letters to FitzRalph and forbade the primate to exercise his jurisdiction in Dublin. In 1353 the matter was referred to Avignon. There Pope Innocent VI, acting on the advice of the College of Cardinals, ruled that &quot;each of these prelates should be Primate; while, for the distinction of style, the Primate of Armagh should entitle himself &quot;Primate of All Ireland&quot;, but the Metropolitan of Dublin should subscribe himself &quot;Primate of Ireland&quot;.&quot;

==Church of Ireland==
On 20 October 1551, the Protestant Edward VI and the Privy Council of England transferred the Anglican primacy from George Dowdall of Armagh to George Browne of Dublin, as the former opposed the Reformation in Ireland, which the latter advanced by introducing the 1549 Prayer Book and destroying the &quot;Bachal Isu&quot;, both a Catholic relic and a symbol of Armagh&#x27;s primacy. The Catholic Mary I on 12 October 1553, shortly after succeeding Edward, restored Dowdall and Armagh to primacy. In the 1630s, Lancelot Bulkeley of Dublin argued that Protestant Edward&#x27;s decree ought to be accepted and Catholic Mary&#x27;s annulled, but in 1634 the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, felt that without stronger evidence the primacy should remain with Armagh. The Church Temporalities Act 1833 reduced Tuam and Cashel and Emly from archdioceses to dioceses, leaving no archbishops other than the two primates.

==Catholic==
In 1672 Catholic archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin disputed the right of Oliver Plunkett of Armagh to preside at a synod in Dublin; Talbot claimed King Charles II had given him a Commission. Both wrote tracts supporting their claims, and appealed to the Pope in Rome. While John D&#x27;Alton accepted the assertion that Rome ruled in favour of Armagh, Tomás Ó Fiaich says no ruling was made. There was a further dispute in the 1720s when a Dublin priest, censured by his own archbishop, appealed to Hugh MacMahon of Armagh, who reversed the censure. Rome investigated but made no decision. In 1802, John Troy said that, to avoid controversy, neither archbishop exercised jurisdiction outside his own metropolitan province.

In 1852 archbishop Paul Cullen, the apostolic delegate to Ireland, was translated from Armagh to Dublin; his successor in Dublin, Edward MacCabe, was in 1882 made the first Irish cardinal in preference to Armagh&#x27;s Daniel McGettigan. In 1963 Tomás Ó Fiaich and William Conway suggested that the period of Cullen and MacCabe&#x27;s primacy was the only time during which &quot;the leadership of the Irish Church&quot; was in Dublin rather than Armagh; and the motivation was the necessity of close contact with the Dublin Castle administration in the period after Catholic Emancipation, especially until the controversy over control of education was eased by the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act 1878 and Royal University (1880). 

Since 1885, Irish voting members of the College of Cardinals have been archbishops of Armagh rather than Dublin, except when Desmond Connell was appointed in 2001 ahead of Seán Brady. This was somewhat unexpected, and attributed to Connell&#x27;s experience in the Roman Curia. The younger Brady was made a cardinal in 2007, by which time Connell had passed the 80-year age limit for voting that applies in the College.

<text>Ormsby County was a county in Nevada Territory from 1861 to 1864 and in the State of Nevada from 1864 until 1969. It contained Carson City, the county seat, and later, the state capital, founded two years earlier.

== Name ==
It was named after Major William Ormsby, one of the original settlers of Carson City, killed along with seventy-five other men in 1860, in an unsuccessful attempt to subdue a perceived uprising of Paiute people near Pyramid Lake, Nevada, which was at the time part of Utah Territory.

== History ==

Ormsby County was established in 1861 with creation of Nevada Territory. The county&#x27;s population dwindled significantly after the gold rush days. By the late 1940s, it was little more than Carson City and a few surrounding hamlets to the west. By the 1960 census, all but 2,900 of the county&#x27;s 8,300 residents lived in Carson City. Discussions began about merging Carson City with Ormsby County after World War II. However, the effort never got beyond the planning stages until 1966, when a statewide referendum formally approved the merger. The required constitutional amendment was passed in 1968. On April 1, 1969, Ormsby County and Carson City officially merged as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.
