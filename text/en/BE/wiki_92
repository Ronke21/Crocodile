<text>Dumnonia is the Latinised name for a Brythonic kingdom that existed in Sub-Roman Britain between the late 4th and late 8th centuries CE in the more westerly parts of present-day South West England. It was centred in the area of modern Devon, but also included modern Cornwall and part of Somerset, with its eastern boundary changing over time as the gradual westward expansion of the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex encroached on its territory. The spelling Damnonia is sometimes encountered, but that spelling is also used for the land of the Damnonii, later part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, in present-day southern Scotland.
The form Domnonia also occurs. The name of the kingdom shares a linguistic relationship with the Breton region of Domnonée ().

==Name==
The kingdom is named after the Dumnonii, a British Celtic tribe living in the south-west at the time of the Roman invasion of Britain, according to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. Variants of the name &quot;Dumnonia&quot; include &quot;Domnonia&quot; and &quot;Damnonia&quot;, the latter being used by Gildas in the 6th century as a pun on &quot;damnation&quot; to deprecate the area&#x27;s contemporary ruler Constantine. The name etymologically originates from Proto-Celtic &quot;*dubno-&quot; &#x27;(&quot;adjective&quot;) deep; (&quot;noun&quot;) world&#x27;. Groups with similar names existed in Scotland (&quot;Damnonii&quot;) and Ireland (&quot;Fir Domnann&quot;). Later, the area became known to the English of neighbouring Wessex as the kingdom of West Wales, and its inhabitants were also known to them as &quot;Defnas&quot; (i.e. men of Dumnonia). In Welsh, and similarly in the Southwestern Brythonic languages, it was &quot;Dyfneint&quot; and this is the form which survives today in the name of the county of Devon (Modern , , ).

There is evidence, based on an entry in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;, that there may have been a sub-tribe in the western part of the territory known as the Cornovii from whose name the first element of the present-day name of Cornwall is probably derived.

Following a period of emigration from south-western Britain to north-western Gaul (Armorica) in the 5th and 6th centuries, a sister kingdom (Domnonée in modern French), was established on the north-facing Atlantic coast of the continent in the region that was to become known as Brittany. Historian Barbara Yorke has speculated that the Dumnonii may have seen the end of the Roman empire as an opportunity to establish control in new areas.
Before the arrival of the Romans, the Dumnonii seem to have inhabited the south-west peninsula of Britain as far east as the River Parrett in Somerset and the River Axe in Dorset, judging by the coin distributions of the Dobunni and Durotriges. In the Roman period there was a provincial boundary between the area governed from Exeter and those governed from Dorchester and Ilchester. Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, Book III notes the close trading and military relationship between the continental Veneti of Armorica and the south-western insular British.

In the post Roman period the kingdom of Dumnonia covered Cornwall, Devon and parts of west Somerset. It had close cultural and religious links with Brittany, Wales and Ireland.

==Culture and industries==

The cultural connections of the pre-Roman Dumnonii, as expressed in their ceramics, are thought to have been with the peninsula of Armorica across the Channel, and with Wales and Ireland, rather than with the south-east of Britain. The people of Dumnonia would have spoken a Brythonic dialect, the ancestor of modern Cornish and Breton. Irish immigrants, the Déisi, are evidenced by the inscribed stones they have left behind—sometimes written in Ogham, sometimes in Latin, sometimes in both, confirmed and supplemented by place-name studies.

Apart from fishing and agriculture, the main economic resource of the Dumnonii was tin mining, the tin having been exported since ancient times from the port of &quot;Ictis&quot; (St Michael&#x27;s Mount or Mount Batten). Tin working continued throughout Roman occupation and appears to have reached a peak during the 3rd century CE. The area maintained trade links with Gaul and the Mediterranean after the Roman withdrawal, and it is likely that tin played an important part in this trade. Post-Roman imported pottery has been excavated from many sites across the region. An apparent surge in late-5th-century Mediterranean imports is thought to be related to the trade in metals from Cornwall and Wales to the Byzantine Empire.

Christianity seems to have survived in Dumnonia after the Roman departure from Britain, with a number of late Roman Christian cemeteries extending into the post-Roman period. In the 5th and 6th centuries the area was allegedly evangelised by the children of Brychan and saints from Ireland, like Saint Piran; and Wales, like Saint Petroc or Saint Keyne. There were important monasteries at Bodmin and Glastonbury; and also Exeter where 5th-century burials discovered near the cathedral probably represent the cemetery of the foundation attended by Saint Boniface (although whether this was Saxon or Brythonic is somewhat controversial). Sporadically, Cornish bishops are named in various records until they submitted to the See of Canterbury in the mid-9th century. Parish organisation was a later development of fully Normanised times.

==Settlements==

Around 55 CE, the Romans established a legionary fortress at &quot;Isca Dumnoniorum&quot;, modern Exeter, but west of Exeter the area remained largely un-Romanised. Most of Dumnonia is notable for its lack of a villa system – though there were substantial numbers south of Bath and around Ilchester –, and for its many settlements that have survived from the Romano-British period. As in other Brythonic areas, Iron Age hillforts, such as Hembury and Cadbury Castle, were refortified in post-Roman times for the use of chieftains or kings, and other high-status settlements such as Tintagel seem to have been reconstructed during the period. Local archaeology has revealed that the isolated enclosed farmsteads known locally as &quot;rounds&quot; seem to have survived the Roman departure from Britain; but they were subsequently replaced, in the 6th and 7th centuries, by unenclosed farms taking the Brythonic toponymic &quot;tre(f)-&quot;.

Exeter, called &quot;Caer Uisc&quot; in Brythonic, was later the site of an important Saxon minster, but was still partially inhabited by Dumnonian Britons until the 10th century when Æthelstan expelled them. By the mid-9th century, the royal seat may have been relocated further west, during the West Saxon advance, to &quot;Lis-Cerruyt&quot; (modern Liskeard). Cornish earls in the 10th century were said to have moved to Lostwithiel after Liskeard was seized. It has been suggested that the rulers of Dumnonia were itinerant, stopping at various royal residences, such as Tintagel and Cadbury Castle, at different times of the year, and possibly simultaneously holding lands in Brittany across the Channel. There is textual and archaeological evidence that districts such as Trigg were used as marshalling points for &quot;war hosts&quot; from across the region.

==History and rulers==

Although subjugated by about 78 CE, the local population could have retained strong local control, and Dumnonia may have been self-governed under Roman rule. Geoffrey of Monmouth stated that the ruler of Dumnonia, perhaps about the period 290 – 305, was Caradocus. If not an entirely legendary figure, Caradocus would not have been a king in the true sense but may have held a powerful office within the Roman administration.

The post-Roman history of Dumnonia comes from a variety of sources and is considered exceedingly difficult to interpret given that historical fact, legend and confused pseudo-history are compounded by a variety of sources in Middle Welsh and Latin. The main sources available for discussion of this period include Gildas&#x27;s &quot;De Excidio Britanniae&quot; and Nennius&#x27;s &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; and &quot;De Antiquitate Glastoniensis Ecclesiae&quot;, along with texts from the &quot;Black Book of Carmarthen&quot; and the &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, and Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; as well as &quot;The Descent of the Men of the North&quot; (&quot;Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd&quot;, in Peniarth MS 45 and elsewhere) and the &quot;Book of Baglan&quot;.

===Conflict with the Saxons===
In 577 Ceawlin of Wessex&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Deorham caused the Britons of Dumnonia to be cut off by land from their Welsh allies, but since sea travel was not difficult this may not have been a severe loss. Clemen is thought to have been king when the Britons fought the Battle of Beandun in 614. This is most likely to have been at Bindon near Axmouth in Devon. Bampton, Oxfordshire has also been proposed as the site, but the claim lacks evidence.

According to the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, attributed incorrectly to Matthew of Westminster, the Britons were still in possession of Exeter in 632, when it was bravely defended against Penda of Mercia until relieved by Cadwallon, who engaged and, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, defeated the Mercians with &quot;great slaughter to their troops&quot;. However, since the late 19th century this siege has not been considered a historical fact.

Around 652 Cenwalh of Wessex made a breakthrough against the Dumnonian defensive lines at the battle of Bradford-upon-Avon. The West Saxon victory at the Battle of &quot;Peonnum&quot; (possibly modern Penselwood in east Somerset), around 658, resulted in the Saxons capturing &quot;as far as the Parrett&quot; and the eastern part of Dumnonia being permanently annexed by Wessex.

The entry for 661 in Æthelweard&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; into Latin, known as the &quot;Chronicon Æthelweardi&quot;, describes Cenwalh of Wessex fighting a battle at &quot;Posentesburh&quot;. Though it appears from the context that this is a battle against Wulfhere of Mercia (which he may have lost), if &quot;Posentesburh&quot; is identified with Posbury, near Crediton, Devon, then some conflict with the Britons can be postulated. In Willibald&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Boniface&quot; the head of &quot;Examchester&quot; monastery, which can be identified with Exeter, Devon, has a Germanic name (Wulfhard) during the time Boniface studied there. Boniface self-identifies as Anglo-Saxon by birth (using &quot;Anglorum&quot; in his letter to the English people) and therefore Exeter may have been under West Saxon control at this time, that is, the late 7th century. At this time Dumnonia was sufficiently part of the known world for Aldhelm, later bishop of Sherborne, to address a letter around 705, to its king Geraint regarding the date of Easter. In 682 Wessex forces &quot;advanced as far as the sea&quot;, but it is unclear where this was. In 705 a bishopric was set up in Sherborne for the Saxon area west of Selwood.

In 710 Geraint was defeated in battle by King Ine of Wessex, but in 722 the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; claim a victory by the British in Cornwall at &quot;Hehil&quot;. By about 755, the territory of the &quot;&quot;Defnas&quot; was coming under significant pressure from the Saxon army. The campaigns of Egbert of Wessex in Devon between 813 and 822 probably signalled the conquest of insular Dumnonia leaving a rump state in what is today called Cornwall, known at the time as &quot;Cerniu&quot;, &quot;Cernyw&quot;, or &quot;Kernow&quot;, and to the Anglo-Saxons as Cornwall or &quot;West Wales&quot;.
In 825 a battle was fought between the &quot;Welsh&quot;&quot;, presumably those of Dumnonia, and the Anglo-Saxons. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states: &quot;We fought the &quot;Wealas&quot; (Cornish) and the &quot;Defnas&quot; (Devonians) at &quot;Gafulforda&quot; (perhaps Galford in west Devon). However, there is no mention of who won or who lost. A further rebellion in 838, when the &quot;West Welsh&quot;&quot; were supported by Danish forces, was crushed by Egbert at the battle of Hingston Down.

The Cornish bishop of Bodmin acknowledged the authority of Canterbury in 870 and the last-known Cornish king, Donyarth, died in 875. By the 880s Wessex had gained control of at least part of Cornwall, where Alfred the Great had estates. In about 936, according to William of Malmesbury writing around 1120, Athelstan evicted the Britons from Exeter and the rest of Devon, and set the east bank of the River Tamar as Cornwall&#x27;s border.

Although the chronology of Wessex expansion into all of Dumnonia is unclear, Devon had long been absorbed into England by the reign of Edward the Confessor. The early-12th-century &quot;Gesta Herewardi&quot; gives the King of Cornwall just before the Norman Conquest as a man named Alef.

===Dumnonian continuity in Cornwall and Brittany===
Two waves of migrations took place to Armorica (Brittany) from Dumnonia. Some histories propose the theory that this may have resulted in rulers who exercised kingship in both Brittany and Dumnonia, explaining those occurrences of the same names of rulers in both territories. There are also numerous correspondences of Insular Celtic saints, and place names and a close linguistic relationship between Cornish (&quot;Kernowek&quot;) and Breton (&quot;Brezhoneg&quot;). However, the Breton regions of &quot;Kernev&quot;/Cornouaille (Cornwall) and Domnonée (Devon) have well-established histories including entirely separate rulers from Dumnonia in Britain (see Duchy of Brittany).

While Cornwall retained its language and culture, Devon&#x27;s had significantly diminished by the arrival of the Saxon invaders in the 7th century, almost entirely due to the large-scale migration of Britons from greater Dumnonia to Armorica at the end of the Roman occupation. J.B. Gover wrote in 1931 thatby the middle of the seventh century Devon was a sparsely settled Celtic kingdom due to large-scale emigration to Armorica a century and more earlier, and that once the resistance of its kings had been broken down no considerable native population remained to complicate the life of the new settlers.The relationship between the new Saxon overlords and the remaining indigenous Britons appears to have been peaceable and many Celtic place-names survive in the county, although not to the extent of that of the neighbouring sub-tribe, the Cornovii, who became modern-day Cornwall.

The pre-medieval region of Cornouaille (Breton: &quot;Kernev&quot;) in the Brittany region of the Armorican peninsula is assumed to owe its name to descendants originating in insular Cornwall. The territories of the ancient Cornouaille region coincide mostly with the southern part of the French &quot;departement&quot; of the Finistère, and some of its territorial lands are included in the &quot;departements&quot; of Côtes d&#x27;Armor and Morbihan. At least part of the original territory associated with the pre-medieval Breton kingdom of &quot;Domnonea&quot;, coincides with the modern French department of Côtes-d&#x27;Armor.

There is debate about the location of Arthur&#x27;s supposed great victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, where the Britons fought off Anglo-Saxons. Most historians believe this battle, if it was historical, was fought outside the territory, at Bath, for instance. Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that Arthur&#x27;s final Battle of Camlann was fought in Cornwall: tradition points to Slaughterbridge, near Camelford, which itself has been claimed, without foundation, to be the location of Camelot.

<doc id="292075" wikidata="Q5044567" url="?curid=292075" title="Carol Smillie">
<text>Carol Patricia Smillie (born 23 December 1961) is a Scottish former television presenter, actress and model. Smillie became famous as a presenter on British TV during the 1990s and early 2000s. She was best known for assisting Nicky Campbell on the UK version of the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; between 1989 and 1994. Between 1996 and 2003, she was the main presenter on the BBC One home makeover show &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;.

After leaving the Glasgow School of Art, Smillie was a model throughout the 1980s. Her break in television came in 1989 when she auditioned for the role of hostess on &quot;Wheel of Fortune.&quot; After leaving the show in 1994, Smillie appeared on the BBC television channel, firstly as a reporter on &quot;The Travel Show&quot;, and then the &quot;Holiday&quot; show, eventually becoming the programme&#x27;s main presenter. The DIY programme &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; established her name and led to her presenting other primetime shows for the BBC, such as the &quot;National Lottery&quot; and her own morning chat show &quot;Smillie&#x27;s People&quot;.

In 2012 Smillie decided to leave mainstream TV and created a new business venture, launching a brand of leak-proof underwear for women, named DiaryDoll. This was later changed to Pretty Clever Pants. In 2018 Smillie relinquished control of her business, licensing the brand to the company High Street TV.

 Smillie is pursuing a career conducting humanist ceremonies, having qualified as a humanist celebrant with the Humanist Society Scotland.

==1961–1988: Early life and career beginnings==
Smillie was born on 23 December 1961, in Glasgow, Scotland, the daughter of Isobel and electrical engineer George Smillie. She has two older sisters and one older brother.

Smillie attended Simshill Primary School and the independent Hutchesons&#x27; Grammar School. She attained seven O-grades, including a qualification in fabric and fashion. She left the following year with three Highers. Five were required to be admitted into the Glasgow School of Art. Smillie ultimately obtained one each from Langside College and Cardonald College, thus completing the entry requirements.

At age 18, in 1979, Smillie embarked on her first year at the Glasgow School of Art, studying Art, Design, and Fashion, with the idea of becoming a fashion designer, but felt she didn&#x27;t really fit in with the typical punk students sporting green hair and pink shoes. To subsidise her studies, Smillie worked in a cocktail bar, modelling part-time, and eventually left to embark on a modelling career.

Smillie then joined the Best Modelling Agency, run by Fiona Best. Too short at for catwalk modelling, she booked photo shoots and promotions. Smillie worked for the agency throughout the 1980s. Smillie met her future husband, former model Alex Knight, through Fiona&#x27;s agency.

===Outside television===

====1982–2010: Model====
In her early years, Smillie worked the exhibition circuit and was an occasional lingerie model. Smillie was allegedly one of the Tennent&#x27;s Lager girls (a Scottish marketing promotion that put pictures of young women on the backs of cans of lager). Smillie denied having had this role in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper on 2 October 2006.

Smillie has continued to model occasionally since her rise to fame. Between 2007 and 2010 Smillie was the figurehead model for the Scottish company The Edinburgh Woollen Mill.

====1994 and 2009: Radio====

In June 2009, Smillie appeared in the BBC Radio Scotland comedy sketch show Ellis and Clarke. Smillie appeared in a number of sketches in the 30-minute production playing herself, in which she and the members of the cast parodied her television personality. The show was broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland on 5 June 2009.

On Bank Holiday 31 August 2009, Smillie hosted her own Radio show on 105.2 Smooth Radio, a Scottish Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Glasgow and the surrounding area.

====2003: Author====
In 2003, Smillie joined forces with Eileen Fursland to become a best selling author with the publication of &quot;Carol Smillie&#x27;s Working Mum&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. The book examined the practical problems and emotional issues that face women who go back to work. It considered work-life balance, time management, workplace rights to maternity leave and pay, tax credits.

Starting on 10 May 2008, Smillie co-wrote – with animal behaviourist Emma Magson – a weekly column in &quot;The Times&quot; entitled &#x27;Perfect Pets&#x27;. The column was featured in the Body and Soul section of the Saturday edition and lasted 10 weeks.

====2006–2011: Actress====

=====2006–2007 and 2010–2011: Stage actress=====
In February 2006, Smillie made her début on the stage in the Eve Ensler play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. She completed three tours of Scotland, appearing in Aberdeen, Ayr, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth.

In February to March 2010, Smillie appeared on stage in &quot;Hormonal Housewives&quot;, a new comedy written by Julie Coombe and John MacIsaac. Appearing alongside Smillie were the co-writer Julie Coombe and Shonagh Price. The comedy portrayed three women juggling a career, childcare and being a housewife. The play begins with the three women getting ready for a night out and then moves into a series of self-contained sketches. The finale features a medley of music by Kylie Minogue, Madonna and Cher. Smillie takes the part of Madonna, dancing and miming to the track &quot;Holiday&quot;, dressed in a pastiche outfit based on the Jean Paul Gaultier-designed conical bra corset, from the singer&#x27;s 1990 Blond Ambition tour. Smillie took the play on a three-week tour of Scotland performing at theatres in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness.

=====2008: Film Actress=====
In 2008, Smillie made her film debut in a short film entitled &quot;Infamy&quot; playing a television presenter named Joan. The story concerns a man who is so desperate to get on Reality TV that he will try anything, including ultimately, holding up a shop at gunpoint to make the local news.

====2012–2018: Entrepreneur====
=====2012–2018: DiaryDoll/Pretty Clever Pants=====
In October 2012, Smillie started her own business, DiaryDoll, with business partner and friend Annabel Croft, an ex-international tennis player. Together they created a range of women&#x27;s underwear specifically for use during periods, with a secret waterproof panel inside them to remove the possibility of leaks and stains on clothing and bedding. They were designed to look and feel like normal underwear – i.e. breathable, washable and not crackly – giving women the confidence to go about their usual activities. In 2014 DiaryDoll partnered with charity Endometriosis UK.

====2018–present: Humanist celebrant====
Smillie is a humanist. In 2018 she became an accredited humanist celebrant with the Humanist Society Scotland, and began to conduct humanist ceremonies.

==Personal life==
Smillie lives in Glasgow with husband Alex Knight, a restaurateur, whom she married in August 1991. They have three children.

Smillie&#x27;s smile was caricatured by the British impressionist Ronni Ancona in the UK television show &quot;Big Impression&quot;. Ancona&#x27;s impression of Smillie used the catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;m Smiley Smiley Carol Smillie&quot;.

==Charity work==
Smillie is involved with several charities, primarily ones concerned with child welfare. One of her main charities is The Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice (PPWH). She hosts &#x27;A Little Less Strictly Come Dancing&#x27; Ball for them every year alongside Angus Purden. Smillie was a contestant on the British television game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; supporting the charity NSPCC. She appeared on the show with Michael Aspel. They failed to progress past the £16,000 mark when they missed the question about authors, dropping to £1,000.

=== Trustee ===
Smillie is trustee to a number of Glasgow institutions. These include Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, where she is on the board as trustee of The Kelvingrove Refurbishment Appeal (KRA). This is an independent trust established to raise £5 million in sponsorship and donations towards the £27.9million refurbishment of Kelvingrove. She became a board member and Trustee for The Riverside Museum.

She supports the Glasgow School of Art, as a former and current student of the School’s Continuing Education Programme. Smillie is a member of the Mackintosh Conservation and Access Project team. In July 2007 she launched The Digital MacIntosh Project to raise funds for the restoration and refurbishment of the MacIntosh Building, which houses the school.

==Mensa==
When Smillie was hosting &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in the early 1990s, she was invited to take the Mensa test for high IQs by a tabloid newspaper, to prove that game show hostesses were not stupid. She said she had passed with an IQ of 148. She courted controversy in 2003, when she announced in an interview that she had cheated on the test. She admitted that the test was not taken under exam conditions, and she completed only two thirds of it, coming unstuck at the end. Smillie had phoned a friend to complete the remainder of the test. She said, &quot;I felt slightly guilty at the time, but it hadn&#x27;t really bothered me that I had cheated because it was never a real test to me, and Mensa had never invited me to take part.&quot;

<doc id="292079" wikidata="Q824249" url="?curid=292079" title="Veles (god)">
<text>Veles, also known as Volos, is a major god of earth, waters, livestock, and the underworld in Slavic paganism. His mythology and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of (among other deities) Odin, Loki, and Hermes.

According to reconstruction by some researchers, he is the opponent of the supreme thunder god Perun. As such he probably has been imagined as a dragon, which in the belief of the pagan Slavs is a chimeric being resembling a cross between a bear and a snake that devours livestock. His tree is the willow, while that of Perun is the oak.
No direct accounts survive, but reconstructionists speculate that he may directly continue aspects of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon with the original deity Welnos. 

==Sources==
Veles is one of few Slavic gods for which evidence of offerings can be found in all Slavic nations. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, a historical record of the early Kievan Rus, is the earliest and most important record, mentioning a god named Volos several times. Here, Volos is mentioned as god of cattle and peasants, who will punish oath-breakers with diseases, the opposite of Perun who is described as a ruling god of war who punishes by death in battle. In the later half of the 10th century, Veles or Volos was one of seven gods whose statues Vladimir I of Kiev had erected in his city. It is very interesting that Veles&#x27; statue apparently did not stand next to others, on the hill where the prince&#x27;s castle was, but lower in the city, in the marketplace. Not only does this indicate that Veles was connected with commerce, but it also shows that worship of Perun and Veles had to be kept separate: while it was proper for Perun&#x27;s shrines to be built high, on the top of the hill, Veles&#x27; place was down, in the lowlands.

A similar pattern can be observed among the South Slavs. Here the name of Veles appears only in toponyms, the best-known of which is the city of Veles in Macedonia, over which looms a hill of St. Elias the Thunderer. Also, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a part of Sarajevo is called Velešići and a mountain Velež near Mostar, Herzegovina. Other examples are Veles in Western Serbia, Velesnica on the Danube and Velestovo in Montenegro and also the township of Velestino (Βελεστίνο, today Φέρες), apparently bearing testimony to a Slavic layer in the settlement of Thessaly. Another debatable if not improbable example is the town of Volosko in Croatia, situated on the seashore under the peak of Mount Učka, nicknamed Perun.

Among Western Slavs, the name can be principally found in 15th and 16th century Czech records, where it means either dragon or devil.

==Etymology==

Presumably it is not possible to conclusively determine a definite etymology for the name of the god Veles, though there are several Proto-Indo-European roots that are all closely related to the nature of Veles and his domains. Further complicating matters is the presence of Lithuanian &quot;vėlės&quot;, which Fraenkel claims is unrelated to the Slavic term. Moreover, it remains to be determined what the original shape of the lemma was in early Slavic, which obfuscates its history and linguistic relationships.

One possibility is that the name derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*wel-&quot;, meaning wool. This seems plausible, since in Slavic cosmology Veles in serpentine form is lying in a nest of black wool in the roots of the Tree of the World and Veles is the shepherd of the dead. &quot;Volos&quot; is also the Russian and Ukrainian word for &quot;hair&quot; and Veles is hairy in his beastly form (bear, wolf). However, since the early 20th century, since the advent of Proto-Indo-European laryngeal theory, the &#x27;wool&#x27; word has been reconstructed as *h2wĺ̥h1neh2.

The Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*welg-&quot; also means &#x27;humid, wet&#x27;. Nothing is more connected with Veles than humidity and wetness. His domain is down, &#x27;у воду пот корч пот колоду&#x27; (&quot;in the water, below the tree stump and the log&quot;). However, this etymology can be discounted, as there is no velar in Veles.

There is also the Indo-European word &quot;*woltus&quot; meaning &#x27;meadow&#x27; which is derived from the same root. Accordingly, Veles is the shepherd of the dead who was imagined to browse the deceased on green lush meadows in the underworld.

The name is also related to Slavic terminology for oxen, for which the South Slavs, Russians, and Poles use &quot;вол/vol/wół&quot;. Volos can also be a derivation from the same root by Eastern Slavic phonetic laws, now considered the most probable explanation for this phonetic form.

Veles is presumed to be or to represent the same figure as Vala, the enemy of the Vedic thunder god Indra. Other scholarship suggests a closer connection to characters of Baltic mythology, such as &quot;Velnias&quot;, &quot;Velns&quot; (Latvian) or &quot;Vėlinas&quot; (Lithuanian), a devil-like entity and enemy of the Baltic thunder-god Perkūnas (cf. Slavic &quot;Perun&quot;). Scholar Marija Gimbutas cited &quot;related&quot; etymons: Lithuanian &quot;veles&quot; &#x27;shades of the dead&#x27; and Latvian &quot;Vels&quot; &#x27;god of the underworld&#x27;, which seem to indicate Veles&#x27;s connection to the underworld. An ancient Russian word, &quot;Vlasezhelische&quot;, probably refers to the place where Veles dwells, &quot;the underground kingdom or an entrance to it&quot;.

==Enemy of Perun and storm myth==
The Russian philologists Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov reconstructed the mythical battle of Perun and Veles through comparative study of various Indo-European mythologies and a large number of Slavic folk stories and songs. A unifying characteristic of all Indo-European mythologies is a story about a battle between a god of thunder and a huge serpent or a dragon. In the Slavic version of the myth, Perun is a god of thunder while Veles acts as a dragon who opposes him, consistent with the Vala etymology; he is also similar to the Etruscan underworld monster Vetha and to the dragon Illuyankas, enemy of the storm god of Hittite mythology.

The reason for the enmity between the two gods is Veles&#x27;s theft of Perun&#x27;s son, wife, or, usually, cattle. It is also an act of challenge: Veles, in the form of a huge serpent, slithers from the caves of the underworld and coils up the Slavic world tree towards Perun&#x27;s heavenly domain. Perun retaliates and attacks Veles with his lightning bolts. Veles flees, hiding or transforming himself into trees, animals or people. In the end, he is killed by Perun and in this ritual death, whatever Veles stole is released from his battered body in the form of rain falling from the skies. This &quot;storm myth&quot;, or &quot;divine battle&quot;, as it is generally called by scholars today, explained to ancient Slavs the changing of seasons through the year. The dry periods were interpreted as the chaotic results of Veles&#x27; thievery. Storms and lightning were seen as divine battles. The ensuing rain was the triumph of Perun over Veles and the re-establishment of world order. On a deeper level, as has been said above, Perun&#x27;s place is up, high and dry and Veles&#x27; down, low and wet. By climbing up into the sphere of Perun, Veles disrupts the equilibrium of the world and needs to be put in his place. Perun achieves this in a fierce battle, smiting his adversary with lightning and driving him back down into his proper place, the watery realm lying beneath the roots of the cosmic tree (axis mundi). Order thus restored, the two gods cease hostilities until the next time that Veles tries to crawl up into Perun&#x27;s realm.

The myth was cyclical, repeating itself each year. The death of Veles was never permanent; he would reform himself as a serpent who would shed its old skin and would be reborn in a new body. Although in this particular myth he plays a negative role as bringer of chaos, Veles was not seen as an evil god by ancient Slavs. In fact, in many of the Russian folk tales, Veles, appearing under the Christian guise of Saint Nicholas, saves the poor farmer and his cattle from the furious and destructive Elias the Thunderer, who represents Perun.
The duality and conflict of Perun and Veles does not represent the dualistic clash of good and evil; rather, it is the opposition of the natural principles of earth and water (Veles) against heaven/sky and fire (Perun).

The Ivanov/Toporov conception of &quot;the key myth&quot; of Slavic mythology has been criticized by several authors, including Leo Klejn and Igor M. Diakonoff. Many, including Klejn, pointed out that Ivanov and Toporov often tended toward unjustified generalizations and considered many of their arguments &quot;far-fetched&quot;. Supporters of the theory, on the other hand, include Boris Uspensky, T. Sudnik and T. Tsivyan, and others.

==God of magic and musicians==
According to Ivanov and Toporov, Veles&#x27; portrayal as having a penchant for mischief is evident both from his role in the storm myth and in carnival customs of Koledari shamans. In his role as a trickster god, he is in some ways similar to both Greek Hermes and Scandinavian Loki. He was connected with magic. The word &quot;volhov&quot;, obviously derived from his name, in some Slavic languages still means sorcerer while in the 12th century Ruthenian epic The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign, the character of Boyan the wizard is called Veles&#x27; grandson. Veles was also believed to be protector of travelling musicians. For instance, in some wedding ceremonies of northern Croatia (which continued up to the 20th century), the music would not start playing unless the bridegroom, when making a toast, spilled some of the wine on the ground, preferably over the roots of the nearest tree. The symbolism of this is clear, even though forgotten long ago by those still performing it: the musicians will not sing until a toast is made to their patron deity.

==Post-Christian Veles==
After the advent of Christianity, Veles was split into several different characters. As a god of the underworld and dragons, he became identified with the Devil. His more benevolent sides were transformed to several Christian saints. As a protector of cattle, he became associated with Saint Blaise, popularly known among various Slavic nations as St. Vlaho, St. Blaz, or St. Vlasiy (Armenian: Սուրբ Վլասի; germ: Blasius; fr: Blaise; sp: San Blas; port: São Brás; it: San Biagio; Croat: sv. Blaž; eng: Blase; Greek: Άγιος Βλάσιος). In Yaroslavl, for example, the first church built on the site of Veles&#x27;s pagan shrine was dedicated to St Blaise, for the latter&#x27;s name was similar to Veles and he was likewise considered a heavenly patron of shepherds. As mentioned already, in many Eastern Slavic folk tales, he was replaced by St. Nicholas, probably because the popular stories of the saint describe him as a giver of wealth and a sort of trickster.

<doc id="292080" wikidata="Q2939864" url="?curid=292080" title="Carol Vorderman">
<text>Carol Jean Vorderman (born 24 December 1960) is a Welsh broadcaster, media personality, and writer. Her media career began when she joined the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot;, appearing with Richard Whiteley from 1982 until his death in 2005, and subsequently with Des Lynam and Des O&#x27;Connor, before leaving in 2008.

While appearing on &quot;Countdown&quot;, Vorderman began presenting shows for ITV, including &quot;How 2&quot; (1990–1996), &quot;Better Homes&quot; (1999–2003) and &quot;The Pride of Britain Awards&quot; (1999–present), as well as guest hosting shows, such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (2004–2006) and &quot;The Sunday Night Project&quot; (2006). She was a presenter on the ITV talk show &quot;Loose Women&quot; from 2011 until 2014. She has also appeared as a contestant on reality shows, including &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2004), &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Great Celebrity Bake-Off&quot; (2020), winning the last. Since 2022, Vorderman has been a news-reviewer for &quot;This Morning&quot;.

Vorderman was honoured as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to broadcasting in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours in June 2000. She has also worked as a newspaper columnist and nominal author of educational and diet books. In 2023, Vorderman began presenting her own show for the talk radio station LBC, but has since stepped down from presenting regularly on the station.

==Early life and education==
Vorderman was born on 24 December 1960 (Christmas Eve) in Bedford, Bedfordshire, the youngest of three children of a Dutch father, Anton Vorderman (1920–2007), and a Welsh mother, Edwina Jean Davies (1928–2017). Her parents separated three weeks after her birth, and her mother took the family back to her home town of Prestatyn, Flintshire, North Wales, where Vorderman and her brother and sister grew up. Vorderman did not see her father again until she was 42. In 1970, her mother remarried, separating ten years later. Vorderman&#x27;s father remarried; his wife died in the early 1990s.

Vorderman was educated at Blessed Edward Jones Catholic High School in nearby Rhyl. In 1978, aged 17, she began studying engineering at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. She left with a third-class degree, a result which she has described as having been &quot;disappointing&quot;. Vorderman did not trace the Dutch side of her family until 2007 (as part of the BBC genealogy programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;). It was only then that she discovered that her father had been an active member of the Dutch resistance during the Nazi occupation. He died while the programme was being filmed. Her great-grandfather Adolphe Vorderman played a key role in the discovery of vitamins.

==Early career==
Vorderman initially found employment as a junior civil engineer at Dinorwig Power Station in Llanberis, Wales, and later as a graduate management trainee in Leeds. In her spare time, she was briefly a backing singer with friend Lindsay Forrest in the Leeds-based pop group Dawn Chorus and the Blue Tits, fronted by radio DJ Liz Kershaw during the early 1980s.

The group recorded, among other songs, a version of The Undertones&#x27; hit &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; (one of the tracks Vorderman had to identify during the &quot;intros round&quot; when she appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in December 2009; the series often includes questions from contestants&#x27; pasts). 

During 1984–85, Vorderman made regular appearances on the Peter Levy show on Radio Aire, appearing mid-morning to read a story for pre-school children. In the mid-1980s, Vorderman worked part-time in the Information Services Department of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, principally in the production of in-house video programmes.

==Television career==

===&quot;Countdown&quot;===
====1982–2008====
Vorderman&#x27;s mother noticed an advertisement in &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; asking for &quot;a woman with good mathematical skills&quot; to appear as co-host on a quiz show for the fledgling fourth terrestrial channel. She submitted an application on behalf of her daughter, then aged 21. Vorderman appeared on &quot;Countdown&quot; from the show&#x27;s inception in 1982 until 2008.

Initially, Vorderman&#x27;s only contribution to the show was the numbers game, and she formed part of a five-person presentation team, billed as one of the &quot;vital statisticians&quot; along with Linda Barrett. However, over the following years, the team was pared down, and Vorderman began handling tiles for both the letters and numbers games. Vorderman thus became a new type of game show hostess, revealing her intellectual ability by carrying out fast and accurate arithmetic calculations during the numbers game to reach an exact solution if neither contestant was able to do so. Her lasting success on the show led to her becoming one of the highest-paid women in Britain, ultimately earning her an estimated £1 million per year.

====After Richard Whiteley====
In June 2005, the producers of &quot;Countdown&quot; asked Vorderman if she wanted to fill the role of main presenter vacated by the recently deceased Richard Whiteley. Vorderman declined, and a search for a new presenter began while the show went into a four-month hiatus. In October 2005, Des Lynam replaced Whiteley and co-hosted with Vorderman. In January 2007, Des O&#x27;Connor replaced Lynam while Vorderman continued to co-host the show. On 25 July 2008, after 26 unbroken years with the show, it was announced that Vorderman was stepping down from &quot;Countdown&quot;. She later said she had resigned after failing to agree terms for a new contract, and it was reported that she had been asked to take a cut of 90% from her previous salary, estimated as £900,000. She had considered leaving the show when the show&#x27;s original host Richard Whiteley died in 2005, but remained on the show when Lynam took over, and until 2008 when his eventual replacement O&#x27;Connor announced he was also to step down as the show&#x27;s host. Vorderman and O&#x27;Connor both left the show in December 2008.

Vorderman recorded her last &quot;Countdown&quot; show on 13 November 2008 which was broadcast on 12 December 2008. Both of her children were in the audience, together with many of the previous guests from &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot;. After the prizegiving at the end of the show, Des O&#x27;Connor was presented with a bouquet of flowers by the show&#x27;s lexicographer Susie Dent, and Vorderman received one from Gyles Brandreth. She was too moved to complete her farewells. A special show, &quot;One Last Consonant, Please Carol&quot;, hosted by Brandreth and featuring Vorderman&#x27;s highs and lows during the 26 years of the show, was also filmed and transmitted just before her final &quot;Countdown&quot; appearance. 

After leaving &quot;Countdown,&quot; Vorderman continued to contribute her column to the British magazine &quot;Reveal&quot;. Channel 4 admitted in 2009 that all &quot;Countdown&quot; presenters had always worn earpieces, and that producers would &quot;sometimes supply extra ideas as there are often multiple options to ensure viewers are given the best possible answers.&quot; A source close to Vorderman denied that she had worn an earpiece or cheated in her mental arithmetic answers.

===&quot;Loose Women&quot;===

In July 2011, Vorderman and Sally Lindsay were tipped for roles on &quot;Loose Women&quot; following ITV&#x27;s decision to axe Kate Thornton and Zoë Tyler from the programme. This was later confirmed, with Vorderman presenting her first live show on 5 September 2011. From September 2011 to June 2013, Vorderman and fellow &quot;Loose Women&quot; host Andrea McLean hosted two to three shows per week. However, after the show returned from its summer break in September 2013, she began to host one episode per week, with McLean anchoring the remaining four. On 3 October 2013, it was announced that former &quot;Loose Women&quot; presenter Kaye Adams would be returning to the show later in the year and Ruth Langsford would join the panel in January 2014. Adams, Langsford and Andrea McLean hosted the show in rotation, with Vorderman remaining as an occasional presenter on the programme, usually presenting one episode a fortnight.

On 14 July 2014, Vorderman announced her departure as a presenter on &quot;Loose Women&quot;. Vorderman explained:

===Other television work===
Vorderman is the presenter of the annual Pride of Britain Awards, which are televised by ITV. She began hosting the awards when they were introduced in 1999. In 2004, Vorderman took part in the second series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Paul Killick. She was the second celebrity to be eliminated from the show. She guest presented &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in 2004 and 2006 and also presented an episode of &quot;The Sunday Night Project&quot;. Vorderman guest presented 15 episodes of &quot;Lorraine&quot; in 2011. She presented the ITV Food show &quot;Food Glorious Food&quot; in 2013. In March 2013, Vorderman recorded an ITV gameshow pilot called &quot;Revolution&quot;. On 29 June 2013, it was announced that the show had been &quot;scrapped&quot; by ITV.

In 2016, Vorderman finished in eighth place in the sixteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; On 7 April 2020, Vorderman appeared on &quot;The Great Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off&quot; and won. Broadcast on S4C on 19 April 2020, Vorderman took part in the show (&#x27;Language Road Trip&#x27;) and, with the help of Owain Wyn Evans, learned Welsh and completed various challenges in the language. An extra episode, (&#x27;Language Road Trip: Christmas&#x27;) was broadcast at the end of 2020, interviewing each of the celebrities about whether they were still making use of their Welsh and the opportunities they had had to use Welsh during lockdown.

In 2023, Vorderman appeared in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... South Africa&quot;. On 16 June 2023, she appeared as herself in Episode 1 of the BBC One comedy Queen of Oz. Vorderman is seen and heard on her radio programme questioning the outrageous antics of spoiled spare to the British crown, Princess Georgiana, played by Catherine Tate.

===Filmography===
====Television====
==Radio==

After leaving the BBC in 2023, Vorderman was an occasional guest host on LBC. In January 2024, two months after her BBC departure, she was to present her own show from 4pm to 7pm on Sunday afternoons. She said &quot;I&#x27;ll be using my voice – as you might expect – to cause a commotion. I won&#x27;t be shy to say things that others won&#x27;t and I&#x27;ll hold the corrupt to account without fear or favour.&quot; Vorderman announced on 11 October 2024 that she would leave LBC following a &#x27;health scare&#x27;.

==Other work==

===Journalism===
Vorderman has had newspaper columns in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on Internet topics. She has written books on Detox diets. Her No. 1 bestseller was &quot;Detox For Life&quot;, produced in collaboration with Ko Chohan and Anita Bean and published by Virgin Books, which sold over a million copies. Many school textbooks have been published under her name, chiefly by Dorling Kindersley in series such as &quot;English Made Easy&quot;, &quot;Maths Made Easy&quot;, &quot;Science Made Easy&quot; and &quot;How To Pass National Curriculum Maths&quot;.

===Commercial ventures===
Vorderman expanded her business ventures, launching a number of Sudoku products. In March 2007, she launched a brain-training game called &quot;Carol Vorderman&#x27;s Mind Aerobics&quot; together with BSkyB. Also in 2007, she released a video game for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable in the United States entitled &quot;Carol Vorderman&#x27;s Sudoku&quot;. In 2007, Vorderman did TV commercials for the frozen food chain Farmfoods – advertising &quot;Chippy Chips for £1&quot; and &quot;Cadbury&#x27;s Cones for 99p&quot;.

In the autumn of 2008, soon after she completed her final regular &quot;Countdown&quot; show, Vorderman announced a new commercial venture, her own property development and sales company that would specialise in overseas holiday and retirement homes in the Caribbean, the Bahamas and Spain. It was called Carol Vorderman Overseas Homes Limited. She saw the company as a natural extension of her own experiences in buying and selling properties over recent years and was aiming at a target market of &quot;families aged 35 plus&quot;. However, because of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the venture proved short-lived. During March 2009 Vorderman publicly withdrew her name from the firm, which suspended trading soon afterwards. On 2 March 2010, Vorderman publicly launched her new commercial venture of an online mathematics coaching system for 4- to 12-year-old children under the name of the MathsFactor.

===Endorsement controversy===
Vorderman had maintained a long-standing endorsement of the debt consolidation company FirstPlus, an association that ceased in 2007. In 2006, the charity Credit Action attempted to highlight the potential dangers of debt consolidation, calling on Vorderman to stop giving First Plus credibility. Her agent responded that Vorderman had no intention of curtailing the contract for a service which was perfectly legal and offered by an excellent company. When interviewed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in November 2008 Vorderman herself responded with:&quot;The secured loans market was criticised and it was pertinent to pick me out, because I was a face. I advertised FirstPlus for 10 years. We had something like £1.5billion out on loan and until a matter of months ago there were no repossessions. When that programme [BBC&#x27;s Real Story] was made, [there were] no repossessions. Did they say that? Funnily enough, no.&quot;

===Other activities===

On 18 September 2010, Vorderman, a Catholic, co-presented events leading up to the Papal Vigil in Hyde Park, alongside author Frank Cottrell Boyce. On 2 June 2012, Vorderman named a Class 91 (91110) &quot;Battle of Britain Memorial Flight&quot; at the National Railway Museum as part of the Railfest 2012 Event. In 2014, Vorderman qualified for a private pilot&#x27;s licence and announced that she planned to fly solo around the world. She named her plane &quot;Mildred&quot; after Mildred, Mrs Victor Bruce, a British record-breaking racing motorist, speedboat racer and aviator in the 1920s and 1930s, who Vorderman has described as &quot;my heroine. She&#x27;s one of the most incredible women of the last century&quot;.

On 20 November 2014, Vorderman accepted the appointment of ambassador to the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, and was granted the honorary rank of group captain in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch). In 2017, her honorary commission was extended to 19 November 2020. Vorderman has also taken up learning the Welsh language and has been using the Say Something in Welsh online course. In early 2020, she said &quot;I&#x27;ve been learning Welsh ... and I love it. It&#x27;s taken me back to my roots&quot;.

==Personal life==
Vorderman is a Catholic. She was first married in 1985 at age 24 to Christopher Mather, a Royal Navy officer, but the marriage lasted only twelve months. Her second marriage was to management consultant Patrick King in 1990 at the age of 30. Vorderman had two children with King, Katie (b. 1992) and Cameron (born 1997); the couple separated in 2000.

After meeting at a Christmas party in 1999, Vorderman and Des Kelly lived together in London from 2001, also using their other house in Glandore, West Cork, Ireland. After five years together, Vorderman and Kelly separated in December 2006, publicly announcing the amicable split in January 2007, and after a brief reconciliation in Bristol, according to reports.

, Vorderman shares her Bristol home with her two children. Vorderman lived with or very near to her mother all her life, until her mother&#x27;s death in 2017. On 6 June 2020, she complained in a number of UK newspapers of being harassed by photographers in the road outside her home. Vorderman in 2022 declared a lack of interest in traditional monogamy, preferring to have &quot;special friends&quot; with benefits.

=== Political views ===
In 2009, Vorderman mocked the Labour Party&#x27;s education policies, as part of her work heading a task force established by the Conservative Party to look at the teaching of mathematics. David Cameron commented, &quot;Carol has got a passion for maths. We have all seen that on &quot;Countdown&quot; with her brilliant mental arithmetic and she is going to lead this task force so we can get the answers right.&quot; In an appearance on &quot;Question Time&quot; in March 2010, Vorderman was critical of all three major parties for hypocrisy in taking donations from non-domiciled taxpayers.
In 2023, Vorderman was critical of the Conservative administration, labelling it a &quot;despicable government&quot;, and described herself as being politically independent. In 2022, Vorderman was praised by &quot;The Herald&quot; as the &quot;real leader of the opposition&quot; after criticising members of the government for exploiting their positions for personal gain.

In November 2023, the BBC objected to Vorderman&#x27;s social media postings reflecting her personal opinions; she said that she would &quot;not be silenced&quot; by the BBC&#x27;s new social media guidelines, and resigned from her weekly BBC Radio Wales show. She immediately made several posts criticising several people and policies of the Conservative government in power at the time. She has referred to the government as &quot;a lying bunch of greedy, corrupt, destructive, hateful, divisive, gaslighting crooks&quot;. In late 2023, she became the face of tactical voting initiative &quot;StopTheTories.vote&quot;.

In August 2024 she delivered the Alternative MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh Television Festival, saying &quot;Our industry is [full] of snobbery – regional snobbery, class snobbery and educational snobbery – and don&#x27;t even get me started on the political issues...Working class people feel they are not represented, their situation is not represented, the lack of opportunities and lack of money and jobs is not represented...What [social media] gives everyone, in towns and cities outside the wealthy south-east, the opportunity to do, is to see and hear views they recognise, in language they recognise.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
Vorderman was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to broadcasting in the 2000 Birthday Honours. She was elected an Honorary Fellow of Bangor University in North Wales and, in 2000, received an Honorary MA from the University of Bath.

Vorderman was voted UK Female Rear of the Year in 2011. In 2014, she became the first celebrity to win the award twice. In November 2021, she was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Institution of Engineering and Technology in recognition of her outstanding contribution to the engineering profession.

==Charity work==

Vorderman is a patron of the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) (her older brother, Anton, was born with a cleft lip and palate). In 2005, she was the winner of &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;. As part of its 50th anniversary celebrations ITV ran a series of the nation&#x27;s favourite game shows featuring celebrities competing to become Gameshow Marathon winner and raise money for the charity of their choice. As series winner Vorderman won £60,000 for CLAPA. In November 2011, she appeared in the music video in aid of CLAPA for New Vorder&#x27;s &quot;Carol O Carol&quot;, a song written by Jim Salveson in 1999 about his love for Vorderman, and directed by Tim Cocker.

Vorderman appeared in a short film, &quot;Run for the future&quot;, promoting prostate cancer awareness, and took part in a charity run held every year on the Bristol Downs to raise funds for the BUI prostate appeal. She also took part in the Great North Run on several occasions, to raise money for Marie Curie Cancer Care in memory of Richard Whiteley&#x27;s sister Helen, who died of cancer. Vorderman is an active supporter and advocate of the RAF Association charity, appearing at airshows and taking part in other fundraising events.

<text>James Burnham (November 22, 1905 – July 28, 1987) was an American philosopher and political theorist. He chaired the New York University Department of Philosophy.

His first book was &quot;An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis&quot; (1931). Burnham became a prominent Trotskyist activist in the 1930s. His most famous book, &quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot; (1941), speculated on the future of an increasingly proceduralist hence sclerotic society. A year before he wrote the book, he rejected Marxism and became an influential theorist of the political right as a leader of the American conservative movement. Burnham was an editor and a regular contributor to William F. Buckley&#x27;s conservative magazine &quot;National Review&quot; on a variety of topics. He rejected containment of the Soviet Union and called for the rollback of communism worldwide.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 22, 1905, James Burnham was the son of Claude George Burnham, an English immigrant and executive with the Burlington Railroad. James was raised as a Roman Catholic but rejected Catholicism as a college student, professing atheism for the rest of his life. He graduated at the top of his class at Princeton University before attending Balliol College, Oxford, where his professors included J. R. R. Tolkien and Martin D&#x27;Arcy. In 1929, he became a professor of philosophy at New York University.

In 1934, he married Marcia Lightner.

===Trotskyism===
In 1933, along with Sidney Hook, Burnham helped to organize the American Workers Party led by the Dutch-born pacifist minister A. J. Muste. Burnham supported the 1934 merger with the Communist League of America which formed the US Workers Party. In 1935, he allied with the Trotskyist wing of that party and favored fusion with the Socialist Party of America. During this period, he became a friend to Leon Trotsky. Writing for &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, Burnham was also an important influence on writers including Dwight Macdonald and Philip Rahv. However, Burnham&#x27;s engagement with Trotskyism was short-lived: from 1937 a number of disagreements came to the fore.

In 1937, the Trotskyists were expelled from the Socialist Party, an action which led to the formation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) at the end of the year. Inside the SWP, Burnham allied with Max Shachtman in a faction fight over the position of the SWP&#x27;s majority faction, led by James P. Cannon and backed by Leon Trotsky, defending the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers state against the incursions of imperialism. Shachtman and Burnham, especially after witnessing the Nazi–Soviet pact of 1939 and the invasions of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime, as well as the Soviet invasion of Finland in November 1939, came to contend that the USSR was a new form of imperialistic class society and was thus not worthy of even critical support from the socialist movement.

In February 1940 he wrote &quot;Science and Style: A Reply to Comrade Trotsky&quot;, in which he broke with dialectical materialism. In this text he responds to Trotsky&#x27;s request to draw his attention to &quot;those works which should supplant the system of dialectic materialism for the proletariat&quot; by referring to &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; by Russell and Whitehead and &quot;the scientists, mathematicians and logicians now cooperating in the new Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;.

After a protracted discussion inside the SWP, in which the factions argued their case in a series of heated internal discussion bulletins, the special 3rd National Convention of the organization in early April 1940 decided the question in favor of the Cannon majority by a vote of 55–31. Even though the majority sought to avoid a split by offering to continue the debate and to allow proportional representation of the minority on the party&#x27;s governing National Committee, Shachtman, Burnham, and their supporters resigned from the SWP to launch their own organization, again called the Workers Party.

This break also marked the end of Burnham&#x27;s participation in the radical movement, however. On May 21, 1940, he addressed a letter to the National Committee of the Workers Party resigning from the organization. In it he made it clear the distance he had moved away from Marxism:

In 1941, Burnham wrote a book analyzing the development of economics and society as he saw it, called &quot;The Managerial Revolution: What is Happening in the World&quot;. The book was included in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944.

===OSS and &quot;National Review&quot;===

During World War II, Burnham took a leave from NYU to work for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. Recommended by George F. Kennan, Burnham was invited to lead the semi-autonomous &quot;Political and Psychological Warfare&quot; division of the Office of Policy Coordination.

Subsequently, during the Cold War, he called for an aggressive strategy against the Soviet Union. A contributor to &quot;The Freeman&quot; in the early 1950s, he considered the magazine too focused on economic issues, though it presented a wide range of opinion on the Soviet threat. In &quot;The Struggle for the World&quot; (1947), he called for common citizenship between the United States, Great Britain, and the British dominions, as well as a &quot;World Federation&quot; against communism. Burnham thought in terms of a hegemonic world, instead of a balance of power:

A World Federation initiated and led by the United States would be, we have recognized, a World Empire. In this imperial federation, the United States, with a monopoly of atomic weapons, would hold a preponderance of decisive material power over all the rest of the world. In world politics, that is to say, there would not be a balance of power.

In 1955, he helped William F. Buckley Jr. found &quot;National Review&quot; magazine, which from the start took positions in foreign policy consistent with Burnham&#x27;s own. In the &quot;National Review&quot;, he wrote a column titled &quot;Third World War,&quot; which referred to the Cold War. Burnham became a lifelong contributor to the journal, and Buckley referred to him as &quot;the number one intellectual influence on &quot;National Review&quot; since the day of its founding.&quot; His approach to foreign policy has caused some to regard him as the first &quot;neoconservative,&quot; although Burnham&#x27;s ideas have been an important influence on both the paleoconservative and neoconservative factions of the American Right.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In early November 1978 he suffered a stroke which affected his health and short-term memory. He died of kidney and liver cancer at home in Kent, Connecticut, on July 28, 1987. He was buried in Kent on August 1, 1987.

==Ideas==
===&quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot;===

===Later writings===
In &quot;The Machiavellians&quot;, he developed his theory that the emerging new élite would prosper better if it retained some democratic trappings—political opposition, a free press, and a controlled &quot;circulation of the élites.&quot;

His 1964 book &quot;Suicide of the West&quot; became a classic text for the post-war conservative movement in American politics, proclaiming Burnham&#x27;s new interest in traditional moral values, classical liberal economics and anti-communism. He defined political ideologies as syndromes afflicting their proponents with various internal contradictions. His works greatly influenced paleoconservative author Sam Francis, who wrote two books about Burnham, and based his political theories upon the &quot;managerial revolution&quot; and the resulting managerial state.

== In fiction ==
British writer George Orwell was inspired by Burnham&#x27;s &quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot; and his explanation of power, which informed Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Orwell noted in 1945, &quot;For Burnham&#x27;s geographical picture of the new world has turned out to be correct. More and more obviously the surface of the earth is being parceled off into three great empires ...&quot;. The superpowers of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia in the novel are partly influenced by Burnham&#x27;s assessment of Roosevelt&#x27;s America, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as being managerial states. In 1946 Orwell, summarized Burnham&#x27;s managerial revolution and outlined the geopolitical landscape of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;:

While Orwell partly agreed with Burnham&#x27;s analysis, he never fully accepted Burnham&#x27;s attitude towards Machiavellian managerial power. This unresolved thought helped to inspire the character of O&#x27;Brien, who talks about power and regimes in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

<doc id="292086" wikidata="Q203768" url="?curid=292086" title="Abdülmecid II">
<text>Abdülmecid II or Abdulmejid II (; ; 29 May 1868 – 23 August 1944) was the last Ottoman caliph, the only caliph of the Republic of Turkey, and head of the Osmanoğlu family from 1926 to 1944. As opposed to previous caliphs, he used the title &quot;Halîfe-i Müslimîn&quot; (Caliph of the Muslims), instead of &quot;Emîrü&#x27;l-Mü&#x27;minîn&quot; (Commander of the Faithful).

He was also a relatively famous artist and a Turkish aesthete, interested in art and the ways to promote it, mainly literature, painting and music, in Turkey. After the abolition of the Ottoman caliphate, he was succeeded for a few months by Hussein bin Ali, who was mostly recognized in the Arab world, but that attempt ended as well.

He died in Paris in 1944 and was buried as a caliph in Medina.

== Biography ==
===Early years===
On 30 May 1868, he was born at Dolmabahçe Palace, Beşiktaş, Istanbul, to then Sultan Abdulaziz and his consort Hayranidil Kadın. He was the younger full brother of Nazime Sultan. He was educated privately. According to testimonies, he agreed with marriages between cousins within the Ottoman dynasty to reduce tensions within the dynasty.

In accordance with late Ottoman custom, Abdulmejid was confined to the palace until he was 40. On 4 July 1918, his first cousin Mehmed VI became sultan and Abdulmejid was named crown prince. He was interested in literature and founded the Pierre Loti Society in 1920 to promote the works of the author and translate them into Turkish. He had a genuine interest in painting as well, and himself painted a lot, trying to develop realist art in the Ottoman Empire and in music, for he was a composer also. He played the piano.

=== Caliphate ===
When his cousin was deposed on 1 November 1922, the Ottoman Sultanate was abolished. But on 19 November 1922, Abdülmecid was elected caliph by the Turkish National Assembly at Ankara. He established himself in Istanbul on 24 November 1922. The choice of Abdulmejid as caliph was not evident for all Muslims, and there was a significant amount of Islamic and political criticism from within and outside the Ottoman Empire. There was indeed a conflict among certain Muslims, for example in Palestine, who opposed the figures of Hussein bin Ali and Abdulmejid to succeed Mehmed VI. Western colonial powers, such as France or the United Kingdom, were very attentive to these developments. One of those critics was Muhammad Rashid Rida, who claimed that he lacked some of the qualities needed to be the caliph.

However, even though he was criticized when he assumed the position, it seems that the vast majority of Muslims chose to recognize him.

Abdulmejid was targeted by Kemalist propaganda which used the fact that he occupied the Yıldız Palace in Istanbul, and he was subsequently portrayed as having unjustly claimed it for himself. He was also unhappy about the transfer of certain responsibilities from Istanbul to Ankara; for instance, he was angry about the relocation of a military band unit.

On 3 March 1924, six months after the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the Ottoman Caliphate was abolished and the Ottoman dynasty was deposed and expelled from Turkey.

===Exile and death===
The caliph was nominally the supreme religious and political leader of all Muslims across the world, with the main goal to prevent extremism or protect the religion from corruption. In the last session of the budget negotiations on 3 March 1924, Urfa Deputy Sheikh Saffet Efendi and his 53 friends demanded the abolition of the caliphate, arguing it was not necessary any more. This was approved by majority of the votes and a law was established. With the same law, it was decided to expel all members of the Ottoman dynasty. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, however, offered the caliphate to Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, on the condition that he reside outside Turkey; Senussi declined the offer and confirmed his support for Abdulmejid. He was succeeded by Hussein bin Ali in the Arab world, with the support of his cousin, Mehmed VI but that attempt ended fast as well.

Although Abdulmejid and his family were upset about this decision, they did not want the people to revolt, so they secretly went to Çatalca by car from the Dolmabahçe Palace at 5:00 the next morning. Here, after being hosted by the head of the Rumeli Railways Company for a while, they were put on the Simplon Express. When he left Turkey, he traveled to Switzerland. However, contrary to expectations, he was not greeted by a delegation or ceremony but simply as an ordinary traveler. He was also in a difficult financial situation.

When Abdulmejid II arrived in Switzerland, he was detained at the border for a while, but was admitted to the country after a delay. In Switzerland, he said multiple times that he was upset about the abolition of the caliphate, and that this would bring chaos to the Islamic world, with the rise of extremism. But after the Turkish government put pressure on the Swiss government, Abdulmejid was never allowed to give such speeches in Switzerland again. After staying in Switzerland for a while, he moved to Nice, France in October 1924.

Abdulmejid lived a quiet life in Nice, France. His daughter Dürrüşehvar Sultan and his niece Nilüfer Hanım Sultan married the sons of the Nizam of Hyderabad, one of the richest people in the world; thanks to this, his financial situation improved. As he did not get the anticipated support from the Islamic world for the restoration of the caliphate, he started to focus more on worship, painting, and music.

Abdulmejid, who later settled in Paris, used to perform Friday prayers at the Grand Mosque of Paris with other Muslims in the region. After the departure of his very fond grandchildren and son, who left France to marry the Kavala princes of Egypt, he spent painful days alone. He wrote a 12-volume book of memoirs, preserved by his daughter Dürrüşehvar Sultan.

On 23 August 1944, Abdulmejid II died at his house in the 15th Avenue du Maréchal Mounoury, Paris, due to a heart attack. His death coincided with the Liberation of Paris from the German occupation. Despite the efforts of Dürrüşehvar Sultan, the Turkish government did not permit his funeral to be held in Turkey. Subsequently, his remains were preserved at the Grand Mosque of Paris for ten years. Finally, when the mosque could no longer maintain his body, his body was subsequently moved to Medina, where he was then buried. His predecessor, Mehmed VI, was buried in Damascus, by Faisal I. This is explained by the prohibition imposed by the Kemalists, Atatürk and then İnönü, who prohibited the former caliph from being buried in Turkey.

===As artist===
Abdulmejid was given the title of General in the Ottoman Army, but did not have strong military inclinations. He had a more significant role as Chairman of the Ottoman Artists&#x27; Society and was a personal friend of some Western painters, such as Fausto Zonaro, who was influential in art in the Ottoman Empire. He was also connected to the French artist Adolphe Thalasso, who dedicated some works to him.

He is considered one of the most important painters of late period Ottoman art. His paintings of the Harem, showing a modern musical gathering, and of his wife, Şehsuvar Hanım, reading Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;Faust&quot;, express the influence of western Europe in his elite circle. These were displayed at a 1918 exhibition of Ottoman paintings in Vienna. His personal self-portrait can be seen at Istanbul Modern.

Abdulmejid was also an avid collector of butterflies, an activity that he pursued during the last 20 years of his life. His favourite magazine was &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;.

===Personal life===
Abdülmecid&#x27;s first wife was Şehsuvar Hanım, a Turk or an Ubykh. They married on 23 December 1896. She was the mother of Şehzade Ömer Faruk, born in 1898. She died in Paris in 1945, and was buried in Bobigny cemetery. His second wife was Mihrimah Hanım. She died at the Nakkaştepe Palace, on 23 May 1899, and was buried in Nuhkuyusu Mosque, Istanbul.

His third wife was Hayrünissa Hanım, a Circassian. She was childless. His fourth wife was Mehisti Hanım. She was a Circassian-Abkhazian. Her father was Akalsba Hacımaf Bey, and her mother was Safiye Hanım. They married on 16 April 1912. She was the mother of Dürrüşehvar Sultan (who married Azam Jah, son of Mir Osman Ali Khan), born in 1914. She died in Middlesex, London in 1964, and was buried in Brookwood cemetery.

<text>Project HARP, for high altitude research project, was a joint venture of the United States Department of Defense and Canada&#x27;s Department of National Defence created with the goal of studying ballistics of re-entry vehicles and collecting upper atmospheric data for research. Unlike conventional space launching methods that rely on rockets, HARP instead used very large guns to fire projectiles into the atmosphere at extremely high speeds.

A HARP gun operated by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Ballistic Research Laboratory (now called the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) at Yuma Proving Ground currently holds the world record for the highest altitude that a gun-fired projectile has achieved: .

==History==

=== Preparations ===
Project HARP originated as the brainchild of Gerald Bull, a renowned but controversial ballistic engineer specializing in high-velocity guns and gun propulsion systems. In the mid-1950s, Bull was working on anti-ballistic missile (ABM) and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) research at the Canadian Armaments and Research Development Establishment (CARDE) when he formulated the idea to launch satellites into orbit using an enormous cannon. Bull believed that a large supergun would be significantly more cost-effective at sending objects into space than a conventional rocket. Bull argued it would not need expensive rocket motors, firing a large gun wouldn&#x27;t require the missile to throw away multiple rocket stages to break through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to reach orbit. In theory, a sabot would protect the payload during firing and later fall away as the satellite inside emerges.

During the late 1950s, Bull conducted preliminary launch experiments at the CARDE (now known as Defence Research and Development Canada – Valcartier, or DRDC Valcartier) using guns as small as 76mm. These experiments soon caught the attention of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Ballistic Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Chief of Army Research and Development, Lieutenant general Arthur Trudeau. At the time, aircraft engineers needed more information on the atmosphere&#x27;s upper regions to design better jet planes. However, launching rockets into the air to collect data was generally considered costly and inefficient. The U.S. military, in particular, was especially in need of a low-cost launch system that could cover altitudes that conventional aircraft and weather balloons couldn&#x27;t reach to support the development of new supersonic aircraft and missile systems. By late 1960, CARDE and the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) conducted several feasibility studies surrounding small gun-launched probes&#x27; structural integrity. Around the same time, BRL developed a smooth-bore, 5-inch gun system at Aberdeen Proving Ground that successfully launched a probe to altitudes exceeding 220,000 feet.

In 1961, Bull resigned from CARDE and McGill University hired him as a professor. Working together with Donald Mordell, the university&#x27;s Dean of Engineering, Bull moved forward with his space gun project and requested funding from various sources. He received a $200,000 loan from McGill University&#x27;s board of governors. He was given a verbal promise for a $500,000 grant from the Canadian Department of Defence Production (CDDP), which was later reportedly denied due to bureaucratic opposition. In October 1961, Bull met with Charles Murphy, the head of the Ballistic Research Laboratory, to pitch his project for a supergun and was met with overwhelming support. The U.S. Army provided Bull with substantial financial backing and two 16-inch naval gun barrels complete with a land mount and surplus powder charges, a heavy-duty crane, and a $750,000 radar tracking system. Bull and Mordell officially announced the HARP project as a program under McGill University&#x27;s Space Research Institute at a press conference in March 1962. HARP was presented as a research initiative dedicated to &quot;developing low-orbital capacity for geodetic and atmospheric objectives&quot;. However, the project&#x27;s long-term goal was to place satellites into orbit economically.

=== Construction ===
In 1962, Bull and Mordell established a McGill University research station on Barbados (then still a British colony and part of the West Indies Federation) as HARP&#x27;s main base of operations for its 16-inch super gun. The site location was first suggested by Mordell, who believed that a launch site closer to the equator would allow the projectile to procure extra velocity from the Earth&#x27;s rotation to reach higher altitudes. In addition, the site&#x27;s close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean made for the safe impact of re-entry projectiles. As a result of McGill University&#x27;s close connections with the island&#x27;s Democratic Labour Party, Bull met with the Barbados Prime Minister Errol Barrow to arrange the construction of a firing site at Foul Bay, St. Philip. HARP reportedly received enthusiastic support from the Barbados government due to expectations that the island nation would become heavily involved in space exploration research.

The installation of the 16-inch gun began at the newly established High Altitude Research Facility in April 1962. A gun pit was dug into the island&#x27;s coral base, and a concrete emplacement was built on a plateau so that the gun barrel could stand vertically. The 16-inch naval gun barrels provided by the U.S. Army served as the barrels of the HARP gun. They had to be transported to the site on the U.S. Army landing ship, the Lieutenant Colonel John D. Page, with the U.S. Army Transportation Corps assistance, the U.S. Army Research Office, and the Office of the Chief of Research and Development. Hundreds of people from Barbados were employed to transport the two 140-ton gun tubes from the coast to the designated emplacement 2 miles from the beach using a temporary purpose-built railway. By late 1962, the HARP 16-inch gun was set up, and construction on workshops, storage buildings, radar installations, and other facilities neared completion. Around this time, the U.S. Army Research Office increased its financial support of the project to $250,000 per year. The first test shot from the 16-inch gun on Barbados was fired on January 20, 1963, marking the first time that a gun of this caliber was fired at a near-vertical angle. The 315 kg test slug reached an altitude of 3000 meters with a flight time of about 58 seconds at a launch velocity of 1,000 m/s before coming down a kilometer off-shore.

=== Operations ===
The projectiles fired by the 16-inch HARP gun on Barbados belonged to a family of cylindrical, finned missiles called Martlets, named after the martin bird that appeared on the McGill University crest. Inside the gun barrel, the Martlet was surrounded by a sabot. This machined wooden casing protected the projectile as it traveled through the barrel by absorbing the combustive energy and then splitting apart in the air after the Martlet exited the barrel. The Martlets also carried payloads of metallic chaff, chemical smoke, or meteorological balloons to gather atmospheric data as well as telemetry antennas for tracking the missile&#x27;s flight. The Harry Diamond Laboratories designed several telemetry systems used in the HARP program. The firing of these Martlet missiles was always accompanied by a huge explosion that shook the houses within close proximity, leading to cracks in several areas. Since the Barbados government refused to recognize householders&#x27; damage claims, HARP fell into ill favor by much of the Barbados population.

From late January to early February 1963, the 16-inch gun on Barbados conducted its first test series using the Martlet 1, the first of which flew for 145 seconds and reached an altitude of 26 km. It was the first Martlet flight to feature a radio transmitter beacon that tracked the vehicle&#x27;s flight. The second test series was conducted in April 1963 with the new Martlet 2 missiles, which set the world&#x27;s new gun-launched altitude record of 92 km. Around the same time, development for the Martlet 3A began in the spring, with test launches commencing in September. By the end of 1963, approximately 20 Martlet 2 missiles were launched and regularly reached altitudes of 80 km. From these tests, researchers obtained a significant amount of atmospheric data as well as the internal ballistics of the 16-inch gun and the flight performance of the Martlet 2, 3A, and 3B. Impressed with the HARP program&#x27;s initial results, the U.S. Army agreed to provide $250,000 per year in funding.

In 1964, the HARP gun on Barbados continued to primarily launch Martlet 2 missiles that carried a wide variety of payloads. Part of the reason was its low cost, since the firing of the Martlet 2 cost from $2500 to $3000 and took only half an hour to load. The new results from HARP convinced the U.S. Army to increase the annual funding of the project from $250,000 to $1.5 million per year. By March 1964, Canada&#x27;s Department of Defence Production (DDP) agreed to provide joint funding for the HARP program for a total of $3 million per year. However, HARP funding reportedly faced several obstacles in the form of bureaucratic sabotage due to opposition in the Canadian government. The funding promised by the DDP for July 1, 1964, to June 30, 1965, did not arrive until May 1965. During this period, McGill University covered the funds to the best of its ability, although changes had to be made to the original plan. For each subsequent funding periods, the DDP repeatedly delayed HARP funding late into the fiscal year.

The first attempts to improve the performance of the 16-inch gun at Barbados were made in 1964, primarily by increasing the barrel&#x27;s length. In 1962, the Ballistic Research Laboratory increased the barrel length of a 5-inch gun system by welding a second section of barrel to the first barrel&#x27;s muzzle, lengthening the barrel to 8.9 meters. The resulting gun system demonstrated a higher muzzle velocity at the muzzle exit. The longer barrel allowed the propellant gases to push on the projectile for a longer period of time. In September 1964, a ten-calibers extension was added to the 16-inch gun based on BRL&#x27;s experiment with the 5-inch gun. However, while increased velocity and altitude was recorded for test flights, the extension failed in December after the eleventh shot was fired. In 1965, a successful extension of the 16-inch gun was established after enlarging the gun pit to accommodate the equipment&#x27;s large size. The extension almost doubled the length of the gun to 120 feet and weighed nearly 200 tons, making the 16-inch Barbados gun the largest operational artillery piece in the world at the time.

By the end of 1965, Project HARP had fired more than one hundred missiles at heights over 80 km high into the ionosphere. At this point, the project starting planning the launch of the Martlet 4, a projectile that used rocket jets that would ignite mid-flight to send the missile into orbit. For this endeavor, BRL designed the telemetry system that utilized Sun sensors to determine the projectile&#x27;s altitude. This telemetry system would serve as an early precursor to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Aeroballistic Dynamic Fuze (DFuze).

By 1966, the HARP program had established several different launch sites around the United States and Canada, including a second 16-inch HARP gun at the Highwater Range in Quebec and a third 16-inch HARP gun at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.

On November 18, 1966, the HARP gun operated by BRL at Yuma Proving Ground launched an 84-kg Martlet 2 missile at 2,100 m/s, sending it briefly into space and setting a world altitude record of 179 km. This feat has remained the world altitude record for any fired projectile.

=== Closure ===
Throughout 1966, the HARP program experienced a series of funding delays caused by immense opposition from critics in the Canadian government and growing bureaucratic pressures. Upon the end of the Canadian government&#x27;s participation in June 1967, the Canadian government had contributed $4.3 million and the US Army $3.7 million.

On the American side, growing political and financial pressure caused by the Vietnam War and NASA&#x27;s focus on large-scale traditional rockets strained funding for the project as well, exacerbating the program&#x27;s problems even further. In November 1966, the Canadian government announced that it would pull all Project HARP funding after June 30, 1967. Despite Bull&#x27;s attempts to resuscitate the program, the Canadian government withdrew its support in 1967. This decision promptly caused the U.S. Army to withdraw its funding as well, leading to the program&#x27;s complete termination. Both the HARP guns at Barbados and at Highwater Range were shut down, though the HARP guns under the jurisdiction of the U.S. military remained operational. Project HARP&#x27;s assets were transferred to Bull, who started a Space Research Corporation commercial operation to salvage his project. After HARP was cancelled, the 16-inch gun on Barbados remained on its emplacement, where it remains to this day, gradually rusting away.

== Testing ==
The guns used for Project HARP consisted of smooth-bore 5 inch, 7-inch, and 16-inch guns, all of which were designed to launch sub-caliber saboted projectiles into the upper atmosphere. In addition to the High Altitude Research Laboratory at Barbados, a 16-inch HARP gun was constructed at the Highwater Range in Quebec and at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. Smooth-bore 5-inch and 7-inch guns were set up at several different test sites, including Fort Greely, Alaska, Wallops Island, Virginia, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The data collected from the projectiles fired from these gun systems were measured by radar chaff, aluminized balloons, trimethylaluminum trails, and sensors ranging from sun sensors to magnetometers.

=== 5-inch gun systems ===
The 5-inch HARP guns were based on a modified 120 mm T123 service gun and used by the Ballistic Research Laboratory before the HARP program in order to fulfill the needs of the U.S. military&#x27;s Meteorological Rocket Network, a program dedicated to collecting atmospheric wind and temperature data. They were designed to carry a 0.9 kg payload to an altitude of 65 km, which consisted of radar reflective chaff to collect wind data and small radiosondes that returned radio telemetry of information like temperature and humidity as they drifted back down under large parachutes. This initial design for the 5-inch HARP gun reached an altitude of 130,000 ft when tested in 1961. The 5-inch L70 smoothbore guns was the first vertical firing gun system developed under Project HARP. In 1962, a 10-ft extension was implemented for the 5-inch HARP gun by welding a second barrel section to the first, allowing it to launch projectiles at muzzle velocities of 1554 m/s (5,100 ft/sec) to altitudes of 73,100 m (240,000 ft). Throughout HARP, further modifications were made to the 5-inch gun, such as adding three sets of stiffening wires to maintain barrel alignment. Due to their small size, they were easily transported from their initial site at Aberdeen Proving Ground to different launch sites across North America and the Caribbean. One of the 5-inch HARP guns was acquired by the Atmospheric Sciences Laboratory (which consolidated into the U.S. Army Research Laboratory in 1992) to measure the stratosphere&#x27;s winds. The 5-inch gun was deemed successful as a low-cost launch system, costing only around $300 to $500 per launch. By May 1966, a total of the HARP program&#x27;s 5-inch guns launched 162 flights at Wallops Island, 47 flights at White Sands Missile Range, 30 flights at Barbados, and 24 flights at Fort Greeley.

=== 7-inch gun systems ===
The 7-inch HARP guns functioned as scaled-up versions of the 5-inch HARP guns that could carry three times the payload with an altitude capacity of 350,000 ft. The 7-inch gun system was constructed from a 175 mm M113 gun whose barrel was smooth-bored and extended by 26 ft. In general, its projectiles were 1.6 m long and weighed 27 kg. However, it was also capable of firing 5 kg slugs at a muzzle velocity of 2,880 m/s. The 7-inch HARP gun also incorporated the use of gun-boosted rockets to increase payload and altitude capacity. Unlike the 5-inch HARP guns, all vertical high-performance flights for the 7-inch HARP guns were conducted at NASA&#x27;s Wallops Island facility, where 34 vehicles were launched by May 1966.

=== 16-inch gun systems ===

==== High Altitude Research Facility ====
The 16-inch HARP gun in Barbados held the largest gun record globally, with a barrel length of 119 ft (36 m) and weighing 200 tons. It consisted of two 16-inch U.S. Navy gun barrels welded together and smooth-bored to 16.4-inch diameter. It was capable of firing at a muzzle velocity of 2,164 m/s (7,100 ft/s) with a maximum acceleration at launch of 15,000 g. It launched a 181-kg shot with an 84-kg payload that could reach an altitude of 181 km (595,000 ft). For propellants, the 16-inch gun used either the solvent type WM/M.225 or the solventless M8M.225, both manufactured by Canadian Arsenals Limited. During testing, a camera station set up on the islands of Barbados, Saint Vincent, and Grenada were used to photograph the trimethylaluminium trails released from the projectile during launch, which provided data on upper atmosphere wind velocities for different altitudes.

==== Highwater Range ====
The 16-inch HARP gun at Highwater Range was established in 1964 near McGill University to conduct flight tests and other general research on the HARP guns without traveling all the way to the launch site at Barbados. Although the Highwater 16-inch gun was only capable of horizontal test flights and could not be elevated higher than 10 degrees, it was frequently used to test new and experimental launch vehicles and gun systems under each gun loads and in free flight. The Highwater 16-inch gun was primarily used for missile-sabot structural integrity tests, charge development, rocket grain tests, and for testing vehicle performance inside the gun and during the critical muzzle exit. In 1965, the barrel of the Highwater 16-inch gun was extended to a length of 176 ft, holding the record for the longest big-bore artillery piece in the world.

==== Yuma Proving Ground ====
The 16-inch HARP gun at Yuma Proving Ground was constructed in 1966 in order to establish a functional 16-inch gun on American soil and holds the record for achieving the highest projectile launched. It was almost identical to the 16-inch gun on Barbados, being 119 ft long, but was limited by a 35-mile range restriction. However, unlike the Barbados gun, its projectiles could be recovered since they were not lost in the ocean upon their journey back down. The Yuma 16-inch gun was primarily used for flight tests, such as those testing altitude control and telemetry components. In 1966, the 16-inch Yuma gun underwent three firing series using wooden slugs, Martlet 2C&#x27;s, and a Low Altitude High-Velocity cone.
== Martlet projectiles ==

Several models of test projectiles were fired or designed during Project HARP: These projectiles were fired on the island of Barbados and some were fired by the US Army&#x27;s Ballistic Research Lab. The tube&#x27;s slender design, which contained the rocket&#x27;s payload, was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube. This limitation on size was extremely inconvenient when considering the future proposed payloads of Martlet rockets, including satellites and space probes. The cannon-like design also eliminated the capacity for crewed space travel as well as the launching of satellites carrying extremely sensitive scientific instruments and payloads due to the extreme acceleration placed on the projectile during firing.

=== Martlet 1 ===
The Martlet 1 was the first test projectile of the HARP program. Designed in 1962, it was a 16-inch (406 mm) gun bore that weighed 450 lb (200 kg), was 6.6 inches (170 mm) in diameter and 70 inches (1,800 mm) long. Only four were manufactured, two of which were fired during the January and June 1963 test series.

=== Martlet 2A, 2B, 2C family ===
The Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C represented the earliest of the Martlet 2 16-inch (406 mm) test projectiles. Martlet 2A was designed simultaneously with the Martlet 1 with a range of interest being 70 to 200 kilometers. Most carried multi-type research payloads studying the upper atmosphere and near-space conditions. Due to their low cost per missile launch, they were used to test out single payloads. Despite similarities in missile airframe, the Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C featured differences in their structural materials and mechanical details. For the Martlet 2A, the liquid payload was loaded into an aluminum, tapered liner inside the missile body. But by the development of the Martlet 2C series, the aluminum insert was abandoned altogether to allow the liquid payload to be housed in contact with the steel body, increasing the quantity of the liquid payload that could be carried.

=== Martlet 2G and 2G-1 ===
The Martlet 2G was an advanced test projectile with nearly all of its total 350 lb (160 kg) weight in the projectile. It was tested successfully with the Highwater gun and the Barbados gun but never proceeded beyond the engineering flight testing stage. The Martlet 2G-1 was a proposed space launch vehicle variant of Martlet 2G, which had a solid rocket motor in the projectile. The follow-on 2G-2 proposal was to have had a second rocket motor to place the second stage in orbit, though with little or no payload. After development, it underwent horizontal development firings from the Highwater gun in 1966 but failed to be properly tested in time.

=== Martlet 3 ===
The Martlet 3 series consisted of advanced rocket-propelled projectiles. They were built and tested for the HARP project but were ultimately not successful due to restrictions in funding and a severe lack of technical information regarding large rocket grains&#x27; behaviour under high acceleration loading. When testing these projectiles, the danger of in-bore detonation was considered a severe potential problem.

==== Martlet 3A ====
The Martlet 3A was an diameter, gun-fired rocket projectile that theoretically could reach 500 km altitude. As HARP&#x27;s first attempt at a low-cost sabotted rocket system, the projectile was built with fiberglass or aluminum bodies. A standard 6-inch rocket was bonded to an aluminum case. The rocket nozzle was supported by a pusher plate, which would impart the missile&#x27;s acceleration through the aluminum wall casing. Fiberglass limited acceleration to 3600 g (corresponding to a velocity of at rocket ignition). The Martlet 3A&#x27;s original objective was to carry a 40-lbs payload to an altitude of 500 km, which theoretically was feasible if the system could be launched at full gun pressures. The rocket motors&#x27; solid propellant deformed during firing and the design was never successful, despite several test firings.

==== Marlet 3B ====
The Martlet 3B was similar to the Martlet 3A but using steel casings and attempting to solve some of the 3A model&#x27;s other problems. The casings survived , but the propellant failed at . This was solved for later rockets by filling the propellant cavity with liquid, but only after developing the 3B model had ended.

==== Martlet 3D ====
The Martlet 3D model was planned as a suborbital test rocket, using the first stage of the Martlet 4 solid rocket version. As the Martlet 4 was never built, no Martlet 3Ds were produced either.

==== Martlet 3E ====
The Martlet 3E was a solid suborbital rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180 mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new rocket grain construction technique that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure.

=== Martlet 4 ===
By July 1964, the Marlet 4 program pursued developing an orbit capable multi-stage rocket system to be launched from the 16&quot; Barbados gun. Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed.

==== Martlet 4 Control Systems ====
A guidance and control system were developed for the orbital mission by Aviation Electric Limited of Montreal under the direction of McGill-BRL-Harry Diamond Laboratory group. Infrared horizon sensors and sun sensors were included in calculating vehicle attitude. Information for on-board sensors was to be processed by the logic module, which provided commands to a cold gas thruster system which in turn adjusted the vehicle&#x27;s orientation. The components of the guidance and control assembly were integrated into a 6.25-inch diameter test projectile. Sun sensors, horizon sensors, telemetry packs, receiving/transmitting antenna, hydraulic systems, logic modules, and gas thruster attitude control systems were all test-fired to approximately 10,000 g&#x27;s.

<doc id="292093" wikidata="Q5259583" url="?curid=292093" title="Ritu (season)">
<text>Ritu () means &quot;season&quot; in different ancient Indian calendars used in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. There are six ritus (also transliterated ritu) or seasons. Seasons are different times of the year and there are 12 months in the year. Every month has its own special season. The word is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Ṛtú, a fixed or appointed time, especially the proper time for sacrifice (yajna) or ritual in Vedic religion; this in turn comes from the word Ṛta (ऋत), as used in Vedic Sanskrit literally means the &quot;order or course of things&quot;. This word is used in nearly all Indian languages.

== Nepalese and Indian calendars ==
Nepal and India observes six ecological seasons. 
==East Indian calendars==
East Indian calendars (Bengali, Assamese, Odia and Mithila) start their new year on Mesh Sankranti. The season names corresponds to the Sanskrit Vasanta, Grishma, Varsha, Sharada, Hemanta, Shishira order.
The Bengali Calendar is similar to the Sanskrit calendar above, but differs in start and end times which moves certain dates/days around (i.e., Vasant Panchami occurs here in Vasant ritu but in the calendar above, it occurs in Shishir as that is the Magha Shukla Panchami). The East Indian Calendar has the following seasons or ritus:

===Assamese Calendar===

==South Indian calendars==
===Malayalam Kannada Telugu Calendar ===
The Malayalam calendar or Kollam Era, a solar and sidereal Hindu calendar used in Kerala, and in Karnataka they follows a pattern of six seasons slightly different from North Indian Calendars. 
===Tamil calendar===
The Tamil Calendar follows a similar pattern of six seasons as described in the Hindu calendar.
==In culture==
The seasons are described in literature such as the Sanskrit poem &quot;Ṛtusaṃhāra&quot; written by the legendary Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa.

Names of the ritu are commonly used for persons: typically, Vasant, Sharad, Hemant, Shishir and Varsh are &quot;male&quot; names; &quot;female&quot; names include Vasanti, Sharada, Hemanti, Grishma and Varsha.

Similar naming conventions are also used in Tamil: For female Ilavenil. For male Kar(Vannan).

<doc id="292094" wikidata="Q1772397" url="?curid=292094" title="Anorgasmia">
<text>Anorgasmia is a type of sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm despite adequate sexual stimulation. Anorgasmia is far more common in females (4.6%) than in males and is especially rare in younger men. The problem is greater in women who are post-menopausal. In males, it is most closely associated with delayed ejaculation. Anorgasmia can often cause sexual frustration.

==Causes==
The condition is sometimes classified as a psychiatric disorder. However, it can also be caused by physiological problems such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, genital mutilation on any gender, complications from genital surgery, pelvic trauma (such as from a straddle injury caused by falling on the bars of a climbing frame, bicycle or gymnastics beam), hormonal imbalances, total hysterectomy, spinal cord injury, cauda equina syndrome, uterine embolisation, childbirth trauma (vaginal tearing naturally or through the use of forceps or suction or a large or unclosed episiotomy), vulvodynia and cardiovascular disease.

=== Drugs-induced ===
A common cause of anorgasmia, in both women and men, is the use of antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Though reporting of anorgasmia as a side effect of SSRIs is not precise, studies have found that 17–41% of users of such medications are affected by some form of sexual dysfunction.

Another cause of anorgasmia is cocaine use and opiate addiction, particularly to heroin.

===Primary anorgasmia===
Primary anorgasmia is a condition where one has never experienced an orgasm. This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex. Women with this condition can sometimes achieve a relatively low level of sexual excitement. Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular engorgement. On occasion, there may be no obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have a caring, skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect sexual satisfaction.

About 15% of women report difficulties with orgasm, and 10% of women in the United States have never climaxed. 29% of women always have orgasms with their partner.

Some social theorists believe that inability to orgasm may be related to residual psychosocial perceptions that female sexual desire is somehow &#x27;wrong&#x27;, and that this stems from the age of Victorian repression. It is argued that this view may impede some women – perhaps those raised in a more repressed environment – from being able to experience natural and healthy sexual feeling.

A significant genetic influence was seen with an estimated heritability for difficulty reaching orgasm during intercourse of 34% (95% confidence interval 27–40%) and 45% (95% confidence interval 38–52%) for orgasm during masturbation. 
===Secondary anorgasmia===
Secondary anorgasmia is the loss of the ability to have orgasms (as opposed to primary anorgasmia which indicates a person who has never had an orgasm) or loss of the ability to reach orgasm of past intensity. The cause may be alcoholism, depression, grief, pelvic surgery (such as total hysterectomy) or injuries, certain medications, death-grip, illness, estrogen deprivation associated with menopause, or rape.

==== Prostatectomy ====

Secondary anorgasmia is close to 50% among males undergoing prostatectomy; 80% among radical prostatectomies. This is generally caused by damage to the primary nerves serving the penile area, which pass near the prostate gland. Removal of the prostate frequently damages or even completely removes these nerves, making sexual response unreasonably difficult. Radical prostatectomies are usually given to younger males who are expected to live more than 10 years. At more advanced ages, the prostate is less likely to grow during that person&#x27;s remaining lifetime.

===Situational anorgasmia===
People who are orgasmic in some situations may not be in others. A person may have an orgasm from one type of stimulation but not from another, achieve orgasm with one partner but not another, or have an orgasm only under certain conditions or only with a certain type or amount of foreplay. These common variations are within the range of normal sexual expression and should not be considered problematic.

A person who is troubled by experiencing situational anorgasmia should be encouraged to explore alone and with their partner those factors that may affect whether or not they are orgasmic, such as fatigue, emotional concerns, feeling pressured to have sex when they are not interested, or a partner&#x27;s sexual dysfunction. In the relatively common case of female situational anorgasmia during penile-vaginal intercourse, some sex therapists recommend that couples incorporate manual or vibrator stimulation during intercourse, or using the female-above position as it may allow for greater stimulation of the clitoris by the penis or pubic symphysis or both, and it allows the woman better control of movement.

== Diagnosis ==
Effective treatment for anorgasmia depends on the cause. In the case of women with psychological sexual trauma or inhibition, psychosexual counselling might be advisable and could be obtained through general practitioner (GP) referral.

Women with anorgasmia with no obvious psychological cause would need to be examined by their GP to check for absence of disease. Blood tests would also need to be done (full blood count, liver function, oestradiol/estradiol, total testosterone, SHBG, FSH/LH, prolactin, thyroid function, lipids and fasting blood sugar) to check for other conditions such as diabetes, lack of ovulation, low thyroid function or hormone imbalances. The normal thresholds for these tests and timing in a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle is detailed in Berman et al., 2005.

They would then need to be referred to a specialist in sexual medicine. The specialist would check the patient&#x27;s blood results for hormonal levels, thyroid function and diabetes, evaluate genital blood flow and genital sensation, as well as giving a neurological work-up to determine the degree (if any) of nerve damage.

Recently, it has been proposed to add a subtype of female orgasmic disorder (FOD), called reduced orgasmic intensity, and field trials are underway to assess the suitability of this proposal.

== Treatment ==
Just as with erectile dysfunction in men, lack of sexual function in women may be treated with hormonal patches or tablets to correct hormonal imbalances, clitoral vacuum pump devices and medication to improve blood flow, sexual sensation and arousal.

Many practitioners today treat both men and women who have SSRI-induced anorgasmia with sildenafil, more commonly known as Viagra. While this approach is known to work well in men with sexual dysfunction, it is only recently that the effectiveness of sildenafil in women with sexual dysfunction is coming to light. A 1999 study by H. G. Nurnberg et al. showed a complete or very significant reversal of their sexual dysfunction upon taking sildenafil one hour prior to sexual activity. In this study, eight out of the nine women required 50 mg of sildenafil while the 9th woman required 100 mg of sildenafil.

Another option for women who have SSRI-induced anorgasmia is the use of vardenafil. Vardenafil is a type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitor that facilitates muscle relaxation and improves penile erection in men. However, there is controversy about the efficiency of the drug used in the reversal of female sexual dysfunction. Vardenafil is similar to sildenafil, but vardenafil is less expensive and may be covered under some insurance plans. A study by A.K. Ashton M.D. has shown that in the case of one particular woman, the effects of vardenafil as opposed to sildenafil have not only been comparable in the effectiveness, but that vardenafil is cheaper and reversal of sexual dysfunction requires a smaller dose. So far, vardenafil has been approved by the Food and Drug administration only for use in men.

The NIH states that yohimbine hydrochloride has been shown in human studies to be possibly effective in the treatment of male impotence resulting from erectile dysfunction or SSRI usage (e.g., anorgasmia). Published reports have shown it to be effective in the treatment of orgasmic dysfunction in men.

Cabergoline, an agonist of dopamine D2 receptors which inhibits prolactin production, was found in a small study to fully restore orgasm in one third of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restore orgasm in another third. Limited data has shown that the drug amantadine may help to relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Cyproheptadine, buspirone, stimulants such as amphetamines (including the antidepressant bupropion), nefazodone and yohimbine have been used to treat SSRI-induced anorgasmia. Reducing the SSRI dosage may also resolve anorgasmia problems.

<text>Aprus or Apros (), also Apri or Aproi (Ἄπροι), was a town of ancient Thrace and, later, a Roman city established in the Roman province of Europa.

== History ==
Stephanus of Byzantium collects a quote of Theopompus that mentions Aprus. Pliny the Elder notes that Aprus is situated in the interior of Thrace, 22 M.P. from Resisto (likely the same as Bisanthe), 50 Roman miles from Bizya and 180 Roman miles from Philippi.

The city was re-founded as Colonia Claudia Aprensis in the mid-1st century AD, probably in connection with the emperor Claudius&#x27;s annexation of Thracia, and was intended for retired members of the Roman military. It was situated on the Via Egnatia that ran from the Adriatic coast in the province of Illyricum to Byzantium, the city that was to become Constantinople.

In the 4th century, Aprus was the principal city of the region southwest of Heraclea, the capital of the province.

The city was called Theodosiopolis (Greek: Θεοδοσιούπολις) in documents of the 6th century, in honour of Theodosius II, emperor from 401 to 450, or of Theodosius I (347–395).

After the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade (1204), the Henry of Flanders, brother of Baldwin I, attacked the city and killed many of the citizens. The Latin Empire made Theodore Branas (called Li Vernas by Geoffroi de Villehardouin) lord of Aprus. In 1206, Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria destroyed the city, but Branas rebuilt it.

In the Battle of Apros of July 1305, the Catalan Company annihilated the Byzantine imperial army under Michael IX Palaiologos.

==Site==
Its location is near the modern Turkish village of Kermeyan.

==Name==
In Armenian the town is known as Garin, In Greek Karenitis and in Arabic as Kalikelah. The Romans named the town Colonia Claudia Aprensis, and the Byzantines called it 
Apros and latter Theodosiopolis.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
The former archbishopric was a double Catholic titular archbishopric - under the name Theodosiopolis ante Apri it was the only Bulgarian Catholic titular see, but has been suppressed as such, yet it remains a Latin titular see as Aprus.

=== Archbishopric ===
In a &quot;Notitia Episcopatuum&quot; of about 640, the bishopric appears as an autocephalous archdiocese and as the 22nd in order of precedence among 34 sees dependent upon the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Perhaps due to error, it is missing from the next such document, composed at the start of the 10th century, but reappears in the middle of the same century. In the 15th century it was dropped from the official lists of the dioceses dependent on the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

No longer a residential diocese, it has been listed by the Catholic Church as a double titular see, but remains only Latin

=== Latin titular see ===
No later than 1848, the diocese was nominally restored as a Latin Episcopal as Titular bishopric under the names of Theodosiopolis (Latin) / Teodosiopoli (Curiate Italian) / Apri / Apros / Aprus.

It was repeatedly renamed : in 1926 as Titular Episcopal See of Theodosiopolis (Latin) / Teodosiopoli d’Europa (Italian) / Apri / Apros / Aprus; in 1929 as Titular Episcopal See of Theodosiopolis (Latin) / Teodosiopoli di Frigia (Italian) and in 1930 as Titular Episcopal See of Theodosiopolis (Latin) / Teodosiopoli d’Europa (Italian) / Apri / Apros / Aprus.

In 1931 it was suppressed, having had the following incumbents, &quot;however none of the then fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank, all of the higher (and present) Archiepiscopal (intermediary) rank :
* Antonius Merciai, Dominican Order (O.P.) (?Italian?) (1848.12.11 – death 1850.10.22), no prelature 
* Giovanni Tommaso Neuschel (1852.09.17 – death 1863.12.10) (born Italy) as emeritate and promoted for the former Titular Bishop of Troas (1828 – 1828.09.30), Bishop of Guastalla (Italy) (1828.09.30 – 1836.11.21), Bishop of Borgo San Donnino (Italy) (1836.11.21 – 1843.01.27), Bishop of Parma (Italy) (1843.01.27 – retired 1852.09.17)

* Pietro Maglione (1900.12.17 – death 1903.04.13) (born Italy), as emeritate and promotion, previously Bishop of Cariati (Italy) (1874.06.15 – 1876.12.18), Bishop of Capaccio–Vallo (Italy) (1876.12.18 – 1900.12.17)
* Nicola Marconi, Friars Minor O.F.M. (1911.01.21 – death 1930.04.11) (born Italy) as emeritate and promotion for the former Bishop of Pult (Albania) (1890.12.23 – 1911.01.21).

In 1933 however, it was restored, renamed and promoted as Titular archbishopric of Aprus (Latin) / Apro (Italian) / Apren(sis) (Latin adjective).

It has been vacant for several decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the now fitting Archiepiscopal (intermediary) rank;
* Giuseppe Lojacono (1939.06.01 – death 1945.03.13) (born Italy) as emeritate and promotion for the former Bishop of Ariano (Italy) (1918.11.04 – 1939.06.01)

In 1924 it was suppressed, having had a single incumbent of the fitting Archiepiscopal (intermediary) rank :
* Michail Miroff (1907.01.08 – death 1923), no actual prelature.

<text>The 1946 Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Literary Merit were the eleventh rendition of the Governor General&#x27;s Awards, Canada&#x27;s annual national awards program which then comprised literary awards alone. The awards recognized Canadian writers for new English-language works published in Canada during 1946 and were presented in 1947. There were no cash prizes.

The 1946 awards were announced on April 19, 1947, in Toronto, Ontario. As every year from 1942 to 1948, there two awards for non-fiction, and four awards in the three established categories, which recognized English-language works only.

==Winners==

* Poetry or drama: Robert Finch, &quot;Poems&quot;
* Non-fiction: Frederick Philip Grove, &quot;In Search of Myself&quot;

==Stephen Leacock Award==

The Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, commonly called the Stephen Leacock Award, recognizes the previous year&#x27;s best English-language book of humour by a Canadian writer. It was inaugurated for 1946 publications when the winner was announced along with the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Awards in April 1947 although it was – and always has been – separately administered and presented. As of 2015 the Leacock Medal approximately maintains its original schedule (2015, for 2014 publications: winner announced online, May 13; Leacock ceremony, first weekend in June) Meanwhile, the ceremonial date of the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Awards has advanced to November of the publication year.

<text>The Church of Nigeria is the Anglican church in Nigeria. It is the second-largest province in the Anglican Communion, as measured by baptised membership (not by attendance), after the Church of England. In 2016 it stated that its membership was “over 18 million&quot;, out of a total Nigerian population of 190 million. It is &quot;effectively the largest province in the Communion.&quot; As measured by active membership, the Church of Nigeria has nearly 2 million active baptised members. According to a study published by &quot;Cambridge University Press&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Anglican Studies&quot;, there are between 4.94 and 11.74 million Anglicans in Nigeria. The Church of Nigeria is the largest Anglican province on the continent of Africa, accounting for 41.7% of Anglicans in Sub-Saharan Africa, and is &quot;probably the first [largest within the Anglican Communion] in terms of active members.&quot;

Since 2002 the Church of Nigeria has been organised into 14 ecclesiastical provinces. It has rapidly increased the number of its dioceses and bishops from 91 in 2002 to 161 as at January 2013. The administrative headquarters are located in Abuja. Archbishop Henry Ndukuba became its primate in 2020.

==History==
Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin Friars from Portugal. The first mission of the Church of England was, though, only established in 1842 in Badagry by Henry Townsend. In 1864, Charles Longley, the then Archbishop of Canterbury consecrated Rev Samuel Ajayi Crowther Bishop for the Niger mission, thus becoming the first African Bishop and Bishop of the Niger Territories, which was subsequently renamed Diocese of Western Equatorial Africa with its headquarters in Onitsha. The Diocese of Western Equatorial Africa was divided into Diocese of Lagos (1919) and Diocese on the Niger (1920).

The two existing dioceses (Lagos and on the Niger) later gave birth to additional 14 dioceses. On 24 February 1979, the sixteen dioceses of Nigeria were joined in the Church of Nigeria, a newly founded province of the Anglican Communion, with Timothy O. Olufosoye, then Bishop of Ibadan, becoming its first archbishop, primate and metropolitan. Between 1980 and 1988, eight additional dioceses were created. In 1986, he was succeeded by J. Abiodun Adetiloye who became the second primate and metropolitan of Nigeria, a position he would hold until 1999.

In 1989 the Diocese of Abuja was created on the area of the new capital of Nigeria with Peter Akinola as first bishop.

The 1990s was the decade of evangelization for the Church of Nigeria, starting with the consecration of mission bishops for the mission dioceses of Minna, Kafanchan, Katsina, Sokoto, Makurdi, Yola, Maiduguri, Bauchi, Egbado and Ife. Between 1993 and 1996 the primate founded nine dioceses; Oke-Osun, Sabongidda-Ora, Okigwe North, Okigwe South, Ikale-Ilaje, Kabba, Nnewi, Egbu and Niger Delta North. In December 1996 five more mission dioceses were added in the north — Kebbi, Dutse, Damaturu, Jalingo and Otukpo — and their respective first bishops elected. In 1997 and 1998 four more dioceses were established; Wusasa, Abakaliki, Ughelli and Ibadan North. In 1999 the Church of Nigeria added 13 new dioceses; four in July (Oji River, Ideato, Ibadan South and Offa), eight in November (Lagos West, Ekiti West, Gusau, Gombe, Niger Delta West, Gwagwalada, Lafia and Bida) and Oleh in December. So within 10 years there were 27 new regular dioceses and 15 mission dioceses created. The Archbishop of Canterbury declared the Church of Nigeria to be the fastest growing church in the Anglican Communion.

In 1997 the Church of Nigeria was split into three ecclesiastical provinces (see below).

In 2000, Archbishop Peter Akinola succeeded Archbishop Adetiloye as primate of the Church of Nigeria. One of his first actions as primate was to get together 400 bishops, priests, lay members and members of the Mothers&#x27; Union to elaborate a vision for the Church of Nigeria under the chairmanship of Ernest Shonekan, a former President of Nigeria. The vision elaborated was:
The Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) shall be; Bible-based, spiritually dynamic, united, disciplined, self supporting, committed to pragmatic evangelism, social welfare and a Church that epitomizes the genuine love of Christ.

The program of action included among others additional translations of the liturgy, establishing a lay fundraising team, establishing a legal support to ensure freedom of religion and worship, establishing theological colleges and universities, internet access for all dioceses, training evangelists, priests and their wives, social welfare programs, hospitals, secondary schools, literacy courses and setting up cottage industries.

In 2005, as one of the goals of the &quot;Vision of the Church of Nigeria&quot;, the church-owned Ajayi Crowther University in Oyo was granted license to operate as a private university in Nigeria on 7 January 2005.

==Structure and leadership==

In 1997, as a result of rapid expansion, the Church of Nigeria was split into three internal ecclesiastical provinces:
* Province 1, consisting of the dioceses in the West, headed by Archbishop Joseph Abiodun Adetiloye, who remained Primate of All Nigeria, and metropolitan archbishop.
* Province 2, consisting of the Eastern dioceses, headed by Benjamin Nwankiti, Bishop of Owerri as metropolitan archbishop.
* Province 3, consisting of the Northern dioceses, headed by Peter Akinola, Bishop of Abuja, as metropolitan archbishop.

In 2002 the Church of Nigeria was again reorganised, this time into 10 ecclesiastical provinces.

The rapid expansion has continued, and as of 2012 there were 14 archbishops, heading 14 ecclesiastical provinces, with a total of 161 dioceses.

The fourteen ecclesiastical provinces are:
*Aba - (Archbishop: Isaac Chijioke Nwaobia)
*Abuja - (Archbishop: Henry Ndukuba)
*Bendel - (Archbishop: Cyril Odutemu)
*Enugu - (Archbishop: Emmanuel Chukwuma)
*Ibadan - (Archbishop: Abiodun Olaoye)
*Jos - (Archbishop: Markus Ibrahim)
*Kaduna - (Archbishop: Timothy Yahaya)
*Kwara - (Archbishop: Israel Amoo)
*Lagos - (Archbishop: Michael Olusina Fape)
*Lokoja - (Archbishop: Daniel Abubakar Yisa)
*Niger - (Archbishop: Alex Ibezim)
*Niger Delta - (Archbishop: Blessing Enyindah)
*Ondo - (Archbishop: Simeon Borokini)
*Owerri - (Archbishop: David Onuoha)

==Primate==

The fourteen archbishops each hold metropolitical authority within their respective provinces. One of them is additionally the Primate and bears the title &quot;Primate of All Nigeria&quot;. The primates of the Church of Nigeria have been:

==Anglican realignment==
The Church of Nigeria has continuously opposed the liberal inclinations of the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada, which led to the acceptance of non-celibate homosexuality and non-celibate homosexual clergy. The church has also opposed the decisions made by the Church of England to accept celibate same-sex relationships and clergy in celibate same-sex relationships, including civil unions. The former primate, Peter Akinola, become prominent as a leader of conservatives within the Anglican Communion. After the ordination of a partnered gay man, Gene Robinson, as a bishop of the Diocese of New Hampshire, in the United States, he threatened that it was a measure that could split the Anglican Communion. As a first step, the church declared itself in &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the Episcopal Church USA on 21 November 2003. In September 2005 the Church of Nigeria reworded its constitution to redefine, from its point of view, the Anglican Communion, no longer as &quot;Provinces in communion with the See of Canterbury&quot; but instead &quot;all Anglican Churches, Dioceses and Provinces that hold and maintain the ‘Historic Faith, Doctrine, Sacrament and Discipline of the one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church&#x27;.&quot; Also in 2005, Archbishop Akinola criticised the Church of England for allowing clergy in same-sex civil partnerships saying that &quot;[it] proposes same-sex marriage ‘in everything but name’ and that the proposal to extract a promise from gay clergy who register for civil unions to abstain from sexual relations is ‘totally unworkable’ and &#x27;invites deception and ridicule&#x27;.&quot; In 2021, Archbishop Ndukuba reiterated the church&#x27;s opposition to actions within the churches of &quot;The Episcopal Church of the USA, Canada, [and the] UK...&quot; and his commitment to GAFCON.

On November 12, 2005, the church entered into a &quot;Covenant of Concordat&quot; with the Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican Province of America, two conservative groups of Anglican origin but outside the Anglican Communion, which do not recognize the Episcopal Church USA. In October and December 2006, several Episcopal churches in Virginia declared themselves out of communion with the Episcopal Church USA due to their opposition to their stance on homosexuality and joined the Church of Nigeria through the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, a mission originally started by the Church of Nigeria to support Nigerian Anglicans in the United States. It now mostly consists of non-Nigerian, theologically conservative American Anglicans, and initially began under the oversight of two bishops; Bishop Martyn Minns and a suffragan bishop, David Bena, who are simultaneously bishops of the Church of Nigeria. The Church of Nigeria is currently in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, founded in June 2009, launched as a conservative alternative to the liberal tendencies of the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada. The first of four new American dioceses for the ACNA established by the Church of Nigeria, under the oversight of the missionary bishop of CANA, was the Missionary Diocese of the Trinity which was inaugurated on 19 August 2012 by Archbishop Nicholas Okoh. Now reconstituted as the Church of Nigeria North American Mission, CONNAM consists of two U.S. dioceses primarily composed of Nigerian immigrants. In 2022, conflict emerged between the ACNA and the Church of Nigeria as a bishop from the Church of Nigeria led a mob and reportedly attacked members of the ACNA congregation.

The Church of Nigeria took a 470 members delegation, led by Archbishop Nicholas Okoh and including several archbishops and bishops to the GAFCON II, that took place from 21 to 26 October 2013, in Nairobi, Kenya.

The Church of Nigeria was represented at GAFCON III, held in Jerusalem, on 17–22 June 2018, by a 472 members delegation, the largest from any Anglican province.

== Ordination of women ==
The Church of Nigeria does not recognise the ordination of women to the priesthood or the episcopate. In 2010, then Archbishop Nicholas Oko permitted the ordination of women to the diaconate within limitations.

==Ecumenical relations==
In October 2009, the Nigerian church&#x27;s leadership reacted to the Vatican&#x27;s proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by saying that although it welcomed ecumenical dialogue and shared moral theology with the Roman Catholic Church, the current GAFCON structures already meet the spiritual and pastoral needs of conservative Anglicans in Africa.

<doc id="292103" wikidata="Q319312" url="?curid=292103" title="Premature ejaculation">
<text>Premature ejaculation (PE) is a male sexual dysfunction that occurs when a male expels semen (and most likely experiences orgasm) soon after beginning sexual activity, and with minimal penile stimulation. It has also been called &quot;early ejaculation&quot;, &quot;rapid ejaculation&quot;, &quot;rapid climax&quot;, &quot;premature climax&quot; and (historically) &quot;ejaculatio praecox.&quot; There is no uniform cut-off defining &quot;premature&quot;, but a consensus of experts at the International Society for Sexual Medicine endorsed a definition of around one minute after penetration. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) applies a cut-off of 15 seconds from the beginning of sexual intercourse.

Although men with premature ejaculation describe feeling that they have less control over ejaculating, it is not clear if that is true, and many or most average men also report that they wish they could last longer. In males, typical intravaginal ejaculation latency time is approximately 4–8 minutes. The opposite condition is delayed ejaculation.

Men with PE often report emotional and relationship distress, and some avoid pursuing sexual relationships because of PE-related embarrassment. Compared with males, females consider PE less of a problem, but several studies show that the condition also causes female partners distress.

==Cause==
The causes of premature ejaculation are unclear. Many theories have been suggested, including that PE was the result of masturbating quickly during adolescence to avoid being caught, performance anxiety, passive-aggressive behavior or having too little sex; but there is little evidence to support any of these theories.

Several physiological mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to causing premature ejaculation, including serotonin receptors, a genetic predisposition, elevated penile sensitivity and nerve conduction atypicalities. Scientists have long suspected a genetic link to certain forms of premature ejaculation. However, studies have been inconclusive in isolating the gene responsible for lifelong PE.

The nucleus paragigantocellularis of the brain has been identified as having involvement in ejaculatory control. PE may be caused by prostatitis or as a medication side effect.

PE has been classified into four subtypes - lifelong, acquired, variable and subjective PE. The pathophysiology of lifelong PE is mediated by a complex interplay of central and peripheral serotonergic, dopaminergic, oxytocinergic, endocrinological, genetic and epigenetic factors. Acquired PE may occur due to psychological problems - such as sexual performance anxiety, and psychological or relationship problems - and/or co-morbidity, including erectile dysfunction, prostatitis and hyperthyroidism.

==Mechanism==
The physical process of ejaculation requires two actions: emission and expulsion. The emission is the first phase. It involves deposition of fluid from the ampullary vas deferens, seminal vesicles and prostate gland into the posterior urethra. The second phase is the expulsion phase. It involves closure of bladder neck, followed by the rhythmic contractions of the urethra by pelvic-perineal and bulbospongiosus muscle and intermittent relaxation of the external male urethral sphincter.

Sympathetic motor neurons control the emission phase of ejaculation reflex, and expulsion phase is executed by somatic and autonomic motor neurons. These motor neurons are located in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral spinal cord and are activated in a coordinated manner when sufficient sensory input to reach the ejaculatory threshold has entered the central nervous system.

===Intromission time===
The 1948 Kinsey Report suggested that three-quarters of men ejaculate within two minutes of penetration in over half of their sexual encounters.

Current evidence supports an average intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) of six and a half minutes in 18- to 30-year-olds. If the disorder is defined as an IELT percentile below 2.5, then premature ejaculation could be suggested by an IELT of less than about two minutes. Still, it is possible for some men with abnormally low IELTs to be satisfied with their performance and not report a lack of control. Likewise, those with higher IELTs may consider themselves premature ejaculators, and suffer from quality of life issues normally associated with premature ejaculation, and even benefit from non-pharmaceutical treatment.

==Diagnosis==
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defines premature ejaculation as &quot;A persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the person wishes it,&quot; with the additional requirements that the condition occurs for a duration longer than 6 months, causes clinically significant distress, and cannot be better explained by relationship distress, another mental disorder, or the use of medications. These factors are identified by talking with the person, not through any diagnostic test. The DSM-5 allows for specifiers whether the condition is lifelong or acquired, applying in general or only to certain situations, and severity based on the time under one minute, however these subtypes have been criticised as lacking validity due to insufficient evidence.

The 2007 ICD-10 defined PE as ejaculating without control, and within around 15 seconds.

==Treatments==
Several treatments have been tested for treating premature ejaculation. A combination of medication and non-medication treatments is often the most effective method.

===Self-treatment===
Many men attempt to treat themselves for premature ejaculation by trying to distract themselves, such as by trying to focus their attention away from the sexual stimulation. There is little evidence to indicate that it is effective and it tends to detract from the sexual fulfilment of both partners. Other self-treatments include thrusting more slowly, withdrawing the penis altogether, purposefully ejaculating before sexual intercourse, and using more than one condom. Some men report these to have been helpful.

===Sex therapy===
Several techniques have been developed and applied by sex therapists, including Kegel exercises (to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor) and Masters and Johnson&#x27;s &quot;stop-start technique&quot; (to desensitize the male&#x27;s responses) and &quot;squeeze technique&quot; (to reduce excessive arousal).

To treat premature ejaculation, Masters and Johnson developed the &quot;squeeze technique&quot;, based on the Semans technique developed by James Semans in 1956. Men were instructed to pay close attention to their arousal pattern and learn to recognize how they felt shortly before their &quot;point of no return&quot;, the moment ejaculation felt imminent and inevitable. Sensing it, they were to signal their partner, who squeezed the head of the penis between thumb and index finger, suppressing the ejaculatory reflex and allowing the male to last longer.

The squeeze technique worked, but many couples found it cumbersome. From the 1970s to the 1990s, sex therapists refined the Masters and Johnson approach, largely abandoning the squeeze technique and focused on a simpler and more effective technique called the &quot;stop-start&quot; technique. During intercourse, as the male gets the sensation of approaching climax, both partners stop moving and remain still until the male&#x27;s feelings of ejaculatory inevitability subside, at which point, they are free to resume active intercourse.

The functional-sexological approach to treating premature ejaculation, as developed by François de Carufel &amp; Gilles Trudel, offers a novel method focusing on sexual function improvement without interrupting sexual activity. This treatment, distinct from traditional behavioral techniques like the squeeze and stop-start methods, has demonstrated significant improvements in the duration of intercourse, sexual satisfaction, and overall sexual function. A pivotal study by De Carufel &amp; Trudel (2006) showcases the effectiveness of this approach. Moreover, the Cochrane review on psychosocial interventions for premature ejaculation recognizes the De Carufel study as having a low risk of bias, highlighting its methodological robustness among psychosocial intervention studies. This acknowledgment points to the functional-sexological treatment as a promising avenue for individuals and couples grappling with premature ejaculation, suggesting a shift towards more contemporary and empirically supported treatments in the field.

===Medications===
Dapoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been approved for the treatment of premature ejaculation in several countries. Other SSRIs are used off-label to treat PE, including fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram and clomipramine. The opioid tramadol, an atypical oral analgesic is also used. Results have found PDE5 inhibitors to be effective in combination treatment with SSRIs. The full effects of these medications typically emerge after 2-3 weeks, with results indicating about ejaculatory delay varying between 6–20 times greater than before medication. Premature ejaculation can return upon discontinuation, and the side effects of these SSRIs can also include anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction, and diminished libido.

Topical anesthetics such as lidocaine and benzocaine that are applied to the tip and shaft of the penis have also been used. They are applied 10–15 minutes before sexual activity and have fewer potential side effects as compared to SSRIs. However, this is sometimes disliked due to the reduction of sensation in the penis as well as for the partner (due to the medication rubbing onto the partner). Another research was conducted in 21 men who were randomized (15 treatment, 6 placebo) and had complete follow-up data. Baseline mean ± standard deviation IELT was 74.3 ± 31.8 vs 84.9 ± 29.8 seconds among the treatment and placebo groups, respectively (p=0.39). After 2 months, men in the treatment group had significant improvement in IELT with a mean increase of 231.5 ± 166.9 seconds (95% confidence interval of 139-323 seconds) which was significantly greater than men on placebo (94.2 ± 67.1 seconds, p= 0.043). 

===Surgical treatments===
Two different surgeries, both developed in South Korea, are available to permanently treat premature ejaculation: selective dorsal neurectomy (SDN) and glans penis augmentation using a hyaluronan gel. Circumcision has shown no effect on PE. The International Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines do not recommend either surgical treatment due to the risk of permanent loss of sexual function and insufficient reliable data and on the basis of violating the medical principle of non-maleficence as the surgery can lead to complications, of which some might not yet be known. The most common complication of surgery is the recurrence of PE, reported to occur in about 10% of surgeries. Other sources consider SDN as a safe and efficient treatment and these surgeries are popular in Asian countries. 

==Epidemiology==
Premature ejaculation is a prevalent sexual dysfunction in males; however, because of the variability in time required to ejaculate and in partners&#x27; desired duration of sex, exact prevalence rates of PE are difficult to determine. In the &quot;Sex in America&quot; surveys (1999 and 2008), University of Chicago researchers found that between adolescence and age 59, approximately 30% of men reported having experienced PE at least once during the previous 12 months, whereas about 10 percent reported erectile dysfunction (ED). In males, although ED is the most prevalent sex problem after age 60, and may be more prevalent than PE overall according to some estimates, premature ejaculation remains a significant issue that, according to the survey, affects 28 percent of men age 65–74, and 22 percent of men age 75–85. Other studies report PE prevalence ranging from 3 percent to 41 percent of men over 18, but the great majority estimate a prevalence of 20 to 30 percent—making PE a very common sex problem.

There is a common misconception that younger men are more likely to develop premature ejaculation and that its frequency decreases with age. Prevalence studies have indicated, however, that rates of PE are relatively constant across age groups.

==History==

=== Naturalism ===
Male mammals ejaculate quickly during intercourse, prompting some biologists to speculate that rapid ejaculation had evolved into genetic makeup of human males to increase their chances of passing their genes.

Ejaculatory control issues have been documented for more than 1,500 years. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, the 4th century BCE Indian marriage handbook, declares that “if a male be long-timed, the female loves him the more, but if he be short timed, she is dissatisfied with him.” 

Waldinger summarizes professional perspectives from early in the twentieth century.

Sex researcher Alfred Kinsey did not consider rapid ejaculation a problem, but viewed it as a sign of &quot;masculine vigor&quot; that could not always be cured. The belief that it should be considered a disease rather than a normal variation, has also been disputed by some modern researchers.

=== Medicalization ===

In the 19th century, a symptom called &quot;spermatorrhoea&quot; invented by William Acton in 1857, meaning excessive or involuntary semen discharge, was developed and at the time used as a medical justification of celibacy. Spermatorrhoea was later sub-classified into other symptom clusters based partially on how it affected semen. Treatment for spermatorrhoea at the time included catheterisation, cauterisation, circumcision, and sticking needles through the perineum into the prostate. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the cultural stigma towards researching sexuality which drove its unpopularity among doctors and in publications. The first recognition the symptoms described in spermatorrhoea as a disorder in itself is believed to be in 1883, termed &quot;ejaculatio praecox&quot;. The origin of the modern version of ejaculatio praecox, called premature ejaculation, is thought to have begun with Alfred Adler before major developments of psycohanalytic theory.

Through the mid 20th century, Sigmund Freud published widely accepted and virtually unchallenged theories that rapid ejaculation was due to neurosis, that penetrative sex was the only right way to achieve female orgasm, and that a man&#x27;s erection was essential to female orgasm. It stated that males who ejaculate prematurely have unconscious hostility toward females, so they ejaculate rapidly, which satisfies them but frustrates their partners, who are unlikely to experience orgasm that quickly. Freudians claimed that premature ejaculation could be cured using psychoanalysis. But even years of psychoanalysis accomplished little, if anything, in curing premature ejaculation. In 1974, there was no evidence found to suggest that men with premature ejaculation harbor unusual hostility toward females. This so-called &quot;coital imperative&quot; has later been argued as a medically recognised disorder that did not actually serve the satisfaction of women but rather contributed to the pressure on and pathologisation of men in obtaining a so-called optimal time to ejaculation.

<text>Tekirdağ () is a city in Turkey. It is located on the north coast of the Sea of Marmara, in the region of East Thrace. The city forms the urban part of the Süleymanpaşa district, with a population of 186,421 in 2022.

Tekirdağ is a commercial centre with a harbour for agricultural products (the harbour is being expanded to accommodate a new rail link to the main freight line through Thrace). It is also home to Martas and the BOTAŞ Terminal, both of them important for trade activities in the Marmara Region. The town&#x27;s best known product remains Tekirdağ rakı although it is also known for its cherries, celebrated with a festival every June.

The proximity of the Greek and Bulgarian borders means that there are honorary consulates for both countries in Tekirdağ.

Ferries from Tekirdağ sail to the nearby Marmara Islands during the summer.

The nearest airport is Tekirdağ Çorlu Airport (TEQ) although there are many more flights to Istanbul Airport (IST).

==Names and etymology==

Tekirdağ was called Bisanthe or Bysanthe (), and also Rhaedestus (Ῥαιδεστός) in classical antiquity. The latter name was used until the Byzantine era, and transformed into &quot;Rodosçuk&quot; after it fell to the Ottomans in the 14th century (in western languages it is usually rendered as Rodosto). After the 18th century it was called Tekfurdağı, based on the Turkish word &quot;tekfur&quot;, meaning &quot;Byzantine lord&quot;. In time, the name mutated into the Turkish &quot;Tekirdağ&quot;, and this became the official name under the Turkish Republic. The historical name &quot;Rhaedestos&quot; (transcribed also as Raidestos) is still used in the Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical context (e.g. the Bishop of Raidestos, the Metropolitanate of Heraclia and Raidestos).

==History==

The history of the city of Tekirdağ dates back to around 4000 BC. In Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; it is mentioned as part of the kingdom of the Thracian king Seuthes. It is also mentioned as Bisanthe by Herodotus (VII, 137). The city was a Samian colony.

Procopius chronicled the town&#x27;s restoration by Justinian I in the 6th century AD. In 813 and again in 1206, after the Battle of Rodosto, it was sacked by the Bulgarians, but it continued to appear as a place of considerable importance in later Byzantine times. The 11th-century Byzantine historian Michael Attaleiates owned property in Raidestos which he described in his will. From 1204 to 1235 the town was ruled by the Venetians following the Latin occupation of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade.

In the Ottoman period the city was successively a part of the Rumelia Eyalet, then of the Province of the Kapudan Pasha, the Silistra Eyalet, and Edirne Vilayet. After 1849 it became the seat of the Sanjak of Tekfürtaği.

=== Twentieth century ===
Tekirdağ was occupied twice by the Russian army: firstly, on 22 August 1829 during Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829) and then on 1 February 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). After these wars, the city returned to Ottoman rule.

In 1905, the city had a population of about 35,000, of whom about half were Greeks.

Tekirdağ was occupied by the Bulgarian army on 11 November 1912. The city was liberated on 13 July 1913.

Finally, Tekirdağ was occupied by the Greek army on 20 July 1920 during the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922). After the signing of the Armistice of Mudanya, the city was given back to Turkey on 13 November 1922. Under the terms of the 1923 agreement for the Exchange of Greek Orthodox and Muslim Populations between the two countries, the Greek Christians of Tekirdağ were all forced to leave (founding the village of Nea Raidestos), their place taken by Muslim Turks from Greece.

In December 1934, a convoy of 1,583 Turkish speaking Muslims from Dobruja and Ada Kaleh settled in Tekirdağ.

For many years Tekirdağ served as a depot for the produce of Edirne province. However, its trade suffered badly when Alexandroupolis became the terminus of the railway up the river Maritsa.

===Bishopric===
Rhaedestus remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. However, Roman Catholic Church activity has long ceased.

==Location==

Tekirdağ is situated on the northern coast of the Sea of Marmara, west of Istanbul. Its picturesque bay is backed by the promontory of the mountain which gives its name to the city, Tekir Dağı (ancient Combos), a spur of about 2000 ft. that rises into the hilly plateau to the north. Between Tekirdağ and Şarköy is another mountain, Ganos Dağı.

==Climate==
Tekirdağ has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cs&quot;). Summers are hot and humid whilst winters are cool and wet. Snowfall is somewhat common, with a week or two of snow between the months of December and March.

Highest recorded temperature: on 27 June 2007&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 3 January 1942

==Tekirdağ today==

The Tekirdağ area is the site of many holiday homes, as the city is only two hours drive from Istanbul via a new four-lane highway. The villages of Şarköy, Mürefte and Kumbağ are particularly popular with Turkish tourists. The Marmara Sea is polluted but there are still a number of public beaches near Tekirdağ, especially the Yeniçiftlik beaches.

Most Ottoman wooden buildings have been replaced by concrete apartment blocks although some are being restored or replaced with attractive replicas. Except for the , and the narrow streets that help one imagine life in the Ottoman period, the city lacks antique charm. One reason to visit is the local delicacy, the small spicy cylindrical grilled meatballs called &quot;Tekirdağ köftesi&quot;, traditionally followed by courses of a sweet local cheese and semolina pudding.

The inland parts of Tekirdağ province offer fertile farmland suitable for winter wheat, sunflowers, cherries and grapes for wine-making.

Both the east–west highway (the Via Egnatia of Roman times) and the highway north toward Muratlı and Lüleburgaz are four lanes. There is a prison next to the &quot;rakı&quot; distillery and another north of the city on the road to Muratlı.

On the eastern edge of the city is the Namık Kemal University, founded in 2006, which has three faculties.

=== Tekirdağ &quot;rakı&quot; ===
This part of Turkey is well known for its high quality &quot;rakı&quot;. State-owned until the 1990s, the distilleries are now in private hands and the wine and &quot;rakı&quot; industries are undergoing a renewal despite being hampered by high taxation on alcohol.

<doc id="292107" wikidata="Q120395" url="?curid=292107" title="Dyspareunia">
<text>Dyspareunia ( ) is painful sexual intercourse due to somatic or psychological causes. The term &quot;dyspareunia&quot; covers both female dyspareunia and male dyspareunia, but many discussions that use the term without further specification concern the female type, which is more common than the male type. In females, the pain can primarily be on the external surface of the genitalia, or deeper in the pelvis upon deep pressure against the cervix. Medically, dyspareunia is a pelvic floor dysfunction and is frequently underdiagnosed. It can affect a small portion of the vulva or vagina or be felt all over the surface. Understanding the duration, location, and nature of the pain is important in identifying the causes of the pain.
Numerous physical, psychological, and social or relationship causes can contribute to pain during sexual encounters. Commonly, multiple underlying causes contribute to the pain. The pain can be acquired or congenital. Symptoms of dyspareunia may also occur after menopause. Diagnosis is typically by physical examination and medical history.
Underlying causes determine treatment. Many patients experience relief when physical causes are identified and treated.
In 2020, dyspareunia has been estimated to globally affect 35% of women at some point in their lives.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Those who experience pelvic pain upon attempted vaginal intercourse describe their pain in many ways. This reflects how many different and overlapping causes there are for dyspareunia. The location, nature, and time course of the pain help to understand potential causes and treatments.

Some describe superficial pain at the opening of the vagina or surface of the genitalia when penetration is initiated. Others feel deeper pain in the vault of the vagina or deep within the pelvis upon deeper penetration. Some feel pain in more than one of these places. Determining whether the pain is more superficial or deep is important in understanding what may be causing the pain. Some patients have always experienced pain with intercourse from their very first attempt, while others begin to feel pain with intercourse after an injury or infection or cyclically with menstruation. Sometimes the pain increases over time.

Pain may distract from feeling pleasure and excitement. Both vaginal lubrication and vaginal dilation decrease. When the vagina is dry and undilated, penetration is more painful. Fear of being in pain can make the discomfort worse. Pain may continue despite the original source being removed, due to the learned expectation of pain. Fear, avoidance, and psychological distress around attempting intercourse can become large parts of the experience of dyspareunia.

Physical examination of the vulva (external genitalia) may reveal clear reasons for pain including lesions, thin skin, ulcerations or discharge associated with vulvovaginal infections or vaginal atrophy. An internal pelvic exam may also reveal physical reasons for pain including lesions on the cervix or anatomic variation.

When there are no visible findings on vulvar exam that would suggest a cause for superficial dyspareunia, a cotton-swab test may be performed. This is a test to assess for localized provoked vulvodynia. A cotton tip applicator is applied at several points around the opening of the vagina; the patient reports the resulting pain on a scale from 0–10.

== Causes ==

=== Dyspareunia in women ===
The cause of the pain may be anatomic or physiologic, including but not limited to lesions of the vagina, retroversion of the uterus, urinary tract infection, lack of lubrication, scar tissue, abnormal growths, or tender pelvic sites. Some cases may be psychosomatic, which can include fear of pain or injury, feelings of guilt or shame, ignorance of sexual anatomy and physiology, and fear of pregnancy.

Common causes for discomfort on vaginal penetration include:
# Infections. Infections that mostly affect the labia, vagina, or lower urinary tract like yeast infections, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, urinary tract infections, or herpes tend to cause more superficial pain. Infections of the cervix, or fallopian tubes like pelvic inflammatory disease tend to cause deeper pain.
# Cancer of the reproductive tract, including the ovaries, cervix, uterus, or vagina.
# Tissue Injury. Pain after trauma to the pelvis from injury, surgery or childbirth.
# Anatomic variations. Hymenal remnants, tight hymenal ring, vaginal septa, thickened undilatable hymen, hypoplasia of the introitus, retroverted uterus or uterine prolapse can contribute to discomfort.
# Hormonal causes:
#* Endometriosis and adenomyosis
#* Estrogen deficiency is a particularly common cause of sexual pain complaints related to vaginal atrophy among postmenopausal patients, and may be a result of similar changes in menstruating patients on hormonal birth control. Estrogen deficiency is associated with lubrication inadequacy, which can lead to painful friction during intercourse. Vaginal dryness is often also reported alongside lactation. Patients undergoing radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy often experience severe dyspareunia due to the atrophy of the vaginal walls and their susceptibility to trauma.
# Pelvic masses, including ovarian cysts, tumors, and uterine fibroids can cause deep pain.
# Pain from bladder irritation: Dyspareunia is a symptom of interstitial cystitis (IC). Patients may struggle with bladder pain and discomfort during or after sex. For an IC patient with a penis, pain occurs at the moment of ejaculation and is focused at the tip of the penis. If the IC patient has a vagina, pain usually occurs the following day and is the result of painful, spasming pelvic floor muscles. Interstitial cystitis patients also struggle with urinary frequency and/or urinary urgency.
# Vulvodynia: Vulvodynia is a diagnosis of exclusion involving either generalized or localized vulvar pain most often described as burning without physical evidence of other causes on exam. Pain can be constant or only when provoked (as with intercourse). Localized provoked vulvodynia is the most recent terminology for what used to be called vulvar vestibulitis when the pain is localized to the vaginal opening.
# Conditions that affect the surface of the vulva including LSEA (lichen sclerosus et atrophicus), or xerosis (dryness, especially after the menopause). Vaginal dryness is sometimes seen in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that characteristically attacks the exocrine glands that produce saliva and tears.
# Muscular dysfunction: For example, levator ani myalgia
# Psychological, such as vaginismus. Most vaginal pain disorders were officially discovered or coined during a time when rape was more normalized than it is now (marital rape was criminalized in all 50 US states in only 1993). Some in the medical community are now starting to take into account factors like rape/sexual assault/ fear of rape/sexual harassment as strong enough psychological stressors to cause such pain disorders.

=== Dyspareunia in men ===
There are a number of physical factors that may cause sexual discomfort. Pain is sometimes experienced in the testicular or glans area of the penis immediately after ejaculation. Infections of the prostate, bladder, or seminal vesicles can lead to intense burning or itching sensations following ejaculation. Patients with interstitial cystitis may experience intense penis pain at the moment of ejaculation. Gonorrheal infections are sometimes associated with burning or sharp penile pains during ejaculation. Urethritis or prostatitis can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable. Anatomic deformities of the penis, such as exist in Peyronie&#x27;s disease, may also result in pain during coitus. One cause of painful intercourse is due to the painful retraction of a too-tight foreskin, occurring either during the first attempt at intercourse or subsequent to tightening or scarring following inflammation or local infection. Another cause of painful intercourse is due to tension in a short and slender frenulum, frenulum breve, as the foreskin retracts on entry to the vagina irrespective of lubrication. In one study frenulum breve was found in 50% of patients who presented with dyspareunia. During vigorous or deep or tight intercourse or masturbation, small tears may occur in the preputial frenulum and can bleed and be very painful and induce anxiety, which can become chronic if left unresolved. If stretching fails to ease the condition, and uncomfortable levels of tension remain, a frenuloplasty procedure may be recommended. Frenuloplasty is an effective procedure, with a high chance of avoiding circumcision, giving good functional results and patient satisfaction. The psychological effects of these conditions, while little understood, are real, and are visible in literature and art.

==Diagnosis==
=== Differential diagnosis ===
Dyspareunia is a condition that has many causes and is not a diagnosis of itself. It is combined with vaginismus into genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder in the DSM-5. Criteria for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder include multiple episodes of difficulty with vaginal penetration, pain associated with intercourse attempts, anticipation of pain due to attempted intercourse, and tensing of the pelvis in response to attempted penetration. To meet criteria for this disorder, a patient must experience the symptoms for at least six months and experience &quot;significant distress&quot;.

The differential diagnosis for dyspareunia is long because of its complicated and multifactorial nature. Often there are physiologic conditions underlying the pain, as well as psychosocial components that must be assessed to find appropriate treatment. A differential diagnosis of underlying physical causes can be guided by whether the pain is deep or superficial:
# Superficial dyspareunia or vulvar pain: infection, inflammation, anatomic causes, tissue destruction, psychosocial factors, muscular dysfunction
# Superficial dyspareunia without visible exam findings: When no other physical cause is found the diagnosis of vulvodynia should be considered. Vaginal atrophy may also not be seen clearly on exam but commonly affects postmenopausal patients and is generally associated with estrogen deficiency.
# Deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain: endometriosis, ovarian cysts, pelvic adhesions, inflammatory diseases (interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease), infections, congestion, psychosocial factors,

== Treatment ==
The treatment for pain with intercourse depends on what is causing the pain. After proper diagnosis one or more treatments for specific causes may be necessary.

For example:
* For pain due to yeast or fungal infections, a clinician may prescribe mycogen cream (nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide), which treats both a yeast infection and associated painful inflammation and itching because it contains both an antifungal and a steroid.
* For pain that is likely due to post-menopausal vaginal dryness, estrogen treatment can be used.
* For patients with diagnostic criteria for endometriosis, medications or surgery are possible options.
In addition, the following may reduce discomfort with intercourse:
* Clearly explain to the patient what has happened, including identifying sites and causes of pain. Make clear that the pain, in almost all cases, disappears over time, or at least greatly lessens. If there is a partner, explain the causes and treatment and encourage them to be supportive.
* Encourage the patient to learn about her body, explore her own anatomy and learn how she likes to be caressed and touched.
* Encourage the couple to add pleasant, sexually exciting experiences to their regular interactions, such as bathing together (in which the primary goal is not cleanliness), or mutual caressing without intercourse. Such activities tend to increase both natural lubrication and vaginal dilation, both of which decrease friction and pain. Prior to intercourse, oral sex may relax and lubricate the vagina (provided both partners are comfortable with it).
* For those who have pain on deep penetration because of pelvic injury or disease, recommend a change in coital position to one with less penetration, such as missionary position. A device has also been described for limiting penetration.
* Recommend water-soluble sexual or surgical lubricant during intercourse. Discourage petroleum jelly. Lubricant should be liberally applied (two tablespoons full) to both the penis and the orifice. A folded bath towel under the receiving partner&#x27;s hips helps prevent spillage on bedclothes.
* Instruct the receiving partner to take the penis of the penetrating partner in their hand and control insertion themselves, rather than let the penetrating partner do it.

== History ==
===Etymology===
The word &quot;dyspareunia&quot; comes from Greek , &quot;dys-&quot; &quot;bad&quot; and , &quot;pareunos&quot; &quot;bedfellow&quot;, meaning &quot;badly mated&quot;.

===Classification===
The previous &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, the &quot;DSM-IV&quot;, stated that the diagnosis of dyspareunia is made when the patient complains of recurrent or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse that is not caused exclusively by lack of lubrication or by vaginal spasm (vaginismus). After the text revision of the fourth edition of the DSM, a debate arose, with arguments to recategorize dyspareunia as a pain disorder instead of a sex disorder, with Charles Allen Moser, a physician, arguing for the removal of dyspareunia from the manual altogether. The most recent version, the DSM 5, has grouped dyspareunia under the diagnosis of Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder.

<doc id="292109" wikidata="Q4081357" url="?curid=292109" title="Buckingham, Richardson, Texas">
<text>Buckingham is an area within Richardson, Texas, United States that was formerly a separate incorporated city. As of the 1990 census, the city had a total population of 102. Encompassing only 159 acres (0.6 km), Buckingham, near Dallas, was surrounded by Richardson.

In the early 1980s, real estate speculators bought most of the land, intending to create a planned development similar to the Las Colinas planned development in north Irving. To spur development, the residents voted to allow alcohol sales in the community before they were bought out. But the real estate market declined, and by the late 1980s, the development company went bankrupt.

The 1990s brought more development to the area, though not without causing conflicts with nearby Richardson residents. At one point, conflicts between the cities led to school zone signs being removed from one Buckingham road, leading parents to stand alongside the road waving flags to warn motorists to slow down.

In April 1996, though, conflicts between Buckingham and Richardson were resolved once and for all, when Buckingham&#x27;s 159 acres (0.6 km) were annexed into the city of Richardson. Since it allowed alcohol sales before annexation, it remained &quot;wet&quot;, although the vast majority of Richardson was at the time &quot;dry&quot;. (With the other exception being a small area of land annexed into Richardson along SH 190.) Richardson residents voted on whether to allow beer and wine sales in the 2006 general election. The measure passed with 68% in favor, so Richardson is no longer considered &quot;dry.&quot;

== Education ==
The area is zoned to the Richardson Independent School District.

Dallas County residents are zoned to Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College or DCCCD).

<text>Las Colinas is a mixed-use planned community development in Irving, Texas, part of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, governed by The Las Colinas Association, a Texas non-profit corporation. Due to its central location between Dallas and Fort Worth and its proximity to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field airport, Las Colinas has been a focus of corporate and business relocation.

==History==
Originally called &quot;El Ranchito de Las Colinas&quot; (&quot;the Little Ranch of the Hills&quot;), Las Colinas was developed in 1972 by cattle ranching millionaire Ben H. Carpenter. It was one of the first planned communities in the United States and was once the largest mixed-use development in the South, with a land area of more than . Urban planners were consulted to lay out the entire town, an undertaking that predated later projects in Plano, Allen, and other Dallas suburbs.

During the 1980s building boom, Las Colinas became a popular location for relocating companies and office developers, attracting many corporations, including the global headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies and offices of more than 30 others, such as ExxonMobil, GTE Telephone (now Verizon), Kimberly-Clark and Associates Corp.

In 1985, the first sign of financial trouble appeared at Las Colinas after a real estate market crash. However, another of office space was built in the late 1990s boom. 

=== Recent ===

With of office space, nearly equivalent to the Dallas CBD, Las Colinas is home to more than 2,000 companies, including the Fortune 500 global headquarters for Caterpillar Inc.,

<doc id="292115" wikidata="Q881512" url="?curid=292115" title="Theodore Branas">
<text>Theodore Branas or Vranas (, &quot;Theodōros Branas&quot;), sometimes called Theodore Komnenos Branas, was a general under the Byzantine Empire and afterwards under the Latin Empire of Constantinople. Under the Latin regime he was given the title Caesar and in 1206 he became governor and lord of Adrianople. He is called Livernas by western chroniclers of the Fourth Crusade, including Geoffroi de Villehardouin.

==Origins and early career==
Theodore was the son of general and &quot;protosebastos&quot; Alexios Branas and of Anna Komnene Vatatzina. He was probably born in Adrianople, where his family held hereditary lands. He was a descendant of the imperial dynasty of the Komnenoi through both his parents, and was a great-nephew of Manuel I Komnenos. His father, who defeated the Siculo-Norman invasion of Byzantium at the Battle of Demetritzes, was killed in 1187 when leading a rebellion against Isaac II Angelos. In 1193, according to the chronicler Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Theodore became the lover of the dowager empress Anna, then aged 22. She was the daughter of King Louis VII of France by his third wife Adèle of Champagne, and the sister of Philip II of France. She had originally come to Constantinople to be married to Alexios II Komnenos, but Alexios was murdered by his co-emperor and regent Andronikos I Komnenos in 1183. She was then married to Andronikos, and was again widowed on his violent death in 1185. Though of French birth, Anna became thoroughly Byzantine in culture and Greek in language; she insisted on employing an interpreter when talking to a party of crusaders, claiming to have completely forgotten the French language.

Theodore fought with limited success under Isaac II Angelos. As the commander of the Alan mercenaries, he was the only Byzantine leader to resist the German crusaders in a clash at Prousenos near Philippopolis in 1189. Together with John Petraliphas, Michael Kantakouzenos and others, he was involved in the successful plot to replace Isaac with his brother Alexios III Angelos in 1195. He fought against various enemies under Alexios III, and was appointed &quot;doux&quot; (provincial governor) of the theme of Adrianople and Didymoteichon. He was prominent in the initial defence of Constantinople against the Fourth Crusade, in 1202–1203.

==Life in the Latin Empire==

After the fall of Constantinople in 1204 Theodore seems to have speedily come to an accommodation with the new Latin regime. Theodore and Anna married, the date of their marriage is unknown. They had at least one daughter, who married Narjot de Toucy. For several years after 1204 Theodore, and presumably Anna, were of invaluable assistance to the Empire. Theodore was one of the few notable Greeks to offer it his immediate support, and, possibly in 1206, received the title of Caesar in return.

Branas was a leader, under Alexios Aspietes, of the Greek party in Philippopolis in opposition to the rule of the Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan. He managed to escape the violent sacking of the city by the Bulgarians, after which Aspietes was executed. Being an avowed anti-Bulgarian Greek and a native of Thrace, he developed even closer ties with the Latins, who were the only force actively confronting the Bulgarian Tsar. Kaloyan&#x27;s destructive ruthlessness was a major cause of Greek desertions to the Latins. Choniates states that Branas was elected the leader of Greek troops who had made peace with the Latin regime in Constantinople. In 1206 Theodore Branas acted as a mediator between Henry of Flanders and the Greeks of Adrianople and Didymoteichon, who were menaced by the Bulgarians and wished to seek Latin protection for their cities. Branas was given command of the garrison of Adrianople, consisting of local Greek troops and 40 Latin knights, and later unsuccessfully defended Didymoteichon when it was besieged and sacked by Kaloyan (20 August 1206). In spring of 1207 Kaloyan went on the offensive again, and laid siege to Adrianople itself. The siege was abandoned even before a relief force from Constantinople arrived. A joint Latin and Adrianopolitan army, under Emperor Henry, then raided Bulgarian territory.

Theodore was Lord of Adrianople, Didymoteichon and Apros (known to the Latins as Naples or Napoli). The &quot;Pactum Adrianopolitanum&quot; dating to 1206, records the recognition by Marino Zeno, Venetian Podestà of Constantinople, of the right of &quot;the hereditary ruler and captain, most worthy Caesar, most noble Komnenos, lord Theodore Branas&quot;, to govern Adrianople and its territories according to the customs of the Greeks. The lordship was feudal in nature, Branas as his service was to provide Venice with 500 cavalry when required. Venice, in turn was obliged to support Branas and the Adrianopolitans against all enemies. However, Branas held the town of Apros directly from the Latin emperor, and the dependency of the other territories on Venice was entirely theoretical. The last record of Theodore Branas is in 1219, when, like his son-in-law Narjot de Toucy, he briefly governed Constantinople as regent.

==Legacy==
Theodore Branas was succeeded as Lord of Adrianople by Baldwin of Béthune (called &quot;rex Adronopili&quot; in the West), probably a son of Baldwin of Béthune, titular Count of Aumale. As the lordship was hereditary it is assumed that Baldwin married an otherwise unattested daughter of Branas. Baldwin was a relative of Cono of Béthune who held the Byzantine titles of &quot;protovestiarios&quot; and &quot;sebastokrator&quot;.

The Branas family in the later 13th century held extensive estates around Smyrna in Anatolia, they seem to have returned fully into Byzantine society and Theodore&#x27;s granddaughter Irene married into the imperial family of the Palaiologoi.

<doc id="292123" wikidata="Q1779543" url="?curid=292123" title="Felix Leiter">
<text>Felix Leiter is a fictional character created by Ian Fleming in the &quot;James Bond&quot; books, films, and other media. The character is an operative for the CIA and Bond&#x27;s friend. After losing a leg and a hand to a shark attack, Leiter joined the Pinkerton Detective Agency. The name &quot;Felix&quot; comes from the middle name of Fleming&#x27;s friend Ivar Bryce, while the name &quot;Leiter&quot; was the surname of Fleming&#x27;s friend Marion Oates Leiter Charles, the then wife of Thomas Leiter.

Leiter also appeared in novels by continuation authors, as well as ten films and one television episode, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, in which the character became a British agent, Clarence Leiter, played by Michael Pate. In the Eon Productions series of films, Leiter has been portrayed by Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, David Hedison, John Terry, and Jeffrey Wright; in the independent production &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, the part was played by Bernie Casey. Leiter has also appeared in the video game &quot;007 Legends&quot;.

==Novels==
Felix Leiter, James Bond&#x27;s CIA ally and friend, played a part in six of the Fleming novels; he is introduced in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; as being thin, tall, about 35 years old and a former U.S. Marine who was working with the Joint Intelligence Staff of NATO. Kerstin Jütting describes Leiter as &quot;a cool and quiet no-nonsense character who knows 007&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses well&quot;. Physically, Fleming describes Leiter in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;: &quot;a mop of straw-coloured hair lent his face a boyish look which closer examination contradicted&quot;.

Leiter is Bond&#x27;s saviour in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, providing him with 32 million francs when Bond has been cleaned out by SMERSH paymaster Le Chiffre, calling it &quot;Marshall aid&quot;. Media historian James Chapman notes that Bond&#x27;s relationship with Leiter represented the Special Relationship between Britain and America, although the American Leiter is in the subordinate position to the British Bond. Academic Jeremy Black agrees, although points out that the Bond and Leiter relationship suggested &quot;a far smoother working of the Anglo-American alliance than was in fact the case.&quot; Academic and writer Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;, considered that this view of Leiter was partly because of Fleming&#x27;s writing, noting that &quot;Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he&quot;. Bond scholars Bennett and Woollacott note that although the two men share adventures, it is Bond who leads, not Leiter. Leiter&#x27;s role is to &quot;suppl[y] Bond with technical support and hardware, add ... muscle where needed and money&quot;.

Fleming&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, reveals that in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;. He is kidnapped by the novel&#x27;s villain, Mr. Big, who feeds him to a great white shark. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the original draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming&#x27;s US agent with Curtis Brown, protested about the death of the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter&#x27;s involvement in a domestic U.S. matter was a breach of the CIA&#x27;s charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.

After the shark attack, Leiter returned in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; with a hook for his missing hand and a prosthetic leg; as he had lost his gun hand, he was no longer with the CIA, but employed as a private detective by Pinkerton Detective Agency, although he was on the reserve of the CIA and was recalled for &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. Fleming had flown to the US in August 1954 to research the background to &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;; his friend Ernest Cuneo introduced him to a rich socialite, William Woodward Jr., who drove a Studillac—a Studebaker with a powerful Cadillac engine. According to Bond scholar Henry Chancellor, &quot;the speed and comfort of it impressed Ian, and he shamelessly appropriated this car&quot; for Leiter to drive in the novel.

For the post-Fleming continuation Bond authors, Leiter has also appeared on a periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel &quot;For Special Services&quot; introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, who is also a CIA officer (and briefly Bond&#x27;s romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter&#x27;s character in some of his novels, including &quot;The Facts of Death&quot; and &quot;Doubleshot&quot;. The 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel &quot;Devil May Care&quot; and the 2011 novel &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; by Jeffery Deaver both contain the character.

==Television==
===Michael Pate: 1954===
The first screen interpretation of the Leiter character was in the 1954 CBS one-hour television adventure &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, broadcast as part of the dramatic anthology series &quot;Climax Mystery Theater&quot;, which ran between October 1954 and June 1958. For the American audience the Bond character from &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was re-cast as an American agent—&quot;Card Sense&quot; Jimmy Bond, played by Barry Nelson—described as working for &quot;Combined Intelligence&quot;, supported by the British agent, Clarence Leiter; &quot;thus was the Anglo-American relationship depicted in the book reversed for American consumption&quot;, according to Jeremy Black. Leiter, who was an agent for Station S, was a combination of the novel&#x27;s Felix Leiter and René Mathis and was played by the Australian actor Michael Pate.

==Films==

===Eon Productions films===
====Jack Lord: 1962====
Jack Lord was the first Felix Leiter, appointed into the role for the first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;. Eon Productions started filming the series out of the order written by Fleming (Fleming had started with &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, with &quot;Dr. No&quot; being the sixth novel). Leiter was not present in the Fleming novel, but the writers added the character to the film. Bond scholars Smith and Lavington consider Leiter to offer negligible help to Bond, largely because there is no role for him in the novel, a point with which continuation Bond author Raymond Benson agrees, noting that he is &quot;extraneous to the dramatic action&quot;. Jeremy Black agrees, although points out that the inclusion of Leiter was a sign of American influence in the Caribbean.

Lord played Leiter in a &quot;swaggering&quot; fashion, according to Smith and Lavington, and they considered him &quot;excellent, an effective American version of James Bond.&quot; Bond scholars Pfeiffer and Worrall agree, stating that Lord&#x27;s was &quot;one of the most satisfying portrayals of Leiter&quot;.

:* &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962)

====Cec Linder: 1964====
When the role of Leiter was brought back for the third Bond film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, in 1964, Lord was again approached to play Leiter; according to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing with Connery, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role. The producers instead decided to recast the role, initially with Austin Willis. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Willis, who was recast as one of Auric Goldfinger&#x27;s opponents in a card game. Linder was the only actor actually on location in Miami. Raymond Benson considers that Linder was &quot;miscast&quot; as Leiter because he looked too old: &quot;he looks like Bond&#x27;s uncle rather than his best friend.&quot;

:;Featured in
:* &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964)

====Rik Van Nutter: 1965====
The fourth film in the Eon series, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, was the third to portray Leiter and the producers chose a third actor to play the role, Rik Van Nutter. Van Nutter was married to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg at the time and the couple had dined with Albert and Dana Broccoli after Ekberg had appeared in the Eon-produced &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot;. Van Nutter was subsequently offered the Leiter role without an audition, although he did have screen tests with some of the Bond girls.

According to Pfeiffer and Worrall, Leiter had a more proactive role in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and Van Nutter was &quot;an inspired choice for the role&quot;. Smith and Lavington agree and consider that Van Nutter&#x27;s &quot;relaxed and charming performance works well.&quot; Benson also concurs, but complains that although Van Nutter is a piece of successful casting, &quot;the script ... does not give the character any real depth&quot;.

:* &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965)

====Norman Burton: 1971====
For the 1971 instalment, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, Eon chose Norman Burton. Burton&#x27;s Leiter was more amusing and more exasperated than the previous incarnations of the role.

Raymond Benson again considers that the Leiter role was miscast and considered Burton to be &quot;overweight and too old for the role&quot;. Smith and Lavington describe him as &quot;an elderly, portly man in a government-issue suit ... anonymous, orthodox&quot;. Pfeiffer and Worrall agree, thinking that Burton was &quot;the least likely incarnation&quot; of Leiter.

:* &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971)

====David Hedison: 1973 &amp; 1989====
In 1973 the Bond franchise introduced a new main lead, Roger Moore, who played Bond for the next 12 years in seven films. David Hedison, an old friend of Moore&#x27;s, was cast as Leiter in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Pfeiffer and Worrall consider that this friendship comes through, with &quot;genuine chemistry&quot; between the two actors. Raymond Benson thought Hedison miscast, but acknowledged that &quot;he&#x27;s the best Leiter next to Rik Van Nutter.&quot;

Hedison returned to play Leiter 16 years later in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and after another actor had also been in the role. Hedison did not expect to return to the role, saying &quot;I was sure that ... [&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;] would be my first – and last&quot; and Glen was reluctant to cast the 61-year-old actor for the physically demanding role, which even included a parachuting scene. Hedison was the only actor to play Leiter in multiple films until Jeffrey Wright appeared in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; and &quot;No Time to Die&quot; 

Leiter, now working with the DEA, is central to the plot of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;. He and Bond work together to capture the drug lord Franz Sanchez on the way to Leiter&#x27;s wedding, at which Bond serves as best man. After Sanchez escapes, he orders his men to rape and murder Della and torture Leiter by lowering him into a tank containing a great white shark — an event transferred from the original plot of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Bond finds Leiter maimed but alive, and seeks revenge on Sanchez, paving the way for the rest of the film&#x27;s plot. At the film&#x27;s end, Leiter is shown recovering in the hospital.

:* &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989)

====John Terry: 1987====
Following Hedison&#x27;s first outing in 1973 in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the Leiter role did not appear again until the 1987 film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, by which time Bond was being played by Timothy Dalton; the role was taken up by John Terry.

Smith and Lavington consider that, although the scene between Bond and Leiter sees warmth in the relationship between them, &quot;it is too fleeting to have any impact&quot;. Pfeiffer and Worrall agree on the briefness of Leiter&#x27;s role in the film, although they consider that Terry has &quot;virtually no chemistry with Dalton&quot;.

&quot;Casino Royale&quot; rebooted the series, which allowed Leiter to re-appear; he and Bond meet for the first time in the film. This version of the character is revealed to be from Milwaukee. As in the novel, he goes undercover to a high-stakes card game with Bond and Le Chiffre, but quickly loses his money. He prevents Bond from killing Le Chiffre, and offers to stake Bond back- in, in exchange for letting the CIA take custody of Le Chiffre.

He appeared again in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, in which he reluctantly helps his corrupt superior Gregg Beam pursue Bond at the behest of Quantum leader Dominic Greene; he redeems himself, however, by helping Bond locate Greene and foil his plan to steal Bolivia&#x27;s water rights. At the end of the film, M mentions that Beam has been fired and Leiter has replaced him. Early script drafts for &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; gave Wright a larger role, but his screen time was restricted by on-set rewrites.

Bond mentions Leiter in &quot;Spectre&quot; as a friend he has called upon for help in hiding the widow of a SPECTRE agent whom the terrorist group is trying to assassinate.

The character (as portrayed by Wright) makes his final appearance in &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, in which he asks the retired Bond&#x27;s help in finding a missing MI6 scientist who was kidnapped by terrorist Lyutsifer Safin&#x27;s men. Bond agrees, but he and Leiter are betrayed by Leiter&#x27;s CIA colleague Logan Ash, a double agent working for Safin. Ash shoots and mortally wounds Leiter, who dies in Bond&#x27;s arms. Later on in the film, Bond avenges Leiter by killing Ash.

===Non-Eon films===

====Bernie Casey: 1983====

In 1983, Kevin McClory, one of the original writers of the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, produced &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, a re-make of the 1965 film &quot;Thunderball&quot;. McClory&#x27;s rights to the film were held separate to those of Eon Productions, although he had been the producer for the first &quot;Thunderball&quot; adaptation. The film marked the return of Sean Connery to the Bond role; he spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, casting a Black actor as Leiter might make the character more memorable. Smith and Lavington consider Casey to be &quot;the most compelling Felix Leiter since Jack Lord&quot;, although again there was little in the script for him to do.

==Video games==

In the 2012 game &quot;007 Legends&quot;, Canadian-American actor Demetri Goritsas provided his likeness and voice for the character of Leiter.

==Comics==
Felix Leiter has made several appearances in multiple comic strips as well as comic books as a supporting character aiding Bond on joint assignments, some of them being adaptations of the novels and the films, while others maintaining original storylines. He briefly makes an appearance in &quot;Permission to Die&quot; (1989), later returning in &quot;A Silent Armageddon&quot; (1992), playing a rather large role in &quot;The Quasimodo Gambit&quot; (1995), a brief comeback in &quot;Eidolon&quot; (2016), and at the latest, in &quot;Black Box&quot; (2017).

In January 2017, Dynamite Comics published the first issue of a miniseries starring Felix, written by James Robinson and illustrated by Aaron Campbell, simply titled, &quot;Felix Leiter&quot;.

==Analysis==
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Thomas Vinciguerra has referred to Leiter as James Bond&#x27;s &quot;sidekick&quot; and documented that his evolving character has paralleled Bond&#x27;s fortunes as both a cinematic icon and a hero of the Cold War and its aftermath.

<doc id="292126" wikidata="Q1665428" url="?curid=292126" title="Montgomery Blair">
<text>Montgomery Blair (May 10, 1813 – July 27, 1883) was an American politician and lawyer from Maryland. He served in the Lincoln administration cabinet as Postmaster-General from 1861 to 1864, during the Civil War. He was the son of Francis Preston Blair, elder brother of Francis Preston Blair Jr. and cousin of B. Gratz Brown.

==Early life and education==
Blair was born in Franklin County, Kentucky, site of the state capital of Frankfort. His father, Francis Preston Blair, Sr., was editor of &quot;The Washington Globe&quot; and a prominent figure in the Democratic Party during the Jacksonian era. As a boy, Montgomery &quot;often listened to the talk of his father and Andrew Jackson.&quot;

Blair graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point. After a year of service in the Seminole War, however, he left the U.S. Army, married Caroline Rebecca Buckner of Virginia, and began studying law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. Blair began to practice law in 1839 at St. Louis, Missouri, working as a United States district attorney. After the death of his first wife, Carolina, in 1844, he later married Mary Elizabeth Woodbury, daughter of Levi Woodbury.

After serving as U.S. District Attorney from 1839 to 1843 and later as judge of the court of common pleas from 1843 to 1849, Blair moved to Maryland in 1852 and devoted himself to law practice principally in the Supreme Court of the United States. He was United States Solicitor in the Court of Claims (1855–58) and was associated with George T. Curtis as counsel for the plaintiff in the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; case in the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857.

== Career ==

The Blairs, like many other nationalist Democrats, but unusual for politicians from the border states, had abandoned the Democratic Party in the wake of the Kansas–Nebraska Act and had been among the founding leaders of the new Republican Party. Four years after Blair switched political parties, President Buchanan removed Blair from his position as Solicitor of the United States Court of Claims in 1858. 

In 1860, Blair took an active part in support of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s presidential campaign. After his election, Lincoln appointed Blair to his cabinet as Postmaster General in 1861. Lincoln expected Blair, who advocated taking a firm stance with the southern states, to help balance more conciliatory members of his cabinet. While Postmaster-General, Blair instituted a uniform rate of postage and free delivery in cities. Blair also began the sale of money orders by post offices to reduce the mailing of currency to reduce post office robberies. He also called for the First International Postal Conference, which was held in Paris in 1863 and began the process that led to the Universal Postal Union.

While the Blairs, as a family, were often characterized as conservative on the issue of slavery, Blair notably served as counsel for Dred Scott when the enslaved African-American took his case to the Supreme Court in 1857. Scott was the slave of an U.S. Army doctor who took his enslaved servant along for prolonged stays in free territory. 

On Scott&#x27;s behalf, Blair argued that the time the black man had spent in the free state of Illinois and in Minnesota, free territory since the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, made him a free man. The ruling by Court&#x27;s majority against Scott&#x27;s right to freedom is often cited as one of the contributing causes of the American Civil War. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney affirmed that the black man had no rights &quot;that the white man was bound to respect&quot; and that black slaves could not be considered American citizens despite having been born in the U.S. This landmark decision was denounced as a step toward the &quot;nationalization&quot; of slavery by Lincoln and others opposed to the expansion of that institution. Conservative as he may have been on other aspects of the slavery issue, Blair&#x27;s work in the case of &quot;Dred Scott vs. Sandford&quot; suggests a willingness to embrace more progressive viewpoints.

Blair began serving as Postmaster-General in 1861. Under Blair&#x27;s administration, such reforms and improvements as the establishment of free city delivery; the adoption of a money order system; and the use of railway mail cars were instituted, the last of which had been suggested by George B. Armstrong (d. 1871), of Chicago, general superintendent of the United States railway mail service from 1860 to his death.

In September 1864, Lincoln accepted an earlier offer by Blair to resign. Lincoln&#x27;s action may have been a response to the hostility of the Radical Republican faction, which believed Blair&#x27;s retirement should follow the withdrawal of John C. Frémont as a candidate in the 1864 presidential election. Blair told his wife that Lincoln acted &quot;from the best motives&quot; and that &quot;it is for the best all around.&quot; After he left the cabinet, Blair still campaigned for Lincoln&#x27;s re-election in 1864, and Lincoln and the Blair family retained close ties.

Differing from the Republican Party on the Reconstruction policy, Blair gave his adherence to the Democratic Party after the Civil War, along with his brother, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1868.

In 1876, Blair, along with Matthew H. Carpenter and Jeremiah S. Black, was counsel to Secretary of War William W. Belknap during the House of Representatives investigation into the Trader post scandal. Blair asked the House Investigation Committee chaired by Hiester Clymer to drop the charges against Belknap if the latter resigned office. Clymer, however, declined Blair&#x27;s offer. 

Belknap was impeached by the House of Representatives for receiving illicit payments from the Fort Sill trader post on the American frontier as Secretary of War. Belknap had been granted sole power by Congress to choose sutlers to operate lucrative trader posts that sold supplies to U.S. soldiers and Indians. Belknap resigned over the scandal and was acquitted in a United States Senate trial during the summer of 1876. Many senators did not believe that Congress could convict a private citizen, but the Senate passed a resolution that stated Congress could convict a private citizen.

In 1882, Blair unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Representative from Maryland&#x27;s sixth district.

His manor in present-day Silver Spring, Maryland was named Falkland. It was burned by Confederate troops during their thrust towards the national capital in Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War.

==Death==

After several years afflicted with &quot;inflammation of the spinal membranes,&quot; he died in Silver Spring, Maryland on July 27, 1883. 

Funeral services were held at Rock Creek Church, and he was buried at Rock Creek Cemetery. In memory of Blair, the United States Post Office closed on July 30, 1883.

==Personal life==
Blair&#x27;s wife was Mary Woodbury, a daughter of Levi Woodbury. They had one daughter, Minnie Blair, and had three sons, Woodbury Blair, Gist Blair, and Montgomery Blair Jr., all of whom were attorneys.

==In popular culture==
*Blair is portrayed by actor Lew Temple in the 2012 film &quot;Saving Lincoln&quot;.
*In the 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Blair is inaccurately portrayed by actor Byron Jennings. In the film, Blair is incorrectly depicted as being opposed to the 13th Amendment, referring to it as &quot;rash and dangerous.&quot; In reality, though Blair began the Civil War more concerned with punishing secessionists and restoring the union than abolishing slavery, he accepted the abolition of slavery as necessary despite disliking abolitionists by 1863.
*To commemorate the centennial of the First International Postal Conference, Blair&#x27;s portrait appeared on a U.S. airmail stamp, Scott catalogue C66, was issued in 1963.

<text>The former State Anthem of the Republic of Kazakhstan was used as the national anthem of Kazakhstan from 1991 to early 2006. Upon independence in December 1991, the melody of the Anthem of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, composed by musicians Mūqan Tölebaev, Yevgeny Brusilovsky and Latif Hamidi, was retained; and new lyrics written by authors Mūzafar Älımbaev, Qadyr Myrza Älı, Tūmanbai Moldağaliev and Jadyra Därıbaeva were adopted in 1992. The lyrics were written by four people including poet Jadyra Därıbaeva (Жадыра Дәрібаева), one of only a handful of women to have ever been involved in writing a national anthem.

On 7 January 2006, it was officially replaced by &quot;Menıñ Qazaqstanym&quot;, the country&#x27;s current national anthem.

<text>Zadar ( , ), historically known as Zara (from Venetian and Italian, ; see also other names), is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Croatia. It is situated on the Adriatic Sea, at the northwestern part of Ravni Kotari region. Zadar serves as the seat of Zadar County and of the wider northern Dalmatian region. The city proper covers with a population of 75,082 , making it the second-largest city of the region of Dalmatia and the fifth-largest city in the country.

Today, Zadar is a historical center of Dalmatia, Zadar County&#x27;s principal political, cultural, commercial, industrial, educational, and transportation centre. Zadar is also the episcopal see of the Archdiocese of Zadar. Because of its rich heritage, Zadar is today one of the most popular Croatian tourist destinations, named &quot;entertainment center of the Adriatic&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Croatia&#x27;s new capital of cool&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list included the fortified city of Zadar as part of the Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: &quot;Stato da Terra&quot; – Western &quot;Stato da Mar&quot; in 2017.

== Etymology and historical names ==
The name of the city of Zadar emerged as &quot;Iadera&quot; and &quot;Iader&quot; in ancient times. It was most probably related to a hydrographical term, coined by an ancient Mediterranean people and their Pre-Indo-European language. They transmitted it to later settlers, the Liburnians. The name of the Liburnian settlement was first mentioned by a Greek inscription from Pharos (Stari grad) on the island of Hvar in 384 BC, where the citizens of Zadar were noted as (&quot;Iadasinoi&quot;). According to the Greek source Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax the city was (&quot;Idassa&quot;), probably a Greek transcription of the original Liburnian expression.

During Antiquity the name was often recorded in sources in Latin in two forms: &quot;Iader&quot; in the inscriptions and in the writings of classic writers, &quot;Iadera&quot; predominantly among the late Antiquity writers, while usual ethnonyms were &quot;Iadestines&quot; and &quot;Iadertines&quot;. The accent was on the first syllable in both Iader and Iadera forms, which influenced the early-Medieval Dalmatian forms &quot;Jadra&quot;, &quot;Jadera&quot; and &quot;Jadertina&quot;, where the accent kept its original place.

In Dalmatian, &quot;Jadra&quot;/&quot;Jadera&quot; was pronounced &quot;Zadra&quot;/&quot;Zadera&quot;, due to the phonetic transformation of &quot;Ja&quot;- to &quot;Za&quot;-. That change was also reflected in the Croatian name &quot;Zadar&quot; (recorded as &quot;Zader&quot; in the 12th century), developed from masculine &quot;Zadъrъ&quot;. An ethnonym graphic &quot;Jaderani&quot; from the legend of Saint Chrysogonus in the 9th century, was identical to the initial old-Slavic form &quot;Zadъrane&quot;, or Renaissance Croatian &quot;Zadrani&quot;.

The Dalmatian names &quot;Jadra&quot;, &quot;Jadera&quot; were transferred to other languages; in Venetian (hyper-urbanism in the 9th century) and , Hungarian , Tuscan &quot;Giara&quot;, Latin &quot;Iadora&quot; and &quot;Diadora&quot; (Constantine VII in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, 10th century, probably an error in the transcription of ), Old French &quot;Jadres&quot; (Geoffroy de Villehardouin in the chronicles of the Fourth Crusade in 1202), Arabic &quot;Jādhara&quot; () and &quot;Jādara&quot; () (Al-Idrisi, 12th century), &quot;Iadora&quot; (Guido, 12th century), Catalan &quot;Jazara&quot;, &quot;Jara&quot;, &quot;Sarra&quot; (14th century) and the others.

Jadera became Zara when it fell under the authority of the Republic of Venice in the 15th century. Zara was later used by the Austrian Empire in the 19th century, but it was provisionally changed to Zadar/Zara from 1910 to 1920; from 1920 to 1947 the city became part of Italy as Zara, and finally was named &quot;Zadar&quot; in 1947.

==Geography==

Zadar faces the islands of Ugljan and Pašman (part of the Zadar Archipelago), from which it is separated by the narrow Zadar Strait. The promontory on which the old city stands used to be separated from the mainland by a deep moat which has since been filled. The harbour, to the north-east of the town, is safe and spacious.

===Climate===
Zadar has a borderline humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). Zadar has mild, wet winters and very warm, humid summers. July and August are the hottest months, with an average high temperature around . The highest temperature ever was on 5 August 2017 at the Zadar Zemunik station (records since 1981) and at the old Zadar climate station on 6 August 2022 (records since 1961). Temperatures can consistently reach over during the summer months, but during spring and autumn may also reach almost every year. Temperatures below are rare, and are not maintained for more than a few days. January is the coldest month, with an average temperature around . The lowest temperature ever recorded in Zadar was on 28 February 2018 at the Zadar Zemunik weather station and on 23 January 1963 at the old Zadar climate station. Through July and August temperature has never dropped below . October and November are the wettest months, with a total precipitation of about , respectively. July is the driest month, with a total precipitation of around . Winter is the wettest season, however it can rain in Zadar at any time of the year. Snow is exceedingly rare, but it may fall in December, January, February and much more rarely in March. On average Zadar has 1.4 days of snow a year, but it is more likely that there isn’t snow. The sea temperature goes from in February to in July and August, but it is possible to swim from May to October, sometimes even until November. Sometimes, in February, the sea temperature can drop to and, in July, it can exceed .

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The district of present-day Zadar has been populated since prehistoric times. The earliest evidence of human life comes from the Late Stone Age, while numerous settlements have been dated as early as the Neolithic. Before the Illyrians, the area was inhabited by an ancient Mediterranean people of a pre-Indo-European culture. They assimilated with the Indo-Europeans who settled between the 4th and 2nd millennium BC into a new ethnical unity, that of the Liburnians. Zadar was a Liburnian settlement, laid out in the 9th century BC, built on a small stone islet and embankments where the old city stands and tied to the mainland by the overflown narrow isthmus, which created a natural port in its northern strait.

=== Antiquity ===
The Liburnians, an Illyrian tribe, were known as great sailors and merchants, but also had a reputation for piracy in the later years. By the 7th century BC, Zadar had become an important centre for their trading activities with the Phoenicians, Etruscans, Ancient Greeks and other Mediterranean peoples. Its population at that time is estimated at 2,000. From the 9th to the 6th century there was certain cultural unity in the Adriatic Sea, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority through several centuries. Due to its geographical position, Zadar developed into a main seat of the Liburnian thalassocracy and took a leading role in the Liburnian &quot;tetradekapolis&quot;, an organization of 14 communes.

The people of Zadar, &quot;Iadasinoi&quot;, were first mentioned in 384 BC as the allies of the natives of Hvar and the leaders of an eastern Adriatic coast coalition in the fight against the Greek colonizers. An expedition of 10,000 men in 300 ships sailed out from Zadar and laid siege to the Greek colony Pharos in the island of Hvar, but the Syracusan fleet of &quot;Dionysus&quot; was alerted and attacked the siege fleet. The naval victory went to the Greeks which allowed them relatively safer further colonization in the southern Adriatic.

The archaeological remains have shown that the main centres of Liburnian territorial units or municipalities were already urbanized in the last centuries of the BC era. Before the Roman conquest, in the 2nd century BC, Zadar held a territory of more than .

In the middle of the 2nd century BC, the Romans began to gradually invade the region. Although being first Roman enemies in the Adriatic Sea, the Liburnians, mostly stood aside in more than 230 years of Roman wars with the Illyrians, to protect their naval and trade connections in the sea. In 59 BC, Illyricum was assigned as a &quot;provincia&quot; (zone of responsibility) to Julius Caesar and Liburnian Iadera became a Roman municipium.

The Liburnian naval force was dragged into the Roman civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey in 49 BC, partially by force, partially because of the local interests of the participants, the Liburnian cities. Caesar was supported by the urban Liburnian centres, like &quot;Iader&quot; (Zadar), &quot;Aenona&quot; (Nin) and &quot;Curicum&quot; (Krk), while the city of &quot;Issa&quot; (Vis) and the rest of the Liburnians gave their support to Pompey. In 49 BC near the island of Krk, the &quot;Navy of Zadar&quot;, equipped by the fleets of a few Liburnian cities and supported by some Roman ships, lost an important naval battle against Pompey supporting the &quot;Liburnian navy&quot;. The civil war was prolonged until the end of 48 BC, when Caesar rewarded his supporters in Liburnian &quot;Iader&quot; and Dalmatian &quot;Salona&quot;, by giving the status of the Roman colonies to their communities. Thus the city was granted the title &quot;colonia Iulia Iader&quot;, after its founder, and in the next period some of the Roman colonists (mostly legionary veterans) settled there.

The real establishment of the Roman province of Illyricum occurred not earlier than 33 BC and Octavian&#x27;s military campaign in Illyria and Liburnia, when the Liburnians finally lost their naval independence and their galleys and sailors were incorporated into the Roman naval fleets.

From the early days of Roman rule, Zadar gained its Roman urban character and developed into one of the most flourishing centres on the eastern Adriatic coast, a state of affairs which lasted for several hundred years. The town was organised according to the typical Roman street system with a rectangular street plan, a forum, thermae, a sewage and water supply system that came from lake Vrana, by way of a long aqueduct. It did not play a significant role in the Roman administration of Dalmatia, although the archaeological finds tell us about a significant growth of economy and culture.

Christianity did not bypass the Roman province of Dalmatia. Already by the end of the 3rd century Zadar had its own bishop and founding of its Christian community took place; a new religious centre was built north of the forum together with a basilica and a baptistery, as well as other ecclesiastical buildings. According to some estimates, in the 4th century it had probably around ten thousand citizens, including the population from its &quot;ager&quot;, the nearby islands and hinterland, an admixture of the indigenous Liburnians and Roman colonists.

=== Early Middle Ages ===

During the Migration Period and the Barbarian invasions, Zadar was one of the remaining Dalmatian city-states, but it stagnated. In 441 and 447 Dalmatia was ravaged by the Huns, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in 481 Dalmatia became part of the Ostrogothic kingdom, which, besides Italy, already included the more northerly parts of Illyricum, i.e. Pannonia and Noricum.

In the 5th century, under the rule of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, Zadar became poor with many civic buildings ruined due to its advanced age. About the same time (6th century) it was hit by an earthquake, which destroyed entire complexes of monumental Roman architecture, whose parts would later serve as material for building houses. This caused a loss of population and created demographic changes in the city, then gradually repopulated by the inhabitants from its hinterland. However, during six decades of Gothic rule, the Goths saved those old Roman Municipal institutions that were still in function, while religious life in Dalmatia even intensified in the last years, so that there was a need for the foundation of additional bishoprics.

In 536, the Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great started a military campaign to reconquer the territories of the former Western Empire (see Gothic War) and in 553 Zadar passed to the Byzantine Empire. In 568, Dalmatia was devastated by an Avar invasion. Although further waves of attacks by Avar and Slav tribes kept up the pressure, it was the only city which survived due to its protective belt of inland plains. The Dalmatian capital Salona was captured and destroyed in the 640s, so Zadar became the new seat of the Byzantine archonty of Dalmatia, territorially reduced to a few coastal cities with their agers and municipal lands at the coast and the islands nearby. The prior of Zadar had jurisdiction over all Byzantine Dalmatia, so Zadar enjoyed metropolitan status at the eastern Adriatic coast. At this time rebuilding began to take place in the city.
At the beginning of the 9th century the Zadar bishop Donatus and the city duke Paul mediated in the dispute between the Holy Roman empire under Pepin and the Byzantine Empire. The Franks held Zadar for a short time, but the city was returned to Byzantium by a decision of the 812 Treaty of Aachen.

Zadar&#x27;s economy revolved around the sea, fishing and sea trade in the first centuries of the Middle Ages. Thanks to saved Antique ager, adjusted municipal structure and a new strategic position, it became the most important city between the Kvarner islands and Kaštela Bay. Byzantine Dalmatia was not territorially unified, but an alliance of city municipalities headed by Zadar, and the large degree of city autonomy allowed the development of Dalmatian cities as free communes. Forced to turn their attention seawards, the inhabitants of Zadar focused on shipping, and the city became a naval power to rival Venice. The citizens were Dalmatian speakers, but from the 7th century Croatian started to spread in the region, becoming predominant in the inland and the islands to the end of the 9th century.

The Mediterranean and Adriatic cities developed significantly during a period of peace from the last decades of the 9th to the middle of the 10th century. Especially favourable conditions for navigation in the Adriatic Sea occurred since the Saracen raids had finished. Also the adjustment of relations with the Croats enabled Zadar merchants to trade with its rich agriculture hinterland where the Kingdom of Croatia had formed, and trade and political links with Zadar began to develop. Croatian settlers began to arrive, becoming commonplace by the 10th century, occupying all city classes, as well as important posts, like those of prior, judge, priest and others. In 925, Tomislav, the Duke of Croatian Dalmatia, united Croatian Dalmatia and Pannonia establishing the Croatian Kingdom.

Following the dynastic struggle between the descendants of king Stjepan Držislav after his death in 997, the city was besieged in 998 by the army of the Bulgarian emperor Samuel but managed to defend itself.

=== High Middle Ages ===
At the time of Zadar&#x27;s medieval development, the city became a threat to Venice&#x27;s ambitions, because of its strategic position at the centre of the eastern Adriatic coast.

In 998, Zadar sought Venetian protection against the Neretvian pirates. The Venetians were quick to fully exploit this opportunity: in 998 a fleet commanded by Doge Pietro Orseolo II, after having defeated pirates, landed on Korčula and Lastovo. Dalmatia was taken by surprise and offered little serious resistance. Trogir was the exception and was subjected to Venetian rule only after a bloody struggle, whereas Dubrovnik was forced to pay tribute. Tribute previously paid by Zadar to Croatian kings, was redirected to Venice, a state of affairs which lasted for several years.

Zadar citizens started to work for the full independence of Zadar and from the 1030s the city was formally a vassal of the Byzantine Empire. The head of this movement was the mightiest Zadar patrician family – the Madi. After negotiations with Byzantium, Zadar was attached to the Croatian state led by king Petar Krešimir IV in 1069. Later, after the death of king Dmitar Zvonimir in 1089 and ensuing dynastic run-ins, in 1105 Zadar accepted the rule of the first Croato-Hungarian king, Coloman, King of Hungary.

In the meantime Venice developed into a true trading force in the Adriatic and started attacks on Zadar. The city was repeatedly invaded by Venice between 1111 and 1154 and then once more between 1160 and 1183, when it finally rebelled, appealing to the Pope and to the Croato-Hungarian throne for protection.

Zadar was especially devastated in 1202 after the Venetian Doge Enrico Dandolo used the crusaders, on their Fourth Crusade to Palestine, to lay siege to the city. The crusaders were obliged to pay Venice for sea transport to Egypt. As they were not able to produce enough money, the Venetians used them to initiate the Siege of Zadar, when the city was ransacked, demolished and robbed. Emeric, king of Croatia and Hungary, condemned the crusade, because of an argument about the possible heresy committed by God&#x27;s army in attacking a Christian city. Nonetheless, Zadar was devastated and captured, with the population escaping into the surrounding countryside. Pope Innocent III excommunicated the Venetians and crusaders involved in the siege.

Two years later, 1204, under the leadership of the Croatian nobleman Domald from Šibenik, most of the refugees returned and liberated the city from what remained of the crusader force. In the same year Domald became &quot;comes&quot; (duke) of Zadar, but the following year Venetian authority was re-established and a peace agreement signed with hard conditions for the citizens. The only profit which the Communal Council of Zadar derived from this was one third of the city&#x27;s harbour taxes, probably insufficient even for the most indispensable communal needs.

This did not break the spirit of the city, however. Its commerce was suffering due to a lack of autonomy under Venice, while it enjoyed considerable autonomy under the much more feudal Kingdom of Croatia-Hungary. A number of insurrections followed (1242–1243, 1320s, 1345–1346 – the latter resulted in a sixteen-month-long Venetian siege) which finally resulted in Zadar coming back under the crown of King Louis I of Croatia-Hungary under the Treaty of Zadar, in 1358. After the War of Chioggia between Genoa and Venice, Chioggia concluded on 14 March 1381 an alliance with Zadar and Trogir against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because Šibenik became in 1412 the seat of the main customs office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a monopoly on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole Adriatic Sea. After the death of Louis, Zadar recognized the rule of king Sigismund, and after him, that of Ladislaus of Naples. During his reign Croatia-Hungary was enveloped in a bloody civil war. In 1409, Venice, seeing that Ladislaus was about to be defeated, and eager to exploit the situation despite its relative military weakness, offered to buy his &quot;rights&quot; on Dalmatia for a mere 100,000 ducats. Knowing he had lost the region in any case, Ladislaus accepted. Zadar was, thus sold back to the Venetians for a paltry sum.

The population of Zadar during the medieval period was predominantly Croatian, according to numerous archival documents, and Croatian was used in liturgy, as shown by the writings of cardinal Boson, who followed Pope Alexander III en route to Venice in 1177. When the papal ships took shelter in the harbour of Zadar, the inhabitants greeted the Pope by singing lauds and canticles in Croatian.
Even though interspersed by sieges and destruction, the time between the 11th and 14th centuries was the golden age of Zadar. Thanks to its political and trading achievements, and also to its skilled seamen, Zadar played an important role among the cities on the east coast of the Adriatic. This affected its appearance and culture: many churches, rich monasteries and palaces for powerful families were built, together with the Chest of Saint Simeon. One of the best examples of the culture and prosperity of Zadar at that time was the founding of the University of Zadar, built in 1396 by the Dominican Order (the oldest university in present-day Croatia).

=== 15th to 18th centuries ===

After the death of Louis I, Zadar came under the rule of Sigmund of Luxembourg and later Ladislaus of Naples, who, witnessing his loss of influence in Dalmatia, sold Zadar and his dynasty&#x27;s rights to Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 ducats on 31 July 1409. Venice therefore obtained control over Zadar without a fight, but was confronted by the resistance and tensions of important Zadar families. These attempts were met with persecution and confiscation. Zadar remained the administrative seat of Dalmatia, but this time under the rule of Venice, which expanded over the whole Dalmatia, except the Republic of Ragusa/Dubrovnik. During that time Giorgio da Sebenico, a renaissance sculptor and architect, famous for his work on the Cathedral of Šibenik, was born in Zadar. Other important people followed, such as Luciano and Francesco Laurana, known worldwide for their sculptures and buildings.
The 16th and 17th centuries were noted in Zadar for Ottoman attacks. Ottomans captured the continental part of Zadar at the beginning of the 16th century and the city itself was all the time in the range of Turkish artillery. Due to that threat, the construction of a new system of castles and walls began. These defense systems changed the way the city looked. To make place for the pentagon castles many houses and churches were taken down, along with an entire suburb: Varoš of St. Martin. After the 40-year-long construction Zadar became the biggest fortified city in Dalmatia, empowered by a system of castles, bastions and canals filled with seawater. The city was supplied by the water from public city cisterns. During the complete makeover of Zadar, many new civic buildings were built, such as the City Lodge and City Guard on the Gospodski Square, several army barracks, but also some large new palaces.

In contrast to the insecurity and Ottoman sieges and destruction, an important culture evolved midst the city walls. During the 16th and the 17th centuries Zadar was still under the influence of the Renaissance, which had created an environment in which arts and literature could flourish, despite the ongoing conflicts outside the city walls. This period saw the rise of many important Italian Renaissance figures, such as the painters Giorgio Ventura and Andrea Meldolla, and the humanist scholar Giovanni Francesco Fortunio, who wrote the first Italian grammar book. Meanwhile, the activity of the Croatian writers and poets became prolific (Jerolim Vidolić, Petar Zoranić, Brne Karnarutić, Juraj Baraković, Šime Budinić).

During the continuous Ottoman danger the population stagnated by a significant degree along with the economy. During the 16th and 17th centuries several large-scale epidemics of bubonic plague erupted in the city. After more than 150 years of Turkish threat Zadar was not only scarce in population, but also in material wealth. Venice sent new colonists and, under the firm hand of archbishop Vicko Zmajević, the Arbanasi (Catholic Albanian refugees) settled in the city, forming a new suburb. Despite the shortage of money, the Teatro Nobile (lit., noble theater) was built in 1783. It functioned for over 100 years.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

In 1797 with the Treaty of Campo Formio, the Republic of Venice, including Zadar, came under the Austrian crown. In 1806 it was briefly given to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, until in 1809 it was added to the French Illyrian Provinces. In November 1813 an Austrian force blockaded the town with the assistance of two British Royal Navy frigates HMS &quot;Havannah&quot; and &quot;Weazle&quot; under the 3rd Earl of Cadogan. On 9 December the French garrison of Zadar capitulated, and by the end of the year all of Dalmatia was brought back under the control of the Austrian Empire. After the Congress of Vienna (1815) until 1918, the town (bilingual name &quot;Zara – Zadar&quot; ) remained part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 13 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Dalmatia. The Italian name of the city was officially used before 1867. It remained also the capital of Dalmatia province (&quot;Kronland&quot;).

Although during the first half of the 19th century the city population stagnated due to low natural increase, the city started to spread from the old center; citizens from the old city created the new suburb of Stanovi in the north.

During the second half of the 19th century, there was constant increase of population due to economic growth and immigration. Under the pressure of the population increase, the city continued to spread to Voštarnica and Arbanasi quarters, and the bridge in the city port was built. Except being the administrative center of the province, agriculture, industry of liqueurs and trade were developed, many brotherhoods were established, similar to the Central European trade guilds. The southern city walls were torn down, new coastal facilities were built and Zadar became an &quot;open port&quot;. As the city developed economically, it developed culturally. A large number of printshops, new libraries, archives, and theatres sprung up. At the end of the 19th century there was also a stronger industrial development, with 27 small or big factories before World War I.

After 1848, Italian and Croatian nationalistic ideas arrived in the city, which became divided between the Croats and the Italians, both of whom founded their respective political parties.

There are conflicting sources for both sides claiming to have formed the majority in Zadar in this period. The archives of the official Austro-Hungarian censuses conducted around the end of 19th century show that Italian was the primary language spoken by the majority of the people in the city (9,018 Italians and 2,551 Croatians in 1900), but only by a third of the population in the entire county (9,234 vs. 21,753 the same year).

During the 19th century, the conflict between Zadar&#x27;s Italian and Croatian communities grew in intensity and changed its nature. Until the beginning of the century it had been of moderate intensity and mainly of a class nature (under Venetian rule the Italians were employed in the most profitable activities, such as trade and administration). With the development of the modern concept of national identity across Europe, national conflicts started to mark the political life of Zadar.

During the second part of the 19th century, Zadar was subject to the same policy enacted by the Austrian Empire in South-Tyrol, the Austrian Littoral and Dalmatia and consisting in fostering the local German or Croatian culture at the expense of the Italian. In Zadar and generally throughout Dalmatia, the Austrian policy had the objective to reduce the possibility of any future territorial claim by the Kingdom of Italy.

=== Italy (1918–1947) ===


In 1915, Italy entered World War I under the provisions set in the Treaty of London. In exchange for its participation with the Triple Entente and in the event of victory, Italy was to obtain the following territory in northern Dalmatia, including Zadar, Šibenik and most of the Dalmatian islands, except Krk and Rab. At the end of the war, Italian military forces invaded Dalmatia and seized control of Zara, with Admiral Enrico Millo being proclaimed the governor of Dalmatia. Famous Italian nationalist Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio supported the seizure of Dalmatia, and proceeded to Zadar in an Italian warship in December 1918.

During 1918, political life in Zadar intensified. The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy led to the renewal of national conflicts in the city. With the arrival of an Italian army of occupation in the city on 4 November 1918 within the framework of allied occupation of the eastern Adriatic, the Italian faction gradually assumed control, a process which was completed on 5 December when it took over the governorship. With the Treaty of Versailles (10 January 1920) Italian claims on Dalmatia contained in the Treaty of London were nullified, but later on the agreements between the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes set in the Treaty of Rapallo (12 November 1920) gave Zadar with other small local territories to Italy.

The Zadar enclave, a total of , included the city of Zadar, the municipalities of Bokanjac, Arbanasi, Crno, part of Diklo (a total of 51 km2 of territory and 17,065 inhabitants) and the islands of Lastovo and Palagruža (, 1,710 inhabitants). The territory was organized into a small Italian province, the province of Zara. According to the 1921 census, in the &quot;comune&quot; of Zara there were 12,075 Dalmatian Italians and 1,255 Croatians.

=== World War II ===

Germany, Italy, and other Axis Powers, invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Zadar held a force of 9,000 and was one of the starting points of the invasion. The force reached Šibenik and Split on 15 April (2 days before surrender). Civilians were previously evacuated to Ancona . Occupying Mostar and Dubrovnik, on 17 April they met invading troops that had started out from Italian-occupied Albania. On 17 April the Yugoslav government surrendered, faced with the Wehrmacht&#x27;s overwhelming superiority.

Mussolini required the newly formed Nazi puppet-state, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (NDH) to hand over almost all of Dalmatia (including Split) to Italy under the Rome Treaties.

The city became the center of a new Italian territorial entity, the Governorate of Dalmatia, including the enlarged province of Zara (now Zadar), the province of Cattaro (now Kotor), and the province of Spalato (Split).

Under Italian rule, the Croats were subjected to a policy of forced assimilation. This created immense resentment among the Yugoslav people. The Yugoslav Partisan movement took root in Zadar, even though more than 70% of the population of Zadar was Italian.

After Mussolini was removed from power on 25 July 1943, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, which was announced on 8 September 1943, and the Italian army collapsed. Then on 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans, and formed the Nazi-puppet Italian Social Republic. German troops (114th Jäger Division) entered Zadar on 10 September and took over. This avoided a temporary liberation by Partisans, as was the case in Split and Šibenik. Zadar was placed under the control of the Italian Social Republic.

The NDH proclaimed the Treaty of Rome to be void and occupied Dalmatia with German support but the NDH was prevented from taking over Zadar on the grounds that Zadar itself was not subject to the conditions of the 1941 Treaty of Rome. Despite this, NDH leader Ante Pavelić designated Zadar as the capital of the Sidraga-Ravni Kotari County, although the county administrator could not enter the city.

During World War II, Zadar was bombed by the Allies, from November 1943 to October 1944. Estimated fatalities range from under 1,000, up to as many as 4,000 of the city&#x27;s 20,000 inhabitants. Over the course of the bombing, 80% of the city&#x27;s buildings were destroyed. Zadar has been called the &quot;Dresden of the Adriatic&quot; because of perceived similarities to the Allied bombing of Dresden.

In late October 1944, the German army and most of the Italian civilian administration abandoned the city, except the Vice Prefect Giacomo Vuxani. On 31 October 1944, the Partisans seized the city, until then a part of Mussolini&#x27;s Italian Social Republic. At the start of World War II, Zadar had a population of 24,000; by the end of 1944, this had decreased to 6,000. Though controlled by the Partisans, Zadar remained under nominal Italian sovereignty until the Paris Peace Treaties that took effect on 15 September 1947. After the war Dalmatian Italians of Zadar left Yugoslavia towards Italy (Istrian–Dalmatian exodus).

=== SFR Yugoslavia (1947–1991) ===

In 1947, Zadar became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Republic of Croatia. In the first decade after the war, the city&#x27;s population increase was slow and still did not reach its pre-war numbers. The Italian exodus from the city continued and in a few years was almost total. It is estimated that around 10,000 Italians emigrated from Zadar. In October 1953, the last Italian schools in the area were closed. Today the Italian community counts only a few hundred people, gathered into a local community (&quot;Comunità degli Italiani di Zara&quot;).

The city recorded a large population increase in the late 1950s and the 1960s, mainly due to immigration as the government encouraged migration from rural areas to urban centers and their industrial development. Construction of the Adriatic Highway, railway and civil airport contributed to the development of tourism and the accessibility of Zadar. Population growth slowed down in the following decades. In the late 1980s, due to the economic crisis in Yugoslavia, Zadar&#x27;s economy began stagnating.

=== Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995) ===

In 1990, Serb separatists from Dalmatian Hinterland sealed roads and effectively blocked Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia during the Log Revolution. In March 1991, the Croatian War of Independence broke out. It affected Zadar and its surroundings. A number of non-Serbs were expelled from the area and several Croatian policemen were killed resulting in the 1991 anti-Serb riot in Zadar. Serbs at that time accounted for about 14% of the population.

The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) and forces of the SAO Krajina occupied parts of Zadar&#x27;s hinterland, converged on the city and subjected it to artillery bombardment during the Battle of Zadar. Along with other Croatian towns in the area, Serb forces shelled Zadar sporadically, damaging buildings and homes as well as UNESCO protected sites. Serb forces also attacked a number of nearby towns and villages, the most brutal attack being the Škabrnja massacre in which Krajina Territorial Defense troops killed 62 Croatian civilians and five prisoners of war.

Land connections with Zagreb were severed for over a year. The only link between the north and south of the country was via the island of Pag. The siege of the city lasted from 1991 until January 1993 when Zadar and the surrounding area came under the control of Croatian forces and the bridge link with the rest of Croatia was reestablished in Operation Maslenica. Attacks on the city continued until the end of the war in 1995.

Some of the countryside along the No. 8 highway running north east is still sectioned off due to land mines.

== Main sights ==



=== Architecture ===
Zadar gained its urban structure in Roman times; during the time of Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus, the town was fortified and the city walls with towers and gates were built. On the western side of the town were the forum, the basilica and the temple, while outside the town were the amphitheatre and cemeteries. The aqueduct which supplied the town with water is partially preserved. Inside the ancient town, a medieval town had developed with a series of churches and monasteries being built.

During the Middle Ages, Zadar fully gained its urban aspect, which has been maintained until today. In the first half of the 16th century, Venice fortified the town with a new system of defensive walls on the side facing land. In the course of the century architectural building in the Renaissance style was continued and defensive trenches (Foša) were also built. They were completely buried during the Italian occupation until 1873 when, under Austrian rule, the ramparts of Zadar were converted from fortifications into elevated promenades commanding extensive seaward and landward views, thus being the wall lines preserved; of its four old gates one, the Porta Marina, incorporates the relics of a Roman arch, and another, the Porta di Terraferma, was designed in the 16th century by the Veronese artist Michele Sanmicheli. In the bombardments during World War II entire blocks were destroyed but some structures survived.

Most important landmarks include:
* Roman Forum – the largest on the eastern side of the Adriatic, founded by the first Roman Emperor Augustus, as shown by two stone inscriptions about its completion dating from the 3rd century.
* Most Roman remains were used in the construction of the fortifications, but two squares are embellished with lofty marble columns; a Roman tower stands on the eastern side of the town; and some remains of a Roman aqueduct may be seen outside the ramparts.
* Church of St. Donatus – a monumental round building from the 9th century in pre-Romanesque style, traditionally but erroneously said to have been erected on the site of a temple of Juno. It is the most important preserved structure of its period in Dalmatia; the massive dome of the rotunda is surrounded by a vaulted gallery in two stories which also extends around the three apses to the east. The church treasury contains some of the finest Dalmatian metalwork; notably the pastoral staff of Bishop Valaresso (1460).
* St. Anastasia&#x27;s Cathedral (Croatian: &quot;Sv. Stošija&quot;), basilica in Romanesque style built in the 12th to 13th century (high Romanesque style), the largest cathedral in Dalmatia.
* Churches of St. Chrysogonus and St. Simeon are also architectural examples in the Romanesque style. The latter houses the ark or reliquary of St. Simeon (1380), made in gilted silver by Francesco Antonio da Milano under commission of queen Elizabeth of Hungary.
* St Chrysogonus&#x27;s Church – monumental Romanesque church of very fine proportions and refined Romanesque ornaments.
* St Elijah&#x27;s Church (Croatian: &quot;Sv. Ilija&quot;)
* St Francis&#x27; Church – Gothic styled church, site of the signing of the Zadar Peace Treaty 1358. Its choir is home to several carved stalls, executed in 1394 by the Venetian Giovanni di Giacomo da Borgo San Sepolcro.
* Five Wells Square
* St Mary&#x27;s Church, which retains a fine Romanesque campanile from 1105, belongs to a Benedictine Convent founded in 1066 by a noblewoman of Zadar by the name of Cika with the permanent Ecclesiastical art exhibition &quot;The Gold and Silver of Zadar&quot;.
* Citadel. Built in 1409 southwest of the Land Gate, it has remained the same to this day.
* Land Gate – built to a design by the Venetian architect Michele Sanmicheli in 1543.
* The unique sea organ
* The Great Arsenal 
* Among the other chief buildings are the Loggia del Comune, rebuilt in 1565, and containing a public library; the old palace of the priors, now the governor&#x27;s residence; and the episcopal palaces.

=== Culture ===

The first university of Zadar was mentioned in writing as early as in 1396 and it was a part of a Dominican monastery. It closed in 1807.

Between the 15th and 17th centuries Zadar was an important Renaissance center, producing an array of Italian Dalmatia architects, sculptors, painters and scholars such as Giorgio da Sebenico, Laurana and Francesco Laurana, Giorgio Ventura, Andrea Meldolla and Giovanni Francesco Fortunio (who wrote the first Italian grammar book).

Zadar was, along with Split and Dubrovnik, also one of the centres of the development of Croatian literature. The 15th and 16th centuries were marked by important activities of Croatians writing in the national language: Jerolim Vidolić, Petar Zoranić (who wrote the first Croatian novel, Planine), Brne Karnarutić, Juraj Baraković, Šime Budinić.

Under French rule (1806–1810), the first Dalmatian newspaper &quot;Il Regio Dalmata – Kraglski Dalmatin&quot; was published in Zadar. It was printed in Italian and Croatian; the latter used for the first time in a newspaper.

In the second half of the 19th century, Zadar was a centre of the movement for the cultural and national revivals in Dalmatia (Italian and Croatian).

Today Zadar&#x27;s cultural institutions include:
* The Croatian Theatre House

== Demographics ==

Zadar is the fifth largest city in Croatia and the second largest in Dalmatia, with a population of 70,779 according to the 2021 census. The 2021 census shows Zadar with a population of 67,134 or 94.85% of its citizens being ethnic Croats. The second largest ethnic group according to the 2021 census are Serbs, with 1,371 or 1.94% of the population 

The city belonged for centuries to the Republic of Venice within the so-called Venetian Dalmatia, of which it was the capital, and for this reason, there was a significant community of Italians in Zadar, the Dalmatian Italians. According to the Austrian censuses they were 7,423 Dalmatian Italians (64.6% of the total population) in 1890, 9,018 (69.3%) in 1900, and 9,318 (66.3%) in 1910 and 12,075 (70.8%) in 1921, before the Istrian–Dalmatian exodus, the Dalmatian Italians were of the city&#x27;s population. Their number dropped drastically following the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which took place from 1943 to 1960.

==Education==
There are nine primary schools and 16 secondary schools, including six gymnasiums, in Zadar.

===University===

The University of Zadar was founded by the Dominicans in 1396 as &quot;Universitas Iadertina&quot;, a theological seminary. It was the first institute of higher learning in the country. In 1807 it ceased to become an independent institution and its functions were taken over by other local universities. In 1956 the University of Zagreb, the country&#x27;s second oldest university, re-established it as its satellite Faculty of Arts campus. The Faculty later became a part of the University of Split, and in 2003, a full-fledged independent university. University comprises 25 departments with more than 6.000 students.

==Science==
In 1998, Zadar hosted the Central European Olympiad in Informatics (CEOI).

== Transportation ==
In the 20th century, roads became more important than sea routes, but Zadar remained an important traffic point. The main road along the Adriatic passes through the city. In the immediate vicinity is the Zagreb–Dubrovnik highway which connects to Split and it was completed in 2005. Zadrans can access to the highway by two interchanges: Zadar 1 exit in the north and Zadar 2 highway hub near Zemunik in the south. The southern interchange is connected to Zadar port of Gaženica by the D424 expressway.

Today, buses are the only kind of ground public transportation with which one can reach Zadar. Zadar&#x27;s bus station is used by both inter-city buses (which provide Zadar&#x27;s connection with the rest of the country) and buses operated by the company &quot;Liburnija&quot; which provide public transit to the city of Zadar and its suburbs.

Since 1966, during the time of Yugoslavia, railway has linked Zadar with Knin, where it joins the mainline from Zagreb to Split.  However, all passenger trains between Knin and Zadar were since 2013 replaced with the buses that ran in organisation of the national railway company Croatian Railways. As the company discounted bus-replacement service in 2020, Zadar has officially become the city without passenger railway connections.

Zadar also has an international ferry line to Ancona in Italy. Ships also connect Zadar with islands of its archipelago from two ferry ports: one located in the town center serving catamaran services and the other one located in the south suburb of Gaženica serving ferry and distant services.

Zadar International Airport is located in Zemunik, around to the east of Zadar and accessible via the expressway. The airport is experiencing year on year an average of 30% increase in passenger traffic mainly due to arrivals of lowcost carriers (Ryanair, InterSky, JobAir, etc.) connecting Zadar from the end of March through October with over 20 cities throughout Europe.

== Sports ==

The basketball club is KK Zadar, the football club HNK Zadar, and the local handball club RK Zadar. The bowling club Kuglački klub Zadar is also very successful. Zadar is also the hometown of Croatian handball player Ivan Ninčević and football players Luka Modrić, Dado Pršo, Šime Vrsaljko and Danijel Subašić.

<text>Jennifer Jason Leigh (born Jennifer Leigh Morrow; February 5, 1962) is an American actress. She began her career on television during the 1970s before making her film breakthrough in the teen film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982). She received critical praise for her performances in &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1989), &quot;Miami Blues&quot; (1990), &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), &quot;Single White Female&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994), and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Dorothy Parker in &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; (1994).

Leigh starred in a 1995 film written by her mother, screenwriter Barbara Turner, titled &quot;Georgia&quot;. She co-wrote and co-directed a film with Alan Cumming titled &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot; (2001). Leigh starred in the crime drama &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002) and the family drama &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot; (2007). She had a recurring role on the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;Weeds&quot; (2009–2012) and received critical acclaim for her voice work in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Anomalisa&quot; (2015). For her role as fugitive Daisy Domergue in &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015), she was nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. From 2017 to 2021, she starred in the Netflix comedy-drama series &quot;Atypical&quot;, while featuring in the science fiction films &quot;Annihilation&quot; (2018) and &quot;Possessor&quot; (2020). She has since starred in the fifth season of the crime drama series &quot;Fargo&quot; (2023).

For her stage work, Leigh was nominated for a Drama Desk award for her off-Broadway performance as Beverly Moss in Mike Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;. Her Broadway debut occurred in 1998, when she became the replacement for the role of Sally Bowles in the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;.

== Early life ==
Leigh was born February 5, 1962, in Los Angeles, California. Her father, Vic Morrow (born Victor Morozoff), was an actor, and her mother, Barbara Turner, was a screenwriter. Her parents divorced when she was two. Leigh&#x27;s birth name was Jennifer Leigh Morrow. She changed her surname early in her acting career, taking the middle name &quot;Jason&quot; in honor of actor Jason Robards, a family friend. Leigh&#x27;s parents were Jewish; her father&#x27;s family was from Russia and her mother&#x27;s from Austria.

Leigh is the younger of two daughters. Her older sister, Carrie Ann Morrow, who was credited as a &quot;technical advisor&quot; on her 1995 film &quot;Georgia&quot;, died in 2016. Leigh also has a half-sister, actress Mina Badie (born &#x27;Badiyi&#x27; – from her mother&#x27;s second marriage). Badie acted alongside Leigh in &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot;. Film director Reza Badiyi became Leigh&#x27;s stepfather when he married Leigh&#x27;s mother, Barbara.

== Career ==

=== 1976–1989 ===

Leigh had a nonspeaking role in her film debut &quot;Death of a Stranger (The Execution)&quot; (1973). At the age of 14, she attended acting workshops, taught by Lee Strasberg, and the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in Loch Sheldrake, New York. Afterwards, she landed a role in the film &quot;The Young Runaways&quot; (1978). She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Baretta&quot; and an episode of &quot;The Waltons&quot;. Several television films followed, including a portrayal of an anorexic teenager in &quot;The Best Little Girl in the World&quot;, for which Leigh dropped to under medical supervision. She made her film debut, as a blind, deaf and mute rape victim in the 1981 slasher film &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot;. She left school to star in the film.

In 1982, Leigh played a pregnant teenager in Amy Heckerling&#x27;s high school film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, which served as a launching pad for several of its young stars. While decrying the writing as sexist and exploitative, film critic Roger Ebert was enthusiastic about the acting, singling out Leigh and writing, &quot;Don&#x27;t they know they have a star on their hands?&quot; With the exception of &quot;Ridgemont High&quot; and a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1983) alongside Rodney Dangerfield, Leigh&#x27;s early film work consisted of playing fragile, damaged or neurotic characters in low-budget horror or thriller films. She played a virginal princess kidnapped and raped by mercenaries in &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (1985), an innocent waitress pursued by the psychopathic title character in &quot;The Hitcher&quot; (1986) (both films pitting her alongside Rutger Hauer), a mentally-disturbed, child-like young woman on the threshold of sexual awakening in the Southern Gothic film &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; (1987), and a young woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown in &quot;Heart of Midnight&quot; (1989).

She was selected as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Most Beautiful Women&quot; by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 1989.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Leigh made a significant career breakthrough when she was awarded New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayals of two very different prostitutes: the tough streetwalker Tralala who is brutally gang-raped in &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, and Susie, a 23-year-old prostitute who falls in love with ex-con Alec Baldwin in &quot;Miami Blues&quot;. Roger Ebert included &quot;Last Exit&quot; in his list of Best Movies of 1990, calling Leigh&#x27;s performance brave, though his review of &quot;Miami Blues&quot; was much less sympathetic, simultaneously criticizing Leigh&#x27;s ability to play dumb roles and praising her ability to play smart roles. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called her &quot;the Meryl Streep of bimbos&quot;.

In his 1991 book &quot;Cult Movie Stars&quot;, Danny Peary described Leigh as &quot;an interesting, always watchable, and extremely talented young actress,&quot; summarizing her appeal &quot;For those who believe that the preacher&#x27;s angelic-looking daughter is as interested in sex as the farmer&#x27;s daughter. This pretty, sweet-looking blonde has played a number of shy and innocent-looking women who are curious about sex; once they learn, they display wicked imaginations.&quot; Peary added, &quot;Leigh seems too gentle and looks too young and innocent to play the parts she has taken. Her females are either hungry for sex and/or have been psychologically affected by past sexual incidents... Her characters are vulnerable and almost always victimised, but usually they gave surprising resilience, and try to use their bad experiences to make themselves stronger.&quot;

Leigh was cast in her first mainstream Hollywood studio film, the firefighter drama &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), in which she played a more conventional role, the girlfriend of lead actor William Baldwin. She found more success in the gritty crime drama &quot;Rush&quot; (1991), portraying an undercover cop who becomes a junkie and falls in love with her partner, played by Jason Patric. Reviewing &quot;Rush&quot;, Roger Ebert noted, &quot;Leigh of course is a veteran by now of grubby characters in sleazy films; she has become one of the best young actresses by accepting roles some of her contemporaries would not even consider... After her extraordinary work as a doomed prostitute in &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, here she is again, looking sweet and wholesome, and descending into a world of people who have forgotten their better natures.&quot; Leigh&#x27;s next film, &quot;Single White Female&quot; (1992), was a surprise box-office success, bringing Leigh to her largest mainstream audience yet, portraying a mentally-ill woman who terrorizes roommate Bridget Fonda.

Leigh was awarded the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain at the 1993 MTV Movie Awards and nominated for Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress. Leigh co-starred with Kathy Bates as a tormented, pill-popping woman hiding a history of childhood sexual abuse in the adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; (1995). Leigh achieved her greatest acclaim in the role of Sadie Flood, an angry, drug-addicted rock singer living in the shadow of her successful older sister (Mare Winningham), in &quot;Georgia&quot; (1995). For the role, Leigh dropped to and sang all of her songs live, including a rambling -minute version of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Back&quot;. &quot;Georgia&quot; was met with critical praise. James Berardinelli wrote, &quot;There are times when it&#x27;s uncomfortable to watch this performance because it&#x27;s so powerful&quot;, and Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Leigh&#x27;s &quot;fierce, risk-taking performance and flashes of overwhelming honesty&quot;.

Leigh won New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and Best Actress from the Montreal World Film Festival, as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination and Sensual Knife fight nomination Some expressed surprise that she was not nominated for an Academy Award, while Winningham was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Throughout the 1990s, Leigh worked with many independent film directors. She worked with Robert Altman in &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), playing a phone-sex operator, and &quot;Kansas City&quot; (1996), as a streetwise kidnapper. Leigh has expressed admiration for Altman and called him her mentor. In a change of pace from her &quot;bad girl&quot; roles, Leigh played the fast-talking reporter Amy Archer in the Coen Brothers&#x27; comic homage to 1950s comedy, &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994). Leigh took her first lead role as the writer and critic Dorothy Parker in Alan Rudolph&#x27;s film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; (1994). She received a Golden Globe Award nomination and a National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, as well as Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and Fort Lauderdale Film Critics Best Actress Award.

In another change of pace, she starred in Agnieszka Holland&#x27;s version of the Henry James novel &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1997), as a mousy 19th-century heiress courted by a gold digger. In 1997, she was featured in Faith No More&#x27;s music video for &quot;Last Cup of Sorrow&quot;. In 1998, she appeared alongside Campbell Scott in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television film &quot;The Love Letter&quot;. In David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;eXistenZ&quot; (1999), she played a virtual-reality game designer who becomes lost in her own creation. Leigh filmed a role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s final film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999) as a grieving patient of Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) who declares her love for him after her father&#x27;s death. Kubrick wanted to reshoot the scenes, but Leigh was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;eXistenZ&quot;; instead, her scenes were cut, and the role was recast with Marie Richardson.

=== 2000s ===
She served as a jury member at the 57th Venice International Film Festival in 2000. Leigh had a brief role as a gangster&#x27;s doomed wife in Sam Mendes&#x27;s &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002) and co-starred as Meg Ryan&#x27;s brutally murdered sister in Jane Campion&#x27;s erotic thriller &quot;In the Cut&quot; (2003). She went on to play Stevie, the prostitute girlfriend of Christian Bale&#x27;s character in the dark thriller &quot;The Machinist&quot; (2004). Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; commented that &quot;As the downtrodden, sexy, trusting, and quietly funny prostitute, Leigh is, of course, in her element&quot;. Her performance as a manipulative stage mother in Don McKellar&#x27;s film &quot;Childstar&quot; won her a Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in 2005.

After many years of wanting to be in a Todd Solondz film, she appeared in &quot;Palindromes&quot; (2004). Leigh was originally cast as Vincent Gallo&#x27;s girlfriend in his self-directed film &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;, and was apparently prepared to perform oral sex on Gallo as the script required. Leigh subsequently commented that &quot;it just didn&#x27;t work out&quot; and the role was eventually played by Chloë Sevigny. She also appeared in the psychological thriller &quot;The Jacket&quot; (2005), alongside Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley. Leigh appeared in the 2008 ensemble film &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; and has acted in two films written and directed by her then-partner Noah Baumbach: &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot;, co-starring Nicole Kidman, and &quot;Greenberg&quot;. Leigh has said that the roles were not specifically written for her, as Baumbach does not write roles with actors in mind. In 2009, Leigh was cast in the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;Weeds&quot;, becoming a regular guest in the eighth season.

Leigh has received three separate career tributes: at the Telluride Film Festival in 1993, a special award for her contribution to independent cinema from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 2002, and a week-long retrospective of her film work held by the American Cinematheque at Los Angeles&#x27;s Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in 2001.

=== 2010s–present ===
Leigh joined the drama series &quot;Revenge&quot; on ABC in 2012. In 2015, Leigh starred in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s western film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. It is set in Wyoming after the Civil War, and was released on December 25. Leigh, along with the rest of the cast, appeared at San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film in July 2015. Leigh&#x27;s performance has received multiple award nominations at various award ceremonies, including her third Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, her first BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 2017, Leigh was reunited with her &quot;Hateful Eight&quot; co-star Tim Roth when the pair played a husband-and-wife team of contract killers in six episodes of Showtime&#x27;s revival of David Lynch and Mark Frost&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

Leigh played psychiatrist Dr. Ventress in the 2018 science fiction film &quot;Annihilation&quot;, alongside Natalie Portman, directed by Alex Garland and based on the novel by Jeff VanDerMeer.

In 2019, Leigh appeared in two episodes of Showtime&#x27;s last season of &quot;The Affair&quot; and narrated the audiobook for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. She appeared in Brandon Cronenberg&#x27;s science fiction thriller Possessor in 2020. In 2022, Leigh was cast in a lead role as Lorraine Lyon in the fifth season of the FX black comedy crime drama anthology series &quot;Fargo&quot;.

=== Stage roles ===
In 1998, Leigh took on the lead role of Sally Bowles in Sam Mendes&#x27;s Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;, succeeding Natasha Richardson, who originated the role in Mendes&#x27;s production. She succeeded Mary-Louise Parker in the lead role in &quot;Proof&quot; on Broadway in 2001. Her other theatrical appearances include &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, &quot;Man of Destiny&quot;, &quot;The Shadow Box&quot;, &quot;Picnic&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;. In 2011, she played Bunny in the Broadway revival of &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; in New York City alongside Ben Stiller and Edie Falco.

=== Writing and directing ===
In 2001, Leigh co-wrote and co-directed &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot;, an independently produced feature film about a recently reconciled married couple who assemble their friends at their Hollywood Hills house, ostensibly to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary. As the evening progresses, the party disintegrates into emotional confrontations and bitter arguments as the façade of their happy marriage crumbles. Leigh was inspired by her recent experience filming the low-budget Dogme 95 film &quot;The King Is Alive&quot;. Leigh and co-writer Alan Cumming drew freely from their personal experiences in the writing of the film. Leigh plays an aging actress who makes jokes about her lack of Academy Award nominations and is fearful of losing her bisexual husband (Cumming). The film was shot in 19 days on digital video, and costarred the pair&#x27;s real-life Hollywood friends, including Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Beals, John C. Reilly, Parker Posey, and Leigh&#x27;s sister Mina Badie. Leigh and Cumming jointly received a citation for Excellence in Filmmaking from the National Board of Review, and were nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature and Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. The film received generally positive reviews.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Leigh&#x27;s father, Vic Morrow, was accidentally killed along with two child actors when a helicopter stunt went wrong during the filming of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;. Leigh and her sister filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Warner Bros., John Landis, and Steven Spielberg. They settled out of court a year later.

Leigh has described herself as shy, introverted, and averse to Hollywood publicity and scandal. Speaking about her roles in smaller, independent films, she said, &quot;I&#x27;d much rather be in a movie that people have really strong feelings about than one that makes a hundred million dollars but you can&#x27;t remember because it&#x27;s just like all the others.&quot;

She met independent film writer-director Noah Baumbach in 2001 while starring on Broadway in &quot;Proof&quot;. The couple married on September 2, 2005. Their son was born on March 17, 2010. Leigh filed for divorce on November 15, 2010, in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. She sought spousal support as well as primary custody of the couple&#x27;s son, with visitation for Baumbach. The divorce was finalized in September 2013.

Following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and the subsequent war, Leigh has heavily voiced support for Israel on Instagram. On February 14, 2024, Leigh signed an open letter written by pro-Israel organization Creative Community for Peace criticizing attempts to remove Israel from Eurovision 2024. Following Jonathan Glazer&#x27;s acceptance speech at the 96th Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film in which he denounced his &quot;Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation...&quot;, Leigh was one of 1,000 Jewish members of the film industry who denounced Glazer&#x27;s speech and defended the Israeli government&#x27;s actions in another open letter.

<text>Stevens Institute of Technology is a private research university in Hoboken, New Jersey. Founded in 1870, it is one of the oldest technological universities in the United States and was the first college in America solely dedicated to mechanical engineering. The 55-acre campus encompasses Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken, a quad, and 43 academic, student and administrative buildings.

Established through an 1868 bequest from Edwin Augustus Stevens, enrollment at Stevens includes more than 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students representing 47 states and 60 countries throughout Asia, Europe and Latin America. Stevens comprises three schools that deliver technology-based STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) degrees and degrees in business, arts, humanities and social sciences: The Charles V. Schaefer Jr., School of Engineering and Science, School of Business, and the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. For undergraduates, Stevens offers the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). At the graduate level, Stevens offers programs in engineering, science, systems, engineering, management and the liberal arts. Graduate students can pursue advanced degrees in more than 50 different designations ranging from graduate certificates and master&#x27;s degrees to Ph.D. levels.

Stevens is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot; The university is home to two national Centers of Excellence as designated by the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Two members of the Stevens community, as alumni or faculty, have been awarded the Nobel Prize: Frederick Reines (class of 1939), in physics, and Irving Langmuir (Chemistry faculty 1906–1909), in chemistry.

==History==
===Establishment &amp; the Stevens Family (1868-1870)===

In 1868, Edwin Augustus Stevens died. In his will, he left a bequest for the establishment of an &quot;institution of learning,&quot; providing his trustees with land and funds. Edwin&#x27;s will was executed by surviving wife, Martha Bayard Stevens, who would also serve as a lifetime Trustee of the institute that now bears the family&#x27;s name. Martha and her brother, Samuel Bayard Dod, are responsible for much of the organization for the institute including the hiring of the first president, Henry Morton. Dod became the first President of the Board of Trustees serving until his death in 1907.

The land now occupied by Stevens Institute of Technology was purchased at public auction by John Stevens in 1784. John Stevens was a Revolutionary War Colonel, Continental Congressman, first Treasurer of New Jersey, father of American patent law, steamboat and rail locomotive engineer, and father to Edwin. John built his estate on Castle Point, the Stevens Castle which served as the home to the Stevens family until 1917 when the building was offered to the U.S. Government for WW1 while the family resided in another building on the estate. The Stevens Mansion was then acquired by the university and used as an administrative building until 1959 when the Wesley J. Howe Center was built on its location.

The Stevens family - &quot;America&#x27;s First Family of inventors&quot; - was influential in founding the university, its early leadership as trustees, and the Institute&#x27;s surrounding community, Hoboken. Edwin A. Stevens&#x27; bequest totaled a city block&#x27;s worth of land, $150,000 for the construction of a building, and a $500,000 endowment.

=== Early years ===
Stevens Institute of Technology opened in 1870, offering a rigorous engineering curriculum grounded in scientific principles and the humanities. The original course of study was a single, rigorous curriculum based upon the European Polytechnic model of engineering science (following the French and German scientific and polytechnic schools), rather than the shop schools that were common at that time. The original degree offered was the mechanical engineer (M.E.), in addition to a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, chemistry and physics. Stevens granted several doctoral degrees between 1870 and 1900, making it one of the earliest Ph.D.-granting institutions in the United States. The broad-based interdisciplinary philosophy was put into practice by the founders from the first graduating class. Despite the title of the degree and concentration in mechanical engineering, the curriculum included courses in all engineering disciplines of the time: mechanical, civil, chemical and electrical. In 1880, Robert H. Thurston, professor of mechanical engineering, was nominated the first president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

The campus was situated at the periphery of the family estate at Castle Point in Hoboken. It occupied a single building now designated Edwin A. Stevens Hall, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Stone designs on the building&#x27;s facade are believed to be derived from a pattern repeated in the floor mosaic of Hagia Sophia, the great cathedral in Istanbul, which Edwin Stevens is believed to have visited in the late 19th century.

===1900–1999===
In its first century, Stevens grew quickly, evolving from a small, four-year undergraduate engineering college into a comprehensive technological university with strengths in key fields such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, resilience engineering, robotics, complex systems, healthcare, biomedical research, brain research and fintech. The university produced a Nobel Prize winner (Frederick Reines &#x27;39 M.S. &#x27;41) and thousands of new technologies, products, services and research insights.

In 1906, students, under the guidance of President A.C. Humphreys, created the honor system – a moral and ethical code governing the life of Stevens students and preaching equality and honest work. The student-run system still exists to this day, in which the accused are tried by their peers with a punishment recommended to the faculty. Stevens was the first technical school to implement such a system.

During World War II, Stevens Institute of Applied Science was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. During this time, the institute was also honored by the naming of the Victory Ship, SS &quot;Stevens Victory&quot;, a merchant cargo ship built by the Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard at Baltimore. Launched on May 29, 1945, the ship was one of 150 named for U.S. colleges and universities.

In 1959, the undergraduate engineering degree was changed to the bachelor of engineering (B.E.) to reflect the broad-based interdisciplinary engineering curriculum (the M.E. degree of that time was a baccalaureate degree, not to be confused with the present Engineer&#x27;s degree, which is a terminal professional graduate degree).

Also in 1959, the land occupied by the 40-room Victorian mansion, &quot;Castle Stevens&quot; or &quot;Villa on the Hudson&quot;, was repurposed for the 14-story administration building completed in 1962, later renamed the Wesley J. Howe Building. Serving as a campus building since in 1911, it was used as a dormitory, cafeteria, and office space. The unsupported cantilevered staircase, with its elegant hand-carved balustrade, was one of only two such &quot;floating staircases&quot; in America.

Stevens&#x27; graduate program admitted women for the first time in 1967. Undergraduate women were first admitted in 1971. The Lore-El Center for Women&#x27;s Leadership promotes the empowerment of women at Stevens.

In 1982, Stevens became the first institution in the U.S. to require all incoming first-year undergraduate students to purchase and use a personal computer. Around this time, an intranet was installed throughout campus, which placed Stevens among the first universities with a campus network.

WCPR: Castle Point Radio, the radio station of Stevens Institute of Technology since 1961, has over 10,000 LPs, one of the largest record collections in New Jersey.

=== 2000 and beyond ===
Stevens has continued to grow since the turn of the millennium, expanding its enrollment, facilities, partnerships and research programs. The university&#x27;s collaborations with industry and government include numerous grant awards, contracts and collaborative projects, as well as two National Centers of Excellence designated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense.

Since 2010, undergraduate enrollment has increased 67 percent and full-time graduate enrollment has increased 73 percent. Stevens has adapted and expanded to accommodate that growth, with a focus on modernizing campus facilities and infrastructure. Under the 2012–22 university strategic plan, Stevens made AV and IT upgrades to 100 percent of its classrooms. Improvements also included two new anchor facilities. The Gateway Academic Center, an 89,500-square-foot teaching and research facility, opened in 2019. In 2022, Stevens opened the University Center Complex, providing residential housing for approximately 1,000 students, as well as a campus hub with meeting, collaboration, event spaces, a fitness center and dining facilities.

Stevens has also focused on increasing access and opportunity for students from underrepresented groups. Among undergraduates, there was a 98 percent increase in women and 149 percent increase in the number of underrepresented minorities between 2011 and 2021. Initiatives developed to provide financial, academic and professional development support for students – including the Accessing Careers in Engineering and Science (ACES), A. James Clark Scholars and Lawrence T. Babbio Pinnacle Scholars programs – have played a role in this growth.

In recognition of the progress Stevens made through its strategic plan, the American Council on Education presented the university with its 2018 ACE/Fidelity Investments Award for Institutional Transformation. The award is given to &quot;institutions that have responded to higher education challenges in innovative and creative ways and achieved dramatic changes in a relatively brief period.&quot;

Stevens was named one of the healthiest campuses in the nation by Active Minds, a national nonprofit dedicated to student wellness. It has also been recognized for its commitments to environmental sustainability, including receiving the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) STARS Gold Rating in 2020. In 2021, Stevens announced it would source 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy starting in that year&#x27;s fall semester.

In April 2021, Stevens became one of the first higher education institutions in the United States to require COVID-19 vaccination not only for students, but also faculty and staff. In December 2021, the university announced it would require all students, faculty and staff to receive the COVID-19 booster vaccine to be compliant with the rule.

===Controversies===
====Attorney general matter====
In 2009, after a two-year investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General, Stevens and the attorney general filed competing lawsuits against one another. The Stevens suit against the attorney general contended that she had overstepped her legal authority over a private institution and sought that any case be pursued by confidential arbitration. The attorney general suit against Stevens, its then-president, Harold J. Raveché, and chairman of the board of trustees, Lawrence Babbio Jr., now referred to as the attorney general matter or allegations of the attorney general. On January 15, 2010, a settlement was reached in which Raveché was ordered to repay the low-interest loans offered to him by the university and increased oversight by the state of New Jersey until 2016. The president and chairman stepped down shortly after - succecceded by Nariman Farvardin and Virginia P. Ruesterholz, respectively. It concluded with no admission of liability or unlawful conduct by any party.

==Campus==
Stevens Tech&#x27;s 55 acre (22 ha) campus is in Hoboken, New Jersey, a city defined by its proximity to New York City and high density. The campus overlooks the Hudson River and is primarily along the waterfront of Hoboken, directly west of Manhattan. The area has a humid subtropical climate and consists of a prominent hill known as Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken. There are 17 academic, 3 athletic, 11 administrative, and 9 non-Greek residential buildings. Also, there are 13 Greek residences and additional buildings associated with the university in Hoboken.

Of the 60+ buildings associated with the university, 3 are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

===Early Campus (1870-1916)===
====Edwin A. Stevens Hall====
When the institution opened in 1870 it consisted of a single building, Edwin A. Stevens Hall, named after its benefactor. The building was designed by renowned architect Richard Upjohn and featured a five-story, 80,000-square-foot hall in the High Victorian Gothic style adorned with heavy-stone masonry, brickwork, pointed arches, and intricately carved sculptures and ornaments. The majority of the building was finished in 1870, with the east wing being completed in 1872, and it functioned as the only building for the college until 1902. Notably, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers was chartered within the prominent main hall in 1880, now known as Debaun Auditorium. To celebrate the 125th anniversary of the institution a 40 ft spire was added atop the building, which is now featured as the logo of the university. Modernly, the building is home to the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. School of Engineering and Sciences, performing arts space, laboratories, offices, and lecture halls. The building was added to the NRHP in 1994 for its significance to education, architecture, and social history.

====Carnegie Mechanical Laboratory====
In 1900, trustee and benefactor Andrew Carnegie, offered a sum of $65,000 for the construction of a new engineering workshop, Carnegie Mechanical Laboratory. The architectural style of the building includes an arcade atop a cement basement with a Corinthian entablature. Structurally, a steel frame and cement make up the building, making it completely fireproof. The building is now home to labs, offices, and classroom space. Carnegie Laboratory is inter-linked with the Gateway Academic Center, which wraps around the north and east sides of the building.

====Morton Memorial Laboratory of Chemistry====
While Carnegie Laboratory was being constructed, President Henry Morton was developing plans for a suitable building to house a chemical laboratory, then known as the Alumni Chemical Hall. After Dr. Morton&#x27;s death in 1902, the building was renamed to honor him and redesigned, as Jacobus said, to make it “look more imposing.” Construction began in 1905. In 1906, the building was opened as the Morton Memorial Laboratory of Chemistry. The building was designed by Ackerman &amp; Partridge and featured three-stories, ten prominent brick chimneys rising high above its roofline, with limestone and copper trimings in a Classical Revival style. The building was added to the NRHP in 2022 for its significance to architecture.

====William Hall Walker Gymnaisum====
When William Hall Walker Gymnasium was completed in 1916 the student newspaper, The Stute, noted: &quot;Stevens is now a real college, for we have a real place for college dances.&quot; The building was distinctive for its elliptical form (due to site conditions) and architects Ludlow &amp; Peabody designed the structure in a classical revival style based on ancient Greek and Roman designs. The exterior of the building was made of variegated deep-toned brick with raked joints, lime and terracotta stone trim, and a green shingled tile roof. The second floor housed the main gymnasium under a trussed ceiling 27 feet above with a gallery running track. Modernly, the building&#x27;s purpose is much the same, predominately as a space for athletics with occasional activities for student life. The building was added to the NRHP in 2019 for its significance to architecture.

===Distinct Buildings===
In addition to the three buildings on the National Register of Historic Places, Stevens is also home to a few distinct features as part of its campus, whether at present or historically. This includes four sculptures, three historic plaques, an anchor, and the famous boat dorm.

====S.S. &quot;Stevens&quot; (dorm boat)====

The SS &quot;Stevens&quot;, a 473-foot, 14,893-ton ship, served as a floating dormitory from 1968 to 1975 for approximately 150 students. Moored on the Hudson River at the foot of campus across from New York City, this first collegiate floating dormitory became one of the best-known college landmarks in the country.

Purchased by the institute to fill a shortfall in student housing, the ship&#x27;s operating costs during the initial years of service were comparable to conventional land-based dormitory housing. In later years, however, the ship&#x27;s burgeoning operating and repair costs, combined with a more favorable housing outlook, forced the institute to sell &quot;Stevens&quot; in 1975. In tribute, one of her 6-ton anchors was prominently placed on the campus grounds by the graduating Class of 1975. In August 1975, the ship was towed to a shipyard in Chester, Pennsylvania, and she was subsequently scrapped in 1979.
The anchor was briefly removed during the construction of the UCC Towers, but was brought back after student advocacy in April 2024.
====S.C. Williams Library Archives====
Stevens’ S.C. Williams Library houses the university&#x27;s special collections, which contain the largest compendium of items relating to Frederick Winslow Taylor; prints, manuscripts in facsimile and books by and about Leonardo da Vinci; and artwork by Alexander Calder, who studied at Stevens. The other collection hallmark, the &quot;Leonardo da Vinci Room,&quot; was donated by John W. Lieb, Class of 1880.

The library&#x27;s archives also house Stevens family documents and artifacts from early American and New Jersey history dating to the American Revolutionary War. The Hoboken Historical Museum hosted a six-month exhibition on the Stevens Family and their contributions to American life and featured many of the library&#x27;s contents.

== Organization &amp; Governance ==
===Governance &amp; Administration===
The 7th and current president of Stevens is Nariman Farvardin, who was appointed by the institute&#x27;s board of trustees in 2011 following the resignation of Harold J. Raveché and chairman of the board Lawrence Babbio Jr. The board is currently chaired by Stephen T. Boswell, the former president and CEO of Boswell Engineering. The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 3 and no more than 42 members at any one time, with the president of the university serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university&#x27;s endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

The president also has a cabinet of 11 vice-presidents. Furthermore, the president and board are advised by a 21-member group known as the Presidents Leadership Council, including Marques Brownlee. The Provost is advised by 12-member Academic Council, including the deans for each of the schools and colleges.

Stevens is composed of four academic schools: the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. School of Engineering and Science, the School of Systems and Enterprises, the School of Business, and the School of Humanitis Arts and Social Sciences. Additionally, the university is home to the College of Online and Professional Education, which is focused on providing online education following a 25-year WebCampus program.

===Academic Affiliations===
Stevens is a member of National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and a founding-member of Association of Independent Technological Universities since 1957. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) serves as an acredidating body of Stevens since 1927. For Engineering and Computer Science, ABET provides further accredidation. In 1937, Stevens and Columbia were the first two engineering programs accredited. Furthermore, the chemistry program at Stevens is accredited by American Chemical Society (ACS){, undergraduate and graduate business programs are accredited by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and project management programs are accredited by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

===Finances===
Stevens Tech reports an endowment of $319 million (per 2023 figures) which, over the last five-years, has grown by $112 million - including $63 million in donations. According to Citizens Bank, the institute ranks as the 324th largest endowment in the United States with at least 100 undergraduates. The endowment is about $66,000 per undergraduate student or $32,400 per student (graduate and undergraduate). A portion of the endowment, $475,000 as of 2020, is managed by the students in the Stevens Student Managed Investment Fund.

===Student Governance===
Stevens Institute of Technology is home to a long tradition of student leadership. The Stevens Student Government Association (SGA) is an undergraduate governing body that retains complete control over the allocation of the funds raised by the student activity fee, which is about $800,000 per semester as of 2020. The SGA consists of a seven-person cabinet appointed by a president and vice-president of operations who are elected by the student body. The Senate of the SGA consists of senators per 75-undergraduates in each school.

The Honor Board is a student-run and student elected committee of the school, tasked with upholding the honor system and consulting on academic policies for the university. It is overseen by a faculty-student panel. The primary function of the board is to process academic conduct cases. The honor system was established in 1906 under the guidance of President Alexander Crombie Humphreys.

==Academics==

===Colleges===
Stevens is composed of four academic schools: the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. School of Engineering and Science, the School of Systems and Enterprises, the School of Business, and the School of Humanitis Arts and Social Sciences. Stevens offers 35 undergraduate majors and has a 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio. Graduate offerings include 20 (plus three interdisciplinary) Ph.D. programs, 58 master&#x27;s programs, 194 certificate programs and graduate-level offerings custom designed for corporations.

====Charles V. Schaefer, Jr. School of Engineering and Sciences (SES)====
In 1996, the school acquired its name from then chairman of the Board of Trustees, Charles V. Schaefer Jr., following a four-year $102 million fundrasing campaign. Jean Zu is the current Dean of the school. The Schaefer school offers 15 bachelor&#x27;s, 29 master&#x27;s and 16 doctoral degrees with a variety of certificates in engineering and scientific disciplines for full-time students and part-time professionals. As of 2022, the school is home to approximately 5,100 students and 194 faculty across 9 departments.

Stevens Institute of Technology had a dual degree program in engineering with New York University until NYU acquired the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 2008. Since then, the Schaefer school has also launched a number of dual-degree programs with institutions such as Drew University, Saint Peter&#x27;s University, and Montclair State University. SES has joined nine NYC-area graduate engineering schools in Inter-University Engineering Doctoral Consortium (IUEDC) which beginning in Fall 2024 will allow students to take courses at each other&#x27;s institutions without any additional tuition.

====School of Business (SSB)====
The School of Business offers certificates and undergraduate, master&#x27;s, M.B.A. and doctoral degrees in a variety of technology management specialties. The Stevens undergraduate program emphasizes mathematical business models, applications of hard science to the concept and marketing of products, financial engineering (stochastic calculus, probability and statistics as descriptors of the dynamic behavior of financial markets) and the case-study method of business analysis. The capstone project in the business curriculum is the design of a technology-based business, including an accompanying business plan, operations research, market analysis, financial prospectus, and risk analysis. Several projects have been developed into real companies.

====School of Systems and Enterprises (SSE)====
The School of Systems and Enterprises (SSE) features faculty with industry and government experience to provide real-world applications to its students. SSE offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees, along with a combined bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s program and graduate certificates. SSE offers flexibility in its graduate course delivery. Options include on campus in Hoboken or online through StevensOnline. The school&#x27;s education and research reaches across industries, including defense, homeland security, intelligence, nuclear weapons, communications, space, infrastructure, finance and business solutions. The school follows an open academic model, which emphasizes the interplay between academia, industry and government.

====School of Humanities Arts &amp; Social Sciences (HASS)====
The College of Arts and Letters (CAL) approaches the humanities, social sciences and the arts from a science and technology perspective. While every undergraduate at Stevens is required to take a set of humanities courses, CAL offers B.A. degrees in literature, history, philosophy and the social sciences. CAL was established as a separate college in 2007 as part of a larger institutional realignment. CAL&#x27;s formation followed a history of integrating humanities and liberal arts education, which dates back to the university&#x27;s founding in 1870. In fall 2011, CAL began offering a new M.A. and graduate certificate in Technology, Policy and Ethics. CAL also offers an accelerated, six-year combined bachelor&#x27;s/J.D. degree program in partnership with New York Law School and Seton Hall University School of Law. In July 2023, Stevens renamed CAL to the School of Humanities, Arts, &amp; Social Sciences.

===Cooperative education and career placement===
Undergraduate students may elect to follow the cooperative education program, usually extending their timeline from four to five years, to gain about 18 months of increasingly progressive work experience. The program helps students confirm their choice of major, and clarify their interests and career goals while working in full-time, paid positions. Approximately 30% of undergraduate students follow this path while the remaining engage in research, externships or internships.

The combination of rigorous coursework and real-world application allows 73% of students to finalize their path prior to graduation, with 97% securing their intended outcomes within six months after graduation. The average accepted salary across all majors for the Class of 2021 was $75,400, with a maximum of $90,600, from over 300 companies recruiting on campus. Majors among those ranking the highest were computer science, computer engineering and software engineering. The value of a Stevens degree is often quantified through return on investment, in which the university ranks among the top in the United States.

=== Research ===

The research enterprise at Stevens features three national Centers of Excellence designated by the U.S. government: the National Center for Secure and Resilient (CSR) Maritime Commerce and the National Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC).

Stevens also features the Center for the Advancement of Secure Systems and Information Assurance (CASSIA), dedicated to advancements in cybersecurity. The center was developed in response to Stevens&#x27; designations by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education for the academic years 2003 through 2014, and as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research for the years 2008 through 2013.

The U.S. Department of Energy invited Stevens to compete in the 2015 Solar Decathlon held at Orange County Great Park in Irvine, California, among 19 other universities. Stevens’ entry, SURE HOUSE, was inspired by Hurricane Sandy. A net-zero home resilient enough to withstand Hurricane-force winds and flooding, the entry won the competition. SURE HOUSE achieved a total score of 950.685, ranking first in architecture, market appeal, communications, appliances, engineering, commuting and home life. It also received second place in the comfort zone contest.

Stevens also competed as one of 20 teams in the 2013 Solar Decathlon, the first time the competition was held outside of Washington, D.C. Stevens&#x27; independent entry, &quot;Ecohabit,&quot; placed fourth overall and second among United States entries.

Through a partnership with Parsons The New School for Design and Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy, Stevens designed an affordable green home as part of the 2011 Solar Decathlon. The entry, &quot;Empowerhouse,&quot; won first place in affordability during the 2011 competition. The team partnered with Habitat for Humanity of Washington, D.C., to provide the home to a low-income family in the Deanwood section of Washington at the conclusion of the competition.

===Entrepreneurship===
Stevens embraces a culture of entrepreneurship instilled in the institute from its founding family, who transformed their inventions into a number of successful enterprises like the first steam-driven locomotive. More recently, there have been significant sales of Stevens intellectual property, including PlasmaSol and Hydroglobe. The university&#x27;s Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship was established in 2008 to enhance scientific discoveries by facilitating technology transfer.

ISTEM@Stevens is a four-year entrepreneurship coaching program for incoming first-year students. The program focuses not only on technology and innovation, but also the process required to transform the idea into a fully developed company or nonprofit. The curriculum includes both classes and independent studies.

Launchpad@Stevens is a one-year program that gives undergraduate students the chance to learn about entrepreneurship and innovation alongside professionals who are building technology-based businesses. Participants learn how to identify ideas with potential commercial viability and work in teams to build those ideas into viable businesses.

Stevens&#x27; Innovation Expo, also referred to as &quot;Senior Design Day&quot; or simply &quot;D-Day&quot; by students, is an annual event at the end of the spring semester to feature capstone projects from undergraduate seniors of all schools and majors. Capstone projects take place over two semesters. The day of activities is also marked by the Project Plan Pitch and Elevator Pitch Competition in which students are judged on presentation of their idea and feasibility; many competitors spin-out companies and business ventures from their projects. The panel of judges typically consists of entrepreneurs, CEOs and venture capitalists.

Additionally, the institute hosts the &quot;Thomas H. Scholl Lecture by Visiting Entrepreneurs.&quot; Guest lecturers include Paul R. Sanberg, Jeong H. Kim, Winslow Sargeant, and Ann Fandozzi. The campus is also home to monthly summits of &quot;NJ Tech Meetup,&quot; branded as &quot;NJ&#x27;s largest technology and entrepreneurial community.&quot; It is composed of over 150 entrepreneurs and innovators.

==Athletics==
The Stevens Ducks are composed of 25 NCAA Division III teams representing Stevens Institute of Technology in intercollegiate competition. The Ducks are members of the Middle Atlantic Conferences (MAC) and the MAC Freedom Conference for all sports except fencing. Men&#x27;s fencing competes in the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Fencing Association (MACFA) and women&#x27;s fencing competes in both the Eastern Women&#x27;s Fencing Conference (EWFC) and the National Intercollegiate Women&#x27;s Fencing Association (NIWFA).

Stevens rejoined the MAC in July 2019 after an absence of over 40 years, having most recently been in the Empire 8 conference. The Ducks spent 12 seasons as full members of the Empire 8 after a tenure in the Skyline Conference. Stevens competed as an associate member of the Empire 8 in field hockey during the 2006 season. The Ducks won a total of 62 team championships and 367 individual championships (429 total) during their time in the Empire 8 .

The move to the MAC and the MAC Freedom brought 23 of the department&#x27;s 25 teams under a single conference umbrella; wrestling had been competing in the Centennial Conference since 2004 and men&#x27;s volleyball was a founding member of the United Volleyball Conference. Stevens has found success in the MAC, winning 23 team and 105 individual conference championships (128 total) through the Spring 2021 semester.

With an athletics lineage that dates back to 1872, Stevens was one of five schools (along with Rutgers, Princeton, Columbia and Yale) invited to establish the original set of collegiate football rules in 1873. Stevens dropped football after the 1924 season.

Stevens offers 14 club sports including ice hockey, which plays at the Barnabas Health Hockey House in Newark, New Jersey—the practice facility of the New Jersey Devils and home of the Metropolitan Riveters.

=== Baseball and softball ===
Baseball at Stevens dates back to 1873, although the first recognized season was in 1906. Stevens has had two players drafted in Major League Baseball&#x27;s First Year Player Draft. David Garcia was selected by the Minnesota Twins in 1973 and Charlie Ruegger was selected by the New York Yankees in 2018.

Softball is Stevens&#x27; newest varsity sport. The team was established during the 2009–10 academic year.

=== Basketball ===
Stevens men&#x27;s basketball has won two NCAA Division III statistical championships, leading the country in field-goal percentage defense during the 2007–2008 season. Spencer Cook led the country in three-point field goal percentage in 2020.

=== Cross-country and track &amp; field ===
Doctoral student Gina Dello Russo won the NCAA Division III title in the 400-meter dash at the 2021 Outdoor Track &amp; Field National Championships in Greensboro, N.C. Dello Russo, a 2020 NCAA Woman of the Year Top 30 selection, was the first Stevens track &amp; field champion since Amy Regan in 2017. Between cross country and indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, Regan won six national championships for Stevens. She was the first cross-country runner in any NCAA division from New Jersey to win a national championship and later participated in the 2020 U.S. Olympic marathon team trials. Regan was also an NCAA Today Top 10 Award recipient.

Alina Duran competed at the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials in the hammer throw, reaching the final and finishing 12th in the country.

Stevens has also won national championships in the high jump, with Gladys Njoku securing consecutive titles in 2015 and 2016.

=== Fencing ===
Women&#x27;s fencing was the first female varsity sport at Stevens, and its coach, Linda Vollkommer-Lynch, was the first tenured female faculty member and first female coach at the university. In 2018, Stevens&#x27; women&#x27;s fencing team did not lose to a Division III opponent all season and finished with a 32–3 overall record. That year, they established a new school record for winning percentage at .914, the first team to achieve a percentage over .900.

In 2009–10, the men&#x27;s fencing team was led by head coach Stephen Kovacs who, after being accused of two sexual assaults, died in prison in 2022. The team is currently led by former Olympian Jim Carpenter.

=== Lacrosse ===
Stevens holds the distinction of having the oldest, continuously running lacrosse program in the United States. The program won a recognized national championship four times: 1892 and 1894 in the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association, and in 1917 and 1918 in the United States Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse League. It has also won championships in the Skyline Conference, Empire 8 and MAC Freedom.

Players to come through the program have achieved All-America and Academic All-American Conference awards and North-South All-Star Game Invitations. Some of them include:

* Brian Lalli: All-America and Academic All-America midfielder (2004)
* Mark Beilicky: 3× All-American Midfielder (2005, 2006, 2007), 2007 pre-season midfielder of the year
* JR (Oreskovich) Maehler: 3× All-America attackman (2006, 2007, 2009), 2009 pre-season attackman of the year
* Shawn Coulter: USILA Short-Stick Defensive Midfielder of the Year, the first national individual award in program history.

Stevens hosted the 2006 NCAA Division III women&#x27;s lacrosse national championship game.

===Soccer===
The 2008 men&#x27;s soccer team reached the Division III NCAA championship game, losing to Messiah College (now University) on penalty kicks. They were the first Stevens team to compete in an NCAA national championship contest.

Soccer goalkeeper Zach Carr received All-American and Academic All-American honors in 2010. Carr led the nation in 2010 with a .927 save percentage and maintained a 3.92 grade-point average. One of the best goalkeepers in NCAA history, he set the Division III record and tied for the most shutouts in NCAA history (55), played the third-most minutes in Division III history and posted the sixth-lowest goals-against average. Carr was also a recipient of an NCAA Top VIII Award.

The women&#x27;s team hosts an annual Engineering Cup and has one of the longest active consecutive postseason appearance streaks in Division III. The program was also the first in department history to receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament and post an NCAA victory with a 1–0 win over Johns Hopkins on November 13, 2002.

===Swimming===
In 2011, Laura Barito, a two-time All-American in swimming and track and a two-time, two-sport NCAA national champion (in 50-yard freestyle swimming and the 400-meter hurdles), was awarded the NCAA Woman of the Year. Barito, who was also named by CoSIDA/Capital One to the Academic All-America First Team, was only the second Division III athlete to win the NCAA Woman of the Year Award in its 21-year history.

In 2012, Stevens swimmer Brittany Geyer won the national women&#x27;s 200-yard breaststroke title. Geyer came back in 2015 to win the national 100 breaststroke and 200 breaststroke titles, making her a three-time NCAA champion.

Stevens men&#x27;s swimming has won 10 straight conference championships. Simas Jarasunas won the 100-yard Breaststroke in 2013 for the first national championship in program history.

=== Tennis ===
While the men&#x27;s tennis team have won 14 straight conference championships, the Ducks have had limited success in the NCAA Division III tournament, only once qualifying for the round of 16 in 2013, where they lost to Amherst 1-5 .

===Volleyball===
Both the varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball programs were started by legendary head coach Patrick Dorywalski. Dorywalski coached 37 years at Stevens, including 31 with the men&#x27;s volleyball program. His 635 victories are the most by any varsity coach at Stevens and were the fourth-most by any men&#x27;s volleyball coach in NCAA at the time of his retirement in 2020.

On April 26, 2015, Stevens won the NCAA Division III men&#x27;s championship on its home court of Canavan Arena, the first NCAA team championship in Stevens&#x27; history.

Women&#x27;s team alumna Eva Kwan is tied for the most digs (62) in any single match in Division III history and the second-most in NCAA history.

=== Wrestling ===
Brett Kaliner posted a 29–0 season and became the first national champion in program history in 2022, winning the title at 149 pounds.

=== Former varsity sports ===

==== Football ====
Stevens was one of the first five college football teams. In 1873, representatives of Princeton, Yale, Columbia, and Rutgers met in New York City to establish the first American intercollegiate rules for football on the model of the London Football Association. As the game developed in the United States, it became progressively more violent. The alumni magazine commented that the style of the game became too difficult and required an enormous amount of time and training, which could be afforded by larger colleges but would add too much work to the already difficult academic coursework at Stevens. Stevens holds a disputed victory over the University of Michigan.

==== Equestrian ====
Kerri Rettig won an IHSA National Championship in Intermediate Flat in 2005. Stevens ceased fielding an equestrian team as of July 1, 2019.

=== Awards and recognition ===
Stevens was named ECAC Institution of the Year in 2008 and again in 2013, an honor that measures a combination of athletics success and classroom academic performance at more than 300 Division I, II and III colleges and universities. Stevens is one of only three institutions to win the award multiple times.

The athletic department&#x27;s highest finish in the annual Division III Director&#x27;s Cup is 13th, recorded in 2011 and 2016. The department has received an NADIIIAA Community Service Award eight times, most recently in 2022. Stevens has also won seven College Athletic Administrators of New Jersey (CAANJ) Cups as the Top Division III institution in New Jersey.

===Facilities===
Varsity teams compete in one of three facilities, two of which are on campus. The Schaefer Athletics and Recreation Center houses Canavan Arena, Walker Gymnasium, the DeBaun Aquatic Center, the Athletic Training Center, and the Wrestling Complex. The Schaefer Center construction was part of a $23 million investment in new facilities that also included renovations to Walker Gym and installation of a new turf field.

Field sports (soccer, field hockey, baseball, lacrosse) compete at DeBaun Athletic Complex. Softball competes at Waterfront Park in Weehawken, N.J.

==Greek organizations==
Stevens Institute of Technology hosts chapters of 21 social and academic fraternities and sororities, many of which were founded on campus over a century ago. In 2014, 22% of Stevens students were members of these organizations. All Stevens&#x27; Greek organizations are chapters of national fraternities or sororities.

<doc id="292133" wikidata="Q11765" url="?curid=292133" title="Fee">
<text>A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. Traditionally, professionals in the United Kingdom (and previously the Republic of Ireland) receive a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and often use guineas rather than pounds as units of account. Under the feudal system, a Knight&#x27;s fee was what was given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land. A contingent fee is an attorney&#x27;s fee which is reduced or not charged at all if the court case is lost by the attorney.

A service fee, service charge, or surcharge is a fee added to a customer&#x27;s bill. The purpose of a service charge often depends on the nature of the product and corresponding service provided. Examples of why this fee is charged are: travel time expenses, truck rental fees, liability and workers&#x27; compensation insurance fees, and planning fees. UPS and FedEx have recently begun surcharges for fuel.

Restaurants and banquet halls charging service charges in lieu of tips must distribute them to their wait staff in some US states (e.g., Massachusetts, New York, Montana), but in the state of Kentucky may keep them. A fee may be a flat fee or a variable one, or part of a two-part tariff. A membership fee is charged as part of a subscription business model.

==Telecom==
For telecommunications services such as high-speed Internet and mobile phones, an activation fee is commonly assessed, although most companies fail to include it in the advertised price, resulting in customer missperception on assessment and validity of the fees. An activation fee is prevalent throughout the cellphone industry and is generally assessed to cover costs of line activations and enhancements to networks.

Another fee is the early-termination fee applied nearly universally to cellphone contracts, supposedly to cover the remaining part of the subsidy that the provider prices the phones with. If the user terminates before the end of the term, he or she will be charged, often well over $100. In the U.S., mobile phone companies have come under heavy criticism for this anti-competitive practice, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering limits to prevent price gouging, such as requiring the fees to be prorated.

Many cable TV and telephone companies, including AT&amp;T, include a regulatory-cost recovery fee in the bill each month of around $3, passing the blame onto government regulation, and essentially charging their customers for complying with U.S. law.

==Banking==

Bank fees are assessed to customers for various services and as penalties. There are unauthorised overdraft fees, ATM usage fees, and fees for having an account balance below the minimum daily balance. Some banks charge a fee for using tellers in an effort to encourage customers to use automated services instead. The fees have come in for criticism as excessive from consumer advocates. They have also targeted bank practices that maximize the assessment of fees and fees that can add up to many times the amount of small transactions.

U.S. banks extract fees from automatic teller machine (ATM) transactions that are made at rival banks, even if the customer&#x27;s home bank has no branch in a particular area (such as when the customer is on vacation). Customers are sometimes charged twice, both by the bank that owns the ATM, and again by their bank. Bank of America charges a denial fee, literally a fee for refusing service to the customer (if there are insufficient funds or a daily limit), and a fee to simply check the account balance at a &quot;foreign&quot; (other banks&#x27;) ATMs.

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and legislation passed by Congress, banks modified many credit card agreements with customers.

==Renting==
Like an activation fee, a setup fee is often charged by places that rent space or other things. In the case of self-storage businesses, this negates claims of &quot;only one dollar for the first month&quot; made by Public Storage and others. Apartment complexes often charge fees for pets (mainly dogs and cats). Some complexes euphemistically call these a non-refundable deposit, ignoring the definition of a deposit as inherently being refundable.

==Real estate==

A title company or attorney collects a variety of fees in the course of handling the purchase of a house at a closing. These may include fees for tax service, flood certification, underwriting, appraisal, credit report, record deed, record deed trust, loan signing and processing.

==Event tickets==
With respect to events tickets, online reservations and payments, and other transactions, there is sometimes a service charge (often called a convenience fee) that serves as additional compensation for the company facilitating the transaction. Ticketmaster and others charge this, and have made a business model of it. However, such groups have a monopoly on particular events or even entire concert venues.

==Air travel==
Airlines have long charged fees for changing flights, and for excess luggage. However, with the oil price increases since 2003, many are increasing fees. In May 2008, it was announced that some would be charging even for just one checked bag, making it nearly impossible to avoid. Airlines have also invented fees for nearly every &quot;service&quot; that has always previously been included in the ticket price. While the extra income may be necessary to prevent bankruptcy, the practice of not including mandatory fees in the stated price is deceptive.

Airports also charge landing fees to airlines in order to cover costs, particularly airport security.

==Customer service==
Some businesses charge fees just for talking to a customer service representative. DirecTV charges this when ordering a pay-per-view movie via telephone instead of through the set-top box. Some companies charge for technical support, either prepaid or by using a premium-rate telephone number (such as the 1–900 numbers in North America). In the 2000s (decade), some banks in the U.S. began charging a fee just to visit a teller, prompting such customer anger that the banks were forced to back down.

==Speaking==

A speaking fee is a payment awarded to an individual for speaking at a public event.

==Late fees==

Late fees are charged when payment is not received by a deadline. These are supposedly intended to get people to pay rent or other charges on time, but these are sometimes exorbitant, or extremely out of proportion to the amount of money which is late. They can also add insult to injury for people who have hit hard financial times, making their situation worse. When added to credit card bills or check card statements, it may also cause an overlimit or NSF fee, creating an endless and inescapable cycle of fees that trigger other fees for people already stretched to their financial limit.

==Retail==
Some retail stores add fees, mainly for &quot;guest passes&quot; at membership warehouses like Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club, where membership have not been paid.

There are a few other &quot;cost-plus&quot; stores, however, that add about ten percent at checkout, using the lower shelf price to trick consumers into erroneous comparison shopping. At Food Depot and other smaller low-end chain stores like this, the shelf price may be $1.95, when the shopper will actually be charged $2.15 in the end, in a sort of legalized bait and switch. (Furthermore, a disclaimer indicates the shelf price is not even the actual cost to the store.)

==Early termination==
An early-termination fee is charged by a company when a customer wants or needs to be released from a contract before it expires. One example is when a renter leaves an apartment before a year-long contract is over. If tenants rent for a shorter period, or month-to-month, they are instead charged significantly more per month, and are often denied any promotional deals. Mobile phone companies in the U.S. are notorious for huge early-termination fees, typically starting at $175, and falling by only a few dollars per month, no matter the actual cost of or subsidy to the phone.

Some mortgage companies also charge early payment penalties if the homeowner pays more than is due in order to reduce the interest owed and to shorten the remaining term of the loan. The fees typically negate this advantage at least in part.

There are also fees charged for any type of termination even if the contract was expired. In the suburban Atlanta county of Gwinnett for example, customers were hit with termination fees of over $23 when the county commission chose not to renew the contracts of the county trash collectors in November 2008. The two companies charged this both in violation of county law and in breach of contract.

==Infrastructure and environment==
An impact fee is a charge which a developer must pay to local government, in order to raise money for capital improvements to roads, libraries, and other services upon which the new land development places a burden. This prevents existing residents from being forced to pay in taxes, in addition to already having to put-up with the traffic, noise, and environmental damage of the new development.

==Government==
In government, the difference between a fee and a tax is that a fee is paid for specific goods or services rendered by the government, while a tax has no connection to the benefits received for an individual.

===Public resources===
A user fee is a fee paid for the use of a public resource, like a park. This is most common for national parks, and often also state parks or provincial parks, and for privately owned areas.

===Licenses and permits===
Fees are usually charged for various government services, including license plates and annual motor vehicle registration, as well as driver licenses and professional licensing. Fees are also charged for various permits, like demolition and building permits, rezoning, and land grading (which causes silt); and sometimes for increasing stormwater runoff, destroying native vegetation, and cutting-down healthy trees.

===Deceptive use===
Sometimes fee is used to mask what are actually penalties or taxes. For example, Virginia&#x27;s now-repealed Civil Remedial Fees were actually a tax on drivers with certain kinds of traffic law violations.

==Schooling==
At public universities and community colleges, students are charged tuition and matriculation, when can themselves be considered fees charged per credit hour. However, the term student fees typically refers to additional charges which the student is required to pay, typically no matter how many hours the student is taking in the academic term.

Commonly this is a student activity fee, which helps to fund student organisations, particularly those which are academic in nature; and those which serve all students equally, like student government and student media. A newer fee is the technology fee, which is often charged to students by schools when state government funding fails to meet needs for computers and other classroom technology. Students may also be charged a health fee which usually covers the campus nurse, and possibly a visit to a local clinic if the student is ill.

Parking fees are normally optional, because students may not have their own automobiles. However, many U.S. schools are now forcing meal plans on their students, particularly those that stay in dorms, and some force freshmen to stay in the dorms. Generally, all fees except parking are covered under scholarships, whether they are from private, government, or lottery funds. However, at least one U.S. state (Georgia) began denying HOPE Scholarship money for any new fees added, even by its own state schools.

== Services Charge in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong ==
Services Charge is a type of consumer and additional add-on fee and charge which is in place in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong restaurants and food outlets to cover the cost of the primary services and all staff costs. The services charge in these territories is 10 per cent. Services fee and charge is collected by the private company restaurant and is not a government tax.

=== Legal Requirement ===
It is legal to charge Services Charges in restaurant and food outlets under Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong laws. However, restaurants and food outlets in these territories must legally disclose the charge/fee to customers who dine at the venue. Refusing or declining to disclose to customers an additional services charge is illegal under consumer law. Restaurants could face heavy fines or a warning.

=== Circumstances ===
In normal circumstances in other countries the services fee charges of 10% is included in the price of the meal. The disadvantage is that this can create misunderstanding and confusion for some people. In the United States of America, restaurant add on services charge is optional, because it has a tipping system. When the customer tips the restaurant it become a form of services fee.

==== Australia ====
In Australia the restaurant and food outlet services charge add on is included in the price of the food meals. However some restaurants and food outlets make additional services charges on public holiday and Sundays, known as public holidays surcharge. The public holiday surcharge in Australia can range from 10% to 15% to cover the cost of staff working on holidays or weekends.

== Hidden fees ==
Hidden fees, surprise fees or junk fees are fees that are not mentioned until payment is required, or only mentioned in small print. Examples include resort fees. These are illegal in some countries. Joe Biden has pushed federal agencies to limit junk fees in the United States in 2024 through the FTC, FCC and CFPB.

<text>The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA), previously known as the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), was a charity, and an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB) of the Department for Education. In England and Northern Ireland, the QCDA maintained and developed the National Curriculum and associated assessments, tests and examinations, advising the minister formerly known as the Secretary of State for Education on these matters.

Regulatory functions regarding examination and assessment boards have been transferred to Ofqual, an independent regulator.

Education and qualifications in Scotland and Wales are the responsibility of the Scottish Government and Welsh Government and their agencies. In Scotland, for example, the Scottish Qualifications Authority is the responsible body.

In May 2010 the Secretary of State announced his intention to promote legislation that would transfer obligations of the QCDA to Ofqual. The newly formed Standards and Testing Agency took on the functions of the agency 3 October 2011. QCDA&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Hall, is also a member of the Executive Board of the British examination board AQA.

==Partners==
QCDA worked closely with its main strategic partners, including the Department for Education, the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), employers&#x27; organisations, the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), the Skills Funding Agency, the former General Teaching Council for England (GTCE) and the Sector Skills Councils (SSC).

QCDA also collaborated with the other public qualification agencies in the UK: the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment in Northern Ireland (CCEA).

QCDA had its headquarter in Coventry, United Kingdom.

==History==
The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) was formed on 1 October 1997, through a merger of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) for vocational qualifications and the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA) for academic qualifications. The QCA had additional powers and duties granted to it by the Education Act 1997, which established the role of the QCA. Under Section 24 of this Act, QCA was granted the right to regulate all external qualifications in England.

In April 2004, the QCA also launched the National Assessment Agency to take over the delivery and administration of National Curriculum assessments. The National Assessment Agency was transformed into a subdivision and its functions subsumed within the management structure of the QCA.

===Formation of Ofqual===
On 26 September 2007, DCSF announced that the regulatory functions of the QCA were to become statutorily independent with transferring QCA&#x27;s obligations to Ofqual.

On 8 April 2008, Ofqual began work as the independent regulator of exams and tests in England, accountable to Parliament rather than to government ministers. The remaining work of the QCA was transferred to the Ofqual. The QCA was formally reintegrated into Ofqual when Ofqual gained statutory status.

<text>A feud , also known in more extreme cases as a blood feud, vendetta, faida, clan war, gang war, private war, or mob war, is a long-running argument or fight, often between social groups of people, especially families or clans. Feuds begin because one party perceives itself to have been attacked, insulted, injured, or otherwise wronged by another. Intense feelings of resentment trigger an initial retribution, which causes the other party to feel greatly aggrieved and vengeful. The dispute is subsequently fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation usually makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds can persist for generations and may result in extreme acts of violence. They can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in family honor. A mob war is a time when two or more rival families begin open warfare with one another, destroying each other&#x27;s businesses and assassinating family members. Mob wars are generally disastrous for all concerned, and can lead to the rise or fall of a family.

Until the early modern period, feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments and were regulated to some degree. For example, Montenegrin culture calls this &quot;krvna osveta&quot;, meaning &quot;blood revenge&quot;, which had unspoken but highly valued rules. In Albanian culture it is called &quot;gjakmarrja&quot;, which usually lasts for generations. In tribal societies, the blood feud, coupled with the practice of blood wealth, functioned as an effective form of social control for limiting and ending conflicts between individuals and groups who are related by kinship, as described by anthropologist Max Gluckman in his article &quot;The Peace in the Feud&quot; in 1955.

A &quot;blood feud&quot; is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives or associates of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or dishonored seeking vengeance by killing or otherwise physically punishing the culprits or their relatives. In the English-speaking world, the Italian word &quot;vendetta&quot; is used to mean a blood feud; in Italian, however, it simply means (personal) &#x27;vengeance&#x27; or &#x27;revenge&#x27;, originating from the Latin &quot;vindicta&quot; (), while the word &quot;faida&quot; would be more appropriate for a blood feud. In the English-speaking world, &quot;vendetta&quot; is sometimes extended to mean any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. Sometimes it is not mutual, but rather refers to a prolonged series of hostile acts waged by one person against another without reciprocation.

===History===
Blood feuds were common in societies with a weak rule of law (or where the state did not consider itself responsible for mediating this kind of dispute), where family and kinship ties were the main source of authority. An entire family was considered responsible for the actions of any of its members. Sometimes two separate branches of the same family even came to blows, or further, over some dispute.

The practice has mostly disappeared with more centralized societies where law enforcement and criminal law take responsibility for punishing lawbreakers.

====Feuds in pre-industrial tribes====

The blood feud has certain similarities to the ritualized warfare found in many pre-industrial tribes. For instance, more than a third of Ya̧nomamö males, on average, died from warfare. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the enslavement of neighboring tribes, such as the Macu, before the arrival of European settlers and government.

====Feuds in Antiquity====
===== Ancient Greece =====
In Homeric ancient Greece, the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: &quot;Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vengeance... Feud is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of revenges; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods&quot;.

===== Hebrew Law =====
In ancient Hebrew law, it was considered the duty of the individual and family to avenge unlawful bloodshed, on behalf of God and on behalf of the deceased. The executor of the law of blood-revenge who personally put the initial killer to death was given a special designation: &quot;go&#x27;el haddam&quot;, the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer (Book of Numbers 35: 19, etc.). Six Cities of Refuge were established to provide protection and due process for any unintentional manslayers. The avenger was forbidden from harming an unintentional killer if the killer took refuge in one of these cities. As the &quot;Oxford Companion to the Bible&quot; states: &quot;Since life was viewed as sacred (Genesis 9.6), no amount of blood money could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be &quot;life for life&quot; (Exodus 21.23; Deuteronomy 19.21)&quot;.

==== Pre-Christian Northern Europe ====
The Celtic phenomenon of the &quot;blood feud&quot; demanded &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between clans might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland.

In Scandinavia in the Viking era, feuds were common, as the lack of a central government left dealing with disputes up to the individuals or families involved. Sometimes, these would descend into &quot;blood revenges&quot;, and in some cases would devastate whole families. The ravages of the feuds as well as the dissolution of them is a central theme in several of the Icelandic sagas. An alternative to feud was &quot;blood money&quot; (or &quot;weregild&quot; in the Norse culture), which demanded a set value to be paid by those responsible for a wrongful permanent disfigurement or death, even if accidental. If these payments were not made, or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud could ensue.

Violence was common in Viking Age Norway. An examination of Norwegian human remains from the Viking Age found that 72% of the examined males and 42% of the examined females had suffered weapon-related trauma. Violence was less common in Viking Age Denmark, where society was more centralized and complex than the clan-based Norwegian society.

==== Early Confucianism ====
Confucius had demanded vengeance for the killing of parents, older brothers, and friends, and viewed this as a matter of duty. &quot;Book of Rites&quot; quotes Confucius saying: &quot;(a son whose parent was killed) should sleep on straw, with his shield for a pillow; he should not take office; he must be determined not to live with the slayer under the same heaven. If he meet with him in the marketplace or the court, he should not have to go back for his weapon, but instantly fight with him.&quot;

====Feuds in Medieval and Renaissance Europe====
===== Middle Ages =====
According to historian Marc Bloch:


Rita of Cascia, a popular 15th-century Italian saint, was canonized by the Catholic Church due mainly to her great effort to end a feud in which her family was involved and which claimed the life of her husband.

===== Holy Roman Empire =====
At the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s &quot;Reichstag&quot; at Worms in 1495 AD, the right of waging feuds was abolished. The Imperial Reform proclaimed an &quot;eternal public peace&quot; (&quot;Ewiger Landfriede&quot;) to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons, and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted. In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed a family rival in Prague, and the town councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed. His brother, Jiri Kopidlansky, declared a private war against the city of Prague. Another case was the Nuremberg-Schott feud, in which Maximilian was forced to step in to halt the damages done by robber knight Schott.

===== Greece =====
In Greece, the custom of blood feud is found in several parts of the country, for instance in Crete and Mani. Throughout history, the Maniots have been regarded by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice blood feuds, known in the Maniot dialect of Greek as &quot;Γδικιωμός&quot; (Gdikiomos). Many vendettas went on for months, some for years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and, when they got the chance, would murder members of the opposing family. The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless; it has led to entire family lines being wiped out. The last vendetta on record required the Greek Army with artillery support to force it to a stop. Regardless of this, the Maniot Greeks still practice vendettas, even today. Maniots in America, Australia, Canada and Corsica still have on-going vendettas which have led to the creation of mafia families known as &quot;Γδικιωμέοι&quot; (Gdikiomeoi).

===== Corsica =====
In Corsica, vendettas were a social code (mores) that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.

===== Spain =====
In the Spanish Late Middle Ages, the Vascongadas was ravaged by the War of the Bands, which were bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In the region of Navarre, next to Vascongadas, these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, in Vascongadas, the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (&quot;Cf.&quot; the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy). High defensive structures (&quot;towers&quot;) built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, and sometimes by royal decree.

==== Caucasus ====
Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the Caucasus, wrote in the mid-19th century: &quot;Among the mountain people the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion.&quot; In the Dagestani &quot;aul&quot; of Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century until the 1860s.

====Samurai honours and feuds====
In Japan&#x27;s feudal past, the samurai class upheld the honor of their family, clan, and their lord by &quot;katakiuchi&quot; (), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the Forty-seven Ronin, others were given official permission with specific targets.

===Feuds in modern times===

Blood feuds are still practised in some areas in:
* France (especially Corsica and within Manush communities)
* Sardinia where a blood feud is called in the local language &quot;Disamistade&quot;. 
* Ireland (especially Dublin and Limerick)
* Between Mafia families in Southern Italy (especially Sicily, Campania, Calabria, Apulia and other areas of the same territory) and neighbouring Malta
* Greece (Mani and Crete) 
* Between White British, British Asian or Black British working-class families, crime groups, street gangs, football firms and family clans throughout Britain and Ireland. Feuds amongst Traveller clans are also relatively common throughout Britain and Ireland. Multiple diaspora communities also partake in feuding, such as Turkish, Albanian and Kurdish communities.
* Between rival crime families in Galicia, Spain
* Between so-called &quot;woonwagenbewoners&quot; (ethnic Dutch people who live in mobile homes) in the Netherlands 
* Among Kurdish and Turkish clans in Turkey (as well as between Kurdish clans in Iraq and Iran) 
* Between Turkish Cypriots
* Between rival clans in northern Albania and Kosovo
* Between Canadian Aboriginal tribes
* Among Pashtuns in Afghanistan 
* Among tribes of Montenegro

* Among Chechen teips where those seeking retribution do not accept or respect the local law enforcement authority
* Among the Madurese people in Indonesia (&quot;carok&quot;)

==== Gang warfare/mob war ==== 

During a fight at a carnival celebration in 1991 two young men from the &#x27;Ndrangheta crime organization were killed, leading to a series of feuds between rival clans. Blood feuds within Russian communities do exist (mostly related to criminal gangs), but are neither as common nor as pervasive as they are in the Caucasus. In the United States, gang warfare also often takes the form of blood feuds. A mob war is a time when two or more rival families/gangs begin open warfare with one another, destroying each other&#x27;s businesses and assassinating family members. Mafia/Mob wars are generally disastrous for all concerned, and can lead to the rise or fall of a family or gang. African-American, Italian-American, Cambodian, Cuban Marielito, Dominican, Guatemalan, Haitian, Hmong, Sino-Vietnamese Hoa, Irish-American, Jamaican, Korean, Laotian, Puerto Rican, Salvadoran and Vietnamese gangs and organized crime conflicts very often have taken the form of blood feuds, in which a family member in the gang is killed and a relative takes revenge by killing the murderer as well as other members of the rival gang. This can also be observed in particular cases in conflicts among Colombian, Mexican, Brazilian, and other Latin American gangs, drug cartels, and paramilitary groups; in turf wars among Cape Coloured gangs in South Africa; in gang fights among Dutch Antillean, Surinamese and Moluccan gangs in the Netherlands; and in criminal feuds between Scottish, White British, Black and Mixed British gangs in the UK. This has resulted in gun violence and murders in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Ciudad Juarez, Medellin, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Amsterdam, London, Liverpool, and Glasgow, to name just a few. The Five Families of New York City New York go to great lengths to avoid a war, as not only do the families lose considerable money and valuable men, gangland killings also cause public outrage and can trigger mass crackdowns from authorities like the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI.

==== Southern United States ====
Blood feuds also have a long history within the White Southerner population (and in particular among the &quot;Scots-Irish&quot; or Ulster Scots American population) of the Southern United States, where it is called the &quot;culture of honor&quot;, and still exists to the present day. A series of prolonged violent engagements in late nineteenth-century Kentucky and West Virginia were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, both of whom had written semihistorical accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the Hatfield–McCoy feud, were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the Reconstruction Era and the early twentieth century, and are seen by some as linked to a Southern culture of honor with its roots in the Scots-Irish forebears of the residents of the area. Another prominent example was the Regulator–Moderator War, which took place between rival factions in the Republic of Texas. It is sometimes considered the largest blood feud in American history.

====Albania====

In Albania, &quot;gjakmarrja&quot; (blood feuding) is a tradition. Blood feuds in Albania trace back to the Kanun, this custom is also practiced among the Albanians of Kosovo. It returned to rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian Communists led by Enver Hoxha.

In 1980, Albanian author Ismail Kadare published &quot;Broken April&quot;, about the centuries-old tradition of hospitality, blood feuds, and revenge killing in the highlands of north Albania in the 1930s. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing it, wrote: &quot;&quot;Broken April&quot; is written with masterly simplicity in a bardic style, as if the author is saying: Sit quietly and let me recite a terrible story about a blood feud and the inevitability of death by gunfire in my country. You know it must happen because that is the way life is lived in these mountains. Insults must be avenged; family honor must be upheld...&quot; The novel was made into a 2001 movie entitled &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; by filmmaker Walter Salles, set in 1910 Brazil and starring Rodrigo Santoro, which was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

There are now more than 1,600 families who live under an ever-present death sentence because of feuds. and since 1991, some 12,000 people were killed in them.

====Kosovo====
Blood feuds have also been part of a centuries-old tradition in Kosovo, tracing back to the Kanun, a 15th-century codification of Albanian customary rules. In the early 1990s, most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by Anton Çetta. The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992, the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993, not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.

====Republic of Ireland====
Criminal gang feuds also exist in Dublin, Ireland and in the Republic&#x27;s third-largest city, Limerick. Traveller feuds are also common in towns across the country. Feuds can be due to personal issues, money, or disrespect, and grudges can last generations. Since 2001, over 300 people have been killed in feuds between different drugs gangs, dissident republicans, and Traveller families.

====Philippines====
Family and clan feuds, known locally as &quot;rido&quot;, are characterized by sporadic outbursts of retaliatory violence between families and kinship groups, as well as between communities. It can occur in areas where the government or a central authority is weak, as well as in areas where there is a perceived lack of justice and security. &quot;Rido&quot; is a Maranao term commonly used in Mindanao to refer to clan feuds. It is considered one of the major problems in Mindanao because, apart from numerous casualties, &quot;rido&quot; has caused destruction of property, crippled local economies, and displaced families.

Located in the southern Philippines, Mindanao is home to a majority of the country&#x27;s Muslim community, and includes the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Mindanao &quot;is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 in the last three decades.&quot; There is a widely held stereotype that the violence is perpetrated by armed groups that resort to terrorism to further their political goals, but the actual situation is far more complex. While the Muslim-Christian conflict and the state-rebel conflicts dominate popular perceptions and media attention, a survey commissioned by The Asia Foundation in 2002—and further verified by a recent Social Weather Stations survey—revealed that citizens are more concerned about the prevalence of &quot;rido&quot; and its negative impact on their communities than the conflict between the state and rebel groups. The unfortunate interaction and subsequent confusion of &quot;rido&quot;-based violence with secessionism, communist insurgency, banditry, military involvement and other forms of armed violence shows that violence in Mindanao is more complicated than what is commonly believed.

&quot;Rido&quot; has wider implications for conflict in Mindanao, primarily because it tends to interact in unfortunate ways with separatist conflict and other forms of armed violence. Many armed confrontations in the past involving insurgent groups and the military were triggered by a local &quot;rido&quot;. The studies cited above investigated the dynamics of &quot;rido&quot; with the intention of helping design strategic interventions to address such conflicts.

=====Causes=====
The causes of &quot;rido&quot; are varied and may be further complicated by a society&#x27;s concept of honor and shame, an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The triggers for conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of &quot;rido&quot;. Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of &quot;rido&quot;.

=====Statistics=====
Studies on &quot;rido&quot; have documented a total of 1,266 &quot;rido&quot; cases between the 1930s and 2005, which have killed over 5,500 people and displaced thousands. The four provinces with the highest numbers of &quot;rido&quot; incidences are: Lanao del Sur (377), Maguindanao (218), Lanao del Norte (164), and Sulu (145). Incidences in these four provinces account for 71% of the total documented cases. The findings also show a steady rise in &quot;rido&quot; conflicts in the eleven provinces surveyed from the 1980s to 2004. According to the studies, during 2002–2004, 50% (637 cases) of total &quot;rido&quot; incidences occurred, equaling about 127 new &quot;rido&quot; cases per year. Out of the total number of &quot;rido&quot; cases documented, 64% remain unresolved.

===== Resolution =====
&quot;Rido&quot; conflicts are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccurring. Although the majority of these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases can utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of blood money to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups. Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.

<text>Multiple myeloma (MM), also known as plasma cell myeloma and simply myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. Often, no symptoms are noticed initially. As it progresses, bone pain, anemia, renal insufficiency, and infections may occur. Complications may include hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.
The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. Risk factors include obesity, radiation exposure, family history, age and certain chemicals. There is an increased risk of multiple myeloma in certain occupations. This is due to the occupational exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents having a role in causation of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is the result of a multi-step malignant transformation, and almost universally originates from the pre-malignant stage monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). As MGUS evolves into MM, another pre-stage of the disease is reached, known as smoldering myeloma (SMM).

In MM, the abnormal plasma cells produce abnormal antibodies, which can cause kidney problems and overly thick blood. The plasma cells can also form a mass in the bone marrow or soft tissue. When one tumor is present, it is called a plasmacytoma; more than one is called multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed based on blood or urine tests finding abnormal antibody proteins (often using electrophoretic techniques revealing the presence of a monoclonal spike in the results, termed an m-spike), bone marrow biopsy finding cancerous plasma cells, and medical imaging finding bone lesions. Another common finding is high blood calcium levels.
Multiple myeloma is considered treatable, but generally incurable. Remissions may be brought about with steroids, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant. Bisphosphonates and radiation therapy are sometimes used to reduce pain from bone lesions. Recently, new approaches utilizing CAR-T cell therapy have been included in the treatment regimes.
Globally, about 175,000 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2020, while about 117,000 people died from the disease that year. In the U.S., forecasts suggest about 35,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease in 2023, and about 12,000 people will die from the disease that year. In 2020, an estimated 170,405 people were living with myeloma in the U.S.

It is difficult to judge mortality statistics because treatments for the disease are advancing rapidly. Based on data concerning people diagnosed with the disease between 2013 and 2019, about 60% lived five years or more post-diagnosis, with about 34% living ten years or more. People newly diagnosed with the disease now have a better outlook, due to improved treatments.

The disease usually occurs around the age of 60 and is more common in men than women. It is uncommon before the age of 40. The word &quot;myeloma&quot; is from Greek &quot;myelo-&quot; &#x27;marrow&#x27; and &quot;-oma&quot; &#x27;tumor&#x27;.
==Signs and symptoms==
Because many organs can be affected by myeloma, the symptoms and signs vary greatly. Fatigue and bone pain are the most common symptoms at presentation. The CRAB criteria were formerly the benchmark used to establish the presence of active multiple myeloma (as opposed to an earlier, generally asymptomatic, &quot;smoldering&quot; form of the disease). The CRAB criteria are:
* Calcium: serum calcium &gt;0.25 mmol/L (&gt;1 mg/dL) higher than the upper limit of normal or &gt;2.75 mmol/L (&gt;11 mg/dL)
* Renal insufficiency: creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL per minute or serum creatinine &gt;1.77 mol/L (&gt;2 mg/dL)
* Anemia: hemoglobin value of &gt;2g/dL below the lowest limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value &lt;10g/dL
* Bone lesions: osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET/CT

 the diagnostic criteria were expanded and updated by the IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) to add three myeloma-defining events, any one of which indicates the presence of active multiple myeloma. Each of these three events may occur before any of the CRAB criteria appears, thereby making more people eligible for treatment with myeloma drugs earlier.

===Bone pain===

Bone pain affects almost 70% of people with multiple myeloma and is one of the most common symptoms. Myeloma bone pain usually involves the spine and ribs and worsens with activity. Persistent, localized pain may indicate a pathological bone fracture. Involvement of the vertebrae may lead to spinal cord compression or kyphosis. Myeloma bone disease is due to the overexpression of receptor activator for nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) by bone marrow stroma. RANKL activates osteoclasts, which resorb bone. The resultant bone lesions are lytic (cause breakdown) in nature, and are best seen in plain radiographs, which may show &quot;punched-out&quot; resorptive lesions (including the &quot;raindrop&quot; appearance of the skull on radiography). The breakdown of bone also leads to the release of calcium ions into the blood, leading to hypercalcemia and its associated symptoms.

===Anemia===
The anemia found in myeloma is usually normocytic and normochromic. It results from the replacement of normal bone marrow by infiltrating tumor cells and inhibition of normal red blood cell production (hematopoiesis) by cytokines.

===Impaired kidney function===
Impaired kidney function may develop, either acutely or chronically, and with any degree of severity.
The most common cause of kidney failure in multiple myeloma is due to proteins secreted by the malignant cells. Myeloma cells produce monoclonal proteins of varying types, most commonly immunoglobulins (antibodies) and free light chains, resulting in abnormally high levels of these proteins in the blood. Depending on the size of these proteins, they may be excreted through the kidneys. Kidneys can be damaged by the effects of proteins or light chains. Increased bone resorption leads to hypercalcemia and causes nephrocalcinosis, thereby contributing to kidney failure. Amyloidosis is a distant third in the causation. People with amyloidosis have high levels of amyloid protein that can be excreted through the kidneys and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.

Light chains produce myriad effects that can manifest as the Fanconi syndrome (type II kidney tubular acidosis).

===Infection===
Collateral infections are common with multiple myeloma since the disease impairs the functioning of blood components that normally resist pathogens. The most common infections are pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. The greatest risk period for the occurrence of infection is in the initial few months after the start of new drug therapy, since many drug therapies further suppress the normal immune response.

Infections (and &quot;adverse events&quot; for all diseases) are graded by a standardized scale. With some myeloma drug therapies, over 30% of people experience a &quot;Grade 3&quot; or higher infection (many people experience multiple such infections), calling for intervention at least by antibiotics. Of people who die within 6 months of their myeloma diagnosis, between 20% and 50% die from collateral infections.

Clinical evaluation of a person&#x27;s immune response is typically performed by a lab test that measures the levels of different immunoglobulins in the blood. There are five varieties of immunoglobulins, indicated by the suffices -A, -D, -E, -G and -M. In the aggregate, the immunoglobulin level may be elevated with the disease, but the majority of such increased antibodies are of a monoclonal variety due to the clonal plasma cell and are thus ineffective. Such ineffective antibodies are common of the immunoglobulin -A and -G varieties. When the measure of effective antibodies drops below a threshold (a condition termed hypogammaglobulinemia), supplemental immunoglobulins may be provided by periodic infusions to reduce the risk of collateral infections.

===Neurological symptoms===
Some symptoms (e.g., weakness, confusion, and fatigue) may be due to anemia or hypercalcemia. Headache, visual changes, and retinopathy may be the result of hyperviscosity of the blood depending on the properties of the paraprotein. Finally, radicular pain, loss of bowel or bladder control (due to involvement of spinal cord leading to cord compression) or carpal tunnel syndrome, and other neuropathies (due to infiltration of peripheral nerves by amyloid) may occur. It may give rise to paraplegia in late-presenting cases.

When the disease is well-controlled, neurological symptoms may result from current treatments, some of which may cause peripheral neuropathy, manifesting itself as numbness or pain in the hands, feet, and lower legs.

=== Mouth ===
The initial symptoms may involve pain, numbness, swelling, expansion of the jaw, tooth mobility, and radiolucency. Multiple myeloma in the mouth can mimic common tooth problems such as periapical abscess or periodontal abscess, gingivitis, periodontitis, or other gingival enlargement or masses.

==Cause==

The cause of multiple myeloma is generally unknown.

===Risk factors===
* Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) increases the risk of developing multiple myeloma. MGUS transforms to multiple myeloma at the rate of 1% to 2% per year, and almost all cases of multiple myeloma are preceded by MGUS.
* Smoldering multiple myeloma increases the risk of developing multiple myeloma. Individuals diagnosed with this premalignant disorder develop multiple myeloma at a rate of 10% per year for the first 5 years, 3% per year for the next 5 years, and then 1% per year.
* Obesity is related to multiple myeloma with each increase of body mass index by five increasing the relative risk by 11%. In addition, studies have shown a positive correlation between BMI and adhesion of multiple myeloma cells.

Studies have reported a familial predisposition to myeloma. Hyperphosphorylation of several proteins—the paratarg proteins—a tendency that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, appears a common mechanism in these families. This tendency is more common in African-Americans with myeloma and may contribute to the higher rates of myeloma in this group.

=== Occupations ===
In a study to investigate the association between occupational exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents (Benzene and its many derivatives), evidence has shown that these solvents have a role in causation of multiple myeloma. The occurrence of multiple myeloma may occur more in certain occupations. The risk of multiple myeloma occurring is greater in occupations as a firefighter, as a hairdresser, and in agricultural and industrial occupations. The risk in certain occupations is due to exposure to different chemicals. Repeated exposure to chemicals increases the risk of multiple myeloma. The use of pesticides and hazardous chemicals in occupations, like firefighting and agriculture has been seen to cause an increase in risk for multiple myeloma. Other occupations, such as industrial occupations, are also at increased risk for multiple myeloma. Industrial workers are exposed to chemicals that have aromatic hydrocarbon solvents in them.

Exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, benzene, toluene, and xylene, can increase risk of multiple myeloma. Increased duration, high intensity of exposure, or repeated exposure was associated with an increased risk of multiple myeloma by up to 63%. The time from exposure to diagnosis was studied, and diagnosis after exposure lagged at least 20 years. When exposure to one chemical was identified, there was usually exposure to another hydrocarbon solvent identified. Multiple myeloma affects more men, older adults, and African Americans. These populations also have higher exposure frequencies than their female counterparts.

====Epstein–Barr virus====
Rarely, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple myeloma, particularly in individuals who have an immunodeficiency due to e.g. HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or a chronic inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. EBV-positive multiple myeloma is classified by the World Health Organization (2016) as one form of the Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and termed Epstein–Barr virus-associated plasma cell myeloma. EBV-positive disease is more common in the plasmacytoma rather than multiple myeloma form of plasma cell cancer. Tissues involved in EBV+ disease typically show foci of EBV+ cells with the appearance of rapidly proliferating immature or poorly differentiated plasma cells. The cells express products of EBV genes such as EBER1 and EBER2. While the EBV contributes to the development and/or progression of most Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases, its role in multiple myeloma is not known. However, people who are EBV-positive with localized plasmacytoma(s) are more likely to progress to multiple myeloma compared to people with EBV-negative plasmacytoma(s). This suggest that EBV may have a role in the progression of plasmacytomas to systemic multiple myeloma.

==Pathophysiology==

B lymphocytes start in the bone marrow and move to the lymph nodes. As they progress, they mature and display different proteins on their cell surfaces (cell surface antigens). When they are activated to secrete antibodies, they are known as plasma cells.

Multiple myeloma develops in B lymphocytes after they have left the part of the lymph node known as the germinal center. The normal cell type most closely associated with MM cells is generally taken to be either an activated memory B cell or the precursor to plasma cells, the plasmablast.

The immune system keeps the proliferation of B cells and the secretion of antibodies under tight control. When chromosomes and genes are damaged, often through rearrangement, this control is lost. Often, a promoter gene moves (or translocates) to a chromosome, where it stimulates an antibody gene to overproduction.

A chromosomal translocation between the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (on chromosome 14, locus q32) and an oncogene (often 11q13, 4p16.3, 6p21, 16q23 and 20q11) is frequently observed in people with multiple myeloma. This mutation results in dysregulation of the oncogene which is thought to be an important initiating event in the pathogenesis of myeloma. The result is a proliferation of a plasma cell clone and genomic instability that leads to further mutations and translocations. The chromosome 14 abnormality is observed in about 50% of all cases of myeloma. Deletion of (parts of) chromosome 13 is also observed in about 50% of cases.

Production of cytokines (especially IL-6) by the plasma cells causes much of their localized damage, such as osteoporosis, and creates a microenvironment in which the malignant cells thrive. Angiogenesis (the generation of new blood vessels) is increased.

The produced antibodies are deposited in various organs, leading to kidney failure, polyneuropathy, and various other myeloma-associated symptoms.

=== Epigenetics ===
Epigenetic modifications, as DNA methylation or histone modifications, are key for the disease establishment and progression. In a study that investigated the DNA methylation profile of multiple myeloma cells and normal plasma cells, a gradual demethylation from stem cells to plasma cells was observed, with site-specific gain of methylation. Loss of methylation is associated with gene activation and gain of methylation is correlated with gene silencing. The dysregulated methylation pattern in multiple myeloma results in the activation of specific oncogenes and repression of specific tumor suppressor genes. The observed methylation pattern of CpG within intronic regions with enhancer-related chromatin marks in multiple myeloma is similar to undifferentiated precursor and stem cells. These results may represent a &quot;de novo&quot; epigenetic reprogramming in multiple myeloma, leading to the acquisition of a methylation pattern related to stemness.

Other studies have identified a multiple myeloma specific gene silencing pattern associated with abnormal histone modifications caused by dysregulation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Increased expression of the PRC2 subunit, EZH2 have been described to be a common feature in multiple myeloma, resulting in an accumulation and redistribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation which advances with disease severity.

===Genetics===

Genetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma divide the disease into two main groups, hyperdiploid multiple myeloma and non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma. Hyperdiploid MM is associated with a good prognosis and includes trisomies of odd-numbered chromosomes. Non-hyperdiploid MM has a worse outcome and is characterized by translocations on chromosome 14, which leads to the expression of oncogenes. These translocations can be t(11;14), t(6;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20). Other genetic alterations are 1q amplification, deletion 1p, deletion 17, deletion 13, MYC overexpression, and point mutations in key pathways.

Associated genetic mutations include ATM, BRAF, CCND1, DIS3, FAM46C, KRAS, NRAS and TP53.

=== Development ===

The genetic and epigenetic changes occur progressively. The initial change, often involving one chromosome 14 translocation, establishes a clone of bone marrow plasma cells that causes the asymptomatic disorder MGUS, which is a premalignant disorder characterized by increased numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow or the circulation of a myeloma protein immunoglobulin. Further genetic or epigenetic changes produce a new clone of bone marrow plasma cells, usually descendant from the original clone, that causes the more serious, but still asymptomatic premalignant disorder smoldering multiple myeloma. This myeloma is characterized by a rise in the number of bone marrow plasma cells or levels of the circulating myeloma protein above that seen in MGUS.

Subsequent genetic and epigenetic changes lead to a new, more aggressive clone of plasma cells, which causes further rises in the level of the circulating myeloma protein, further rises in the number of bone marrow plasma cells, or the development of one or more of a specific set of &quot;CRAB&quot; symptoms, which are the basis for diagnosing malignant multiple myeloma and treating the disease.

In a small percentage of multiple myeloma cases, further genetic and epigenetic changes lead to the development of a plasma cell clone that moves from the bone marrow into the circulatory system, invades distant tissues, and thereby causes the most malignant of all plasma cell dyscrasias, plasma cell leukemia. Thus, a fundamental genetic instability in plasma cells or their precursors leads to the progression:
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance → smoldering multiple myeloma → multiple myeloma → plasma cell leukemia
Being asymptomatic, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma are typically diagnosed fortuitously by detecting a myeloma protein on serum protein electrophoresis tests done for other purposes. MGUS is a relatively stable condition afflicting 3% of people aged 50 and 5% of people aged 70; it progresses to multiple myeloma at a rate of 0.5–1% cases per year; smoldering multiple myeloma does so at a rate of 10% per year for the first 5 years, but then falls off sharply to 3% per year for the next 5 years and thereafter to 1% per year.

Overall, some 2–4% of multiple myeloma cases eventually progress to plasma cell leukemia.

==Diagnosis==
===Blood tests===
The globulin level may be normal in established disease. A doctor may request protein electrophoresis of the blood and urine, which might show the presence of a paraprotein (monoclonal protein, or M protein) band, with or without reduction of the other (normal) immunoglobulins (known as immune paresis). One type of paraprotein is the Bence Jones protein, which is a urinary paraprotein composed of free light chains. Quantitative measurements of the paraprotein are necessary to establish a diagnosis and to monitor the disease. The paraprotein is a specific immunoglobulin (or fragment of immunoglobulin) originally produced by the mutated plasma cell which began to multiply and is now produced by the entire line of malignant cells.

In theory, multiple myeloma can produce all classes of immunoglobulin, but IgG paraproteins are most common, followed by IgA and IgM. IgD and IgE myeloma are very rare. In addition, light and or heavy chains (the building blocks of antibodies) may be secreted in isolation: κ- or λ-light chains or any of the five types of heavy chains (α-, γ-, δ-, ε- or μ-heavy chains). People without evidence of a monoclonal protein may have &quot;nonsecretory&quot; myeloma (not producing immunoglobulins); this represents about 3% of all people with multiple myeloma.

Additional findings may include a raised calcium level (when osteoclasts are breaking down bone, releasing it into the bloodstream), raised serum creatinine level due to reduced kidney function, which is mainly due to casts of paraprotein deposition in the kidney, although the cast may also contain complete immunoglobulins, Tamm-Horsfall protein and albumin.

Other useful laboratory tests include quantitative measurement of IgA, IgG, and IgM to look for immune paresis, and beta-2 microglobulin, which provides prognostic information. On peripheral blood smear, the rouleaux formation of red blood cells is commonly seen, though this is not specific.

The recent introduction of a commercial immunoassay for measurement of free light chains potentially offers an improvement in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment, particularly where the paraprotein is difficult to measure accurately by electrophoresis (for example in light chain myeloma, or where the paraprotein level is very low). Initial research also suggests that measurement of free light chains may also be used, in conjunction with other markers, for assessment of the risk of progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma.

This assay, the serum free light chain assay, has recently been recommended by the International Myeloma Working Group for the screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of plasma cell dyscrasias.

===Histopathology===
A bone marrow biopsy is usually performed to estimate the percentage of bone marrow occupied by plasma cells. This percentage is used in the diagnostic criteria for myeloma. Immunohistochemistry (staining particular cell types using antibodies against surface proteins) can detect plasma cells that express immunoglobulin in the cytoplasm and occasionally on the cell surface; myeloma cells are often CD56, CD38, CD138, and CD319 positive and CD19, CD20, and CD45 negative. Flow cytometry is often used to establish the clonal nature of the plasma cells, which will generally express only kappa or lambda light chain. Cytogenetics may also be performed in myeloma for prognostic purposes, including a myeloma-specific fluorescent &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization and virtual karyotype.

The plasma cells seen in multiple myeloma have several possible morphologies. First, they could have the appearance of a normal plasma cell, a large cell two or three times the size of a peripheral lymphocyte. Because they are actively producing antibodies, the Golgi apparatus typically produces a light-colored area adjacent to the nucleus, called a perinuclear halo. The single nucleus (with inside a single nucleolus with vesicular nuclear chromatin) is eccentric, displaced by an abundant cytoplasm.
Other common morphologies seen, but which are not usual in normal plasma cells, include:
* Bizarre cells, which are multinucleated
* Mott cells, containing multiple clustered cytoplasmic droplets or other inclusions (sometimes confused with Auer rods, commonly seen in myeloid blasts)
* Flame cells, having a fiery red cytoplasm

Historically, the CD138 has been used to isolate myeloma cells for diagnostic purposes. However, this antigen disappears rapidly &quot;ex vivo&quot;. Recently, however, the surface antigen CD319 (SLAMF7) was discovered to be considerably more stable and allows robust isolation of malignant plasma cells from delayed or even cryopreserved samples.

The prognosis varies widely depending on various risk factors. The Mayo Clinic has developed a risk-stratification model termed Mayo Stratification for Myeloma and Risk-adapted Therapy (mSMART), which divides people into high-risk and standard-risk categories. People with deletion of chromosome 13 or hypodiploidy by conventional cytogenetics, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20) or 17p- by molecular genetic studies, or with a high plasma cell labeling index (3% or more) are considered to have high-risk myeloma.

===Medical imaging===
The diagnostic examination of a person with suspected multiple myeloma typically includes a skeletal survey. This is a series of X-rays of the skull, axial skeleton, and proximal long bones. Myeloma activity sometimes appears as &quot;lytic lesions&quot; (with local disappearance of normal bone due to resorption) or as &quot;punched-out lesions&quot; on the skull X-ray (&quot;raindrop skull&quot;). Lesions may also be sclerotic, which is seen as radiodense. Overall, the radiodensity of myeloma is between −30 and 120 Hounsfield units (HU). Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive than simple X-rays in the detection of lytic lesions, and may supersede a skeletal survey, especially when vertebral disease is suspected. Occasionally, a CT scan is performed to measure the size of soft-tissue plasmacytomas. Nuclear Medicine Bone scans are typically not of any additional value in the workup of people with myeloma (no new bone formation; lytic lesions not well visualized on nuclear bone scan).

===Diagnostic criteria===
In 2003, the IMG agreed on diagnostic criteria for symptomatic myeloma, asymptomatic myeloma, and MGUS, which was subsequently updated in 2009:
* Symptomatic myeloma (all three criteria must be met):
*# Clonal plasma cells &gt;10% on bone marrow biopsy or (in any quantity) in a biopsy from other tissues (plasmacytoma)
*# A monoclonal protein (myeloma protein) in either serum or urine and it has to be more than 3g/dL (except in cases of true nonsecretory myeloma)
*# Evidence of end-organ damage felt related to the plasma cell disorder (related organ or tissue impairment, CRAB):
*#* HyperCalcemia (corrected calcium &gt;2.75 mmol/L, &gt;11 mg/dL)
*#* Renal failure (kidney insufficiency) attributable to myeloma
*#* Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL)
*#* Bone lesions (lytic lesions or osteoporosis with compression fractures)

Note: Recurrent infections alone in a person who has none of the CRAB features is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of myeloma. People who lack CRAB features, but have evidence of amyloidosis, should be considered as amyloidosis and not myeloma. CRAB-like abnormalities are common with numerous diseases, and these abnormalities must be felt to be directly attributable to the related plasma cell disorder and every attempt made to rule out other underlying causes of anemia, kidney failure, etc.

In 2014, the IMWG updated its criteria further to include biomarkers of malignancy. These biomarkers are &gt;60% clonal plasma cells, a serum involved / uninvolved free light chain ratio ≥ 100 (the concentration of the involved free light chain must be ≥ 100 mg/L) and more than one focal lesion ≥ 5 mm by MRI. Together, these biomarkers and the CRAB criteria are known as myeloma-defining events (MDEs). A person must have &gt;10 % clonal plasma cells and any MDE to be diagnosed with myeloma. The biomarker criteria were added so that smouldering people with multiple myeloma at high risk of developing multiple myeloma could be diagnosed before organ damage occurred, so they would therefore have a better prognosis.
* Asymptomatic/smoldering myeloma:
*# Serum M protein &gt;30 g/L (3 g/dL) or
*# Clonal plasma cells &gt;10% on bone marrow biopsy and
*# No myeloma-related organ or tissue impairment
* Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS):
*# Serum paraprotein &lt;30 g/L (3 g/dL) and
*# Clonal plasma cells &lt;10% on bone marrow biopsy and
*# No myeloma-related organ or tissue impairment or a related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder

Related conditions include solitary plasmacytoma (a single tumor of plasma cells, typically treated with irradiation), plasma cell dyscrasia (where only the antibodies produce symptoms, e.g., AL amyloidosis), and peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes.

===Staging===
In multiple myeloma, staging helps with prognostication but does not guide treatment decisions. The Durie-Salmon staging system was used historically and was replaced by the International Staging System (ISS), published by the International Myeloma Working Group In 2005. The revised ISS (R-ISS) was published in 2015 and incorporates cytogenetics and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
* Stage I: β2 microglobulin (β2M) &lt; 3.5 mg/L, albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL, normal cytogenetics, no elevated LDH
* Stage II: Not classified under Stage I or Stage III
* Stage III: β2M ≥ 5.5 mg/L and either elevated LDH or high-risk cytogenetics [t(4,14), t(14,16), and/or del(17p)]

==Prevention==
The risk of multiple myeloma can be reduced slightly by maintaining a normal body weight.

==Treatment==
Most drug therapies employ multiple agents, e.g., so-called &quot;triplet&quot; or &quot;quadruplet&quot; therapies. Many such groupings include one or more of a monoclonal antibody (e.g., isatuximab or daratumumab), an immunomodulatory agent (e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., or bortezomib, carfilzomib or ixazomib), in combination with a steroid (e.g., dexamethasone).

While triplet therapies were the standard of care for many years, current practice more commonly applies quadruplets of drugs. Such combination therapies are commonly referenced by initials, employing upper-case letters for drug brand names and lower-case letters for generic drug names, e.g., VRd for Velcade (brand name for bortezomib), Revlimid (brand name for lenalidomide) and dexamethasone. Similarly with DKRd, with the D representing Darzalex (brand name for daratumumab), and K representing Kyprolis (brand name for carfilzomib). (Emerging practice is not to call such drugs &quot;chemotherapy&quot; because they are not the traditional non-specific intracellular poisons that operate in the classic &quot;chemo&quot; fashion of inhibiting mitosis or inducing DNA damage.)

Commonly, the efficacy of each drug diminishes over time, as the cancer develops drug resistance mechanisms, such as by clonal evolution or genetic mutations. In part for this reason, multiple myeloma has not historically been treated when in its &quot;smoldering&quot; stage, since the drug(s) utilized may then be of diminished efficacy if the disease progresses to a symptomatic stage. Thus, the standard of care was &quot;watchful waiting&quot; while the disease smoldered. Increasingly, however, efforts are underway to study whether drug therapies applied during the smoldering stage might prevent the disease from ever advancing to the active stage. Exemplary are the GEM-CESAR, ASCENT and Immuno-PRISM clinical trials.

After drug therapy has reduced a patient&#x27;s cancer burden, some patients undergo a bone marrow transplant (more properly termed a autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or ASCT) to further suppress the disease. However, this procedure is not available for frail patients, as it essentially resets aspects of the immune system and requires redevelopment of natural defenses, such as by administering childhood vaccines.

Increasingly, precision medicine therapies are being explored, with research indicating that certain variants and genetic sub-types of the disease respond more favorably to some drug therapies than others. For example, some research indicates that patients with the t(11,14) genetic translocation (present in about 15-20% of multiple myeloma patients) may particularly benefit from Venetoclax therapy (which is FDA approved for other blood cancers but not yet available for multiple myeloma patients except through clinical trials).

While drug therapies commonly entail months or years of treatment, CAR-T therapy offers the alternative of a single treatment (albeit involving a prolonged hospital stay). Moreover, CAR-T treatment seems to provide a deeper, longer-lasting disease remission than existing drugs. Presently, however, such therapy is FDA-approved only for patients in later stages of the disease and is available only at certain medical centers.

An upcoming therapy that also leverages T-cell immune response is the class of drugs termed bispecific T-cell engagers (BITE), or sometimes simply bispecific antibodies. The first drug in this class approved for multiple myeloma is Teclistamab, but again its use is presently reserved for patients in later stages of the disease. Another BITE drug,Talquetamab, is under study; others are in the pipeline. (Ongoing clinical trials are investigating BITE therapy for smoldering and newly diagnosed patients.)

Some patients seek out clinical drug trials, as these provide a degree of medical oversight not present in most other clinical settings – not to mention access to new drugs that seem to hold promise over existing therapies. Some patients temporarily relocate to urban areas where such trials are available.

The major cancer research institutes offer the most clinical trials, but some trials (particularly later-stage, Phase 3, trials) are available at satellite networks that extend to hundreds of hospitals. The U.S. National Institutes of Health maintains a directory of clinical trials. In the U.S., cities such as New York, Boston, Houston and Rochester host leading multiple myeloma research efforts; globally, other top-tier myeloma research programs are found at the University of Salamanca, Spain, and at Vrije Universiteit Brussels, amongst others.

Medical information soon becomes outdated in fast-moving medical arenas, such as therapies for multiple myeloma, so oncologists at smaller medical centers may not be able to stay up-to-date with the literature in all relevant disciplines. This has given rise to organizations that work to educate patients on the latest developments in the disease, e.g., by offering webinars featuring prominent researchers and practitioners who focus on multiple myeloma; examples of such organisations are the International Myeloma Foundation and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. Some patients interested in following latest developments review proceedings from major hematologic cancer conferences, such as the American Society of Hematologists (ASH) Conference, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Conference, the IMF IMWG Summit, and the European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Conference.

Treatment is indicated in myeloma with symptoms. If there are no symptoms, but a paraprotein typical of myeloma and diagnostic bone marrow is present without end-organ damage, treatment is usually deferred or restricted to clinical trials. Treatment for multiple myeloma is focused on decreasing the clonal plasma cell population and consequently decrease the symptoms of disease.

===Chemotherapy===
====Initial====

The preferred treatment for those under the age of 65 is high-dose chemotherapy, commonly with bortezomib-based regimens, and lenalidomide–dexamethasone, to be followed by a stem cell transplant. A 2016 study concluded that stem cell transplant is the preferred treatment for multiple myeloma. There are two types of stem cell transplants to treat multiple myeloma. In autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) – the patient&#x27;s stem cells are collected from the patient&#x27;s blood. The patient is given high-dose chemotherapy, and the patient&#x27;s stem cells are then transplanted back into the patient. The process is not curative but does prolong overall survival and complete remission. In allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, a healthy donor&#x27;s stem cells are transplanted into the affected person. Allogenic stem-cell transplantation has the potential for a cure, but is used in a very small percentage of people (and in the relapsed setting, not as part of initial treatment). Furthermore, a 5–10% treatment-associated mortality rate is associated with allogeneic stem-cell transplant.

People over age 65 and people with significant concurrent illnesses often cannot tolerate stem-cell transplantation. For these people, the standard of care has been chemotherapy with melphalan and prednisone. Recent studies among this population suggest improved outcomes with new chemotherapy regimens, e.g., with bortezomib. Treatment with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone had an estimated overall survival of 83% at 30 months, lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone an 82% survival at 2 years, and melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide had a 90% survival at 2 years. Head-to-head studies comparing these regimens have not been performed .

There is support for continuous therapies with multiple drug combinations of antimyeloma drugs bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide as initial treatment for transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma. Further clinical studies are required to determine the potential harms of these drugs and their effect on the person&#x27;s quality of life. A 2009 review noted, &quot;Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the major side effects of
thalidomide and lenalidomide. Lenalidomide causes more myelosuppression, and thalidomide causes more sedation. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia are major side effects of bortezomib.&quot; The addition of subcutaneous daratumumab to induction and consolidation therapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, and to lenalidomide maintenance therapy, conferred improved progression-free survival among transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

Treatment of related hyperviscosity syndrome may be required to prevent neurologic symptoms or kidney failure.

====Maintenance====
Most people, including those treated with ASCT, relapse after initial treatment. Maintenance therapy using a prolonged course of low-toxicity medications is often used to prevent relapse. A 2017 meta-analysis showed that post-ASCT maintenance therapy with lenalidomide improved progression-free survival and overall survival in people at standard risk. A 2012 clinical trial showed that people with intermediate- and high-risk disease benefit from a bortezomib-based maintenance regimen.

====Relapse====
Reasons for relapse include disease evolution, either from the selective pressure applied by treatment or by de novo mutations and/or if the disease was inadequately represented in the initial biopsy. Relapse within the first 18 months of diagnosis is considered as functional high-risk multiple myeloma. Depending on the person&#x27;s condition, the prior treatment modalities used, and the duration of remission, options for relapsed disease include retreatment with the original agent, use of other agents (such as melphalan, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, or dexamethasone, alone or in combination), and a second ASCT.

Later in the course of the disease, it becomes refractory (resistant) to formerly effective treatment. This stage is referred to as relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Treatment modalities that are commonly used to treat RRMM include dexamethasone, proteasome inhibitors (e.g. bortezomib and carfilzomib), immunomodulatory imide drugs (e.g. thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), and certain monoclonal antibodies (e.g. isatuximab against CD38 or antibodies targeting CD319). Survival expectancy has risen in recent years, and new treatments are under development.

Kidney failure in multiple myeloma can be acute (reversible) or chronic (irreversible). Acute kidney failure typically resolves when the calcium and paraprotein levels are brought under control. Treatment of chronic kidney failure is dependent on the type of kidney failure and may involve dialysis.

Several newer options are approved for the management of advanced disease:
* belantamab mafodotin: a monoclonal antibody against B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), also known as CD269, indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent.
* carfilzomib: a proteasome inhibitor that is indicated:
** as a single agent in people who have received one or more lines of therapy
** in combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in people who have received one to three lines of therapy
* daratumumab: a monoclonal antibody against CD38 indicated in people who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent
* elotuzumab: an immunostimulatory humanized monoclonal antibody against SLAMF7 (also known as CD319) indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in people who have received one to three prior therapies
* isatuximab: a monoclonal antibody against CD38 indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.
* ixazomib: an orally available proteasome inhibitor indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in people who have received at least one prior therapy
* panobinostat: an orally available histone deacetylase inhibitor used in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in people who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent
* selinexor: an orally available selective inhibitor of nuclear export indicated in combination with dexamethasone in people who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease does not respond to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody
* idecabtagene vicleucel: first cell-based gene therapy was approved by FDA in 2021 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies

Talquetamab (Talvey) and elranatamab (Elrexfio) were approved for medical use in the United States in August 2023.

=== Stem cell transplant ===
Stem cell transplant can be used to treat multiple myeloma. Stem cell transplants come with a risk of a graft-versus-host-disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells may reduce all-cause mortality if they are used for a therapeutic reason and the therapeutic use of MSCs may increase the complete response of acute and chronic GvHD, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence suggests that MSCs for prophylactic reason result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality, in the relapse of malignant diseases, and in the incidence of acute GvHD. The evidence suggests that MSCs for prophylactic reason reduce the incidence of chronic GvHD.

=== Bone marrow transplant ===
Plerixafor (Mozobil) was approved for medical use in the United States in 2008.

Motixafortide (Aphexda) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2023.

=== Gene therapy ===
* Idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) – first cell-based gene therapy was approved by FDA in 2021 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies
* Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2022. Ciltacabtagene autoleucel is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.

===Other measures===
In addition to direct treatment of the plasma cell proliferation, bisphosphonates (e.g., pamidronate or zoledronic acid) are routinely administered to prevent fractures; they have also been observed to have a direct antitumor effect even in people without known skeletal disease. If needed, red blood cell transfusions or erythropoietin can be used for management of anemia.

=== Side effects ===
Chemotherapies and stem cell transplants can cause unwanted bleeding and may require platelet transfusions. It was seen that platelet transfusions for people undergoing chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation for the prevention of bleeding events had different effects on the number of participants with a bleeding event, the number of days on which bleeding occurred, the mortality secondary to bleeding and the number of platelet transfusions depending on the way they were used (therapeutic, depending on a threshold, different dose schedules or prophylactic).

=== Supportive treatment ===
Adding physical exercises to the standard treatment for adult patients with haematological malignancies like multiple myeloma may result in little to no difference in mortality, in the quality of life, and in the physical functioning. These exercises may result in a slight reduction in depression. Furthermore, aerobic physical exercises probably reduce fatigue. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect and serious adverse events

=== Palliative care ===
Multiple national cancer treatment guidelines recommend early palliative care for people with advanced multiple myeloma at the time of diagnosis and for anyone who has significant symptoms.

Palliative care is appropriate at any stage of multiple myeloma and can be provided alongside curative treatment. In addition to addressing symptoms of cancer, palliative care helps manage unwanted side effects, such as pain and nausea related to treatments.

=== Teeth ===
Oral prophylaxis, hygiene instruction, and elimination of sources of infection within the mouth before beginning cancer treatment can reduce the risk of infectious complications. Before starting bisphosphonate therapy, the person&#x27;s dental health should be evaluated to assess the risk factors to prevent the development of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). If there are any symptoms or radiographic appearance of MRONJ, such as jaw pain, loose tooth, or mucosal swelling, early referral to an oral surgeon is recommended. Dental extractions should be avoided during the active period of treatment, and the affected tooth should be treated with nonsurgical root canal therapies instead.

==Prognosis==
Overall the 5-year survival rate is around 54% in the United States. With high-dose therapy followed by ASCT, the median survival has been estimated in 2003 to be about 4.5 years, compared to a median around 3.5 years with &quot;standard&quot; therapy.

The international staging system can help to predict survival, with a median survival (in 2005) of 62 months for stage-1 disease, 45 months for stage-2 disease, and 29 months for stage-3 disease. The median age at diagnosis is 69 years.

===Genetic testing===
SNP array karyotyping can detect copy number alterations of prognostic significance that may be missed by a targeted FISH panel.

The following table outlines the prognostic effect of various genetic findings in multiple myeloma, with chromosomal translocations designated t, followed by standard nomenclature thereof:
==Epidemiology==

Globally, multiple myeloma affected 488,000 people and resulted in 101,100 deaths in 2015. This is up from 49,000 in 1990.

===United Kingdom===
Myeloma is the 17th-most common cancer in the UK: around 4,800 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011. It is the 16th-most common cause of cancer death: around 2,700 people died of it in 2012.

===United States===
In the United States in 2016, an estimated 30,330 new cases and 12,650 deaths were reported. These numbers are based on assumptions made using data from 2011, which estimated the number of people affected as 83,367 people, the number of new cases as 6.1 per 100,000 people per year, and the mortality as 3.4 per 100,000 people per year.

Multiple myeloma is the second-most prevalent blood cancer (10%) after non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. It represents about 1.8% of all new cancers and 2.1% of all cancer deaths.

Multiple myeloma affects slightly more men than women. African Americans and Native Pacific Islanders have the highest reported number of new cases of this disease in the United States and Asians have the lowest. Results of one study found the number of new cases of myeloma to be 9.5 cases per 100,000 African Americans and 4.1 cases per 100,000 Caucasian Americans. Among African Americans, myeloma is one of the top-10 causes of cancer death.

==Other animals==
Multiple myeloma has been diagnosed in dogs, cats, and horses.

In dogs, multiple myeloma accounts for around 8% of all haemopoietic tumors. Multiple myeloma occurs in older dogs and is not particularly associated with either males or females. No breeds appear overrepresented in case reviews that have been conducted. Diagnosis in dogs is usually delayed due to the initial nonspecificity and range of clinical signs possible. Diagnosis usually involves bone marrow studies, X-rays, and plasma-protein studies. In dogs, protein studies usually reveal the monoclonal gammaglobulin elevation to be IgA or IgG in an equal number of cases. In rare cases the globulin elevation is IgM, which is referred to as Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinemia. The prognosis for initial control and return to good quality of life in dogs is good; 43% of dogs started on a combination chemotherapeutic protocol achieved complete remission. Long-term survival is normal, with a median of 540 days reported. The disease eventually recurs, becoming resistant to available therapies. The complications of kidney failure, sepsis, or pain can lead to an animal&#x27;s death, frequently by euthanasia.

<text>Louis Thomas Hardin (May 26, 1916 – September 8, 1999), known professionally as Moondog, was an American composer, musician, performer, music theoretician, poet and inventor of musical instruments. Largely self-taught as a composer, his prolific work widely drew inspiration from jazz, classical, Native American music which he had become familiar with as a child, and Latin American music. His strongly rhythmic, contrapuntal pieces and arrangements later influenced composers of minimal music, in particular American composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass.

Due to an accident, Moondog was blind from the age of 16. He lived in New York City from the late 1940s until 1972, during which time he was often found on Sixth Avenue, between 52nd and 55th Streets, selling records, composing, and performing poetry. He briefly appeared in a cloak and horned helmet during the 1960s and was hence recognized as &quot;the Viking of Sixth Avenue&quot; by passersby and residents who were not aware of his musical career.

==Biography and career==
===Early life===
Hardin was born in Marysville, Kansas, to Louis Thomas Hardin, an Episcopalian minister, and Norma Alves. Hardin started playing a set of drums that he made from a cardboard box at the age of five. His family relocated to Wyoming, where his father opened a trading post at Fort Bridger. At one point, his father took him to an Arapaho Sun Dance where he sat on the lap of Chief Yellow Calf and played a tom-tom made from buffalo skin. He also played drums for the high school band in Hurley, Missouri.

On July 4, 1932, the 16-year-old Hardin found an object in a field which he did not realise was a dynamite cap. While he was handling it, the explosive detonated in his face and permanently blinded him. His older sister, Ruth, would read to him daily after the accident for many years. Here he had his first encounters with philosophy, science and myth that formed his character. One book in particular, &quot;The First Violin&quot; by Jessie Fothergill, inspired him to pursue music. Up to that point he had been interested mainly in percussion instruments, but from then on, he became obsessed with the desire to become a composer.

After learning the principles of music in several schools for blind young men across middle America, he taught himself the skills of ear training and composition. He studied with Burnet Tuthill at the Iowa School for the Blind.

He then moved to Batesville, Arkansas, where he lived until 1942, when he obtained a scholarship to study in Memphis, Tennessee. Although he was largely self-taught in music, learning predominantly by ear, he learned some music theory from books in braille during his time in Memphis.

In 1943, Hardin moved to New York, where he met classical musicians including Leonard Bernstein and Arturo Toscanini, as well as jazz performers such as Charlie Parker and Benny Goodman, whose upbeat tempos and often humorous compositions would influence Hardin&#x27;s later work. One of his early street posts was near the 52nd Street nightclub strip, and he was known to jazz musicians. By 1947, Hardin had adopted the name &quot;Moondog&quot; in honor of a dog &quot;who used to howl at the moon more than any dog I knew of.&quot;

===New York City===
From the late 1940s until 1972, Moondog lived as a composer and poet in New York City, occasionally playing in midtown Manhattan, eventually settling on the corner of 53rd or 54th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. He was rarely if ever homeless, and maintained an apartment in upper Manhattan and had a country retreat in Candor, New York, to which he moved full-time in 1972. He partially supported himself by selling copies of his poetry, sheet music, records, and his musical philosophy. In addition to his music and poetry, he was also known for a distinctive &quot;Viking&quot; garb that he briefly wore during the 1960s. Already bearded and long-haired, he added a Viking-style horned helmet to avoid the occasional comparisons of his appearance with that of Christ or a monk, as he had rejected Christianity in his late teens. He developed a lifelong interest in Nordic mythology, and maintained an altar to Thor in his country home in Candor.

In 1949, he traveled to a Blackfoot Sun Dance in Idaho where he performed on percussion and flute, returning to the Native American music he had first come in contact with as a child. It was this Native music, along with contemporary jazz and classical, mixed with the ambient sounds from his environment (city traffic, ocean waves, babies crying, etc.) that created the foundation of Moondog&#x27;s music.

In 1954, he won a case in the New York State Supreme Court against disc jockey Alan Freed, who had branded his radio show, &quot;The Moondog Rock and Roll Matinee&quot;, around the name &quot;Moondog&quot;, using &quot;Moondog&#x27;s Symphony&quot; (the first record that Moondog ever cut) as his &quot;calling card&quot;. Moondog believed he would not have won the case had it not been for the help of musicians such as Benny Goodman and Arturo Toscanini, who testified that he was a serious composer. Freed had to apologize and stop using the nickname &quot;Moondog&quot; on air, on the basis that Hardin was known by the name long before Freed began using it.

===Germany===

Along with his passion for Nordic culture, Moondog had an idealised view of Germany (&quot;The Holy Land with the Holy River&quot; — the Rhine), where he settled in 1974.

Moondog revisited the United States briefly in 1989, for a tribute at the New Music America Festival in Brooklyn, in which festival director Yale Evelev asked him to conduct the Brooklyn Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, stimulating a renewed interest in his music.

Eventually, a young German student named Ilona Goebel (later known as Ilona Sommer) helped Moondog set up the primary holding company for his artistic endeavors and hosted him, first in Oer-Erkenschwick, and later on in Münster in Westphalia. Moondog lived with Sommer&#x27;s family and they spent time together in Münster. During that period, Moondog created hundreds of compositions which were transferred from Braille to sheet music by Sommer. Moondog spent the remainder of his life in Germany.

On 8 September 1999, he died in Münster from heart failure. He is buried at the Central Cemetery Münster. His tomb was designed by the artist Ernst Fuchs after the death mask.

He recorded many albums and toured both in the U.S. and in Europe—France, Germany and Sweden.

==Music==
In the process of establishing himself as a composer, Moondog drew inspiration from a wide variety of styles of music. His first works were immediately inspired by the music of pow wow gatherings that he had attended as a child; as his career progressed, his music encompassed influences from bebop, swing, rumba, modernism and Renaissance music. It was characterized by what he called &quot;snaketime&quot; and described as &quot;a slithery rhythm, in times that are not ordinary [...] I&#x27;m not gonna die in 4/4 time&quot;. During the 1950s, he began to incorporate city sounds such as cars, subway trains, human speech, and foghorns into his work.

==Inventions==

Moondog invented several musical instruments, some of which were played on studio albums or in live performances by him and his subsequent ensembles. They include the &quot;oo&quot;, a small triangular-shaped harp, a larger harp which he named the &quot;ooo-ya-tsu&quot;, a triangular stringed instrument played with a bow that he called the &quot;hüs&quot; (after the Norwegian , meaning ), the &quot;dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot;, the &quot;tuji, the &quot;uni&quot;, the &quot;utsu&quot;, the &quot;hexagonal drums&quot;, and the &quot;troubador harp&quot;. His best known instrument is the trimba, a triangular percussion instrument that the composer invented in the late 1940s. The original trimba was played by Moondog&#x27;s friend and only student Stefan Lakatos, a Swedish percussionist, to whom Moondog also explained the methods for building such an instrument. Prior to Stefan&#x27;s passing on February 10 of 2023 he shared his teachings from Moondog with American composer Julian Calv.

==Legacy==
Moondog&#x27;s music from the 1940s and &#x27;50s has been cited by American composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich as a major influence on their styles, saying they took Moondog&#x27;s work &quot;very seriously and understood and appreciated it much more than what we were exposed to at Juilliard&quot;. Moondog was also admired by Charlie Parker (whom he mutually admired and paid tribute to with the piece &quot;Bird&#x27;s Lament&quot;), Frank Zappa and Igor Stravinsky, and met on several occasions with Lenny Bruce, William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg.

Moondog inspired other musicians with several songs dedicated to him. These include &quot;Moondog&quot; on Pentangle&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Sweet Child&quot; and &quot;Spear for Moondog&quot; (parts I and II) by jazz organist Jimmy McGriff on his 1968 &quot;Electric Funk&quot; album. Glam rock musician Marc Bolan and T. Rex referenced him in the song &quot;Rabbit Fighter&quot; with the line &quot;Moondog&#x27;s just a prophet to the end...&quot;. The English pop group Prefab Sprout included the song &quot;Moondog&quot; on their album &quot;&quot; released in 1990. Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin covered his song &quot;All Is Loneliness&quot; on their 1967 self-titled album. The song was also covered by Antony and the Johnsons during their 2005 tour. Mr. Scruff&#x27;s single &quot;Get a Move On&quot; from his album &quot;Keep It Unreal&quot; is structured around samples from &quot;Bird&#x27;s Lament&quot;. New York band The Insect Trust play a cover of Moondog&#x27;s song &quot;Be a Hobo&quot; on their album &quot;Hoboken Saturday Night&quot;. The track &quot;Stamping Ground&quot;, with its preamble of Moondog reciting one of his epigrams, was featured on the sampler double album &quot;Fill Your Head with Rock&quot; (CBS, 1970). Canadian composer and producer Daniel Lanois included a track called &quot;Moondog&quot; on his album/video-documentary &quot;Here Is What Is&quot;.

Between 1970 and 1980, a blind bearded mystic called &quot;Moondog&quot; appeared as the title character in a four issue series of Underground comix written and illustrated by George Metzger.

Since the early 1970s, a number of professional wrestlers have been named The Moondogs, taking inspiration from the artist.

== Personal life ==
Moondog was married briefly to Virginia Sledge in 1943, but the marriage was dissolved in 1947.

In 1952, he married Mary Suzuko Whiteing, a single mother of mixed American-Japanese heritage. She had grown up in Japan then came to New York with her mother that year. Suzuko and Hardin met on the streets of New York. According to his daughter, June, Mary was struck by his appearance and moved by his music; Moondog was stirred by the sound of her voice.

The June 4, 1952 issue of the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; features a photograph of Moondog playing a flute on a rooftop while Mary looks on endearingly: the caption indicates it is a &quot;skyline serenade&quot; to a &quot;June bride&quot;. The marriage lasted eight years. They had one daughter, June Hardin, born June 1, 1953. On the Prestige (1956) &quot;Moondog&quot; LP, Moondog&#x27;s wife, Suzuko is credited in &quot;Lullaby&quot;, singing to June, their six-week-old daughter. Hardin later fathered another daughter, Lisa Colins, out of wedlock.

<text>Sarvadaman D. S. Chowla (22 October 1907 – 10 December 1995) was an Indian American mathematician, specializing in number theory.

==Early life==
He was born in London, since his father, Gopal Chowla, a professor of mathematics in Lahore, was then studying in Cambridge. His family returned to India, where he received his master&#x27;s degree in 1928 from the Government College in Lahore. In 1931 he received his doctorate from the University of Cambridge, where he studied under J. E. Littlewood.
==Career and awards==
Chowla then returned to India, where he taught at several universities, becoming head of mathematics at Government College, Lahore in 1936. During the difficulties arising from the partition of India in 1947, he left for the United States. There he visited the Institute for Advanced Study until the fall of 1949, then taught at the University of Kansas in Lawrence until moving to the University of Colorado in 1952. He moved to Penn State in 1963 as a research professor, where he remained until his retirement in 1976. He was a member of the Indian National Science Academy.

Among his contributions are a number of results which bear his name. These include the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem, the Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence, the Chowla–Mordell theorem, and the Chowla–Selberg formula, and the Mian–Chowla sequence.

<text>Bayview is an unincorporated community centered at the intersection of State Route 525 and Bayview Road on Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, United States.

It is approximately 5 miles (8 km) west of the town of Clinton, and 4 miles (6 km) south of the city of Langley.

Bayview is a crossroads of commerce on the south end of the island, as it is centrally located, compared to the other three communities. As such, it is home to a hardware store, a craft store, a nursery, a grocery store, an alternative grocery store, and several restaurants. One gas station, a Mobil, sits by the highway. Bayview is also the home of the South Whidbey Seniors&#x27; Center, South Whidbey Fire Rescue, and Whidbey Telecom.

The historic Bayview Community Hall is located just south of Bayview Corner. Built in 1927 on donated land with volunteer help, the hall is run as a nonprofit organization and is owned by the people living in the South Whidbey School District.

Across Bayview Road from this area is a renovated Sears kit house. This house was originally built in Greenbank, and for approximately 90 years it occupied a prominent corner at Hwy 525 &amp; Wonn Road on the Greenbank Farm, before being displaced by a highway re-alignment project. It was later renovated and moved to Bayview.

The Bayview Alternative School is across Bayview Road from Bayview Corner. The building was formerly used as a K-12 school and a branch of Skagit Valley College.

Bayview is not to be confused with Bay View, located on the mainland in Skagit County.

<doc id="292149" wikidata="Q384647" url="?curid=292149" title="Motoori Norinaga">
<text>was a Japanese scholar of active during the Edo period. He is conventionally ranked as one of the Four Great Men of Kokugaku (nativist) studies.

==Life==

Norinaga was born in what is now Matsusaka in Ise Province (now part of Mie Prefecture). His ancestors were vassals of the Kitabatake clan in Ise Province for many generations. However, in the early Edo period they abandoned their samurai status, changing their surname to Ozu, and relocated to Matsusaka, where they became cotton wholesalers. The family initially prospered and had a store in Edo as well. (The film director Yasujirō Ozu was a descendant of the same line). After his elder brother&#x27;s death, Norinaga succeeded to the Ozu line. At one stage he was adopted out to a paper-making family but the bookish boy was not suited to business.

It was at his mother&#x27;s suggestion that, at the age of 22, Norinaga went to Kyoto to study medicine. In Kyoto, he also studied Chinese and Japanese philology under the neo-Confucianist Hori Keizan. It was at this time that Norinaga became interested in the Japanese classics and decided to enter the field of under the influence of Ogyū Sorai and Keichū. (With changes in the language, the ancient classics were already poorly understood by Japanese in the Edo period and texts needed philological analysis in order to be properly understood.) Life in Kyoto also instilled in the young Norinaga a love of traditional Japanese court culture.

Returning to Matsusaka, Norinaga opened a medical practice for infants while devoting his spare time to lectures on &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and studies of the (&quot;Chronicles of Japan&quot;). At the age of 27, he bought several books by Kamo no Mabuchi and embarked on his researches. As a doctor, he reassumed his ancestral samurai surname of Motoori.

In 1763, Norinaga met Mabuchi in person when the latter visited Matsusaka, a meeting that has come down in history as &#x27;the night in Matsusaka&#x27;. Norinaga took the occasion to ask Mabuchi to supervise his annotations of the (&quot;Records of Ancient Matters&quot;). Mabuchi suggested that Norinaga should first tackle the annotations to the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; in order to accustom himself to the ancient kana usage known as the man&#x27;yōgana. This was the only meeting between the two men, but they continued to correspond and, with Mabuchi&#x27;s encouragement, Norinaga later went on to full-fledged research into the .

Norinaga&#x27;s disciples included Ishizuka Tatsumaro, Nagase Masaki, Natsume Mikamaro, Takahashi Mikiakira and Motoori Haruniwa (Norinaga&#x27;s son).

Although overshadowed by his activities as a scholar, Norinaga spent 40 years as a practicing doctor in Matsusaka and was seeing patients until ten days before his death in 1801.

==Works==
Norinaga&#x27;s most important works include the (&quot;Commentaries on the &quot;), made over a period of around 35 years, and his annotations on the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;. Using the methods of and &quot;kaozheng&quot;, Norinaga claimed that the was the oldest surviving Japanese text. He used the supposed antiquity of the to develop an idea of indigenous Japanese religion and laws which were later used in the development of an idea of State Shinto.

Norinaga took the view that the heritage of ancient Japan was one of natural spontaneity in feelings and spirit, and that imported Confucianism ran counter to such natural feelings. In his 1763 work Personal Views on Poetry (&quot;Isonokami Sasamegoto,&quot; 石上私淑言) Norinaga argued that Waka poetry, with its focus on these natural feelings cultivated a true and simple nature in the Japanese ‘heart’ - which he contrasted with the “artificially clever hearts” of Chinese poets. He criticized Ogyū Sorai for his over-valuing of Chinese civilization and thought, although it has been pointed out that his philological methodology was heavily influenced by Sorai&#x27;s. His ideas were influenced by the Chinese intellectual Wang Yangming, who had argued for &quot;innate knowing&quot;, that mankind had a naturally intuitive (as opposed to rational) ability to distinguish good and evil.

Hitherto Confucian scholars of ancient literature had shown a preference for the grandness and masculinity of &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; poetry and an aversion to works like the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;, which were regarded as unmanly and feminine. To Buddhist scholars the text represented a literary rendition of the Indian &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. Norinaga resurrected the position of the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;, which he regarded as an expression of the uniquely Japanese &quot;mono no aware&quot; (concept related to &quot;magokoro&quot; which Kamo no Mabuchi also spoke about)&quot;,&quot; a particular Japanese sensibility of &quot;sorrow at evanescence&quot; that Norinaga claimed forms the essence of Japanese literature. Each man, according to Motoori, has at his birth a &quot;true heart&quot; a &quot;magokoro&quot; (the term &quot;magokokoro&quot; is itself almost an onomatopoeia since &quot;kokoro&quot; (the heart) expresses these &quot;beats of the heart&quot;) whose ancient Japanese literature is the most faithful expression&quot;.&quot;

In undertaking his textual analysis of ancient Japanese, Norinaga also made vital contributions to establishing a native Japanese grammatical tradition, in particular the analysis of clitics, particles and auxiliary verbs. As part of this research, Norinaga would initially discover Lyman&#x27;s Law of &quot;rendaku,&quot; preceding the naming of which in honor of its later proponent, Benjamin Smith Lyman, by some 100 years.

==Motoori Norinaga Former Residence==

The former residence of Motoori Norinaga was constructed in 1691 as a retirement retreat by his grandfather, Ozu Sanshiemon Sadaharu. Originally located in the Uomachi neighborhood of Matsusaka, it was relocated to its present site within the grounds of Matsusaka Castle in 1909. Motoori Norinaga lived from age 12 to his death at age 72.

When Norinaga was 11 years old, his father, Ozu Sadatoshi Sanshiemon, died. His brother-in-law, Ozu Sogoro Sadaharu, took over the business, but the Ozu family&#x27;s luck gradually began to decline. The following year, Norinaga was forced to move to the retreat built by his grandfather, together with his mother, one of his younger brothers and two younger sisters. Norinaga then lived in this house until his death at the age of 72, except for seven years when he studied medicine in Kyoto when he was young.

After the death of his brother-in-law, Norinaga succeeded the Ozu family, but stopped doing business. He worked as a town doctor using this house as a clinic, while he worked on the study of Japanese classical literature, and wrote the &quot;Kojikiden,&quot; and other works. When Norinaga was 53 years old, he remodeled the storeroom on the second floor to create a new study. He hung a bell (&quot;suzu&quot;) on a pillar between the floors of his study and named this study &quot;Suzunoya&quot;. His descendants continued to live in this house until the Meiji period; however, as the new Meiji government gave increasing prominence to his works as the basis of State Shinto and studies, a movement arose to preserve the structure. In 1909, it was relocated to the grounds of Matsusaka Castle and effort has been made to preserve the interior as closely as possible to the time when it was used by Norinaga. In 1953, the structure and the site of Uomachi before the relocation were designated as a Special National Monument.

Portions of the building are open to the public as part of the . Motoori&#x27;s writing studio on the second floor contains some examples of original manuscripts. The museum houses many artifacts that are protected as Important Cultural Properties of Japan, of which only a small portion is on display at any time.

==Grave of Motoori Norinaga (Mount Yamamuro)==
After Motoori died, he was buried on the summit of Mount Yamamuro behind the temple of Myōraki-ji in Matsusaka. The grave was situated to overlook the town on Matsusaka, and the hills of Mikawa and Mount Fuji in the distance across Ise Bay and is inscribed with a poem from the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. The site was designated per detailed instructions left in his will, and Motoori had visited the site before his death to plant flowering mountain sakura trees and to design the layout of his tomb; however, the scenery around it has been drastically altered since that time with the construction of the Yamamuroyama Jinja Shinto shrine in 1875. Beside his tomb is a memorial cenotaph to his masters, Hirata Atsutane and Uematsu Arinobu. The tomb and its surroundings were designated a National Historic Site in 1936. The current grave was extensively renovated in 1999.

Motoori Norinaga has a second tomb at the Motoori clan cemetery in the temple of Jukyō-ji in downtown Matsusaka. This tomb, along with that of his son Motoori Harunaga, was collectively designated a separate National Historic Site in 1936.

<doc id="292154" wikidata="Q1658456" url="?curid=292154" title="Self-selection bias">
<text>In statistics, self-selection bias arises in any situation in which individuals select themselves into a group, causing a biased sample with nonprobability sampling. It is commonly used to describe situations where the characteristics of the people which cause them to select themselves in the group create abnormal or undesirable conditions in the group. It is closely related to the non-response bias, describing when the group of people responding has different responses than the group of people not responding.

Self-selection bias is a major problem in research in sociology, psychology, economics and many other social sciences. In such fields, a poll suffering from such bias is termed a self-selected listener opinion poll or &quot;SLOP&quot;.
The term is also used in criminology to describe the process by which specific predispositions may lead an offender to choose a criminal career and lifestyle.

While the effects of self-selection bias are closely related to those of selection bias, the problem arises for rather different reasons; thus there may be a purposeful intent on the part of respondents leading to self-selection bias whereas other types of selection bias may arise more inadvertently, possibly as the result of mistakes by those designing any given study.

==Explanation==
Self-selection makes determination of causation more difficult. For example, when attempting to assess the effect of a test preparation course in increasing participant&#x27;s test scores, significantly higher test scores might be observed among students who choose to participate in the preparation course itself. Due to self-selection, there may be a number of differences between the people who choose to take the course and those who choose not to, such as motivation, socioeconomic status, or prior test-taking experience. Due to self-selection according to such factors, a significant difference in mean test scores could be observed between the two populations independent of any ability of the course to affect test scores. An outcome might be that those who elect to do the preparation course would have achieved higher scores in the actual test anyway. If the study measures an improvement in absolute test scores due to participation in the preparation course, they may be skewed to show a higher effect. A relative measure of &#x27;improvement&#x27; might improve the reliability of the study somewhat, but only partially.

Self-selection bias causes problems for research about programs or products. In particular, self-selection affects evaluation of whether or not a given program has some effect, and complicates interpretation of market research.

The Roy model provides one of the earliest academic illustrations of the self-selection problem.

<doc id="292155" wikidata="Q21422559" url="?curid=292155" title="Korean conflict">
<text>The Korean conflict is an ongoing conflict based on the division of Korea between North Korea (Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea) and South Korea (Republic of Korea), both of which claim to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea. During the Cold War, North Korea was backed by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist allies, while South Korea was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other Western allies.

The division of Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union occurred in 1945 after the defeat of Japan ended Japanese rule of Korea, and both superpowers created separate governments in 1948. Tensions erupted into the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953. When the war ended, both countries were devastated, but the division remained. North and South Korea continued a military standoff, with periodic clashes. The conflict survived the end of the Cold War and is still ongoing. It is now considered one of the 10 frozen conflicts of the world and is considered one of the oldest, along with the Sino-Taiwanese conflict.

The U.S. maintains a military presence in the South to assist South Korea in accordance with the ROK–U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty. In 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton described the division of Korea as the &quot;Cold War&#x27;s last divide&quot;. In 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush described North Korea as a member of an &quot;axis of evil&quot;. Facing increasing isolation, North Korea developed missile and nuclear capabilities.

Following heightened tension throughout 2017, and some parts of 2018, 2018 saw North Korea, South Korea and the U.S. holding a series of summits, which promised peace and nuclear disarmament. This led to the Panmunjom Declaration on 27 April 2018, when the North and the South agreed to work together to denuclearize the peninsula, improve inter-Korean relations, end the conflict officially, and move towards the peaceful reunification. In subsequent years, diplomatic efforts faltered and military confrontation returned to the fore.

The Korean border remains the most militarized private area in the world with the presence of the Korean People&#x27;s Army in north; the Forces of the Republic of Korea and the United States Forces Korea (highlighted notably through the Combined Forces) in south and the presence of the forces of United Nations in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (JSA and Camp Bonifas).

==Background==
Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan on 22 August 1910, and ruled by it until 2 September 1945. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, nationalist and radical groups emerged, mostly in exile, to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to unite into a single national movement. Based in China, the Korean Provisional Government failed to obtain widespread recognition. The many leaders advocating for Korean independence included the conservative and U.S.-educated Syngman Rhee, who lobbied the U.S. government, and the Communist Kim Il Sung, who fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese from neighboring Manchuria.

Following the end of the occupation, many high-ranking Koreans were accused of collaborating with Japanese imperialism. An intense and bloody struggle between various figures and political groups aspiring to lead Korea ensued.

==Division of Korea (1945–1949)==


On 9 August 1945, as agreed by the Allies at the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and advanced into Korea. The U.S. government requested that the Soviet advance stop at the 38th parallel. The U.S. forces were to occupy the area south of the 38th parallel, including the capital, Seoul. This division of Korea into two zones of occupation was incorporated into General Order No. 1, which was given to Japanese forces after the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. On 24 August 1945, the Red Army entered Pyongyang and established a military government over Korea north of the parallel. American forces landed in the south on 8 September 1945, and established the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea.

The Allies had originally envisaged a joint trusteeship which would steer Korea towards independence, but most Korean nationalists wanted independence immediately. Meanwhile, the wartime co-operation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. deteriorated as the Cold War took hold. Both occupying powers began promoting into positions of authority Koreans aligned with their side of politics and marginalizing their opponents. Many of these emerging political leaders were returning exiles with little popular support. In North Korea, the Soviet Union supported Korean communists. Kim Il Sung, who from 1941 had served in the Soviet Army, became the major political figure. Society was centralized and collectivized, following the Soviet model. Politics in the South were more tumultuous, but the strongly anti-communist Syngman Rhee, who had been educated in the U.S., was positioned as the most prominent politician.

In South Korea, a general election was held on 10 May 1948. The Republic of Korea (or ROK) was established with Syngman Rhee as president, and formally replaced the U.S. military occupation on 15 August. In North Korea, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (or DPRK) was declared on 8 September, with Kim Il Sung, as prime minister. Soviet occupation forces left the DPRK on 10 December 1948. U.S. forces left the ROK the following year, though the U.S. Korean Military Advisory Group remained to train the Republic of Korea Army. The new regimes even adopted different names for Korea: the North choosing &quot;Choson&quot;, and the South &quot;Hanguk&quot;.

Both opposing governments considered themselves to be the government of the whole of Korean Peninsula (as they do to this day), and both saw the division as temporary. Kim Il Sung lobbied Stalin and Mao for support in a war of reunification, while Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North. In 1948, North Korea, which had almost all the generators, turned off the electricity supply to the South. In the lead-up to the outbreak of civil war, there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at Kaesong and Ongjin, initiated by both sides.

Throughout this period there were uprisings in the South, such as the Jeju Uprising and the Yeosu–Suncheon Rebellion, that were brutally suppressed. In all, over one hundred thousand people died in fighting across Korea before the Korean War began.

==Korean War (1950–1953)==

By 1950, North Korea had clear military superiority over the South. The Soviet occupiers had armed it with surplus weaponry and provided training. Many troops returning to North Korea were battle-hardened from their participation in the Chinese Civil War, which had just ended. Kim Il Sung expected a quick victory, predicting that there would be pro-communist uprisings in the South and that the U.S. would not intervene. Rather than perceiving the conflict as a civil war, however, the West saw it in Cold War terms as communist aggression, related to recent events in China and Eastern Europe.

North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. In September 1950 United Nations Command, led by the U.S., intervened to defend the South, and following the Incheon Landing and breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, rapidly advanced into North Korea. As the UN force neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea.

Korea was devastated. Around three million civilians and soldiers had been killed. Seoul was in ruins, having changed hands four times. Several million North Korean refugees fled to the South. Almost every substantial building in North Korea had been destroyed. As a result, North Koreans developed a deep-seated antagonism towards the U.S.

==Armistice (27 July 1953)==
Negotiations for an armistice began on 10 July 1951, as the war continued. The main issues were the establishment of a new demarcation line and the exchange of prisoners. After Stalin died, the Soviet Union brokered concessions which led to an agreement on 27 July 1953.

President Syngman Rhee opposed the armistice because it left Korea divided. As negotiations drew to a close, he attempted to sabotage the arrangements for the release of prisoners, and led mass rallies against the armistice. He refused to sign the agreement but reluctantly agreed to abide by it.

The armistice inaugurated an official ceasefire but did not lead to a peace treaty for two Koreas. It established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a buffer zone between the two sides, that intersected the 38th parallel but did not follow it. Despite its name, the border was, and continues to be, one of the most militarized in the world.

North Korea announced that it would no longer abide by the armistice at least six times, in the years 1994, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2013.

==Cold War period (1953–1991)==
After the war, the Chinese forces left, but U.S. forces remained in the South. Sporadic conflict continued. The North&#x27;s occupation of the South left behind a guerrilla movement that persisted in the Cholla provinces. On 1 October 1953, the United States and South Korea signed a defense treaty. In 1958, the United States stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea. In 1961, North Korea signed mutual defense treaties with the USSR and China. In the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty, China pledged to render immediate military and other assistance by all means to North Korea against any outside attack. During this period, North Korea was described by former CIA director Robert Gates to be the &quot;toughest intelligence target in the world&quot;. Alongside the military confrontation, there was a propaganda war, including balloon propaganda campaigns.

The opposing regimes aligned themselves with opposing sides in the Cold War. Both sides received recognition as the legitimate government of Korea from the opposing blocs. South Korea became a strongly anti-Communist military dictatorship. North Korea presented itself as a champion of orthodox Communism, distinct from the Soviet Union and China. The regime developed the doctrine of Juche or self-reliance, which included extreme military mobilization. In response to the threat of nuclear war, it constructed extensive facilities underground and in the mountains. The Pyongyang Metro opened in the 1970s, with the capacity to double as bomb shelter. Until the early 1970s, North Korea was an economic equal of the South.

South Korea was heavily involved in the Vietnam War. Hundreds of North Korean fighter pilots went to Vietnam, shooting down 26 U.S. aircraft. Teams of North Korean psychological warfare specialists targeted South Korean troops, and Vietnamese guerrillas were trained in the North.
Tensions between North and South escalated in the late 1960s with a series of low-level armed clashes known as the Korean DMZ Conflict. In 1966, Kim declared &quot;liberation of the south&quot; to be a &quot;national duty&quot;. In 1968, North Korean commandos launched the Blue House raid, an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the South Korean President Park Chung Hee. Shortly after, the American spy ship USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; was captured by the North Korean navy. The Americans saw the crisis in terms of the global confrontation with Communism, but, rather than orchestrating the incident, the Soviet government was concerned by it. The crisis was initiated by Kim, inspired by Communist successes in the Vietnam War.

In 1967, Korean-born composer Isang Yun was kidnapped in West Germany by South Korean agents and imprisoned in South Korea on the charge of spying for the North. He was released after an international outcry.

In 1969, North Korea shot down a U.S. EC-121 spy plane over the Sea of Japan, killing all 31 crew on board, which constituted the largest single loss of U.S. aircrew during the Cold War. In 1969, Korean Air Lines YS-11 was hijacked and flown to North Korea. Similarly, in 1970, the hijackers of Japan Airlines Flight 351 were given asylum in North Korea. In response to the Blue House raid, the South Korean government set up a special unit to assassinate Kim Il Sung, but the mission was aborted in 1972.
In the 1970s, South Korea pursued its own nuclear weapons, but was discouraged by the US.

In 1974, a North Korean sympathizer attempted to assassinate President Park and killed his wife, Yuk Young-soo. In 1976, the Panmunjeom Axe incident led to the death of two U.S. Army officers in the DMZ and threatened to trigger a wider war. In the 1970s, North Korea kidnapped a number of Japanese citizens.

In 1976, in now-declassified minutes, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements told Henry Kissinger that there had been 200 raids or incursions into North Korea from the South, though not by the U.S. military. According to South Korean politicians who have campaigned for compensation for the survivors, more than 7,700 secret agents infiltrated North Korea from 1953 to 1972, of which about 5,300 are believed not to have returned. Details of only a few of these incursions have become public, including raids by South Korean forces in 1967 that had sabotaged about 50 North Korean facilities. Other missions included targeting advisers from China and the Soviet Union in order to undermine relations between North Korea and its allies.

The East German leader, Erich Honecker, who visited in 1977, was one of Kim Il Sung&#x27;s closest foreign friends. In 1986, East Germany and North Korea signed an agreement on military co-operation. Kim was also close to maverick Communist leaders, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, and Nicolae Ceaușescu of Romania. Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi met with Kim Il Sung and was a close ally of the DPRK. North Korea began to play a part in the global radical movement, forging ties with such diverse groups as the Black Panther Party of the U.S., the Workers&#x27; Party of Ireland, and the African National Congress. As it increasingly emphasized its independence, North Korea began to promote the doctrine of &quot;Juche&quot; as an alternative to orthodox Marxism-Leninism and as a model for developing countries to follow.

When North-South dialogue started in 1972, North Korea began to receive diplomatic recognition from countries outside the Communist bloc. Within four years, North Korea was recognized by 93 countries, on par with South Korea&#x27;s recognition by 96 countries. North Korea gained entry into the World Health Organization and, as a result, sent its first permanent observer missions to the UN. In 1975, it joined the Non-Aligned Movement.

During the 1970s, both North and South began building up their military capacity. It was discovered that North Korea had dug tunnels under the DMZ which could accommodate thousands of troops. Alarmed at the prospect of U.S. disengagement, South Korea began a secret nuclear weapons program which was strongly opposed by Washington.

In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter proposed the withdrawal of troops from South Korea. There was a widespread backlash in America and in South Korea, and critics argued that this would allow the North to capture Seoul. Carter postponed the move, and his successor Ronald Reagan reversed the policy, increasing troop numbers to forty-three thousand. After Reagan supplied the South with F-16 fighters, and after Kim Il Sung visited Moscow in 1984, the USSR recommenced military aid and co-operation with the North.

Unrest in South Korea came to a head with the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. The dictatorship equated dissent with North Korean subversion. On the other hand, some young protesters viewed the U.S. as complicit in political repression and identified with the North&#x27;s nationalist propaganda.

In 1983, North Korea carried out the Rangoon bombing, a failed assassination attempt against South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan while he was visiting Burma. The bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 in 1987, in the lead-up to the Seoul Olympics, led to the U.S. government placing North Korea on its list of terrorist countries. North Korea launched a boycott of the Games, supported by Cuba, Ethiopia, Albania and the Seychelles.

In 1986, former South Korean foreign minister Choe Deok-sin defected to North Korea, becoming a leader of the Chondoist Chongu Party.

In the 1980s, the South Korean government built a -tall flagpole in the village of Daeseong-dong in the DMZ. In response, North Korea built a -tall flagpole in the nearby village of Kijŏng-dong.

==Isolation and confrontation (1991–2017)==
As the Cold War ended, North Korea lost the support of the Soviet Union and plunged into an economic crisis. With the death of leader Kim Il Sung in 1994, there were expectations that the North Korean government could collapse and the peninsula would be reunified. US nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea.

In 1994, suspecting that North Korea was developing nuclear weapons, U.S. President Bill Clinton considered bombing North Korea&#x27;s Yongbyon nuclear reactor, but he later dismissed this option when he was advised that if war broke out, it could cost 52,000 U.S. and 490,000 South Korean military casualties in the first three months, as well as a large number of civilian casualties. Instead, in 1994, the U.S. and North Korea signed an Agreed Framework, which aimed to freeze North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program. In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung initiated the Sunshine Policy, which aimed to foster better relations with the North. However, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush denounced the policy, and in 2002 branded North Korea a member of an &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;. Six-party talks involving North and South Korea, the United States, Russia, Japan, and China commenced in 2003 but failed to achieve a resolution. In 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. The Sunshine Policy was formally abandoned by South Korean President Lee Myung-bak after his election in 2007.

In the start of the 21st century, it was estimated that the concentration of firepower in the area between Pyongyang and Seoul was greater than that in central Europe during the Cold War. The North&#x27;s Korean People&#x27;s Army was numerically twice the size of South Korea&#x27;s military and had the capacity to devastate Seoul with artillery and missile bombardment. South Korea&#x27;s military, however, was assessed as being technically superior in many ways. U.S. forces remained in South Korea and carried out annual military exercises with South Korean forces, including Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, and Ulchi-Freedom Guardian. These were routinely denounced by North Korea as acts of aggression. Between 1997 and 2016, the North Korea government accused other governments of declaring war against it 200 times. Analysts have described the U.S. garrison as a tripwire ensuring American military involvement, but some have queried whether sufficient reinforcements would be forthcoming.

During this period, two North Korean submarines were captured after being stranded on the South Korean coast, one near Gangneung in 1996 and one near Sokcho in 1998. In December 1998, the South Korean navy sank a North Korean semi-submersible in the Battle of Yeosu. In 2001, the Japanese Coast Guard sank a North Korean spy ship in the Battle of Amami-Ōshima.

In 1996 South Korean academic Jeong Su-il was unmasked as a North Korea spy. South Korea ceased sending &quot;North Korea Demolition Agents&quot; to raid the North in the early 2000s. 
Conflict intensified near the disputed maritime boundary known as the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea. In 1999 and 2002, there were clashes between the navies of North and South Korea, known as the First and Second battle of Yeonpyeong. On 26 March 2010, a South Korean naval vessel, the ROKS Cheonan, sank, near Baengnyeongdo in the Yellow Sea and a North Korean torpedo was blamed. On 23 November 2010, in response to a joint military exercise, North Korea fired artillery at South Korea&#x27;s Greater Yeonpyeongdo in the Yellow Sea, and South Korea returned fire.

In 2013, amidst tensions about its missile program, North Korea forced the temporary shutdown of the jointly operated Kaesong Industrial Region. The zone was shut again in 2016. A South Korean parliamentarian was convicted of plotting a campaign of sabotage to support the North in 2013 and jailed for 12 years. In 2014, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the intensification of cyber and electronic warfare to disrupt North Korea&#x27;s missile testing, but this account has been disputed by analysts from the Nautilus Institute.

In 2016, in the face of protests, South Korea decided to deploy the U.S. THAAD anti-missile system in response to nuclear and missile threats by North Korea. After North Korea&#x27;s fifth nuclear test in September 2016, it was reported that South Korea had developed a plan to raze Pyongyang if there were signs of an impending nuclear attack from the North. A North Korean numbers station started broadcasting again, after a break of 16 years, apparently sending coded messages to agents in the South. As South Korea was convulsed by scandal, North Korea enthusiastically supported the removal of President Park Geun-hye, intensifying leaflet drops. In turn, Park&#x27;s supporters accused the opposition Liberty Korea Party of basing its logo on Pyongyang&#x27;s Juche Tower.

In March 2017, it was reported that the South Korean government had increased the rewards to North Korean defectors who brought classified information or military equipment with them. It was also reported that, in 2016, North Korea hackers had stolen classified South Korean military data, including a plan for the killing of Kim Jong Un. According to cybersecurity experts, North Korea maintained an army of hackers trained to disrupt enemy computer networks and steal both money and sensitive data. In the previous decade, it was blamed for numerous cyber-attacks and other hacking attacks in South Korea and elsewhere, including the hack of Sony Pictures supposedly in retaliation for the release of the 2014 film &quot;The Interview&quot;, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong Un.

==Tension and détente (2017–2021)==

The year 2017 saw a period of heightened tension between the U.S. and North Korea. Early in the year, the incoming U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the policy of &quot;strategic patience&quot; associated with the preceding Obama administration. Later in the year, Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy. On 4 July 2017, North Korea successfully conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), named Hwasong-14. It conducted another test on 28 July. On 5 August 2017, the UN imposed further sanctions which were met with defiance from the North Korean government.
Following the sanctions, Trump warned that North Korean nuclear threats &quot;will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before&quot;. In response, North Korea announced that it was considering a missile test in which the missiles would land near the U.S. territory of Guam. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on 3 September. The test was met with international condemnation and resulted in further economic sanctions being taken against North Korea. On 28 November, North Korea launched a further missile, which, according to analysts, would be capable of reaching anywhere in the United States. The test resulted in the United Nations placing further sanctions on the country.

In January 2018, the Vancouver Foreign Ministers&#x27; Meeting on Security and Stability on Korean Peninsula was co-hosted by Canada and the U.S., regarding ways to increase the effectiveness of the sanctions on North Korea. The co-chairs (Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson) issued a summary that emphasized the urgency of persuading North Korea to denuclearize and emphasizing the need for sanctions to create conditions for a diplomatic solution.

When Kim Jong Un proposed participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea in his New Year&#x27;s address, the Seoul–Pyongyang hotline was reopened after almost two years. In February, North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation to the Games, headed by Kim Yo Jong, sister of Kim Jong Un, and President Kim Yong-nam, which passed on an invitation to President Moon to visit the North. Kim Jong Un and Moon met at the Joint Security Area on 27 April, where they announced that their governments would work toward a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and formalize peace between North and South Korea. On 12 June, Kim met with Donald Trump at a summit in Singapore and signed a declaration, affirming the same commitment. Trump announced that he would halt military exercises with South Korea and foreshadowed withdrawing American troops entirely.

In September 2018, at a summit with Moon in Pyongyang, Kim agreed to dismantle North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons facilities if the United States took reciprocal action. The two governments also announced that they would establish buffer zones on their borders to prevent clashes. On 1 November, buffer zones were established across the DMZ to help ensure the end of hostility on land, sea and air. The buffer zones stretched from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea. In addition, no fly zones were established along the DMZ.

In February 2019 in Hanoi, a second summit between Kim and Trump broke down without an agreement. On 30 June 2019, President Trump met with Kim Jong Un along with Moon Jae-in at the DMZ, making him the first sitting U.S. president to enter North Korea. Talks in Stockholm began on 5 October 2019, between U.S. and North Korean negotiating teams, but broke down after one day. On 16 June 2020, at approximately 2:49 p.m., the North Korean regime of Kim Jong Un blew up the North-South Joint Liaison Office in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. In late 2021, President Moon, nearing the end of his five-year term, convened a forum, &quot;Declaration of the End of the War: The Limitations and Prospects&quot; continuing to seek a diplomatic breakthrough; but this was opposed by some speakers, including representatives of the People Power Party.

==The end of détente (2021–present)==

On 9 September 2022, North Korea passed a law to declare itself a nuclear weapons state. In November 2022, a U.S.-South Korean air force exercise called Vigilant Storm was countered by missile tests and an air force exercise by North Korea. In December 2022, five North Korean drones entered South Korean airspace, eluding South Korean defences, one entering the no-fly zone around the Blue House. In late 2022, the South Korean National Intelligence Service began a series of raids targeting alleged North Korean spy-cells.

As of 2023, North Korean publications remained censored in South Korea. Meanwhile, North Korea campaigned against foreign culture, while the US government sponsored the flow of outside information into North Korea.

On 5 January 2024, North Korea fired 200 shells towards Yeonpyeongdo.

On 10 January 2024, during a speech to the Central Committee of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, Kim called for a &quot;fundamental turnabout&quot; in North Korea&#x27;s stance towards South Korea, calling the South the &quot;enemy&quot;. He stated &quot;the party&#x27;s comprehensive conclusion after reviewing decades-long inter-Korean relations is that reunification can never be achieved with those ROK riffraffs that defined the &#x27;unification by absorption&#x27; and &#x27;unification under liberal democracy&#x27; as their state policy&quot;, which he said is in &quot;sharp contradiction with what our line of national reunification was: one nation, one state with two systems&quot;.

Kim cited South Korean constitution&#x27;s claims over the entire Korean Peninsula and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol&#x27;s policy towards the north as evidence that South Korea is an unsuitable partner for reunification. He said the relations between the two Koreas currently were &quot;states hostile to each other and the relations between two belligerent states&quot; and no longer ones that are &quot;consanguineous or homogeneous&quot;, continuing by saying it is &quot;unsuitable&quot; to discuss the issue of reunification &quot;with this strange clan [South Korea], who is no more than a colonial stooge of the U.S. despite the rhetorical word [we used to use] — &#x27;the fellow countrymen&#x27;&quot;.

Kim further confirmed a shift in policy in January 2024, when he gave a speech to the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly (SPA) calling for the constitution to be amended to remove references to cooperation and reunification, as well as specify DPRK&#x27;s territorial borders and add an article specifying the ROK as the most hostile country. He also rejected the maritime Northern Limit Line, saying that &quot;If the Republic of Korea invades our ground territory, territorial air space, or territorial waters by even 0.001 mm, it will be considered a provocation of war&quot;. The SPA also voted on the abolition of three inter-Korean cooperation organizations; the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the Korean People&#x27;s Cooperation Administration, and the Kumgangsan International Tourism Administration.
One of the symbols of this was the destruction of the Arch of Reunification in Pyongyang on 23 January 2024. Kim Jong Un said at the 10th session of the 14th Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea: &quot;We should also take steps such as the demolition of the &quot;Monument to the Three Charters of National Reunification&quot; which stands unceremoniously at the southern entrance to the capital, Pyongyang, in order to completely eliminate the very concepts of &quot;reunification&quot;, &quot;reconciliation&quot; and &quot;fratricidal&quot; national history of the DPRK.&quot; On 19 February 2024, North Korea has erased an image of the Korean Peninsula, viewed as a unification reference, from its major websites.

On 1 March 2024, the government of President Yoon Suk Yeol plans to develop a new vision of unification with North Korea to include the principle of liberal democracy. South Korea plans to update its vision of unification for the first time in 30 years. This is the first revision of the Unification Formula of the national community, South Korea&#x27;s unification policy unveiled in August 1994 under the administration of late President Kim Young-sam.

On 4 June 2024, South Korea&#x27;s State Council suspended the 2018 Panmunjom Declaration due to border tensions over balloons carrying trash sent by North Korea. On 9 June 2024, South Korea announced the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korean propaganda after the balloons were sent. Seoul&#x27;s military detected around 330 balloons since 8 June 2024, with about 80 found in South Korean territory. The president&#x27;s office stated that the broadcasts aimed to deliver messages of hope to the North Korean military and citizens. This response followed weeks of activists in the South launching balloons carrying K-pop, dollar bills, and anti-Kim Jong Un propaganda, which had infuriated Pyongyang. The loudspeaker broadcasts resumed after South Korea suspended the 2018 agreement, allowing for propaganda campaigns and potential military exercises near the border

North Korea claims 1.4 million have enlisted after accusing South Korea of drone incursions. In response, Seoul is restricting leaflet activities near the border to prevent further escalation.

North Korea&#x27;s revised constitution now defines South Korea as a &quot;hostile state,&quot; ending its pursuit of peaceful reunification and increasing military fortifications along the border. At the same time, North Korea blew up road and rail links with South Korea in certain areas between the Korean borders.

As part of the North Korean-Russian agreement, North Korea also sent separate army units to the Ukraine-Russia border. In October 2024, intelligence services from Ukraine, South Korea, and the United States began reporting the dispatch of several thousand North Korean troops to Russia. Moscow and Pyongyang initially denied this information, but at the BRICS summit, Vladimir Putin acknowledged the presence of North Koreans for the first time, without specifying the purpose of their arrival.

On 3 December 2024, President Yoon declared martial law in South Korea. He justified this by accusing members of the Korean Parliament of being pro-North Korea; however, Yoon lifted martial law after the National Assembly passed an emergency motion nullifying the declaration several hours after Yoon&#x27;s speech.

<text>Jacques Parizeau (; August 9, 1930June 1, 2015) was a Canadian politician and economist who served as the 26th premier of Quebec from September 26, 1994, to January 29, 1996.

==Early life and career==
Parizeau was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Germaine ( Biron) and Gérard Parizeau, from a family of wealth. Gérard Parizeau built one of Quebec’s great fortunes and one of the province’s largest financial firms from a brokerage he established in the 1930s. Jacques&#x27; great-grandfather was a founder of the Montreal &quot;Chambre de Commerce&quot; and his grandfather was a doctor of renown and a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the &quot;Légion d’honneur.&quot;

As a teenager, Parizeau had radical views and distributed leaflets for Communist Fred Rose&#x27;s election campaigns. While sympathetic to the Labor-Progressive Party he never joined.

His parents supported bilingualism and sent him to English summer camp. He attended Collège Stanislas, a Roman Catholic private school. He went on to graduate with a PhD from the London School of Economics in London, England, as well as degrees at HEC Montréal, Paris Institute of Political Studies and Faculté de droit de Paris. Because of a prior commitment to return to instruct at HEC, he left England, where career opportunities were offered in British academia. He served an internship with the Bank of Canada in Ottawa, and directed his brightest students to Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario for postgraduate studies.

Parizeau&#x27;s predilection for three-piece, Savile Row suits, and proper manner of speaking French and English, earned him the nickname &quot;Monsieur&quot;.

A firm believer in economic interventionism, he was one of the most important advisors to the provincial government during the 1960s, playing an important behind-the-scenes role in the Quiet Revolution. He was especially instrumental in the nationalization of Hydro-Québec (a hydro-electric utility) in 1962-1963, the nationalization of the Asbestos Corporation Limited mines in 1982, and worked with Eric Kierans to create the Quebec Pension Plan in 1963-1966.

He joked that the Quiet Revolution was essentially carried out by three or four cabinet ministers, two dozen civil servants and 50 chansonniers. (At the end of his career, he said that he would like to be remembered most for his contributions to the reformation of Quebec.)

Parizeau gradually became a committed sovereigntist, and officially joined the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; (PQ) on September 19, 1969. In 1970, he became the president of the PQ’s executive council until 1973. He ran for office in the Montreal districts of Ahuntsic in 1970 and Crémazie in 1973, but lost in both.

After the PQ was elected to office in the 1976 provincial election, which saw Parizeau elected in the district of L&#x27;Assomption, the new premier, René Lévesque, appointed him as Minister of Finance. Parizeau played an important role in the 1980 Quebec referendum campaign in favour of the government&#x27;s proposals for sovereignty-association.

As Minister of Finance in Quebec, he was responsible for a number of innovative economic proposals, including the Quebec Stock Savings Plan (&quot;QSSP&quot;) and the Fonds de solidarité (Solidarity Fund) FTQ in 1983. As of May 2020, the latter&#x27;s net assets were $13.8 billion.

Married to Polish immigrant Alice Poznanska (1930–1990). Jacques Parizeau was criticized for supporting the Charter of the French Language. This law limits access to English-language public schools to children whose parents didn&#x27;t receive their education in English in Canada, and was generally opposed by the English-speaking minority.

In 1984, he had a falling out with Lévesque. Lévesque had moved away from pursuing sovereignty to accept a negotiation with the Federal Government, called &quot;Beau Risque&quot;. Parizeau opposed this shift, resigned from Cabinet along with many other members, and temporarily retired from politics. Lévesque was taken by surprise with all these retirements and retired soon after. He was replaced by Pierre-Marc Johnson.

In 1987, Johnson also left the PQ leadership after losing the 1985 election. Parizeau, still a widely liked figure, was elected to replace him as party leader on March 19, 1988.

It was revealed in 2013 that federal Prime Minister Brian Mulroney offered in 1987 to appoint Parizeau as an independent Senator in his attempt to secure passage of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement through the upper house as well as part of his strategy to achieve reconciliation with Quebec sovereigntists which led to the Meech Lake Accord. Parizeau rejected the offer and went on to become PQ leader and premier.

==Elections, 1995 referendum and aftermath==
In the 1989 election, Parizeau&#x27;s first as PQ leader, his party did not fare well. But five years later, in the 1994 election, it won a majority government. Parizeau promised to hold a referendum on Quebec sovereignty within a year of his election, and despite many objections, he followed through on this promise. In the beginning, support for sovereignty was only about 40% in the public opinion polls. As the campaign wore on, however, support for the &quot;Yes&quot; side grew larger. This growth halted, however, and Parizeau came under pressure to hand more of the campaign over to the more moderate and conservative Lucien Bouchard, the popular leader of the federal &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot; party. Parizeau agreed and as the campaign progressed he lost his leadership role to Bouchard.

During the 1995 referendum he caused an uproar when it was reported by columnist Chantal Hébert in the &quot;La Presse&quot; newspaper that despite the guarantee of an offer of partnership with the rest of Canada before declaring sovereignty following a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, Parizeau had told a group of foreign diplomats that what mattered most was to get a majority vote from Quebec citizens for the proposal to secede from Canada because with that, Quebecers would be in a &quot;lobster pot,&quot; evidently indicating that like lobsters in a lobster trap, Quebecers would not be able to escape the consequences of a vote for independence once it was cast. The &quot;Yes&quot; side would lose the referendum by 55,000 votes. In his concession speech, Parizeau said sovereignty had been defeated by &quot;l&#x27;argent pis des votes ethniques&quot; (&quot;money and ethnic votes&quot;), and referred to the Francophones who voted Yes in the referendum as &quot;nous&quot; (us) when he said that this majority group was, for the first time, no longer afraid of political independence.

Many suspected he may have been drinking. He resigned as PQ leader and Quebec premier the next day. The English-language media, as well as non-sovereigntist newspapers such as &quot;La Presse&quot; and &quot;Le Soleil&quot;, associated Parizeau&#x27;s resignation only with these remarks, against which the sovereigntist-friendly media (notably the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot;) argued that he had made the decision beforehand, drawing attention to a television interview conducted on the eve of the vote with the Groupe TVA channel in which Parizeau spoke of his intentions to step down in the event of defeat. (This interview had previously been held under &quot;embargo&quot;, which is to say that the station agreed not to broadcast it until the referendum was over.)

Parizeau was replaced by Lucien Bouchard as PQ leader and Quebec premier on January 29, 1996.

Parizeau retired to private life, but continued to make comments critical of Bouchard&#x27;s new government and its failure to press the cause of Quebec independence. He owned an estate at his vineyard in France, a farm in the Eastern Townships of Quebec and a home in Montreal. His biographer is Pierre Duchesne.

In 2005 he spoke of the 1995 referendum in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary &quot;Breaking Point&quot;.

His wife and former secretary during his premiership, Lisette Lapointe won a seat in the National Assembly as a candidate for the PQ in the provincial riding of Crémazie in the 2007 Quebec general election.

In June 2008, along with the other four living former Premiers of Quebec, Parizeau was named a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec by Premier Jean Charest.
At a 2013 meeting of &quot;Option nationale&quot;, Parizeau stated to the room that the target of sovereignty for Quebec is still realizable, and that the PQ should make the maximum effort to attain it, including using public funds.

In October 2013, to the surprise of many Quebecers, Parizeau nuanced his earlier infamous &quot;money and ethnic votes&quot; statement to come out against the wholesale adoption of the Quebec Charter of Values, which would have banned most religious symbols and clothing in the public sector (but not the crucifix over the National Assembly President&#x27;s chair). &quot;Federalism is turning into true defenders of minorities in Quebec,&quot; he said to Radio-Canada at the time. &quot;We can&#x27;t put ourselves in a situation like that.&quot; By &quot;we&quot;, he meant the Franco-Quebecois, the majority in Quebec, and who had voted in the majority for sovereignty.

In an interview with 98.5 FM Montreal, Jacques Parizeau clarified the controversial comments he made in a 1995 speech following the sovereignty referendum&#x27;s yes-side loss. He said that when he laid blame for the loss, he said &quot;ethnic votes&quot; and not the ethnic vote, and was referring to a coalition of Greek, Italian, and Jewish organizations which actively campaigned on the &quot;no&quot; side.

Parizeau let his PQ membership lapse and supported the fledgling party Option nationale and its youthful leader Jean-Martin Aussant. After Pierre Karl Péladeau entered provincial politics, Parizeau publicly decried the state of the PQ. In September 2014, after the party&#x27;s defeat in the general election, he stated that it faced &quot;a field of ruin.&quot; During the PQ leadership campaign of 2015, Parizeau told Radio-Canada in his last televised interview that &quot;the party was gradually demolished and it has lost its soul.&quot;

==Elections as party leader==
He lost the 1989 election, and won the 1994 election. He announced his resignation the day after the &quot;Yes&quot; side in the 1995 Quebec referendum was defeated.

==Death==
In a social media posting, Parizeau&#x27;s wife announced his death after five months of hospitalization, on June 1, 2015. He was 84. On her Facebook page, Lapointe wrote:
His state funeral mass was held at Saint-Germain d’Outremont Roman Catholic church, the Parizeau family parish.

<doc id="292161" wikidata="Q666016" url="?curid=292161" title="Radar Scope">
<text>is a 1980 shoot &#x27;em up arcade game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D2 and published by Nintendo. The player assumes the role of the Sonic Spaceport starship and must wipe out formations of an enemy race known as the Gamma Raiders before they destroy the player&#x27;s space station. Gameplay is similar to &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;, but viewed from a three-dimensional third-person perspective.

&quot;Radar Scope&quot; was a commercial failure and created a financial crisis for the subsidiary Nintendo of America. Its president, Minoru Arakawa, pleaded for his father-in-law, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, to send him a new game that could convert and salvage thousands of unsold &quot;Radar Scope&quot; machines. This prompted the creation of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. &quot;Radar Scope&quot; is one of the first video game projects for artist Shigeru Miyamoto and for composer Hirokazu Tanaka.

Retrospectively, critics have praised &quot;Radar Scope&quot; for its gameplay and design being a unique iteration upon the &quot;Space Invaders&quot; template. One critic labeled it one of Nintendo&#x27;s most important games because its commercial failure inadvertently led to the creation of Nintendo&#x27;s mascot character and helped pave the way for the company&#x27;s entry into the console video game market.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Radar Scope&quot; is a shoot &#x27;em up in a three-dimensional third-person perspective over a gradient-blue background, often described as a cross between &quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The player pilots the Sonic Spaceport starship and must defend the space station against enemies called the Gamma Raiders. Gameplay involves clearing each stage of the Gamma Raiders without colliding with them or their projectiles. Each stage sets 48 Gamma Raiders in a formation, who break away and swoop down toward the player. Some will simply swoop down and fire at the player, and others will try to ram into the space station. The Sonic Spaceport has a damage meter at the bottom of the screen, which depletes with enemy fire. The player can lose a life by either allowing this meter to deplete or by colliding with a Gamma Raider or their projectile. Three types of arcade cabinets were produced: a standard upright, a tabletop version, and a rare sit-down cabinet.

==Development and release==

In the late 1970s, Nintendo Co., Ltd. began shifting its focus away from toys and playing cards into the arcade market. This followed the 1973 oil crisis having increased the cost of manufacturing toys, and the widespread success of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in 1978. Nintendo had briefly experimented with electro-mechanical arcade gun games such as &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; and the &quot;Laser Clay Shooting System&quot;, followed by arcade video games such as &quot;EVR-Race&quot;, &quot;Sheriff&quot;, &quot;Space Fever&quot;, and the Color TV-Game line of dedicated home consoles.

&quot;Radar Scope&quot; was created by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2 (R&amp;D2). Masayuki Uemura led the development of the game, while Hirokazu Tanaka programmed the audio and composed the music. Shigeru Miyamoto assisted in the game&#x27;s art production as one of his first video game projects; however, his role in development is often debated, with some claiming he designed the onscreen graphics, and others saying he simply created the arcade cabinet artwork. David Scheff&#x27;s book &quot;Game Over&quot; claims that Miyamoto found the game &quot;simplistic and banal&quot; after it was completed.

The arcade hardware for &quot;Radar Scope&quot; was co-developed with Ikegami Tsushinki. It is based on Namco&#x27;s &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979), with technology such as high-speed emitter-coupled logic (ECL) integrated circuit (IC) chips and memory on a 50 MHz printed circuit board. &quot;Galaxian&quot;, in turn, was based on &quot;Space Invaders&quot; hardware, replacing the more intensive bitmap rendering system with a hardware sprite rendering system that animates sprites over a scrolling background, allowing more detailed graphics, faster gameplay, and a scrolling animated starfield background.

&quot;Radar Scope&quot; was released in Japan on October 8, 1980. That year, Minoru Arakawa established the subsidiary Nintendo of America in New York City. Based on favorable tests at arcades in Seattle, he wagered most of the company&#x27;s modest corporate budget on ordering 3,000 &quot;Radar Scope&quot; units from Nintendo Co., Ltd. Shipping the units into New York by boat took four months, by which time the market lost interest. A total of 1,000 &quot;Radar Scope&quot; units were sold to an underwhelming reception, and the remaining 2,000 sat in Nintendo&#x27;s warehouse. This expensive failure put Nintendo of America into a financial crisis.

Arakawa moved the distressed startup to the Seattle area to cut shipping time. He asked his father in-law and Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi to develop a new game that could be retrofitted into the unsold &quot;Radar Scope&quot; cabinets. Yamauchi polled the company&#x27;s entire talent pool for fresh game design concepts that could satisfy Nintendo of America&#x27;s needs. The result was Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s debut as lead game designer with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, starring Mario and released in 1981. The &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; conversion kits consisting of ROM chips and cabinet marquee graphics were shipped to Nintendo of America and installed on more than 2,000 &quot;Radar Scope&quot; machines by a small team including Arakawa and his wife.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Radar Scope&quot; was a commercial failure for Nintendo upon release. Out of an estimated 3,000 arcade cabinets shipped to the United States alone, 1,000 were sold to an underwhelming reception and the remaining 2,000 sat unsold in Nintendo&#x27;s warehouse. The salvage of unsold &quot;Radar Scope&quot; hardwareby creating &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and Marioprovided the company with its first international smash hit and a resulting windfall of . This rescued Nintendo of America from financial crisis, established Nintendo as a prominent brand in America, and helped fund its launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

In a 1998 retrospective review, Earl Green of &quot;Allgame&quot; said the 3D perspective is a unique idea for the time, and that &quot;Radar Scope&quot; improved the trend of countless games styled after the archetypal &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. &quot;Shack News&quot; writer Greg Burke liked the game&#x27;s colorful visuals and interesting gameplay which differentiate it from games like &quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; criticized the lack of &quot;tight design&quot; as found in &quot;Galaxian&quot;, and for its blaring and annoying sound effects. They said the third-person perspective is a unique innovation, imitated years later by games such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Juno First&quot; and Activision&#x27;s &quot;Beamrider&quot;.

In 2014, Jeremy Parish of &quot;USGamer&quot; said that &quot;Radar Scope&quot; &quot;belonged to the better class of [&quot;Space Invaders&quot;] rip-offs&quot;. He greatly applauded the 3D perspective for providing a unique sense of progression and depth. He was disappointed that the game is poorly recognized over the decades due to its rough history and scarcity, writing: &quot;Sadly, &quot;Radar Scope&quot; tends to be brushed under the rug as a matter of no real significance: A failed game whose only positive contribution to gaming history was providing an opportunity for something better to come along. In truth, though, &quot;Radar Scope&quot; wasn&#x27;t a poor game by any measure; its crimes were instead a simple matter of timing, and of being the focus of Nintendo&#x27;s ill-conceived ambitions.&quot; He said that &quot;Radar Scope&quot; created a &quot;lever&quot; that allowed Nintendo to successfully propel themselves into the console market.

<doc id="292169" wikidata="Q334010" url="?curid=292169" title="Richard Borcherds">
<text>Richard Ewen Borcherds (; born 29 November 1959) is a British mathematician currently working in quantum field theory. He is known for his work in lattices, group theory, and infinite-dimensional algebras, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998. He is well known for his proof of monstrous moonshine using ideas from string theory.

== Early life ==
Borcherds was born in Cape Town, South Africa, but the family moved to Birmingham in the United Kingdom when he was six months old.

== Education ==
Borcherds was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied under John Horton Conway.

== Career ==
After receiving his doctorate in 1985, Borcherds has held various alternating positions at Cambridge and the University of California, Berkeley, serving as Morrey Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Berkeley from 1987 to 1988. He was a Royal Society University Research Fellow. From 1996 he held a Royal Society Research Professorship at Cambridge before returning to Berkeley in 1999 as Professor of Mathematics. 

An interview with Simon Singh for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in which Borcherds suggested he might have some sort of traits possibly associated with Asperger syndrome, led to a chapter about him in a book on autism by Simon Baron-Cohen. Baron-Cohen insinuated that while Borcherds may have had autistic traits, he did not meet a formal diagnosis of Asperger&#x27;s syndrome.

== Awards and honours ==
In 1992 Borcherds was one of the first recipients of the EMS prizes awarded at the first European Congress of Mathematics in Paris, and in 1994 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich. In 1994, he was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1998 at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin, Germany he received the Fields Medal together with Maxim Kontsevich, William Timothy Gowers and Curtis T. McMullen. The award cited him &quot;for his contributions to algebra, the theory of automorphic forms, and mathematical physics, including the introduction of vertex algebras and Borcherds&#x27; Lie algebras, the proof of the Conway-Norton moonshine conjecture and the discovery of a new class of automorphic infinite products.&quot; In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, and in 2014 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

<text>Chicken-fried steak, also known as country-fried steak, is an American Southern breaded cutlet dish consisting of a piece of beefsteak (most often tenderized cube steak) coated with seasoned flour and either deep-fried or pan-fried. It is associated with the Southern cuisine of the United States. It is breaded and fried with a technique similar to the more common fried chicken, hence &quot;chicken-fried&quot;. When deep-fried, it is usually referred to as &quot;chicken-fried steak&quot;. Pan-fried versions are typically referred to as &quot;country-fried steak&quot;.

Chicken-fried steak resembles the Austrian dish &quot;Wiener schnitzel&quot; and the Italian dish , which is a tenderized veal or pork cutlet, coated with flour, eggs, chicken stock cube, and bread crumbs, and then fried. It is also similar to the recipe for Scottish collops.

==History==
The precise origins of the dish are unclear, but many sources attribute its development to German and Austrian immigrants to Texas in the 19th century, who brought recipes for &quot;Wiener schnitzel&quot; from Europe to the USA. Lamesa, the seat of Dawson County on the Texas South Plains, claims to be the birthplace of chicken-fried steak, and hosts an annual celebration accordingly.

&quot;The Virginia Housewife&quot;, published in 1838 by Mary Randolph, has a recipe for veal cutlets that is one of the earliest recipes for a food like chicken-fried steak. The recipe for what we now know as chicken-fried steak was included in many regional cookbooks by the late 19th century. The Oxford English Dictionary&#x27;s earliest attestation of the term &quot;chicken-fried steak&quot; is from a restaurant advertisement in the 19 June 1914 edition of the Colorado Springs &quot;Gazette&quot; newspaper.

A 1943 American cookbook recipe for &quot;Wiener schnitzel&quot; includes a white salt and pepper cream gravy.

Chicken-fried steak is among numerous popular dishes which make up the official state meal of Oklahoma, added to the list in 1988.

==Preparation==
Chicken-fried steak is prepared by taking a thin cut of beefsteak and tenderizing it by pounding, cubing, or forking. It is then immersed in egg batter or buttermilk, then dredged in flour to which salt, pepper, and often other seasonings have been added. Chicken-fried steak is typically deep-fried and served with cream gravy, while country fried steak is typically fried in a skillet and served with brown gravy. The frying medium has traditionally been shortening, but butter and lard have sometimes been used instead. Health concerns have led many cooks to replace the shortening with vegetable oil.

When there are problems with the breading separating from the meat while cooking, it can be very useful to first dredge the meat in the flour mixture, then the egg or buttermilk, and then the flour mixture again, and then let it sit for a half-hour or more before cooking.

The cuts of steak used for chicken-fried steak are usually the less expensive, less desirable ones, such as cube steak, chuck, round steak, and occasionally flank steak. The method may be used for chopped or ground beef, but it is not called chicken-fried steak. Chicken-fried steak is usually served for lunch or dinner topped with cream gravy and with mashed potatoes, vegetables, and biscuits or Texas toast served on the side. In the Midwest, it is also common to serve chicken-fried steak for breakfast, along with toast and hash browns.

The steak can be served on a hamburger bun with cream gravy as a &quot;chicken-fried steak sandwich&quot;. It can also be cubed and stuffed in a baked potato with gravy and cheese.

Alternatively, the tenderized steak may be cut into strips, breaded, deep-fried, and served for breakfast with eggs and toast or for other meals in a basket with fries and cream gravy. Known as &quot;finger steaks&quot; or &quot;steak fingers&quot;, this is a popular dish in the state of Idaho.

==Variants==

In Texas and neighboring states, chicken fried steak is commonly prepared by either deep frying or pan-frying in a generous layer of oil. It is typically served with the classic accompaniment of peppered milk gravy.

Regionally, the pan-fried variation is sometimes known as &quot;country fried steak.&quot; Although some recipes and dining establishments opt for the traditional peppered milk gravy with country fried steak, a distinctive version featuring a brown, beef stock-based gravy with onions is prevalent. This variation serves as the main distinguishing factor between the two dishes in regions where both are enjoyed.
