<text>Thomas Edward Yorke (born 7 October 1968) is an English musician who is the main vocalist and songwriter of the rock band Radiohead. He plays guitar, bass, keyboards and other instruments, and is noted for his falsetto. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Yorke as one of the greatest and most influential singers of his generation.

Yorke formed Radiohead with schoolmates at Abingdon School in Oxfordshire. They gained notice with their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, and went on to achieve acclaim and sales of more than 30 million albums. Yorke&#x27;s early influences included alternative rock acts such as the Pixies and R.E.M. With Radiohead&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), Yorke moved into electronic music, influenced by Warp acts such as Aphex Twin. For most of his career, he has worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood.

Yorke&#x27;s solo work comprises mainly electronic music. His debut solo album, &quot;The Eraser&quot;, was released in 2006. To perform it live, he formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, with musicians including Godrich and the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea. They released an album, &quot;Amok&quot;, in 2013. Yorke&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot;, was released in 2014, followed by &quot;Anima&quot; in 2019. In 2021, Yorke debuted a new band, the Smile, with the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and the drummer Tom Skinner; they have released three albums. Yorke has collaborated with artists including PJ Harvey, Björk, Flying Lotus and Modeselektor, and has composed for film and theatre, including the films &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018) and &quot;Confidenza&quot; (2024).

Yorke is an activist on behalf of human rights, animal rights, environmental and anti-war causes, and his lyrics incorporate political themes. He has been critical of the music industry, particularly of major labels and streaming services such as Spotify. With Radiohead and his solo work, he has employed alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.

==Early life==
Yorke was born on 7 October 1968 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He was born with a paralysed left eye, and underwent five eye operations by the age of six. According to Yorke, the last surgery was &quot;botched&quot;, giving him a drooping eyelid. He decided against further surgery: &quot;I decided I liked the fact that it wasn&#x27;t the same, and I&#x27;ve liked it ever since. And when people say stuff I kind of thought it was a badge of pride, and still do.&quot;

The family moved frequently. Shortly after Yorke&#x27;s birth, his father, a nuclear physicist and later a chemical equipment salesman, was hired by a firm in Scotland. The family lived in Lundin Links in Fife until Yorke was seven, and he moved from school to school. The family settled in Oxfordshire in 1978, where Yorke attended primary school in Standlake.

Yorke said he knew he would become a rock star after seeing the Queen guitarist Brian May on television for the first time at the age of eight. He initially wanted to be a guitarist rather than a singer, but began singing as he had no one else to sing the songs he was writing. He received his first guitar as a child. At 10, he made his own guitar, inspired by May&#x27;s homemade Red Special. By 11, he had joined his first band and written his first song. Seeing Siouxsie Sioux in concert at the Apollo in 1985 inspired him to become a performer; Yorke said he had never seen anyone &quot;captivate an audience like she did&quot;.

Yorke attended the boys&#x27; private school Abingdon in Oxfordshire. He felt out of place, and got into physical fights with other students. He found sanctuary in the music and art departments, and wrote music for a school production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. At school, he performed a vocal recital of a Schubert piece, which helped him find the confidence to become a singer. Terence Gilmore-James, the Abingdon director of music, recalled Yorke as &quot;forlorn and a little isolated&quot; thanks to his unusual appearance, but talkative and opinionated. He said Yorke was &quot;not a great musician&quot;, unlike his future bandmate Jonny Greenwood, but a &quot;thinker and experimenter&quot;. Yorke later credited the support of Gilmore-James and the head of the art department for his success. Yorke had classical guitar lessons with his future bandmate Colin Greenwood.

=== 1985–1991: On a Friday ===
In sixth form at Abingdon, Yorke played with a punk band, TNT, but left when he was dissatisfied with their progress. He began playing with Colin Greenwood, Ed O&#x27;Brien and Philip Selway, joined later by Colin&#x27;s younger brother, Jonny. In 1985, they formed a band, On a Friday, named after the only day they were allowed to practice. According to Selway, while each member contributed songs in the band&#x27;s early period, Yorke emerged as the main songwriter. 

After leaving Abingdon, Yorke took a gap year and tried to become a professional musician. He held several jobs, including a period selling suits and working in an architect&#x27;s office, and made a demo tape. He was also involved in a serious car accident that influenced the lyrics of later songs, including the &quot;Bends&quot; B-side &quot;Killer Cars&quot; (1995) and &quot;Airbag&quot; from &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). In the late 1980s, Yorke made a solo album, &quot;Dearest&quot;, which O&#x27;Brien described as similar to the Jesus and Mary Chain, with delay and reverb effects.

On the strength of their first demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records, but the members decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first. Yorke had wanted to apply to St John&#x27;s to read English at the University of Oxford, but, he said, &quot;I was told I couldn&#x27;t even apply – I was too thick. Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. It&#x27;s too rigorous.&quot; He also considered studying music, but could not read sheet music. 

In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford to study English and fine arts at the University of Exeter. On a Friday entered hiatus aside from rehearsals during breaks. At Exeter, Yorke performed experimental music with a classical ensemble, played in a techno group called Flickernoise, and played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met Stanley Donwood, who would become Radiohead&#x27;s cover artist, and his future wife, Rachel Owen. According to Yorke, his paintings at Exeter were &quot;shit&quot;; he was rejected by his classmates and &quot;went AWOL for three months&quot;. Yorke credited his art school education for preparing him creatively for his later work.

On a Friday resumed activity in 1991 as most of the members were finishing their degrees. Ronan Munro, the editor of the Oxford music magazine &quot;Curfew&quot;, gave the band their first interview while they were sharing a house in Oxford. He recalled: &quot;Thom wasn&#x27;t like anyone I&#x27;d interviewed before ... He was like &#x27;This is going to happen... Failure is not an option.&#x27; ... He wasn&#x27;t some ranting diva or a megalomaniac, but he was so focused on what he wanted to do.&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1991–1993: &quot;Creep&quot; and rise to fame ===
In 1991, when Yorke was 22, On a Friday signed to EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. They gained notice with their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, which appeared on their 1993 debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;. Yorke grew tired of &quot;Creep&quot; after it became a hit, and told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1993: &quot;It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not our song any more ... It feels like we&#x27;re doing a cover.&quot;

According to Yorke, around this time he &quot;hit the self-destruct button pretty quickly&quot;. He tried to project himself as a rock star and drank heavily, often becoming too drunk to perform. Yorke said: &quot;When I got back to Oxford I was unbearable ... As soon as you get any success you disappear up your own arse.&quot; Years later, Yorke said he had found it difficult to cope with Radiohead&#x27;s success: &quot;I got angry ... I got more control-freakery. I put my hands on the steering wheel and I was white-knuckled, and I didn&#x27;t care who I hurt or what I said.&quot; He later apologised to his bandmates for his behaviour.

=== 1994–1997: &quot;The Bends&quot; ===
Paul Q Kolderie, the co-producer of &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, observed that Yorke&#x27;s songwriting improved dramatically after &quot;Pablo Honey.&quot; O&#x27;Brien later said: &quot;After all that touring on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; ... the songs that Thom was writing were so much better. Over a period of a year and a half, suddenly, &quot;bang&quot;.&quot; 

Recording Radiohead&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), was stressful, as they felt pressured to release a follow-up to &quot;Creep&quot;. Yorke in particular struggled. According to the band&#x27;s co-manager, Chris Hufford, &quot;Thom became totally confused about what he wanted to do, what he was doing in a band and in his life, and that turned into a mistrust of everybody else.&quot; &quot;The Bends&quot; was engineered by Nigel Godrich, who became one of Yorke&#x27;s longest-running collaborators.

&quot;The Bends&quot; received acclaim and brought Radiohead wider international attention. It influenced a generation of British and Irish alternative rock acts; &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote that it popularised an &quot;angst-laden falsetto&quot; which &quot;eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound&quot;. The American rock band R.E.M., a major influence on Radiohead, picked them as their support act for their European tour. Yorke befriended the singer, Michael Stipe, who gave him advice about how to deal with fame. Yorke joined R.E.M. to perform their song &quot;E-Bow the Letter&quot; on several occasions from 1998 to 2004.

=== 1997–1998: &quot;OK Computer&quot; ===
During the production of Radiohead&#x27;s third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), the members had differing opinions and equal production roles, with Yorke having &quot;the loudest voice&quot;, according to O&#x27;Brien. &quot;OK Computer &quot;achieved acclaim and strong sales, establishing Radiohead as one of the leading rock acts of the 1990s. 

Yorke struggled with the attention the success brought him, and the stress of the &quot;OK Computer&quot; tour. Colin Greenwood described the &quot;hundred-yard stare&quot; in Yorke&#x27;s eyes when performing, and said &quot;he absolutely did not want to be there... You hate having to put your friend through that experience.&quot; Yorke said later:

In 1997, Yorke provided backing vocals for a cover of the 1975 Pink Floyd song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; with Sparklehorse. The following year, he duetted on &quot;El President&quot; with Isabel Monteiro of Drugstore, and sang on the Unkle track &quot;Rabbit in Your Headlights&quot;, a collaboration with DJ Shadow. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; cited &quot;Rabbit in Your Headlights&quot; as a &quot;turning point&quot; for Yorke, foreshadowing his work in experimental electronic music. 

For the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Andy Mackay of Roxy Music and Bernard Butler of Suede formed a band, the Venus in Furs, to cover Roxy Music songs. In 2016, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Yorke &quot;weirdly comes off as the weak link&quot;, with understated vocals that did not resemble the Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.

=== 1999–2004: &quot;Kid A, Amnesiac&quot; and &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; ===

Following the &quot;OK Computer&quot; tour, Yorke suffered a mental breakdown and found it impossible to write new music. He experienced imposter syndrome, and became self-critical and over-analytical. He was approached to score the 1999 film &quot;Fight Club&quot;, but declined as he was recovering from stress. 

Around this period, acts influenced by Radiohead emerged, such as Travis and Coldplay. Yorke resented them, feeling they had copied him. He said in 2006: &quot;I was really, really upset about it, and I tried my absolute best not to be, but yeah, it was kind of like— that sort of thing of missing the point completely.&quot; Godrich felt Yorke was oversensitive and told him he did not invent &quot;guys singing in falsetto with an acoustic guitar&quot;. He saw Yorke&#x27;s resentment as &quot;a byproduct of being so focused on what he wanted to do that he figures he&#x27;s the only person that&#x27;s ever had that idea&quot;. 

To recuperate, Yorke moved to Cornwall and spent time walking the cliffs, writing and drawing. He restricted his songwriting to piano; the first song he wrote was &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot;. During this period, Yorke listened almost exclusively to the electronic music of artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre, saying: &quot;It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I&#x27;d ever felt about guitar music.&quot; Yorke gradually relaxed and came to enjoy his work again.

Radiohead took Yorke&#x27;s electronic influences to their next albums &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001), processing vocals, obscuring lyrics, and using electronic instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines and samplers. The albums divided listeners, but were commercially successful and later attracted acclaim. &quot;Kid A&quot; was named the best album of the decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

In 2000, Yorke contributed vocals to three tracks on the PJ Harvey album &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea,&quot; and duetted with Björk on her song &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen It All&quot; from her soundtrack album &quot;Selmasongs&quot;. Radiohead released their sixth album, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, a blend of rock and electronic music, in 2003. Yorke wrote many of its lyrics in response to the war on terror and the resurgence of right-wing politics in the west after the turn of the millennium, and his shifting worldview after becoming a father. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood contributed to the 2004 Band Aid 20 single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, produced by Godrich.

=== 2004–2008: &quot;The Eraser&quot; and &quot;In Rainbows&quot; ===
Yorke recorded his debut solo album, &quot;The Eraser&quot;, during Radiohead&#x27;s 2004 hiatus. It comprises electronics songs recorded and edited with computers. Yorke, who formed Radiohead while the members were in school, said he was curious to try working alone. He stressed that Radiohead were not splitting up and that the album was made &quot;with their blessing&quot;. According to Jonny Greenwood, Radiohead were happy for Yorke to make the album: &quot;He&#x27;d go mad if every time he wrote a song it had to go through the Radiohead consensus.&quot; Godrich said that working with Yorke on &quot;The Eraser&quot; was easier than working with Radiohead, as &quot;when we were in a room when it&#x27;s with Radiohead ... I&#x27;m trying to manage a relationship between [Yorke] and the band and it&#x27;s me butting heads with him and trying to work on behalf of the band.&quot;

&quot;The Eraser&quot; was released in 2006 on the independent label XL Recordings, backed by the singles &quot;Harrowdown Hill&quot;, which reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart, and &quot;Analyse&quot;. It reached the top ten in the UK, Ireland, United States, Canada and Australia, and was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. It was followed by a B-sides compilation, &quot;Spitting Feathers&quot;, and a remix album by various artists, &quot;The Eraser Rmxs&quot;.

In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, as a pay-what-you-want download, the first for a major act. The release made headlines worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. Yorke described it as a statement of Radiohead&#x27;s belief in the value of music and a &quot;contract of faith&quot; between musicians and audiences. In the same year, Yorke sang on the Modeselektor track &quot;The White Flash&quot; from the album &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; likened it to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Eraser&quot; and wrote that Yorke&#x27;s vocals &quot;work so perfectly that it feels like this is &quot;his&quot; band&quot;. Yorke also sang backing vocals on Björk&#x27;s 2008 charity single &quot;Náttúra&quot;.
=== 2009–2010: Atoms for Peace ===
In 2009, Yorke released a cover of the Miracle Legion song &quot;All for the Best&quot; with his brother, Andy, for the compilation &quot;Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy&quot;. In July, Yorke performed solo at the Latitude Festival in Suffolk and released a double-A-side single, &quot;FeelingPulledApartByHorses/TheHollowEarth&quot;. He also contributed the track &quot;Hearing Damage&quot; to the &quot;Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; film soundtrack.

That year, Yorke formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, to perform songs from &quot;The Eraser&quot;. Alongside Yorke, the band comprises Godrich on keyboards and guitar, the bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the drummer Joey Waronker and the percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark. Yorke said: &quot;God love &#x27;em but I&#x27;ve been playing with [Radiohead] since I was 16, and to do this was quite a trip ... It felt like we&#x27;d knocked a hole in a wall, and we should just fucking go through it.&quot; 

Atoms for Peace performed eight North American shows in 2010. They went unnamed for early performances, billed as &quot;Thom Yorke&quot; or &quot;??????&quot;. In February, Yorke performed a benefit concert at the Cambridge Corn Exchange for the British Green Party. In June, he performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival with Jonny Greenwood, performing &quot;Eraser &quot;and Radiohead songs. 

Yorke provided vocals for &quot;...And the World Laughs with You&quot; from the Flying Lotus album &quot;Cosmogramma,&quot; and for &quot;Shipwreck&quot; and &quot;This&quot; on the Modeselektor album &quot;Monkeytown&quot;, both released in 2010. Along with Damien Rice and Philip Glass, he contributed to the soundtrack for the 2010 documentary &quot;When the Dragon Swallowed the Sun&quot;.

=== 2011–2013: &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; and &quot;Amok&quot; ===
In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;, which Yorke described as &quot;an expression of physical movements and wildness&quot;. Yorke sought to move further from conventional recording methods. The music video for &quot;Lotus Flower&quot;, featuring Yorke&#x27;s erratic dancing, became an internet meme. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums. 

In the same year, Yorke collaborated with the electronic artists Burial and Four Tet on &quot;Ego&quot; and &quot;Mirror&quot;, and collaborated with Greenwood and the American rapper MF Doom on &quot;Retarded Fren&quot;. In 2012, Yorke contributed music to a show by the fashion label Rag &amp; Bone, and sang on &quot;Electric Candyman&quot; on the Flying Lotus album &quot;Until the Quiet Comes.&quot; He also remixed the single &quot;Hold On&quot; by the electronic musician Sbtrkt, under the name Sisi BakBak. His identity was not confirmed until September 2014.

In February 2013, Atoms for Peace released an album, &quot;Amok&quot;, followed by a tour of Europe, the US and Japan. &quot;Amok&quot; received generally positive reviews, though some critics felt it was too similar to Yorke&#x27;s solo work. That year, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood contributed music to &quot;The UK Gold&quot;, a documentary about tax avoidance. The soundtrack, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a series of &quot;minimalist soundscapes&quot;, was released free in February 2015 through the online music platform SoundCloud.

=== 2014–2017: &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot; and &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; ===
Yorke released his second solo album, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot;, via BitTorrent on 26 September 2014. It became the most torrented album of 2014 (excluding piracy), with more than a million downloads in its first six days. Yorke and Godrich hoped to use the BitTorrent release to hand &quot;some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work&quot;. In December 2014, Yorke released the album on the online music platform Bandcamp along with a new track, &quot;Youwouldn&#x27;tlikemewhenI&#x27;mangry&quot;.

In 2015, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, &quot;Subterranea&quot;, to an installation of Radiohead artwork, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Panic Office&quot;, in Sydney, Australia. The soundtrack was composed of field recordings made in the English countryside and played on speakers at different heights with different frequency ranges. The radio station Triple J described it as similar to the ambient sections of &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot;, with some digitally spoken sections similar to &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; from &quot;OK Computer&quot;. The music was not released. In July 2015, Yorke joined the band Portishead at the Latitude Festival to perform their song &quot;The Rip&quot;.

Yorke composed music for a 2015 production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s 1971 play &quot;Old Times&quot; by the Roundabout Theater Company in New York City. The director described the music as &quot;primeval, unusual ... The sort of neurosis within [Yorke&#x27;s] music certainly has elucidated elements of the compulsive repetition of the play.&quot; That year, Yorke performed with Godrich and the audiovisual artist Tarik Barri at the Latitude Festival in the UK and Summer Sonic in Japan.

Radiohead released their ninth album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot;, on 8 May 2016. Several critics felt its lyrics were coloured by Yorke&#x27;s separation from his partner, Rachel Owen. Spencer Kornhaber of the &quot;Atlantic&quot; wrote that &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; &quot;makes the most sense when heard as a document of a wrenching chapter for one human being&quot;. Yorke contributed vocals and appeared in the video for &quot;Beautiful People&quot; from Mark Pritchard&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Under the Sun&quot;.

=== 2018–2019: &quot;Suspiria&quot; ===
Yorke&#x27;s first feature film soundtrack, &quot;Suspiria&quot;, composed for the 2018 horror film, was released on 26 October 2018 by XL. It was Yorke&#x27;s first project since &quot;The Bends&quot; not to feature production from his longtime collaborator Nigel Godrich; instead, it was produced by Yorke and Sam Petts-Davies. &quot;Suspiria&quot; features the London Contemporary Orchestra and Choir, and Yorke&#x27;s son, Noah, on drums. Yorke cited inspiration from the 1982 &quot;Blade Runner&quot; soundtrack and music from &quot;Suspiria&quot;&#x27;s 1977 Berlin setting, such as krautrock. The lyrics do not follow the film narrative and were influenced by discourse surrounding President Donald Trump and Brexit. &quot;Suspirium&quot; was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 2020 Grammy Awards.

Yorke performed two shows in 2017, and toured Europe and the US in 2018. That year, he and the artist Tarik Barri created an audiovisual exhibition, &quot;City Rats&quot;, commissioned by the Institute for Sound and Music in Berlin. &quot;I See You&quot;, a limited-edition zine edited by Yorke with &quot;Crack Magazine&quot;, was published in September 2018, with profits donated to Greenpeace. Yorke contributed music to the 2018 short film &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Get Along?&quot; for Rag &amp; Bone.

On 29 March 2019, Yorke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead. He did not attend the induction ceremony, citing cultural differences between the UK and the US and his negative experience of the Brit Awards, &quot;which is like this sort of drunken car crash that you don&#x27;t want to get involved with&quot;.

=== 2019–2020: &quot;Anima&quot; ===
Yorke&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Anima&quot;, was released on 27 June 2019. It became Yorke&#x27;s first number-one album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums chart. At the 2020 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. Philip Sherburne of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it was Yorke&#x27;s most ambitious and assured solo album and the first that felt complete without Radiohead. The album was accompanied by a short film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which was nominated for the Grammy for Best Music Film. In August, Yorke released &quot;Not the News Rmx EP&quot;, comprising an extended version of the &quot;Anima&quot; track &quot;Not the News&quot; plus remixes by various artists. A solo tour set to begin in March 2020 was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the 2019 film &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, Yorke wrote &quot;Daily Battles&quot;, with horns by his Atoms for Peace bandmate Flea. The director, Edward Norton, enlisted the jazz musician Wynton Marsalis to rearrange the song as a ballad reminiscent of 1950s Miles Davis. It was shortlisted for Best Original Song at the 92nd Academy Awards. Yorke&#x27;s first classical composition, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fear the Light&quot;, written for the piano duo Katia and Marielle Labeque, debuted in April 2019. 

In April 2020, Yorke performed a new song from his home, &quot;Plasticine Figures&quot;, for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In the same year, he collaborated with Four Tet and Burial again on &quot;Her Revolution&quot; and &quot;His Rope&quot;, and remixed &quot;Isolation Theme&quot; by the electronic musician Clark. Yorke said his remix mirrored the COVID-19 lockdowns, &quot;entering a new type of silence&quot;.

=== 2021–2022: the Smile ===

In March 2021, Yorke contributed music to shows by the Japanese fashion designer Jun Takahashi, including a remixed version of &quot;Creep&quot;. That August, he contributed two remixes of &quot;Gazzillion Ear&quot; by the rapper MF Doom.

In May, Yorke debuted a new band, the Smile, with Jonny Greenwood and the jazz drummer Tom Skinner, produced by Godrich. Greenwood said the project was a way for him and Yorke to work together during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Smile made their surprise debut in a performance streamed by Glastonbury Festival on May 22, with Yorke singing and playing guitar, bass, Moog synthesiser and Rhodes piano. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis said the Smile &quot;sound like a simultaneously more skeletal and knottier version of Radiohead&quot;, exploring more progressive rock influences with unusual time signatures, complex riffs and &quot;hard-driving&quot; motorik psychedelia.

In October 2021, Yorke performed a Smile song, &quot;Free in the Knowledge&quot;, at the Letters Live event at the Royal Albert Hall, London. In the same month, Yorke and the Radiohead cover artist, Stanley Donwood, curated an exhibition of &quot;Kid A&quot; artwork and lyrics at Christie&#x27;s headquarters in London, ahead of a reissued package of the &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesia&quot; albums, &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;. The pair also contributed lyrics and artwork to &quot;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&quot;, a free digital experience for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.

=== 2022: further Smile records and &quot;Confidenza&quot; ===
On 9 April 2022, Yorke performed a solo concert at the Zeltbühne festival in Zermatt, Switzerland, playing songs from across his career. In May, the Smile released their debut album, &quot;A Light for Attracting Attention&quot;, and began a European tour. Yorke wrote two songs, &quot;5.17&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s How Horses Are&quot;, for the sixth series of the television drama &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, broadcast in 2022. He executive-produced &quot;Sus Dog&quot; (2023), the tenth album by Clark, contributing vocals and bass and acting as a mentor for Clark&#x27;s vocals. 

In September 2023, Yorke and Donwood exhibited a selection of artwork, &quot;The Crow Flies&quot;, in London. The paintings, based on Islamic pirate maps and 1960s US military topographic charts, began as work for &quot;A Light For Attracting Attention&quot;. The Smile toured internationally between 2022 and 2024. In 2024, they released the albums &quot;Wall of Eyes&quot; and &quot;Cutouts&quot;, recorded simultaneously. 

Yorke composed the score for the 2024 film &quot;Confidenza&quot; by the Italian filmmaker Daniele Luchetti. It features the London Contemporary Orchestra and a jazz ensemble including Yorke&#x27;s Smile bandmate Tom Skinner. On 22 April, Yorke released two tracks from the soundtrack, &quot;Knife Edge&quot; and &quot;Prize Giving&quot;. The soundtrack was released on 26 April. Yorke produced &quot;Stepdaughter&quot;, a song written and performed by his wife, Dajana Roncione, and released in November 2024. It was written for the Italian film &quot;Eterno Visionario&quot;, directed by Michele Placido and starring Roncione. 

In October, Yorke began the Everything tour of New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Japan, performing songs from across his career. Yorke is due to rework the Radiohead album &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; for a stage production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; announced in September 2024. The production is directed by Christine Jones and Steven Hoggett and scheduled to run at Aviva Studios, Manchester, from April to May 2025, followed by the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in June. Yorke said &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; &quot;chimes with the underlying grief and paranoia&quot; of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Yorke collaborated again with Mark Pritchard on the single &quot;Back in the Game&quot;, released on 13 February.

Yorke writes the first versions of most Radiohead songs, after which they are developed harmonically by Jonny Greenwood before the other band members develop their parts. According to Yorke, Greenwood is &quot;more impatient&quot; and eager to move to the next idea, whereas he enjoys editing and perfecting songs. Yorke&#x27;s solo work comprises mainly electronic music. &quot;Stereogum&quot; characterised it as &quot;largely interior&quot;, &quot;frigid&quot; and &quot;beat-driven&quot;, unlike the &quot;wide-open horizons&quot; of Radiohead songs.

Yorke has worked with the producer Nigel Godrich on most of his projects, including Radiohead, Atoms for Peace, the first Smile record and most of his solo work. He credits Godrich with helping edit his work, identifying which parts need improvement and which have potential. He said they sometimes had arguments that last for days, but that they always resolve their differences, and likened him to a brother. Godrich said the pair were &quot;very productive together and that&#x27;s a really precious and important thing and it changes within the context of whatever we&#x27;re doing&quot;.

Yorke said the nature of being a creative person was &quot;to retain a beginner&#x27;s mind. The search is the point. The flailing around is the point. The process is the point.&quot; He said he used to be more controlling in the studio, but learnt to be more relaxed and open to new ideas. He likened the creative process to surfing: &quot;You can sit out there on a board for ages waiting for the right wave to come along. You can&#x27;t get angry about it. You know it will happen eventually and you start to understand the waiting itself might be part of it.&quot;

=== Instruments ===
Yorke is a multi-instrumentalist, and plays instruments including guitar, piano, bass and drums. He played drums for performances of the 2007 Radiohead song &quot;Bangers and Mash&quot;. With the Smile, Yorke has used a Fender Mustang bass with a fingerstyle technique. Yorke uses electronic instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines and sequencers, and electronic techniques including programming, sampling and looping. In 2015, he said: &quot;Really I just enjoy writing words sitting at a piano. I tend to lose interest in the drum machine.&quot; According to Godrich, &quot;Thom will sit down and make some crazy, fractured cheese-grater-on-head mayhem on a computer, but at some point he always gets his guitar out to check he can actually play it.&quot;

Unlike Greenwood, Yorke does not read sheet music. He said: &quot;You can&#x27;t express the rhythms properly like that. It&#x27;s a very ineffective way of doing it, so I&#x27;ve never really bothered picking it up.&quot; Explaining why he declined an invitation to play piano on the song &quot;Mr. Bellamy&quot; on Paul McCartney&#x27;s album &quot;Memory Almost Full&quot; (2007), Yorke said: &quot;The piano playing involved two hands doing things separately. I don&#x27;t have that skill available. I said to him, &#x27;I strum piano, that&#x27;s it.&#x27;&quot;

=== Vocals ===

Yorke has one of the widest vocal ranges in popular music. He is known for his falsetto&quot;, &quot;which &quot;Paste&quot; described as &quot;sweet&quot;, &quot;cautious&quot; and &quot;haunting&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone &quot;described his voice as a &quot;broad, emotive sweep&quot; with a &quot;high, keening sound&quot;. The &quot;Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;instrument-like&quot; and &quot;spectral&quot;, and wrote that it &quot;transcends the egocentric posturing of the indie rock singer stereotype&quot;. The music journalist Robert Christgau wrote that Yorke&#x27;s voice has &quot;a pained, transported intensity, pure up top with hints of hysterical grit below ... Fraught and self-involved with no time for jokes, not asexual but otherwise occupied, and never ever common, this is the idealised voice of a pretentious college boy ... Like it or not the voice is remarkable.&quot; 

Yorke often manipulates his voice with software and effects, transforming it into a &quot;disembodied instrument&quot;. For example, on &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; (2000), his vocals are treated to create a &quot;glitching, stuttering collage&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote in 2016 that, over the decades, Yorke&#x27;s voice had evolved from &quot;semi-interesting alt-rocker&quot; to &quot;left-field art-rock demigod&quot; to &quot;electronic grand wizard&quot;. In 2006, Yorke said: &quot;It annoys me how pretty my voice is. That sounds incredibly immodest, but it annoys me how polite it can sound when perhaps what I&#x27;m singing is deeply acidic.&quot; He said he keeps vocals in mind whenever he builds music, no matter the genre, and that he found it difficult to listen to dance music without imagining a voice. In 2023, Yorke said that his vocal range had dropped with age and that he now found &quot;Creep&quot; difficult to sing.

In 2005, readers of &quot;Blender&quot; and MTV2 voted Yorke the 18th-greatest singer of all time. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him the 66th-greatest and wrote that he was one of the most influential singers of his generation, influencing bands such as Muse, Coldplay, Travis and Elbow. In their updated 2023 list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Yorke the 34th-greatest singer, praising his &quot;genuine edge of alienation&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
Yorke&#x27;s early lyrics were personal, but he found that &quot;tortured&quot; lyrics became tired. He said his lyrics were not &quot;some deep heartfelt thing&quot;; instead, he likened them to a collage assembled from images and external sources such as television. From &quot;Kid A&quot;, he experimented with cutting up words and phrases and assembling them at random. He sometimes chooses words for their sounds rather than meanings, such as the title phrase of &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; or the repeated phrase &quot;the rain drops&quot; on &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;. A 2021 study found that Yorke had among the largest vocabularies of pop singers, based on the number of different words used in each song.

Yorke deliberately uses cliches, idioms and other common expressions, inspired by the American artist Barbara Kruger. For example, according to the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Rob Mitchum, the &quot;Kid A&quot; lyrics feature &quot;hum-drum observations twisted into panic attacks&quot;. Another &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer, Jayson Greene, said the approach suggested &quot;a mind consumed by meaningless data&quot;. Yorke said he hoped to capture the everyday experience of trying to make emotional sense of words and images, and that &quot;lyrics should be a series of windows opening rather than shutting, which is incredibly hard to do&quot;. Colin Greenwood described Yorke&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;a running commentary on what&#x27;s happening in the world ... like a shutter snapping in succession&quot;. 

The &quot;New Republic&quot; writer Ryan Kearney speculated that Yorke&#x27;s use of common expressions, which he described as &quot;Radioheadisms&quot;, was an attempt &quot;to sap our common tongue of meaning and expose the vapidity of everyday discourse&quot;. Kearney felt the approach had become a crutch for Yorke, creating a &quot;senseless mush&quot;. He wrote in 2016 that he was &quot;the most overrated lyricist in music today&quot;, and that fans, critics and academics had &quot;taken the bait and delivered one overwrought interpretation after another&quot;. 

Yorke said his lyrics were motivated by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns and written as &quot;a constant response to doublethink&quot;. The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album &quot;Hail to the Thief &quot;dealt with what Yorke called the &quot;ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity&quot; following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding war on terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 single &quot;Harrowdown Hill&quot; about David Kelly, the British weapons expert and whistleblower. In a 2008 television performance of &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Yorke dedicated the &quot;denial, denial&quot; refrain to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. The 2011 single &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; attacks the right-wing &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper.

Many of Yorke&#x27;s lyrics express paranoia. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis described &quot;what you might call the Yorke worldview: that life is a waking nightmare and everything is completely and perhaps irreparably screwed&quot;. In a 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, Yorke said: &quot;In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work ... It&#x27;s much harder to do that now. If I was going to write a protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It&#x27;s not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone&#x27;s mind.&quot; Working on Radiohead&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot;, Yorke worried that political songs alienated some listeners, but decided it was better than writing &quot;another lovey-dovey song about nothing&quot;. 

Greene wrote that Yorke&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; were less cynical, conveying wonder and amazement. Many critics felt the lyrics might address Yorke&#x27;s separation from Rachel Owen, his partner of more than 20 years. Yorke denied writing biographically, saying he instead writes &quot;spasmodic&quot; lyrics based on imagery.

=== Dance ===
Yorke often incorporates dance into his performances, described by the &quot;Sunday&quot; &quot;Times&quot; as his &quot;on-stage signature&quot;. He began dancing on stage after Radiohead released &quot;Kid A&quot; in 2000, as many songs did not require him to play guitar. The &quot;New York Times&quot; contrasted Yorke&#x27;s &quot;tortured&quot; 1990s appearance with his later &quot;looser&quot;, more comfortable performances. Yorke said he enjoyed &quot;messing around with the idea of being the rock star or the uptight [1990s] guy. I can &quot;choose&quot; to do something completely different and be stupid or jump around.&quot; 

Yorke&#x27;s dancing features in music videos for songs such as &quot;Lotus Flower&quot; and &quot;Ingenue&quot;, and the short film &quot;Anima&quot;. Critics have described it as &quot;erratic&quot;, &quot;flailing&quot; and unconventional. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted Yorke their 10th-favourite dancing musician.
=== Influences ===
As a child, Yorke&#x27;s favourite artists included Queen, R.E.M., Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division and Bob Dylan were important to him as a teenager. He initially attempted to emulate singers including Michael Stipe, Morrissey and David Sylvian. He also wrote that Mark Mulcahy of Miracle Legion had affected him &quot;a great deal&quot; at this time: &quot;It was the voice of someone who was only truly happy when he was singing ... It changed the way I thought about songs and singing.&quot;

When he was 16, Yorke sent a demo to a music magazine, who wrote that he sounded like Neil Young. Unfamiliar with Young, Yorke purchased his 1970 album &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, which gave him the confidence to reveal &quot;softness and naiveté&quot; in vocals. Yorke also credited Young as a lyrical influence. He said: &quot;It was his attitude toward the way he laid songs down. It&#x27;s always about laying down whatever is in your head at the time and staying completely true to that, no matter what it is.&quot; Yorke said that Jeff Buckley had given him the confidence to use falsetto and be vulnerable in his singing. The 1986 album &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot; by Elvis Costello and the Attractions changed how Yorke approached recording and writing music and lyrics.

Yorke cited the Pixies, Björk and PJ Harvey as artists who &quot;changed his life&quot;, and in 2006 he told &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that Radiohead had &quot;ripped off R.E.M. blind for years&quot;. He cited Stipe as his favourite lyricist: &quot;I loved the way he would take an emotion and then take a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful.&quot; The chorus of &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; from &quot;Kid A&quot; was inspired by Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: &quot;I&#x27;m not here, this isn&#x27;t happening.&quot; Yorke cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante as an influence on his guitar playing on &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, and Scott Walker as an influence on his vocals and lyrics. Yorke admired how the Beastie Boys worked independently despite being signed to a major record label, and was influenced by their activism, such as their Tibetan Freedom Concerts.

Beginning with &quot;Kid A&quot;, Radiohead incorporated influences from electronic artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. In 2013, Yorke cited Aphex Twin as his biggest influence, saying: &quot;Aphex opened up another world that didn&#x27;t involve my fucking electric guitar ... I hated all the music that was around Radiohead at the time, it was completely fucking meaningless. I hated the Britpop thing and what was happening in America, but Aphex was totally beautiful.&quot; He cited the 1962 live album &quot;The Complete Town Hall Concert&quot; by the jazz musician Charles Mingus as another formative influence during this period.

=== Artwork ===
Since the EP &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; (1994), Yorke has created artwork for Radiohead and his other projects with Stanley Donwood. The pair met as art students at the University of Exeter. Donwood said his first impression of Yorke was that he was &quot;mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with.&quot; Yorke is credited for artwork alongside Donwood as the White Chocolate Farm, Tchock, Dr. Tchock and similar abbreviations.

Whereas Donwood described himself as having a tendency towards &quot;detailing and perfectionism&quot;, he said Yorke is &quot;completely opposed, fucking everything up ... I do something, then he fucks it up, then I fuck up what he&#x27;s done ... and we keep doing that until we&#x27;re happy with the result. It&#x27;s a competition to see who &#x27;wins&#x27; the painting, which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way.&quot; The artist Tarik Barri provides live visuals for Yorke&#x27;s solo and multimedia projects and shows with Atoms for Peace.

== Politics and activism ==
=== Music industry ===
Yorke has been critical of the music industry and has pioneered alternative release platforms with Radiohead and his solo work. Following Radiohead&#x27;s tour of America in 1993, he became disenchanted with being &quot;right at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle&quot; he felt he was helping sell. After a 1995 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; article suggested that Yorke would kill himself like the Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, Yorke developed an aversion to the British music press. In November 1995, &quot;NME&quot; covered an incident in which Yorke became sick and collapsed on stage at a show in Munich, and titled the story &quot;Thommy&#x27;s Temper Tantrum&quot;. Yorke said it was the most hurtful thing anyone had written about him, and refused to give interviews to &quot;NME&quot; for five years.

The 1998 documentary &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; portrays Yorke&#x27;s disaffection with the music industry and press during Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot; tour. After Radiohead&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), was leaked via the peer-to-peer filesharing software Napster weeks before release, Yorke told &quot;Time&quot; he felt Napster &quot;encourages enthusiasm for music in a way that the music industry has long forgotten to do. I think anybody sticking two fingers up at the whole fucking thing is wonderful as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot; In 2001, Yorke criticised the American live music industry, describing it as a monopoly controlled by Clear Channel Entertainment and Ticketmaster.

After Radiohead&#x27;s record contract with EMI ended with the release of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; (2003), Yorke told &quot;Time&quot;: &quot;I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say &#x27;Fuck you&#x27; to this decaying business model.&quot; In 2006, he called major record labels &quot;stupid little boys&#x27; games &quot;–&quot; especially really high up&quot;. 

Radiohead independently released their 2007 album &quot;In Rainbows &quot;as a download for which listeners could choose their price. Yorke said the &quot;most exciting&quot; part of the release was the removal of the barrier between artist and audience. However, in 2013, Yorke told the &quot;Guardian&quot; he feared the &quot;In Rainbows&quot; release had instead played into the hands of content providers such as Apple and Google: &quot;They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want?&quot; In 2015, he criticised YouTube for &quot;seizing control&quot; of contributor content, likening it to Nazis looting art during World War II.

==== Spotify ====
In 2013, Yorke and Godrich made headlines for their criticism of the music streaming service Spotify, and removed Atoms for Peace and Yorke&#x27;s solo music from the service. In a series of tweets, Yorke wrote: &quot;Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile, shareholders will shortly be rolling in it ... New artists get paid fuck-all with this model.&quot; Yorke called Spotify &quot;the last gasp of the old industry&quot;, accusing it of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own &quot;direct connections&quot; with audiences instead.

Brian Message, a partner at Radiohead&#x27;s management company, disagreed with Yorke, noting that Spotify pays 70 percent of its revenue back to the music industry. He said that &quot;Thom&#x27;s issue was that the pipe has become so jammed ... We encourage all of our artists to take a long-term approach ... Plan for the long term, understand that it&#x27;s a tough game.&quot; Yorke and Atoms for Peace&#x27;s music was re-added to Spotify in December 2017.

For Yorke&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot; (2014), released via BitTorrent, he and Godrich expressed their hope to &quot;hand some control of internet back to people who are creating the work ... bypassing the self-elected gatekeepers&quot;. Asked if the release had been a success, Yorke said: &quot;No, not exactly ... I wanted to show that, in theory, today one could follow the entire chain of record production, from start to finish, on his own. But in practice it is very different. We cannot be burdened with all of the responsibilities of the record label.&quot;

=== Climate change ===
In 2000, during the recording of &quot;Kid A&quot;, Yorke became &quot;obsessed&quot; with the Worldwatch Institute website, &quot;which was full of scary statistics about icecaps melting and weather patterns changing&quot;. He said he became involved in the movement to halt climate change after having children and &quot;waking up every night just terrified&quot;.

In 2003, Yorke became a spokesperson for the environmental organisation Friends of the Earth and their Big Ask Campaign. He said this was a difficult decision, as it would expose him to personal attacks, and that journalists had harassed his friends and family for personal details. In an article for the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Yorke wrote that he initially felt he would be a poor match as his touring consumed a large amount of energy. However, Friends of the Earth persuaded him that this was ideal as they did not want to &quot;present a holier-than-thou message&quot;. He accepted that he would be criticised for his support.

In 2006, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed at the Big Ask Live, a 2006 benefit concert to persuade the British government to enact a new law on climate change. That year, Yorke refused an invitation from Friends of the Earth to meet the prime minister, Tony Blair. Yorke said that Blair had &quot;no environmental credentials&quot; and that his spin doctors would manipulate the meeting. He told the &quot;Guardian&quot; that Blair&#x27;s advisers had wanted to vet him and that Friends of the Earth would lose access if he said &quot;the wrong thing&quot;, which he equated to blackmail. Yorke also found it unacceptable to be photographed with Blair because of his involvement in the Iraq War.

In 2008, Radiohead commissioned a study to reduce the carbon expended on tour. Based on the findings, they chose to play at venues supported by public transport, made deals with trucking companies to reduce emissions, used new low-energy LED lighting and encouraged festivals to offer reusable plastics. That year, Yorke guest-edited a special climate change edition of &quot;Observer Magazine&quot; and wrote: &quot;Unlike pessimists such as James Lovelock, I don&#x27;t believe we are all doomed ... You should never give up hope.&quot;

In 2009, Yorke performed via Skype at the premier of the environmentalist documentary &quot;The Age of Stupid&quot;, and gained access to the COP 15 climate change talks in Copenhagen by posing as a journalist. In 2010, he performed a benefit concert at the Cambridge Corn Exchange for the British Green Party and supported the 10:10 campaign for climate change mitigation. The following year, he joined the maiden voyage of &quot;Rainbow Warrior III, &quot;a yacht used by Greenpeace to monitor damage to the environment.

Yorke endorsed the Green Party candidate Caroline Lucas at the 2015 UK general election. In December 2015, he performed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris at a benefit concert in aid of 350.org, an environmental organisation raising awareness about climate change. His performance was included on the live album &quot;Pathway to Paris&quot;, released in July 2016. Yorke contributed an electronic track, &quot;Hands Off the Antarctic&quot;, to a 2018 Greenpeace campaign.

=== Israel ===
In April 2017, more than 50 prominent figures, including the musicians Roger Waters and Thurston Moore, the rights activist Desmond Tutu and the filmmaker Ken Loach, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel a performance in Tel Aviv as part of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a cultural boycott of Israel. A week before the Tel Aviv performance, a Radiohead concert in Glasgow was attended by pro-Palestine protestors waving flags and signs. Yorke responded with anger on stage.

In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Yorke said of the criticism: &quot;I just can&#x27;t understand why going to play a rock show or going to lecture at a university [is a problem to them] ... It&#x27;s really upsetting that artists I respect think we are not capable of making a moral decision ourselves after all these years. They talk down to us and I just find it mind-boggling that they think they have the right to do that.&quot; Yorke said that the petitioners had not contacted him. This was disputed by Waters, who wrote in an open letter in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he had attempted to contact Yorke several times. In a statement, Yorke responded: &quot;We don&#x27;t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. Playing in a country isn&#x27;t the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.&quot;

Yorke has made no statement on the ongoing Gaza war. In October 2024, during a solo concert by Yorke in Melbourne, a pro-Palestinian protester heckled Yorke, criticising his lack of condemnation for Israel&#x27;s attacks on Gaza. Yorke challenged him to make a statement onstage and left the stage when he continued to heckle. He returned to perform the final song, &quot;Karma Police&quot;.

===Other issues===
In 1999, Yorke travelled to the G8 summit to support the Jubilee 2000 movement calling for cancellation of third-world debt. In a 2003 &quot;Guardian&quot; article criticising the World Trade Organization, he wrote: &quot;The west is creating an extremely dangerous economic, environmental and humanitarian time bomb. We are living beyond our means.&quot; In 2005, he performed at an all-night vigil for the Trade Justice Movement, calling for a better trade deal for poor countries. The music video for the 2007 Radiohead song &quot;All I Need&quot; was produced with MTV EXIT, an initiative to raise awareness of human trafficking and modern slavery. Yorke said he saw slavery as a &quot;political stability issue&quot;, and that it was important for people in the west to &quot;understand the consequences of our economic activity&quot;.

In 2002, Yorke performed at the Bridge School Benefit, a charity concert organised by the Canadian songwriter Neil Young, one of Yorke&#x27;s influences. His set included a cover of Young&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, performed on the piano Young wrote it on. In September 2004, Yorke was a key speaker at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally outside the RAF Fylingdales air base in Yorkshire, protesting Tony Blair&#x27;s support of the Bush administration&#x27;s plans for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; missile defence system. In November 2010, Yorke and musicians including Plan B, Bryan Ferry and Mark Ronson appeared in the music video for the charity single &quot;2 Minute Silence&quot;, which comprises two minutes of silence. The single commemorates Remembrance Day, with all proceeds to the Royal British Legion. In 2011, alongside Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack and Tim Goldsworthy of Unkle, Yorke played a secret DJ set for a group of Occupy activists in the abandoned offices of the investment bank UBS.

To celebrate the 2008 election of US president Barack Obama, Yorke released a remixed version of his single &quot;Harrowdown Hill&quot; as a free download. In June 2016, following the Orlando nightclub shooting in Florida, Yorke was one of nearly 200 music industry figures to sign an open letter published in &quot;Billboard&quot; urging the United States Congress to impose stricter gun control. After the election of Donald Trump in 2016, he tweeted lyrics from Radiohead&#x27;s single &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;, interpreted as a criticism of Trump&#x27;s policies. He opposed Brexit, and in March 2019 joined the People&#x27;s Vote march calling for a second referendum. In 2024, Yorke was one of 10,500 creative professionals who signed a statement warning against the unlicensed use of creative work in AI training.

Yorke is vegetarian. In a 2005 film for the animal rights foundation Animal Aid, he said: &quot;Society deems it necessary to create this level of suffering in order for [people] to eat food that they don&#x27;t need ... You should at least be aware of what you&#x27;re doing rather than assuming that that&#x27;s your right as a human being to do it.&quot;

==Personal life==
For 23 years, Yorke was in a relationship with the artist and lecturer Rachel Owen, whom he met while studying at the University of Exeter. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Owen and Yorke were unmarried. However, &quot;The Times&quot; later found that they had married in a secret ceremony in Oxfordshire in May 2003. Their son, Noah, was born in 2001, and their daughter, Agnes, in 2004.

In August 2015, Yorke and Owen announced that they had separated amicably. Owen died from cancer on 18 December 2016, aged 48. In September 2020, Yorke married the Italian actress Dajana Roncione in Bagheria, Sicily. Roncione appears in the video for the Radiohead song &quot;Lift&quot; and the &quot;Anima&quot; film. They live in Oxford.

On Yorke&#x27;s 2018 soundtrack album &quot;Suspiria&quot;, his son, Noah, played drums on two tracks and his daughter, Agnes, collaborated on the artwork. In September 2021, Noah released a song, &quot;Trying Too Hard (Lullaby)&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; likened its &quot;ghostly&quot; arrangement to Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;In Rainbows&quot;. Noah has since released several more songs, and performs with James Knott as the noise duo Hex Girlfriend. Yorke&#x27;s younger brother and only sibling, Andy, is the singer of the band Unbelievable Truth. 

Yorke practises meditation. In 2004, he said he had &quot;dabbled&quot; in Buddhism. He has suffered from anxiety and depression, which he treats with exercise, yoga and reading. While recording in California with Atoms for Peace, Yorke took up surfing, which he said taught him patience in creativity. In 2023, an extinct stingray species was named &quot;Dasyomyliobatis thomyorkei&quot; in his honour.

<text>Edward John O&#x27;Brien (born 15 April 1968) is an English guitarist, songwriter, and member of the rock band Radiohead. He releases solo music under the name EOB.

O&#x27;Brien attended Abingdon School in Oxfordshire, England, where he formed Radiohead with schoolmates. O&#x27;Brien said his role was to &quot;service the songs&quot; and support the songwriter, Thom Yorke. He often creates ambient sounds and textures, using effects, sustain units and the EBow, and provides backing vocals. 

With musicians including the Radiohead drummer, Philip Selway, O&#x27;Brien toured and recorded with the 7 Worlds Collide project in the 2000s. His first solo album, &quot;Earth&quot;, was released in 2020. O&#x27;Brien had been writing songs for years, but lacked confidence and felt their character would be lost with Radiohead. He began a North American tour in February 2020; a larger tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has campaigned on topics including climate change and artist rights. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named O&#x27;Brien among the greatest guitarists of all time in 2010 and 2023. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.

== Early life ==

O&#x27;Brien was born on April 15, 1968. His family comes from Ballyporeen, Ireland. As a child, O&#x27;Brien enjoyed cricket and theatre. His parents split when he was 10; O&#x27;Brien said this was when music became his &quot;refuge&quot;. He grew up listening to post-punk acts such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, Depeche Mode, the Police and David Bowie. He said: &quot;It was a very foetal [time] for music because people who went to art college or artists, or musicians, suddenly thought, &#x27;Oh, I can be that.

The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. While O&#x27;Brien was playing Lysander in a school production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, he met Thom Yorke, who was scoring the production. Yorke asked him to join him for a jam. According to O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Before that, [life] was a bit confusing, a bit crap. And then suddenly ... I felt something very strong, almost like some kind of epiphany, almost like: &#x27;This is it.

One year below the drummer, Philip Selway, O&#x27;Brien was in the year above Yorke and the bassist, Colin Greenwood, and four years above Colin&#x27;s brother, the guitarist Jonny Greenwood. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school&#x27;s music room. They continued to rehearse during holidays while the members attended university. O&#x27;Brien studied economics at the University of Manchester, where he took part in the Second Summer of Love.

==Career==

=== Radiohead ===
In 1991, On a Friday signed a record contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. They found early success with their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, from their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993). For their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), the guitarists&#x27; roles were more divided, with Yorke generally playing rhythm, Greenwood lead and Ed O&#x27;Brien providing effects. &quot;The Bends&quot; received positive reviews and elevated Radiohead&#x27;s profile.

Radiohead&#x27;s third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), brought them international fame and is often acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time. O&#x27;Brien used less distortion and more delay and other effects, creating a sound that was &quot;more about textures&quot;. He became depressed during the extensive &quot;OK Computer&quot; tour, but focused on supporting Yorke. After the tour, he returned to Oxford, used large amounts of drugs and fell further into depression. He said: &quot;I was single, on my own … I was the lowest I&#x27;ve ever been. It was the irony as well – you&#x27;re at the top, that old cliché.&quot;

Radiohead&#x27;s next albums, &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001), marked a dramatic change in sound, incorporating influences from electronic music, classical music, jazz and krautrock. O&#x27;Brien initially struggled with the change, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s scary – everyone feels insecure. I&#x27;m a guitarist and suddenly it&#x27;s like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums.&quot; He began using effects units more extensively to process his guitar, creating synthesiser-like sounds. O&#x27;Brien kept an online diary of Radiohead&#x27;s progress during the recording.

During the sessions for &quot;In Rainbows&quot; (2007), O&#x27;Brien believed Radiohead might never record another album. He said later: &quot;One of my mantras throughout the recording was, &#x27;This is the last time I&#x27;m doing this. I&#x27;ll never summon up the energy to do this again. So I&#x27;m going to put everything I can into it.&#x27;&quot; He was motivated by a desire to secure Radiohead&#x27;s legacy as a great band, and said in 2008: &quot;In my view, we&#x27;ve made three really great records, &quot;The Bends&quot;, &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot;. What we needed was another great record just to seal it.&quot;

By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019; O&#x27;Brien and Selway attended the induction ceremony and gave speeches. O&#x27;Brien thanked his bandmates for their musicianship and friendship, saying that &quot;some of the nights we have in the rehearsal studio [are] like transcendental moments&quot;. 

In 2020, O&#x27;Brien said his role in Radiohead was to &quot;service the songs&quot; and support Yorke. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been like his older brother ... I always say that he was like the dad of the band and I&#x27;m the mum. My job was to always put my arm around him, and his job was to be Thom.&quot; Radiohead&#x27;s producer, Nigel Godrich, described O&#x27;Brien as &quot;very much a diplomat&quot;.

=== Solo work ===

O&#x27;Brien releases solo music under the name EOB. After making demos with the producer Ian Davenport in 2014, he recorded with the producer Flood from late 2017 to early 2019. He had written songs for years, but lacked the confidence to bring them to Radiohead and felt they had a &quot;distinct energy&quot; that would be lost if they became a &quot;hybrid product&quot;. He denied that he had ever felt &quot;creatively stifled&quot; in Radiohead. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s debut solo work, the non-album track &quot;Santa Teresa&quot;, was released on 4 October, 2019. &quot;Stereogum&quot; described it as a &quot;haunting&quot; ambient instrumental in the style of Brian Eno and Fennesz.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Earth&quot;, was released on 17 April 2020 on Capitol Records to positive reviews. It features the Radiohead bassist, Colin Greenwood, plus the drummer Omar Hakim, the Invisible members Nathan East and Dave Okumu, the folk singer Laura Marling, the Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley and the Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche. The music was inspired by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s time living in Brazil and attending Carnival, which he described as a &quot;musical eureka moment&quot;. The first track, &quot;Brasil&quot;, was released on 5 December 2019, followed by &quot;Shangri-La&quot; on 6 February. O&#x27;Brien began a North American tour in February 2020; a larger &quot;Earth&quot; tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

O&#x27;Brien contributed a remix of Paul McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Slidin to the 2021 remix album &quot;McCartney III Imagined.&quot; O&#x27;Brien said he intended &quot;Earth&quot; to be the first album in a trilogy. In January 2024, he said he was &quot;deep into&quot; recording his second album.

=== Other work ===

In 1999, O&#x27;Brien contributed to the soundtrack for the BBC drama series &quot;Eureka Street&quot;. He contributed guitar to the 2003 Asian Dub Foundation album &quot;Enemy of the Enemy&quot;. With Selway and other musicians, O&#x27;Brien toured and recorded with Neil Finn as part of the 7 Worlds Collide project. He provided guitar and backing vocals on their 2001 live album and the 2009 album &quot;The Sun Came Out&quot;.

In 2009, along with the musicians Dave Rowntree, Jazzie B, Billy Bragg, Mark Kelly, Master Shortie and Kate Nash, O&#x27;Brien co-founded the Featured Artists Coalition, a nonprofit organisation set up to protect the rights of featured musicians, particularly in the digital age. He appeared in a 2011 episode of the BBC Radio 5 Live sports programme &quot;Fighting Talk&quot; in support of Record Shop Day. In 2013, O&#x27;Brien cofounded the Laundry, a workspace, restaurant and nightclub converted from a laundry in London Fields. In 2019, Hackney Council announced that the building would be demolished to make way for luxury flats.

In 2014, O&#x27;Brien and Selway signed an open letter protesting a ban on guitars in British prisons and stating that music was important for rehabilitation. In 2018, O&#x27;Brien became an &quot;informal patron&quot; for the environmental pressure group Extinction Rebellion, which he described as &quot;incredibly enlightened&quot;. In 2019, O&#x27;Brien joined the RSPB Let Nature Sing project, which aimed to get birdsong into the UK charts to raise awareness of the decline in Britain&#x27;s birdlife. 

In 2020, O&#x27;Brien contributed to Ear Opener, an online video course aimed at helping young people write music. That November, he gave evidence to a DCMS Committee inquiry into the impact of streaming on the music industry. He said he wanted to speak for less successful artists, who he felt were exploited. In February 2025, O&#x27;Brien spoke about climate change at São Paulo International Music Week. O&#x27;Brien was one of more than 1,000 musicians to back &quot;Is This What We Want?&quot;, an album of silence released on 25 February protesting the use of unlicensed copyrighted work to train AI.

==Musicianship==

While Jonny Greenwood plays most of Radiohead&#x27;s lead guitar parts, O&#x27;Brien often creates ambient effects, making extensive use of effects units. He said of the technique: &quot;It&#x27;s a bit like you&#x27;re creating a canvas. That would be in accompaniment with Thom playing chords on the piano — you&#x27;re building up a cloud of effects behind.&quot; O&#x27;Brien said of his playing: &quot;I literally learned to play my instrument within the band, so I started off very limited — and I&#x27;m &quot;still&quot; very limited. But I&#x27;ve been lucky, because I&#x27;ve been in a band that has not required you to be a virtuoso.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien usually plays Fender Stratocasters, including an Eric Clapton Stratocaster. He worked with Fender to design a signature model guitar, the EOB Stratocaster, which went on sale in November 2017. It features a tremolo bridge and a sustainer pickup. He also plays Gretsch and Rickenbacker guitars, including a twelve-string Rickenbacker. O&#x27;Brien also sings backing vocals, which &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described as Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;most consistent secret weapon&quot;. 

O&#x27;Brien said in 2017 that his most used effects for Radiohead were distortion, an Electro-Harmonix Memory Man delay and a DigiTech Whammy pitch shifter. He described the Boss DD-5 delay pedal as &quot;key to the sound of &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer ...&quot; It&#x27;s the only delay that can make those &quot;OK Computer&quot; sounds.&quot; In the &quot;Kid A&quot; sessions, at the suggestion of Michael Brook, the creator of the Infinite Guitar, O&#x27;Brien began using sustain units, which allow guitar notes to be sustained indefinitely. He combined these with looping and delay effects to create synthesiser-like sounds. 

To create the high-pitched chiming sound that introduces &quot;Lucky&quot;, O&#x27;Brien strums above the guitar nut. He creates the reverberating pops on the introduction of &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;. On &quot;Karma Police&quot;, O&#x27;Brien distorts his guitar by driving a delay effect to self-oscillation, then lowering the delay rate, creating a &quot;melting&quot; effect. The ambient track &quot;Treefingers&quot; was created by processing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s guitar loops. On &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot;, O&#x27;Brien uses a pitch shifter pedal to shift his guitar chords from minor to major. For &quot;All I Need&quot;, he used a sustain unit and a guitar strung with four bottom E strings, creating a thicker sound. O&#x27;Brien uses the EBow, an electronic sustaining device, on his guitar to generate drones and ambient leads on songs such as &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, &quot;Talk Show Host&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw Falling Into Place&quot;, &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; and &quot;Nude&quot;. On &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; and &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot;, he used a Klon Centaur overdrive pedal.

In 2010, the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Fricke named O&#x27;Brien the 59th-greatest guitarist of all time. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named O&#x27;Brien and Greenwood the joint 43rd-greatest guitarists, writing that O&#x27;Brien was &quot;possibly the most underrated guitarist in rock ... adding subtle textures that enhance each song and keeping the band grounded with his cheerful, up-for-anything vibe. You might not be able to name his best solo, but it&#x27;s impossible to imagine Radiohead without him.&quot; 

=== Influences ===
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s earliest guitar influence was Andy Summers of the Police, particularly his use of delay and chorus effects on &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;. His other influences include Peter Buck of R.E.M, Paul Weller of the Jam, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, John McGeoch of Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the Edge of U2. O&#x27;Brien admired how these guitarists created &quot;space&quot; rather than playing conventional solos. He said: &quot;They were great guitarists, but they weren&#x27;t lead guitarists ... My favourite guitarists know when not to play. Then you make more of it when you do play. Make it count.&quot; 

O&#x27;Brien cited the American band Phish as an influence on his solo shows, saying: &quot;[They&#x27;re] like a jazz band; they are willing to take risks for a moment of musical transcendence. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after — I want to tap into that.&quot; He cited the music of Brazil, such as the music of Carnival and Jorge Ben, as an influence on &quot;Earth&quot;. Other influences included Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Arcade Fire, Underworld, Bill Withers, Talking Heads and the &quot;Celtic, folky&quot; music of Led Zeppelin.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Brien lives in north London. With his wife, Susan Kobrin, he has a son, born in January 2004, and a daughter, born in 2006. Around 2000, O’Brien gave up alcohol, saying it was &quot;fucking him up&quot;, and began using meditation. In 2011, he and his family moved to Brazil for a year, living on a farm near Ubatuba. In March 2020, O&#x27;Brien announced that he had contracted COVID-19 and was recovering in isolation.

<text>Colin Charles Greenwood (born 26 June 1969) is an English bassist and a member of the rock band Radiohead. Along with bass guitar, Greenwood plays upright bass and electronic instruments.

With his younger brother, the guitarist Jonny Greenwood, Colin attended Abingdon School in Abingdon, England, where they formed Radiohead. Radiohead have achieved acclaim and have sold more than 30 million albums. Greenwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.

Greenwood has contributed to solo projects by the other members of Radiohead, and has collaborated with musicians including Tamino, Gaz Coombes, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. In 2024, he published a book of his photographs of Radiohead.

==Early life==
Colin Greenwood is the older brother of the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Their father served in the British Army as a bomb disposal expert. The Greenwood family has historical ties to the British Communist Party and the socialist Fabian Society. Greenwood lived in Germany as a child and became fluent in German. 

As a teenager, Greenwood read historical works such as &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists&quot; and fiction by American writers including Richard Ford and John Cheever. He enjoyed films by Jean-Luc Godard, Derek Jarman and Michelangelo Antonioni. He credited his older sister, Susan, with introducing him and Jonny to &quot;miserable&quot; bands such as the Fall, Magazine and Joy Division. He said: &quot;We were ostracised at school because everyone else was into Iron Maiden.&quot;

Greenwood and his brother attended Abingdon School, a private school for boys in Oxfordshire. When he was 12, he met the future Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke. Their future bandmates Ed O&#x27;Brien, whom Greenwood met during a school production of the opera &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, and Philip Selway were also pupils. Greenwood bought his first guitar when he was 15. He and Yorke had classical guitar lessons with the Abingdon music teacher, Terence Gilmore-James, who introduced them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music.

Greenwood said he began playing bass out of necessity, as O&#x27;Brien already played guitar. He taught himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said the band members picked their instruments &quot;because we wanted to play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So it was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool.&quot;

Greenwood read English at Peterhouse, Cambridge, between 1987 and 1990, and read modern American literature including Cheever, Raymond Carver and other postwar American writers. While at Peterhouse, he worked as an events and entertainments officer. After graduating, he took a job as a sales assistant at the record shop Our Price in Oxford.

==Radiohead==
In late 1991, the EMI sales representative Keith Wozencroft visited Our Price and struck up conversation with Greenwood. When Wozencroft mentioned that he was moving to a position as an A&amp;R scout at the EMI subsidiary Parlophone, Greenwood gave him a copy of On a Friday&#x27;s latest demo.

On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019. On being in a band with his brother, Jonny, Colin said: &quot;Beyond the normal brotherly thing, I respect him as a person and a musician.&quot;

Greenwood mostly plays fingerstyle, and said he was unskilled with plectrums. He mainly uses Fender basses and Ampeg and Ashdown amplifiers. He also plays double bass on tracks such as &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;You and Whose Army&quot;. While his main role is bass, Greenwood said each Radiohead member contributed to song development. He said he did not think of himself as a bass player and was &quot;just in a band with other people&quot;. Among his influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers, Curtis Mayfield, Peter Hook and J Dilla.

In 2008, &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote that Greenwood and Selway were &quot;surely the most inventive rhythm section working close to the rock mainstream&quot;. In 2014, &quot;NME&quot; readers voted Greenwood one of the 40 best bassists of all time. In 2024, &quot;Far Out&quot; named him the third-most underrated bassist, describing him as a &quot;master of rhythm of space&quot; and citing his bassline for &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; as his best: &quot;His style to a tee, the laid-back but focused walking groove underpins its profoundly dreamlike nature.&quot;

==Other work==

In 1997, Greenwood participated in a marketing campaign for his alma mater, Cambridge University, posing for a photo with students from both state and private schools for a poster titled &quot;Put Yourself in the Picture&quot;. The poster was &quot;designed to break down some of the stereotypes that deter able students from applying to Cambridge&quot; and encourage more applicants from state schools.

Greenwood contributed bass to two soundtracks by his brother, Jonny, &quot;Bodysong&quot; (2003) and &quot;Inherent Vice,&quot; and on his score for the 2008 film &quot;Woodpecker.&quot; He played bass on the albums &quot;Amir&quot; (2018) and &quot;Sahar&quot; (2022) by the Belgian-Egyptian singer Tamino, the album &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; (2018) by Gaz Coombes, and on &quot;Brasil&quot; from &quot;Earth&quot; (2020), the debut solo album by his Radiohead bandmate Ed O&#x27;Brien. He contributed beat programming to Yorke&#x27;s song &quot;Hearing Damage&quot; from the soundtrack to &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot;, and on &quot;Guess Again!&quot; from Yorke&#x27;s album &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot; (2014).

In 2004, Greenwood participated on a panel in the annual sixth-form conference run by Radley College in collaboration with School of St Helen and St Katharine, speaking about digital rights management. In 2013, he soundtracked a Dries van Noten runway show, performing solo bass guitar. In 2018, he reviewed Michael Palin&#x27;s book &quot;Erebus: The Story of a Ship&quot; for the &quot;Spectator&quot;.

In late 2022, Greenwood toured Australia as part of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis&#x27;s band. He appears on their live album &quot;Australian Carnage&quot;. Greenwood joined Cave&#x27;s North American tour in September 2023, and contributed bass to the 2024 album &quot;Wild God&quot; by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Greenwood joined the Bad Seeds on their 2024 tour after their bassist, Martyn P. Casey, fell ill. That October, Greenwood published a book, &quot;How to Disappear: A Portrait of Radiohead&quot;, comprising his photographs of Radiohead taken between 2003 and 2016.

==Personal life==
In December 1998, Greenwood married Molly McGrann, an American literary critic and novelist. They have three sons, Jesse, born in December 2003; Asa, born in December 2005; and Henry, born in December 2009. They live in Oxford. 

Greenwood enjoys writers such as Thomas Pynchon, V.S. Naipaul and Delmore Schwartz. In 2003, he discussed his favourite photographs in the Victoria and Albert Museum, choosing images by photographers including Frederick Sommer and Harold Edgerton.

<text>Philip James Selway (born 23 May 1967) is an English musician and the drummer of the rock band Radiohead. He combines rock drumming with electronic percussion. Selway was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.

In the 2000s, with musicians including the Radiohead guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien, Selway toured and recorded with the 7 Worlds Collide project. In 2010, he released his debut solo album, &quot;Familial&quot;, comprising folk music. It was followed by &quot;Weatherhouse&quot; in 2014 and &quot;Strange Dance&quot; in 2023. Selway also composed the soundtrack for the 2017 film &quot;Let Me Go&quot;. In 2023, Selway played drums with Lanterns on the Lake.

==Early life==
Selway was born on 23 May, 1967, in Abingdon, Berkshire. He started learning to play drums and guitar at the age of 15 for &quot;the social cachet and love of music&quot;. His earliest influences were Joy Division, the Clash and the Velvet Underground.

The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, a private school for boys. Selway was in the year above the guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien, two years above the singer, Thom Yorke, and the bassist, Colin Greenwood, and five years above Colin&#x27;s brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood. In 1985, they formed , the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school&#x27;s music room. 

After Abingdon, Selway studied English and history at Liverpool Polytechnic. He also worked as a TEFL teacher, a copyeditor, and as a drummer in pit bands for touring musicals.

== Career ==

=== Radiohead ===
In 1991, On a Friday signed a recording contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. They found early success with their 1992 single &quot;Creep&quot;. Their third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), brought them international fame and is often acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time.

With their fourth album, &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), Radiohead began integrating drum machines and other electronic percussion into their music. Selway said this widened his options and pushed him to create new dynamics, enabling him to express himself more creatively. Describing the process of arranging electronic tracks such as &quot;Idioteque&quot; for live performance, he said: &quot;Trying to give that sense of the electronic in the piece but doing it through your &#x27;normal&#x27; instrument playing — that naturally develops your own musical voice ... Performing those songs live definitely affected how I sounded and how I would approach drum parts.&quot; 

Since 2011, Radiohead have performed with a second drummer, Clive Deamer. Describing their collaboration during Radiohead&#x27;s 2012 &quot;King of Limbs&quot; tour, Selway said: &quot;One [of us] played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like kids at play, really interesting.&quot; Selway contributed drums to &quot;Impossible Knots&quot; on Yorke&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Anima&quot; (2019). In 2019, Selway testified at an inquest into the 2012 stage collapse that killed Radiohead&#x27;s drum technician, Scott Johnson.

By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019. In a speech at the induction ceremony, Selway said: &quot;We may not be the greatest musicians around and we&#x27;re certainly not the most media-friendly of bands. But we have become very adept at being Radiohead. And when that connects with people, it feels amazing.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote that Selway and Colin Greenwood were &quot;surely the most inventive rhythm section working close to the rock mainstream&quot;. In the same year, &quot;Gigwise&quot; named Selway the 26th-greatest drummer of all time, praising his &quot;mathematical precision&quot;.

=== Solo work ===
Selway wrote songs as a teenager, but concentrated on drumming after forming Radiohead. He began writing again later in life, but decided the songs had a distinct character that did not fit Radiohead. Selway&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Familial&quot;, was released on 30 August 2010. It features Selway on acoustic guitar and vocals, and performances from the Wilco members Glenn Kotche and Pat Sansone and the 7 Worlds Collide artists Lisa Germano and Sebastian Steinberg. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as a collection of &quot;hushed&quot; folk songs in the tradition of Nick Drake. Selway began a solo tour in 2011. On 25 July, he released an EP, &quot;Running Blind&quot;, comprising songs left off &quot;Familial&quot; rerecorded with a full band.

Selway&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Weatherhouse&quot;, was released on 6 October 2014, featuring more ambitious instrumentation and electronic elements. In 2017, Selway composed the score for the feature film &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, directed by Polly Steele. His third solo album, &quot;Strange Dance&quot;, was released on 24 February 2023. He chose not to drum on the album, finding he was out of practice and &quot;not in the right mindset&quot;, and enlisted the Italian drummer Valentina Magaletti. He began a European tour that year. 

Selway contributed a cover of the Nick Drake song &quot;Fly&quot; to &quot;The Endless Coloured Ways – The Songs of Nick Drake&quot;, a tribute album featuring various artists released on 7 July, 2023. Selway described Drake as an influence on his songwriting, and said: &quot;If I had to shrink my record collection to just one artist, then that would be Nick Drake ... Nick Drake is an artist that I feel speaks to me and for me.&quot; On 8 December, Selway released a live album, &quot;Live at Evolution Studios,&quot; recorded with the string quartet Elysian Collective and the percussionist Chris Vatalaro in Evolution Studios, Oxford.

=== Other work ===

Selway is a supporter of the emotional support charity Samaritans, with which he became involved while a university student. He volunteered as a telephone listener for years, including at the height of Radiohead&#x27;s success, and said this &quot;probably kept my sanity in that period&quot;. He is also an ambassador for Independent Venue Week, an initiative that promotes small music venues. In 2014, Selway and O&#x27;Brien signed an open letter protesting a ban on guitars in British prisons and stating that music was important for rehabilitation.

Selway performed with the band Dive Dive at the Oxford Zodiac in February 2005. For the 2005 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Selway appeared as part of the wizard rock band Weird Sisters with the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey of Pulp, Steven Claydon of Add N to (X), and Jason Buckle of All Seeing I.

With O&#x27;Brien, Selway contributed to the 2001 live album by 7 Worlds Collide, a band formed by the New Zealand songwriter Neil Finn. He also contributed to their 2009 studio album &quot;The Sun Came Out&quot;, for which he wrote and sang &quot;Ties That Bind&quot; and &quot;Witching Hour&quot;. It was the first record for which Selway wrote songs and sang, at the encouragement of Finn. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Stephen M. Deusner was impressed by Selway&#x27;s vocals, praising his &quot;subtle melodic hooks and arcing, textured voice&quot;.

Selway appears on &quot;Rest on the Rock&quot; and &quot;Out of Light&quot; on the album &quot;Before the Ruin&quot; by Roddy Woomble, Kris Drever, and John McCusker. He played drums and percussion on the fifth album by Lanterns on the Lake, &quot;Versions of Us&quot; (2023), after the departure of their previous drummer. According to the songwriter, Hazel Wilde, Selway helped them create a &quot;whole other version&quot; of the album and restored their confidence in the songs.

== Personal life ==
Selway and his wife, Cait, have three sons and a daughter. Selway&#x27;s mother Thea died in May 2006; Radiohead cancelled a concert in Amsterdam so that Selway could carry out his family duties. They returned to Amsterdam in August to play the missed show. Radiohead&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;In Rainbows&quot; was dedicated to Thea Selway. As of February 2023, Selway had recently moved to London.

<text>Superficial X-rays are low-energy X-rays that do not penetrate very far before they are absorbed. They are produced by X-ray tubes operating at voltages in the 10–100 kV range, and therefore have peak energies in the 10–100 keV range. The Maximar-100 was a widely-adopted superficial radiation therapy unit.

Precise naming and definitions of energy ranges may vary, and X-rays at the lower end of this range may also be known as Grenz rays. They are useful in radiation therapy for the treatment of various benign or malignant skin problems, including skin cancer and severe eczema. They have a useful depth of up to 5 mm. In some locations, orthovoltage treatment is being replaced by electron therapy or brachytherapy.

As well as teletherapy, X-rays in this energy range (and the low orthovoltage range) are used for imaging patients, to analyse materials and objects in industrial radiography and for crystallography.

<doc id="273498" wikidata="Q2787176" url="?curid=273498" title="Orthovoltage X-rays">
<text>Orthovoltage X-rays are produced by X-ray tubes operating at voltages in the 100–500 kV range, and therefore the X-rays have a peak energy in the 100–500 keV range. Orthovoltage X-rays are sometimes termed &quot;deep&quot; X-rays (DXR). They cover the upper limit of energies used for diagnostic radiography, and are used in external beam radiotherapy to treat cancer and tumors. They penetrate tissue to a useful depth of about 4–6 cm. This makes them useful for treating skin, superficial tissues, and ribs, but not for deeper structures such as lungs or pelvic organs. The relatively low energy of orthovoltage X-rays causes them to interact with matter via different physical mechanisms compared to higher energy megavoltage X-rays or radionuclide γ-rays, increasing their relative biological effectiveness. 

==History==
The energy and penetrating ability of the X-rays produced by an X-ray tube increases with the voltage on the tube. External beam radiotherapy began around the turn of the 20th century with ordinary diagnostic X-ray tubes, which used voltages below 150 kV. Physicians found that these were adequate for treating superficial tumors, but not tumors inside the body. Since these low energy X-rays were mostly absorbed in the first few centimeters of tissue, to deliver a large enough radiation dose to buried tumors would cause severe skin burns.

Therefore beginning in the 1920s &quot;orthovoltage&quot; 200–500 kV X-ray machines were built. These were found to be able to reach shallow tumors, but to treat tumors deep in the body more voltage was needed. By the 1930s and 1940s megavoltage X-rays produced by huge machines with 3–5 million volts on the tube, began to be employed. With the introduction of linear accelerators in the 1970s, which could produce 4–30 MV beams, orthovoltage X-rays are now considered quite shallow.

<text>A radiation oncologist is a specialist physician who uses ionizing radiation (such as megavoltage X-rays or radionuclides) in the treatment of cancer. Radiation oncology is one of the three primary specialties, the other two being surgical and medical oncology, involved in the treatment of cancer. Radiation can be given as a curative modality, either alone or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. It may also be used palliatively, to relieve symptoms in patients with incurable cancers. A radiation oncologist may also use radiation to treat some benign diseases, including benign tumors. In some countries (not the United States), radiotherapy and chemotherapy are controlled by a single oncologist who is a &quot;clinical oncologist&quot;. Radiation oncologists work closely with other physicians such as surgical oncologists, interventional radiologists, internal medicine subspecialists, and medical oncologists, as well as medical physicists and technicians as part of the multi-disciplinary cancer team. Radiation oncologists undergo four years of oncology-specific training whereas oncologists who deliver chemotherapy have two years of additional training in cancer care during fellowship after internal medicine residency in the United States.

== Training (by country) ==

=== United States ===

In the United States, radiation oncologists undergo four years of residency (in addition to an internship), which is more dedicated to oncology training than any other medical specialty. During the four years of post-graduate training, residents learn about clinical oncology, the physics and biology of ionizing radiation, and the treatment of cancer patients with radiation. After completion of this training, a radiation oncologist may undergo certification by the American Board of Radiology (ABR). Board certification includes three written tests and an oral examination which is given only once per year. The written tests include separate exams in radiation physics, and radiobiology, clinical oncology, which is followed by an eight-part oral examination given in the late spring one year into practice. Successfully passing these tests leads to the granting of a time-limited board certification. Recertification is obtained via a series of continuing medical education and practice qualifications including a written exam, clinical practice parameter evaluation, continuing medical education credits, and meeting community practice standards.

=== India ===
Radiotherapy training in India encompasses the treatment of solid tumors in terms of Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and palliative care in most states. Postgraduate MD degree is awarded after 3 years of post-MBBS in-service comprehensive training and a final university level exam. MD Radiation oncology practitioners are the most proficient oncologists in India delivering radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The first Radiotherapy department of Asia was set up in 1910 at Calcutta Medical College in the state of West Bengal and is still a leading oncology training center of India.

=== Canada ===
Radiation Oncology training in Canada is very similar to the United States. Radiation oncologists directly enter radiation oncology residencies of 5 years duration, with the first year as an internship year. During the next four years, residents complete intensive training in clinical oncology, in radiophysics and radiobiology, and in the treatment planning and delivery of radiotherapy. Most radiation oncologists also pursue a fellowship after their residency, examples of which include brachytherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), gynecologic radiation oncology, and many others. Radiation oncologists in Canada commonly treat two or three different anatomic sites, such as head and neck, breast, genitourinary, hematologic, gynecologic, central nervous system, or lung cancer.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, clinical oncologists, who practise radiotherapy are also fully qualified to administer chemotherapy. After completion of their basic medical degree, all oncologists must train fully in general internal medicine and pass the MRCP exam, normally 3–4 years after qualification. Following this, 5 years of Specialist Registrar (SpR) training is required in all non-surgical aspects of oncology in a recognised training program. During this time, the trainee must pass the FRCR examination in order to qualify for specialist registration as a clinical oncologist. A significant proportion of trainees will extend their time to undertake an academic fellowship, MD, or PhD. Almost all consultant clinical oncologists in the UK are Fellows of the Royal College of Radiologists, the governing body of the specialty. Whilst most oncologists will treat a selection of common general oncology cases, there is increasing specialisation, with the expectation that consultants will specialise in one or two subsites.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

In Australia and New Zealand, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR Home | RANZCR) awards a Fellowship (FRANZCR) to trainees after a 5-year program and several sets of exams and modules. As in other countries, radiation oncologists tend to subspecialize although generalists will always exist in smaller centres. Although trained in the delivery of chemotherapy, radiation oncologists in Australia and New Zealand rarely prescribe it.

=== Iran ===

In Iran, radiation oncologists, who are trained in non-surgical aspects of oncology (including radiation therapy) directly enter a 5-year residency program after completion of 7 years of training in general medicine and acceptance in national comprehensive residency exam.

=== Nepal ===

In Nepal, only Bir Hospital runs residency program on Radiation Oncology, under NAMS. It&#x27;s a 3 years residency program, and the main domains are Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy and Palliative Care.

=== Spain ===
In Spain Radiation Oncology Specialists undertake a 4 year specialization program and are recognized to apply both ionizing radiation therapies and chemotherapy. Most fellows follow the policies emerged from leading national society SEOR (Sociedad Española de Oncología Radioterápica).

== Role of the Radiation oncologist ==
The Radiation oncologist is responsible for preparing the treatment plan where the radiation is required. Some of the treatment methods are radioactive implantations, external beam radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and combined modality therapy such as radiotherapy with surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy.

== Equipment ==
To provide the treatment correctly, a series of equipment is needed which will help to complement it. First, a simulator and treatment preparation must be carried out. This consists of locating the area where the tumor is located to know where exactly the patient will be exposed at the time of treatment. The equipment used to perform this work is a computed tomography (CT) scan, a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and W x-ray. Subsequently, the site targeted for treatment is marked and an immobilizer is created which helps to limit exposure another body area to the radiation. To complement this immobilizer staff will employ tape, foam sponges, headrests, molds and plaster casts. When treatment is in the head and neck area a thermoplastic mask is employed. This mask is precisely molded to the patient&#x27;s shape and secured it to fasteners on the treatment table. This improves patient stability. When the treatment plan is complete, the patient will be assigned (depending upon the type of cancer and its stage) appointments to perform the therapy and monitoring.

<text>A linear particle accelerator (often shortened to linac) is a type of particle accelerator that accelerates charged subatomic particles or ions to a high speed by subjecting them to a series of oscillating electric potentials along a linear beamline. The principles for such machines were proposed by Gustav Ising in 1924, while the first machine that worked was constructed by Rolf Widerøe in 1928 at the RWTH Aachen University.
Linacs have many applications: they generate X-rays and high energy electrons for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy, serve as particle injectors for higher-energy accelerators, and are used directly to achieve the highest kinetic energy for light particles (electrons and positrons) for particle physics.

The design of a linac depends on the type of particle that is being accelerated: electrons, protons or ions. Linacs range in size from a cathode-ray tube (which is a type of linac) to the linac at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California.

==History==

In 1924, Gustav Ising published the first description of a linear particle accelerator using a series of accelerating gaps. Particles would proceed down a series of tubes. At a regular frequency, an accelerating voltage would be applied across each gap. As the particles gained speed while the frequency remained constant, the gaps would be spaced farther and farther apart, in order to ensure the particle would see a voltage applied as it reached each gap. Ising never successfully implemented this design.

Rolf Wideroe discovered Ising&#x27;s paper in 1927, and as part of his PhD thesis he built an 88-inch long, two gap version of the device. Where Ising had proposed a spark gap as the voltage source, Wideroe used a 25kV vacuum tube oscillator. He successfully demonstrated that he had accelerated sodium and potassium ions to an energy of 50,000 electron volts (50 keV), twice the energy they would have received if accelerated only once by the tube. By successfully accelerating a particle multiple times using the same voltage source, Wideroe demonstrated the utility of radio frequency (RF) acceleration.

This type of linac was limited by the voltage sources that were available at the time, and it was not until after World War II that Luis Alvarez was able to use newly developed high frequency oscillators to design the first resonant cavity drift tube linac. An Alvarez linac differs from the Wideroe type in that the RF power is applied to the entire resonant chamber through which the particle travels, and the central tubes are only used to shield the particles during the decelerating portion of the oscillator&#x27;s phase. Using this approach to acceleration meant that Alvarez&#x27;s first linac was able to achieve proton energies of 31.5 MeV in 1947, the highest that had ever been reached at the time.

The initial Alvarez type linacs had no strong mechanism for keeping the beam focused and were limited in length and energy as a result. The development of the strong focusing principle in the early 1950s led to the installation of focusing quadrupole magnets inside the drift tubes, allowing for longer and thus more powerful linacs. Two of the earliest examples of Alvarez linacs with strong focusing magnets were built at CERN and Brookhaven National Laboratory.

In 1947, at about the same time that Alvarez was developing his linac concept for protons, William Hansen constructed the first travelling-wave electron accelerator at Stanford University. Electrons are sufficiently lighter than protons that they achieve speeds close to the speed of light early in the acceleration process. As a result, &quot;accelerating&quot; electrons increase in energy but can be treated as having a constant velocity from an accelerator design standpoint. This allowed Hansen to use an accelerating structure consisting of a horizontal waveguide loaded by a series of discs. The 1947 accelerator had an energy of 6 MeV. Over time, electron acceleration at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory would extend to a size of and an output energy of 50 GeV.

As linear accelerators were developed with higher beam currents, using magnetic fields to focus proton and heavy ion beams presented difficulties for the initial stages of the accelerator. Because the magnetic force is dependent on the particle velocity, it was desirable to create a type of accelerator which could simultaneously accelerate and focus low-to-mid energy hadrons. In 1970, Soviet physicists I. M. Kapchinsky and Vladimir Teplyakov proposed the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) type of accelerating structure. RFQs use vanes or rods with precisely designed shapes in a resonant cavity to produce complex electric fields. These fields provide simultaneous acceleration and focusing to injected particle beams.

Beginning in the 1960s, scientists at Stanford and elsewhere began to explore the use of superconducting radio frequency cavities for particle acceleration. Superconducting cavities made of niobium alloys allow for much more efficient acceleration, as a substantially higher fraction of the input power could be applied to the beam rather than lost to heat. Some of the earliest superconducting linacs included the Superconducting Linear Accelerator (for electrons) at Stanford and the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (for protons and heavy ions) at Argonne National Laboratory.

==Basic principles of operation==
=== Radiofrequency acceleration ===

When a charged particle is placed in an electromagnetic field it experiences a force given by the Lorentz force law:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the charge on the particle, formula_3 is the electric field, formula_4 is the particle velocity, and formula_5 is the magnetic field. The cross product in the magnetic field term means that static magnetic fields cannot be used for particle acceleration, as the magnetic force acts perpendicularly to the direction of particle motion.

As electrostatic breakdown limits the maximum constant voltage which can be applied across a gap to produce an electric field, most accelerators use some form of RF acceleration. In RF acceleration, the particle traverses a series of accelerating regions, driven by a source of voltage in such a way that the particle sees an accelerating field as it crosses each region. In this type of acceleration, particles must necessarily travel in &quot;bunches&quot; corresponding to the portion of the oscillator&#x27;s cycle where the electric field is pointing in the intended direction of acceleration.

If a single oscillating voltage source is used to drive a series of gaps, those gaps must be placed increasingly far apart as the speed of the particle increases. This is to ensure that the particle &quot;sees&quot; the same phase of the oscillator&#x27;s cycle as it reaches each gap. As particles asymptotically approach the speed of light, the gap separation becomes constant: additional applied force increases the energy of the particles but does not significantly alter their speed.

=== Focusing ===
In order to ensure particles do not escape the accelerator, it is necessary to provide some form of focusing to redirect particles moving away from the central trajectory back towards the intended path. With the discovery of strong focusing, quadrupole magnets are used to actively redirect particles moving away from the reference path. As quadrupole magnets are focusing in one transverse direction and defocusing in the perpendicular direction, it is necessary to use groups of magnets to provide an overall focusing effect in both directions.

====Phase stability====
Focusing along the direction of travel, also known as &quot;phase stability&quot;, is an inherent property of RF acceleration. If the particles in a bunch all reach the accelerating region during the rising phase of the oscillating field, then particles which arrive early will see slightly less voltage than the &quot;reference&quot; particle at the center of the bunch. Those particles will therefore receive slightly less acceleration and eventually fall behind the reference particle. Correspondingly, particles which arrive after the reference particle will receive slightly more acceleration, and will catch up to the reference as a result. This automatic correction occurs at each accelerating gap, so the bunch is refocused along the direction of travel each time it is accelerated.

==Construction and operation==


A linear particle accelerator consists of the following parts:
*A straight hollow pipe vacuum chamber which contains the other components. It is evacuated with a vacuum pump so that the accelerated particles will not collide with air molecules. The length will vary with the application. If the device is used for the production of X-rays for inspection or therapy, then the pipe may be only 0.5 to 1.5 meters long. If the device is to be an injector for a synchrotron, it may be about ten meters long. If the device is used as the primary accelerator for nuclear particle investigations, it may be several thousand meters long.
*The particle source &quot;(S)&quot; at one end of the chamber which produces the charged particles which the machine accelerates. The design of the source depends on the particle that is being accelerated. Electrons are generated by a cold cathode, a hot cathode, a photocathode, or radio frequency ion sources. Protons are generated in an ion source, which can have many different designs. If heavier particles are to be accelerated, (e.g., uranium ions), a specialized ion source is needed. The source has its own high voltage supply to inject the particles into the beamline.
*Extending along the pipe from the source is a series of open-ended cylindrical electrodes &quot;(C1, C2, C3, C4)&quot;, whose length increases progressively with the distance from the source. The particles from the source pass through these electrodes. The length of each electrode is determined by the frequency and power of the driving power source and the particle to be accelerated, so that the particle passes through each electrode in exactly one-half cycle of the accelerating voltage. The mass of the particle has a large effect on the length of the cylindrical electrodes; for example an electron is considerably lighter than a proton and so will generally require a much smaller section of cylindrical electrodes as it accelerates very quickly.
*A target with which the particles collide, located at the end of the accelerating electrodes. If electrons are accelerated to produce X-rays, then a water-cooled tungsten target is used. Various target materials are used when protons or other nuclei are accelerated, depending upon the specific investigation. Behind the target are various detectors to detect the particles resulting from the collision of the incoming particles with the atoms of the target. Many linacs serve as the initial accelerator stage for larger particle accelerators such as synchrotrons and storage rings, and in this case after leaving the electrodes the accelerated particles enter the next stage of the accelerator.
*An electronic oscillator and amplifier &quot;(G)&quot; which generates a radio frequency AC voltage of high potential (usually thousands of volts) which is applied to the cylindrical electrodes. This is the accelerating voltage which produces the electric field which accelerates the particles. Opposite phase voltage is applied to successive electrodes. A high power accelerator will have a separate amplifier to power each electrode, all synchronized to the same frequency.

As shown in the animation, the oscillating voltage applied to alternate cylindrical electrodes has opposite polarity (180° out of phase), so adjacent electrodes have opposite voltages. This creates an oscillating electric field &quot;(E)&quot; in the gap between each pair of electrodes, which exerts force on the particles when they pass through, imparting energy to them by accelerating them. The particle source injects a group of particles into the first electrode once each cycle of the voltage, when the charge on the electrode is opposite to the charge on the particles. Each time the particle bunch passes through an electrode, the oscillating voltage changes polarity, so when the particles reach the gap between electrodes the electric field is in the correct direction to accelerate them. Therefore, the particles accelerate to a faster speed each time they pass between electrodes; there is little electric field inside the electrodes so the particles travel at a constant speed within each electrode.

The particles are injected at the right time so that the oscillating voltage differential between electrodes is maximum as the particles cross each gap. If the peak voltage applied between the electrodes is formula_6 volts, and the charge on each particle is formula_2 elementary charges, the particle gains an equal increment of energy of formula_8 electron volts when passing through each gap. Thus the output energy of the particles is 
:formula_9
electron volts, where formula_10 is the number of accelerating electrodes in the machine.

At speeds near the speed of light, the incremental velocity increase will be small, with the energy appearing as an increase in the mass of the particles. In portions of the accelerator where this occurs, the tubular electrode lengths will be almost constant. Additional magnetic or electrostatic lens elements may be included to ensure that the beam remains in the center of the pipe and its electrodes. Very long accelerators may maintain a precise alignment of their components through the use of servo systems guided by a laser beam.

== Concepts in development ==
Various new concepts are in development as of 2021. The primary goal is to make linear accelerators cheaper, with better focused beams, higher energy or higher beam current.

=== Induction linear accelerator ===
Induction linear accelerators use the electric field induced by a time-varying magnetic field for acceleration—like the betatron. The particle beam passes through a series of ring-shaped ferrite cores standing one behind the other, which are magnetized by high-current pulses, and in turn each generate an electrical field strength pulse along the axis of the beam direction. Induction linear accelerators are considered for short high current pulses from electrons but also from heavy ions. The concept goes back to the work of Nicholas Christofilos. Its realization is highly dependent on progress in the development of more suitable ferrite materials. With electrons, pulse currents of up to 5 kiloamps at energies up to 5 MeV and pulse durations in the range of 20 to 300 nanoseconds were achieved.

=== Energy recovery linac ===
In previous electron linear accelerators, the accelerated particles are used only once and then fed into an absorber &quot;(beam dump)&quot;, in which their residual energy is converted into heat. In an energy recovery linac (ERL), the accelerated in resonators and, for example, in undulators. The electrons used are fed back through the accelerator, out of phase by 180 degrees. They therefore pass through the resonators in the decelerating phase and thus return their remaining energy to the field. The concept is comparable to the hybrid drive of motor vehicles, where the kinetic energy released during braking is made available for the next acceleration by charging a battery.

The Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin with the project &quot;bERLinPro&quot; reported on corresponding development work. The Berlin experimental accelerator uses superconducting niobium cavity resonators. In 2014, three free-electron lasers based on ERLs were in operation worldwide: in the Jefferson Lab (US), in the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Russia) and at JAEA (Japan). At the University of Mainz, an ERL called MESA is expected to begin operation in 2024.
=== Compact Linear Collider ===
The concept of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) (original name CERN Linear Collider, with the same abbreviation) for electrons and positrons provides a traveling wave accelerator for energies of the order of 1 tera-electron volt (TeV). Instead of the otherwise necessary numerous klystron amplifiers to generate the acceleration power, a second parallel electron linear accelerator of lower energy is to be used, which works with superconducting cavities in which standing waves are formed. High-frequency power is extracted from it at regular intervals and transmitted to the main accelerator. In this way, the very high acceleration field strength of 80 MV / m should be achieved.

=== Kielfeld accelerator (plasma accelerator) ===
In cavity resonators, the dielectric strength limits the maximum acceleration that can be achieved within a certain distance. This limit can be circumvented using accelerated waves in plasma to generate the accelerating field in Kielfeld accelerators: A laser or particle beam excites an oscillation in a plasma, which is associated with very strong electric field strengths. This means that significantly (factors of 100s to 1000s ) more compact linear accelerators can possibly be built. Experiments involving high power lasers in metal vapour plasmas suggest that a beam line length reduction from some tens of metres to a few cm is quite possible.

===Compact medical accelerators ===
The LIGHT program (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy) hopes to create a design capable of accelerating protons to 200MeV or so for medical use over a distance of a few tens of metres, by optimising and nesting existing accelerator techniques The current design (2020) uses the highest practical bunch frequency (currently ~ 3 GHz) for a Radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) stage from injection at 50kVdC to ~5MeV bunches, a Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac (SCDTL) to accelerate from 5Mev to ~ 40MeV and a Cell Coupled Linac (CCL) stage final, taking the output to 200-230MeV. Each stage is optimised to allow close coupling and synchronous operation during the beam energy build-up.
The project aim is to make proton therapy a more accessible mainstream medicine as an alternative to existing radio therapy.

== Modern concepts ==
The higher the frequency of the acceleration voltage selected, the more individual acceleration thrusts per path length a particle of a given speed experiences, and the shorter the accelerator can therefore be overall. That is why accelerator technology developed in the pursuit of higher particle energies, especially towards higher frequencies.

The linear accelerator concepts (often called accelerator structures in technical terms) that have been used since around 1950 work with frequencies in the range from around to a few gigahertz (GHz) and use the electric field component of electromagnetic waves.

=== Standing waves and traveling waves ===
When it comes to energies of more than a few MeV, accelerators for ions are different from those for electrons. The reason for this is the large mass difference between the particles. Electrons are already close to the speed of light, the absolute speed limit, at a few MeV; with further acceleration, as described by relativistic mechanics, almost only their energy and momentum increase. On the other hand, with ions of this energy range, the speed also increases significantly due to further acceleration.

The acceleration concepts used today for &quot;ions&quot; are always based on electromagnetic standing waves that are formed in suitable resonators. Depending on the type of particle, energy range and other parameters, very different types of resonators are used; the following sections only cover some of them. &quot;Electrons&quot; can also be accelerated with standing waves above a few MeV. An advantageous alternative here, however, is a progressive wave, a traveling wave. The phase velocity the traveling wave must be roughly equal to the particle speed. Therefore, this technique is only suitable when the particles are almost at the speed of light, so that their speed only increases very little.

The development of high-frequency oscillators and power amplifiers from the 1940s, especially the klystron, was essential for these two acceleration techniques . The first larger linear accelerator with standing waves - for protons - was built in 1945/46 in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under the direction of Luis W. Alvarez. The frequency used was .  The first electron accelerator with traveling waves of around was developed a little later at Stanford University by W.W. Hansen and colleagues. 

In the two diagrams, the curve and arrows indicate the force acting on the particles. Only at the points with the correct direction of the electric field vector, i.e. the correct direction of force, can particles absorb energy from the wave. (An increase in speed cannot be seen in the scale of these images.)

==Advantages==

The linear accelerator could produce higher particle energies than the previous electrostatic particle accelerators (the Cockcroft–Walton accelerator and Van de Graaff generator) that were in use when it was invented. In these machines, the particles were only accelerated once by the applied voltage, so the particle energy in electron volts was equal to the accelerating voltage on the machine, which was limited to a few million volts by insulation breakdown. In the linac, the particles are accelerated multiple times by the applied voltage, so the particle energy is not limited by the accelerating voltage.

High power linacs are also being developed for production of electrons at relativistic speeds, required since fast electrons traveling in an arc will lose energy through synchrotron radiation; this limits the maximum power that can be imparted to electrons in a synchrotron of given size. Linacs are also capable of prodigious output, producing a nearly continuous stream of particles, whereas a synchrotron will only periodically raise the particles to sufficient energy to merit a &quot;shot&quot; at the target. (The burst can be held or stored in the ring at energy to give the experimental electronics time to work, but the average output current is still limited.) The high density of the output makes the linac particularly attractive for use in loading storage ring facilities with particles in preparation for particle to particle collisions. The high mass output also makes the device practical for the production of antimatter particles, which are generally difficult to obtain, being only a small fraction of a target&#x27;s collision products. These may then be stored and further used to study matter-antimatter annihilation.

===Medical linacs===

Linac-based radiation therapy for cancer treatment began with the first patient treated in 1953 in London, UK, at the Hammersmith Hospital, with an 8 MV machine built by Metropolitan-Vickers and installed in 1952, as the first dedicated medical linac. A short while later in 1954, a 6 MV linac was installed in Stanford, USA, which began treatments in 1956.

Medical linear accelerators accelerate electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, in which the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines tend to have a horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25 MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (&gt;18 MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).

In 2019 a Little Linac model kit, containing 82 building blocks, was developed for children undergoing radiotherapy treatment for cancer. The hope is that building the model will alleviate some of the stress experienced by the child before undergoing treatment by helping them to understand what the treatment entails. The kit was developed by Professor David Brettle, Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) in collaboration with manufacturers Best-Lock Ltd. The model can be seen at the Science Museum, London.

==Application for medical isotope development==
The expected shortages of Mo-99, and the technetium-99m medical isotope obtained from it, have also shed light onto linear accelerator technology to produce Mo-99 from non-enriched Uranium through neutron bombardment. This would enable the medical isotope industry to manufacture this crucial isotope by a sub-critical process. The aging facilities, for example the Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada, which still now produce most Mo-99 from highly enriched uranium could be replaced by this new process. In this way, the sub-critical loading of soluble uranium salts in heavy water with subsequent photo neutron bombardment and extraction of the target product, Mo-99, will be achieved.

==Disadvantages==

*The device length limits the locations where one may be placed.
*A great number of driver devices and their associated power supplies are required, increasing the construction and maintenance expense of this portion.
*If the walls of the accelerating cavities are made of normally conducting material and the accelerating fields are large, the wall resistivity converts electric energy into heat quickly. On the other hand, superconductors also need constant cooling to keep them below their critical temperature, and the accelerating fields are limited by quenches. Therefore, high energy accelerators such as SLAC, still the longest in the world (in its various generations), are run in short pulses, limiting the average current output and forcing the experimental detectors to handle data coming in short bursts.

<doc id="273528" wikidata="Q7690972" url="?curid=273528" title="Te Ruki Kawiti">
<text>Te Ruki Kawiti (1770s – 5 May 1854) was a prominent Māori rangatira (chief). He and Hōne Heke successfully fought the British in the Flagstaff War in 1845–46.

He traced descent from Rāhiri and Nukutawhiti of the &quot;Ngātokimatawhaorua&quot; canoe, the ancestors of the Ngāpuhi. He was born in the north of New Zealand into the Ngāti Hine hapū, one of the subtribes of the Ngāpuhi. From his youth he was trained in leadership and warfare by Hongi Hika. He was present at the Battle of Moremonui in 1807 or 1808 when many Ngāpuhi were slaughtered by Ngāti Whātua, despite the former having a few muskets. Almost twenty years later, in 1825, he was at the Battle of Te Ika-a-ranga-nui when it was Ngāpuhi&#x27;s turn to slaughter Ngāti Whātua in an act of &quot;utu&quot;, or revenge. He took a number of Ngāti Whātua captive and refused to hand them over to Hongi Hika, preferring instead to return them to their own people to whom he was related.

==Treaty of Waitangi==

Kawiti initially refused to sign the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, believing that it would inevitably lead to further European encroachment and the loss of Māori land. However he eventually yielded to pressure from his own people and signed the treaty in May 1840, right at the top, above those chiefs who had signed earlier.

However he soon grew disenchanted with British law and supported Hōne Heke in his protests against British rule. Hōne Heke sought support from Kawiti and other leaders of the Ngāpuhi iwi by the conveying of ‘te ngākau’, the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.

==Battle of Kororāreka==

Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti worked out the plan to draw the Colonial forces into battle, with the opening provocations focusing on the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end Kororāreka. When in March 1845 Heke cut down the flag pole at Kororāreka for the fourth time, thereby initiating the Flagstaff War, Kawiti, now in his seventies, created a diversion by attacking the town.

The Māori warriors followed their chief and would fight in separate groups; however Kawiti and Heke coordinated their tactics at each battle. The conduct of the Flagstaff War appears to follow a strategy of drawing the Colonial forces into attacking a fortified pā, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire. Kawiti was the senior rangatira and appears to have had a key role in the strategic decisions as to the design of the strengthened defences of Pene Taui&#x27;s pā at Ōhaeawai and the design and construction of the new pā that was built at Ruapekapeka to engage the British forces.

== Battle of the sticks ==
After the Battle of Kororāreka, Heke and Kawiti and the warriors travelled inland to Lake Ōmāpere near to Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Tamati Waka Nene built a pā close to Lake Ōmāpere. Heke&#x27;s pā named Puketutu, was away, while it is sometimes named as &quot;Te Mawhe&quot; however the hill of that name is some distance to the north-east. In April 1845, during the time that the colonial forces were gathering in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu that was between the two pās and on open country between Ōkaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke&#x27;s force numbered about 300 men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another 150 warriors. Among Kawiti&#x27;s supporters was his nephew Reweti Maika. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about 400 warriors that supported Tamati Waka Nene including the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his son Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi, and Nōpera Panakareao.

==Attack on Heke&#x27;s Pā at Puketutu==
The first major engagement of the Flagstaff War was the attack on Heke&#x27;s Pā at Puketutu in May 1845 by the colonial forces led by Lt Col William Hulme. While Heke occupied the pā itself, Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. They successfully prevented the Colonial forces from launching a coordinated attack on the pā but at quite a heavy cost in casualties. The Colonial forces were unable to overcome the defences of the pā and retreated back to the Bay of Islands.

==Battle of Te Ahuahu==
The next major engagement was the Battle of Te Ahuahu. The contemporary European accounts of the battle describe it as being fought on 12 June 1845 near Te Ahuahu and that it involved only the warriors of Hōne Heke fighting the warriors of Tāmati Wāka Nene. However, there are no detailed accounts of the action; Hugh Carleton (1874) mentions

Thomas Walker was a name adopted by Tāmati Wāka Nene. In this battle Nene&#x27;s warriors carried the day. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. On this account of the early engagements of the Flagstaff War, Kawiti appears to have made the better strategic decisions as to which battles to fight and which not to.

==Battle of Ōhaeawai==
A debate occurred between Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to the request to fortify Pene Taui&#x27;s pā at Ōhaeawai.

The Colonial forces arrived before the Ōhaeawai Pā on 23 June and established a camp about away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu) they built a four gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day the guns were brought to within of the pā. The bombardment continued for another two days but still did very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade but the main fault was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences.

After two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Lieutenant Colonel Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene&#x27;s colours – the Union Flag. The Union Flag was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak). This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult to the Union Jack, Despard ordered an assault upon the pā the same day. The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour. The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured.

==Battle of Ruapekapeka==
Towards the end of 1845 the British launched a major expedition against Kawiti&#x27;s new pā at Ruapekapeka. It took two weeks to bring the heavy guns into range of the pā, they started the cannon bombardment on 27 December 1845. The siege continued for some two weeks with enough patrols and probes from the pā to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846, William Walker Turau, the brother of Eruera Maihi Patuone, discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle.

The reason why the defenders appeared to have abandoned but then re-entered the pā is the subject of continuing debate. It was later suggested that most of the Māori had been at church, many of them were devout Christians. Knowing that their opponents, the British, were also Christians they had not expected an attack on a Sunday.

It was Māori custom that the place of a battle where blood was spilt became tapu so that the Ngāpuhi left Ruapekapeka Pā. After the battle Kawiti and his warriors, carrying their dead, travelled some four miles north-west to Waiomio, the ancestral home of the Ngāti Hine. After the battle of Ruapekapeka Kawiti expressed the will to continue to fight, however Kawiti and Heke made it known that they would end the rebellion if the Colonial forces would leave the Ngāpuhi land.Tāmati Wāka Nene acted as the intermediary in the negotiations, with Nene persuading the Governor to accept the terms of Kawiti and Heke – that they were to be unconditionally pardoned for their rebellion.

==Aftermath of the Flagstaff War==
After the conclusion of the Flagstaff War Kawiti went to live near Henry Williams at Pakaraka, and was baptised by Williams in 1853. He succumbed to measles on 5 May 1854 at Otaikumikumi, close to Waiomio which is south of Kawakawa. The meeting house and marae complex at Waiomio Caves are his memorial.

==Legacy of Kawiti and the fifth flagpole at Kororāreka==
At the conclusion of the Flagstaff War, the Hokianga and the Bay of Islands region was nominally under British influence; the fact that the government&#x27;s flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant. Such significance was not lost on Henry Williams, who, writing to E. G. Marsh on 28 May 1846, stated that &quot;the flag-staff in the Bay is still prostrate, and the natives here rule. These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name.&quot;

Some argue that the Flagstaff War can be considered an inconclusive stalemate, as both sides wished the war to end, both gained somewhat from the fighting, and the situation more or less remained the same as it was before the outbreak of hostilities. The opinion of Henry Williams, who had counseled Kawiti to abandon the rebellion, was that the Ngāpuhi and the colonial government both agreed that each should let the other alone, so that Kawiti achieved peace on his terms. Henry Williams wrote to his son-in-law Hugh Carleton on 13 March 1854 in response to an earlier comment by Carleton as to the consequences of Kawiti having made peace with Governor Grey:

Upon the death of Kawiti, his son Maihi Paraone Kawiti, who had been a missionary teacher at Mangakahia, succeeded Kawiti as leader of the Ngāti Hine hapū. Maihi Paraone Kawiti was a supporter of te ture (the law) and te whakapono (the gospel). Deputations came to Maihi Paraone Kawiti from the Taranaki and Waikato iwi asking the Ngāpuhi to join the Māori King Movement; the reply from Maihi Paraone Kawiti was that the Ngāpuhi had no desire for a ‘Māori Kingi’ as ‘Kuini Wikitoria’ was their ‘Kingi&#x27;.

Maihi Paraone Kawiti, as a signal to Governor Thomas Gore Browne that he did not follow his father&#x27;s path, arranged for the fifth flagpole to be erected at Kororāreka; this occurred in January 1858 with the flag being named Whakakotahitanga, &quot;being at one with the Queen.&quot; As a further symbolic act, the 400 Ngāpuhi warriors involved in preparing and erecting the flagpole were selected from the ‘rebel’ forces of Kawiti and Heke – that is, Ngāpuhi from the hapū of Tāmati Wāka Nene (who had fought as allies of the British forces during the Flagstaff War), observed, but did not participate in the erection of the fifth flagpole. The restoration of the flagpole was presented by Maihi Paraone Kawiti as a voluntary act on the part of the Ngāpuhi that had cut it down in 1845, and they would not allow any other to render any assistance in this work.

The legacy of Kawiti&#x27;s rebellion during the Flagstaff War was that during the time of Governor Grey and Governor Thomas Gore Browne, the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of opinions of the Ngāpuhi before taking actions in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. The continuing symbolism of the fifth flagpole at Kororāreka is that it exists because of the goodwill of the Ngāpuhi.

<doc id="273529" wikidata="Q1468751" url="?curid=273529" title="Parody mass">
<text>A parody mass is a musical setting of the mass, typically from the 16th century, that uses multiple voices of a pre-existing piece of music, such as a fragment of a motet or a secular &quot;chanson&quot;, as part of its melodic material. It is distinguished from the two other most prominent types of mass composition during the Renaissance, the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; and the paraphrase mass.

==Etymology==
In the sense considered here, the term &quot;parody mass&quot; applies to masses where a polyphonic fragment from another work is used as the basis of a new composition. The term imitation mass has been suggested instead of &quot;parody mass&quot;, as being both more precise and closer to the original usage, since the term &quot;parody&quot; is based on a misreading of a late 16th-century text. In contradistinction, masses which incorporated only a single voice of the polyphonic source, treated not as a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; (&#x27;Tenor Mass&#x27;) but elaborated and moving between different parts, are referred to by writers on musical theory as paraphrase masses. Other compositional techniques provided the basis for the cyclic mass, canon mass, and soggetto cavato. 

The modern English word &#x27;parody&#x27; derives from &#x27;parody&#x27;, from , &#x27;burlesque song or poem&#x27;, from &#x27;beside, parallel to&#x27; (in this case, &quot;mock-&quot;) + &#x27;song, or ode&quot;.
See also A. , the first ode sung by the chorus after its entrance in the ancient Greek drama.

In the case of masses, &quot;parody&quot; has almost nothing to do with humor or ridicule, as understood in the modern definition of the word; while in some cases bawdy secular songs were indeed used in composition of masses, equally often non-liturgical sacred music such as motets formed the basis for parody masses.

==History==
The parody or imitation mass was a very popular model during the Renaissance: Palestrina alone wrote some 50-odd examples, and by the first half of the 16th century this style was the dominant form. The Council of Trent, in a document dated 10 September 1562, banned the use of secular material, &quot;...let nothing profane be intermingled ... banish from church all music which contains, whether in the singing or the organ playing, things that are lascivious or impure.&quot; The proposed reforms were most carefully followed only in Italy; in France, a change in taste had already brought about many of the wishes of the members of the council, and in Germany they were largely ignored.

Parody techniques include adding or removing voices from the original piece, adding fragments of new material, or only using the fragment at the beginning of every part of the mass. In his colossal 22-volume &quot;El melopeo y maestro&quot; of 1613, Italian music theorist Pietro Cerone gave some general guidelines for writing a parody mass: each of the main sections of the mass should start with the beginning of the source; the interior section of the Kyrie should use a secondary motive; and some portions, for example the second and third Agnus Dei, should not be chained to the model but be freely composed. He also recommended using as many subsidiary musical ideas from the model as possible.

Some examples of early parody masses include the &quot;Missa Mater Patris&quot;, &quot;Missa Malheur me bat&quot;, and &quot;Missa Fortuna desperata&quot; of Josquin des Prez, and the &quot;Missa de Dringhs&quot; by Antoine Brumel. The &quot;Missa Mater Patris&quot; by des Prez is considered to be the first true parody mass as it does not include a structural &quot;cantus firmus&quot;. By the middle of the 16th century, a high percentage of all masses composed used the parody technique.

<text>The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) is the largest trade association of electrical equipment manufacturers in the United States. Founded in 1926, it advocates for the industry and publishes standards for electrical products. Notably, the form of US household electrical outlets and plugs is specified by NEMA.

==Description==
It was founded in 1926 and maintains its headquarters in Rosslyn, Virginia, in the Washington metropolitan area. Its approximately 350 member companies manufacture products used in the generation, transmission, distribution, control, and end use of electricity. These products are used in utility, industrial, commercial, institutional, and residential applications. The association&#x27;s Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance (MITA) division represents manufacturers of cutting-edge medical diagnostic imaging equipment including MRI, CT, x-ray, and ultrasound products. Other major end markets include building systems, electrical infrastructure, industrial systems, lighting systems and utility systems. Their combined industries account for 360,000 American jobs in more than 7,000 facilities in every state. Their industry produces $106 billion shipments of electrical equipment and medical imaging technologies per year with $36 billion exports. NEMA also has offices in Mexico City.

In addition to lobbying activities, NEMA has published nearly 1,000 electrical and medical imaging standards, application guides, white papers, and technical papers. Among its major standards are those for electrical enclosures, motors and magnet wire, AC plugs and receptacles; the NEMA connectors are universal in North America and also used by some other countries.

<text>S-cedilla (majuscule: Ş, minuscule: ş) is a letter used in some of the Turkic languages. It occurs in the Azerbaijani, Gagauz, Turkish, and Turkmen alphabets. It is also planned to be in the Latin-based Kazakh alphabet.
It is used in Brahui, Chechen, Crimean Tatar, Kurdish, and Tatar as well, when they are written in the Latin alphabet.

It commonly represents /ʃ/, the voiceless postalveolar fricative (like &quot;sh&quot; in &quot;shoe&quot;).

It is written as the letter S with a cedilla below and it has both the lower-case (U+015F) and the upper-case variants (U+15E).

== Romanian ==

In early versions of Unicode, the Romanian letter Ș (S-comma) was considered a glyph variant of Ş, and therefore was not present in the Unicode Standard. It is also not present in the Windows 1250 (Central Europe) code page. The letter was only added to the standard in Unicode 3.0, and some texts in Romanian still use Ş instead.

<doc id="273535" wikidata="Q2126444" url="?curid=273535" title="Radionuclide therapy">
<text>Radionuclide therapy (RNT, also known as unsealed source radiotherapy or molecular radiotherapy) uses radioactive substances called radiopharmaceuticals to treat medical conditions, particularly cancer. These are introduced into the body by various means (injection or ingestion are the two most commonplace) and localise to specific locations, organs or tissues depending on their properties and administration routes. This includes anything from a simple compound such as sodium iodide that locates to the thyroid via trapping the iodide ion, to complex biopharmaceuticals such as recombinant antibodies which are attached to radionuclides and seek out specific antigens on cell surfaces.

This is a type of targeted therapy which uses the physical, chemical and biological properties of the radiopharmaceutical to target areas of the body for radiation treatment. The related diagnostic modality of nuclear medicine employs the same principles but uses different types or quantities of radiopharmaceuticals in order to image or analyse functional systems within the patient.

RNT contrasts with sealed-source therapy (brachytherapy) where the radionuclide remains in a capsule or metal wire during treatment and needs to be physically placed precisely at the treatment position.

When the radionuclides are ligands (such as with Lutathera and Pluvicto), the technique is also known as radioligand therapy.
==Clinical use==
===Thyroid conditions===

Iodine-131 (131I) is the most common RNT worldwide and uses the simple compound sodium iodide with a radioactive isotope of iodine. The patient (human or animal) may ingest an oral solid or liquid amount or receive an intravenous injection of a solution of the compound. The iodide ion is selectively taken up by the thyroid gland. Both benign conditions like thyrotoxicosis and certain malignant conditions like papillary thyroid cancer can be treated with the radiation emitted by radioiodine. Iodine-131 produces beta and gamma radiation. The beta radiation released damages both normal thyroid tissue and any thyroid cancer that behaves like normal thyroid in taking up iodine, so providing the therapeutic effect, whilst most of the gamma radiation escapes the patient&#x27;s body.

Most of the iodine not taken up by thyroid tissue is excreted through the kidneys into the urine. After radioiodine treatment the urine will be radioactive or &#x27;hot&#x27;, and the patients themselves will also emit gamma radiation. Depending on the amount of radioactivity administered, it can take several days for the radioactivity to reduce to the point where the patient does not pose a radiation hazard to bystanders. Patients are often treated as inpatients and there are international guidelines, as well as legislation in many countries, which govern the point at which they may return home.

===Bone metastasis===

Radium-223 chloride, strontium-89 chloride and samarium-153 EDTMP are used to treat secondary cancer in the bones. Radium and strontium mimic calcium in the body. Samarium is bound to tetraphosphate EDTMP, phosphates are taken up by osteoblastic (bone forming) repairs that occur adjacent to some metastatic lesions.

===Bone marrow conditions===
Beta emitting phosphorus-32 (32P), as sodium phosphate, is used to treat overactive bone marrow, in which it is otherwise naturally metabolised.

===Joint inflammation===
====Yttrium-90 colloid====
An yttrium-90 (90Y) colloidal suspension is used for radiosynovectomy in the knee joint.

===Liver tumours===
====Yttrium-90 spheres====

90Y in the form of a resin or glass spheres can be used to treat primary and metastatic liver cancers.

===Neuroendocrine tumours===
====Iodine-131 mIBG====
131I-mIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) is used for the treatment of phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma.

====Lutetium-177====

177Lu is bound with a DOTA chelator to target neuroendocrine tumours.

==Experimental antibody based methods==

At the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) work is being done on alpha-immunotherapy, this is an experimental method where antibodies bearing alpha isotopes are used. Bismuth-213 is one of the isotopes which has been used. This is made by the alpha decay of actinium-225. The generation of one short-lived isotope from longer lived isotope is a useful method of providing a portable supply of a short-lived isotope. This is similar to the generation of technetium-99m by a technetium generator. The actinium-225 is made by the irradiation of radium-226 with a cyclotron.

<doc id="273537" wikidata="Q5376957" url="?curid=273537" title="Energy Orchard">
<text>Energy Orchard were a guitar-based rock band of the late 1980s and early 1990s, from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Fronted by Bap Kennedy (brother of singer-songwriter Brian Kennedy), their style drew heavily on the influence of Van Morrison and other rhythm and blues acts, but incorporated traditional elements of Irish folk music. The band emerged from the remnants of one other Belfast-based punk/new wave band, 10 Past 7.

== Career ==
Following the band&#x27;s early concerts at the New Pegasus they were signed to MCA on the recommendation of Steve Earle.

The band consisted of:
* Bap Kennedy (lead vocals)
* Paul Toner (lead guitar)
* David Toner (percussion)
* Spade McQuade (rhythm guitar/mandolin/vocals)
* Joby Fox (bass guitar)
* Kevin Breslin (keyboards)

Whilst the majority of the songs were written by Kennedy, it was Fox that wrote their biggest hit, &quot;Belfast&quot;. But following personal problems Fox left to be replaced for a short time initially by Michael Kelpie and then Steve Lawrence. Following another re-jig McQuade switched to bass, in what would become the final line up until the band parted in 1997.

Their debut single, &quot;Belfast&quot; was their most successful song, and reached 52 in the UK Singles Chart, and featured on &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The 1990 follow-up was &quot;Sailortown&quot;. The first album, &quot;Energy Orchard&quot;, was released to some critical appreciation. Subsequent albums included the 1992 release &quot;Stop the Machine&quot;, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Shinola&quot; (released on Essential Records), &quot;Pain Killer&quot; (1995) and the 1996 live album, &quot;Orchardville&quot;.

Despite extensive touring, the breakthrough to mainstream success eluded them. The band having completed their recording contract with Castle Communications in 1996 disbanded. The split up saw Kennedy go on to launch a successful solo career (his first album saw a renewed partnership with Steve Earle), whilst McQuade and Breslin relocated to Jacksonville, Florida. Whilst there they played together in local band Celtic Soul, prior to McQuade launching his own group Spade McQuade and the Allstars.

Both Paul and David Toner left the music industry with Paul reading Law at Queens University, Belfast, and David for a time moving to Sweden to teach English.

With Stan Lynch from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Jim DeVito, Kevin Breslin formed Buffalo Diamond and recorded The Things You Do released in November 2005.

<text>Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy where a sealed radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. The word &quot;brachytherapy&quot; comes from the Greek word , meaning &quot;short-distance&quot; or &quot;short&quot;. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, esophageal and skin cancer and can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites. Treatment results have demonstrated that the cancer-cure rates of brachytherapy are either comparable to surgery and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or are improved when used in combination with these techniques. Brachytherapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies such as surgery, EBRT and chemotherapy.

Brachytherapy contrasts with unsealed source radiotherapy, in which a therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes, iodine-125 or caesium-131 for instance) directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place.

A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.

A course of brachytherapy can be completed in less time than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.

The global market for brachytherapy reached US$680 million in 2013, of which the high-dose rate (HDR) and LDR segments accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic brachytherapy comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the brachytherapy market may reach over US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic brachytherapy, which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a user-friendly technology.
==Medical uses==

Brachytherapy is commonly used to treat cancers of the cervix, prostate, breast, and skin.

Brachytherapy can also be used in the treatment of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.

As the radiation sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high dose of radiation to be applied to a small area. Furthermore, because the radiation sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.

The use of HDR brachytherapy enables overall treatment times to be reduced compared with EBRT.
Patients receiving brachytherapy generally have to make fewer visits for radiotherapy compared with EBRT, and overall radiotherapy treatment plans can be completed in less time.
Many brachytherapy procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience may be particularly relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, to ensure that they have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.

Brachytherapy can be used with the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally advanced tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.
However, in locally advanced tumours, surgery may not routinely provide the best chance of cure and is often not technically feasible to perform. In these cases radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure.
In more advanced disease stages, brachytherapy can be used as palliative treatment for symptom relief from pain and bleeding.

In cases where the tumour is not easily accessible or is too large to ensure an optimal distribution of irradiation to the treatment area, brachytherapy can be combined with other treatments, such as EBRT and/or surgery. Combination therapy of brachytherapy exclusively with chemotherapy is rare.

===Cervical cancer===
Brachytherapy is commonly used in the treatment of early or locally confined cervical cancer and is a standard of care in many countries.
Cervical cancer can be treated with either LDR, PDR or HDR brachytherapy.
Used in combination with EBRT, brachytherapy can provide better outcomes than EBRT alone.
The precision of brachytherapy enables a high dose of targeted radiation to be delivered to the cervix, while minimising radiation exposure to adjacent tissues and organs.

The chances of staying free of disease (disease-free survival) and of staying alive (overall survival) are similar for LDR, PDR and HDR treatments.
However, a key advantage of HDR treatment is that each dose can be delivered on an outpatient basis with a short administration time providing greater convenience for many patients.

Research shows locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix must be treated with a combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and intracavity brachytherapy (ICBT).

===Prostate cancer===
Brachytherapy to treat prostate cancer can be given either as permanent LDR seed implantation or as temporary HDR brachytherapy.

Permanent seed implantation is suitable for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and has been shown to be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence. The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after one to two days.
Permanent seed implantation is often a less invasive treatment option compared to the surgical removal of the prostate.

Temporary HDR brachytherapy is a newer approach to treating prostate cancer, but is currently less common than seed implantation. It is predominantly used to provide an extra dose in addition to EBRT (known as &quot;boost&quot; therapy) as it offers an alternative method to deliver a high dose of radiation therapy that conforms to the shape of the tumour within the prostate, while sparing radiation exposure to surrounding tissues.
HDR brachytherapy as a boost for prostate cancer also means that the EBRT course can be shorter than when EBRT is used alone.

===Breast cancer===
Radiation therapy is standard of care for women who have undergone lumpectomy or mastectomy surgery, and is an integral component of breast-conserving therapy.
Brachytherapy can be used after surgery, before chemotherapy or palliatively in the case of advanced disease. Brachytherapy to treat breast cancer is usually performed with HDR temporary brachytherapy. Post surgery, breast brachytherapy can be used as a &quot;boost&quot; following whole breast irradiation (WBI) using EBRT.
More recently, brachytherapy alone is used to deliver APBI (accelerated partial breast irradiation), involving delivery of radiation to only the immediate region surrounding the original tumour.

The main benefit of breast brachytherapy compared to whole breast irradiation is that a high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs. APBI can typically be completed over the course of a week. The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).

There are five methods that can be used to deliver breast brachytherapy: Interstitial breast brachytherapy, Intracavitary breast brachytherapy, Intraoperative radiation therapy, Permanent Breast Seed Implantation and non-invasive breast brachytherapy using mammography for target localization and an HDR source.

====Interstitial breast brachytherapy====
Interstitial breast brachytherapy involves the temporary placement of several flexible plastic catheters in the breast tissue. These are carefully positioned to allow optimal targeting of radiation to the treatment area while sparing the surrounding breast tissue. The catheters are connected to an afterloader, which delivers the planned radiation dose to the treatment area. Interstitial breast brachytherapy can be used as &quot;boost&quot; after EBRT, or as APBI.

==== Intraoperative radiation therapy ====
Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) delivers radiation at the same time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.

====Intracavitary breast brachytherapy====
Intracavitary breast brachytherapy (also known as &quot;balloon brachytherapy&quot;) involves the placement of a single catheter into the breast cavity left after the removal of the tumour (lumpectomy). The catheter can be placed at the time of the lumpectomy or postoperatively. Via the catheter, a balloon is then inflated in the cavity. The catheter is then connected to an afterloader, which delivers the radiation dose through the catheter and into the balloon. Currently, intracavitary breast brachytherapy is only routinely used for APBI.

There are also devices that combine the features of interstitial and intracavitary breast brachytherapy (e.g. SAVI). These devices use multiple catheters but are inserted through a single-entry point in the breast. Studies suggest the use of multiple catheters enables physicians to target the radiation more precisely.

==== Permanent breast seed implantation ====
Permanent breast seed implantation (PBSI) implants many radioactive &quot;seeds&quot; (small pellets) into the breast in the area surrounding the site of the tumour, similar to permanent seed prostate brachytherapy. The seeds are implanted in a single 1–2 hour procedure and deliver radiation over the following months as the radioactive material inside them decays. Risk of radiation from the implants to others (e.g. partner/spouse) has been studied and found to be safe.

===Brain tumors===
Surgically Targeted Radiation Therapy (STaRT), branded as GammaTile Therapy, is a type of brachytherapy implant specifically designed for use inside the brain. GammaTile is FDA-cleared to treat newly diagnosed, operable malignant intracranial neoplasms (i.e., brain tumors) and operable recurrent intracranial neoplasms, including meningiomas, metastases, high-grade gliomas, and glioblastomas.

In a clinical study, GammaTile Therapy improved local tumor control compared to previous same-site treatments without an increased risk of side effects.

=== Esophageal cancer ===
For esophageal cancer radiation treatment, brachytherapy is one option for effective treatment, involves definitive radiotherapy (boost) or palliative treatments. Definitive radiotherapy (boost) can deliver the dose precisely and palliative treatments can be given to relieve dysphagia. The large diameter applicators or balloon type catheter are used with the afterloader to expand the esophagus and facilitate the delivery of radiation dose to tumor with sparing of nearby normal tissue.

Brachytherapy followed EBRT or surgery have been shown to improve the survival rate and local recurrent rate than EBRT or surgery only for esophageal cancer patients.

===Skin cancer===
HDR brachytherapy for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators can be used to ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.

Another type of brachytherapy which has similar advantages as the HDR is provided be the Rhenium-SCT (Skin Cancer Therapy). It makes use of the beta ray emissions of Rhenium-188 to treat basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas. the radiation source is enclosed in a compound which is applied to a thin protective foil directly over the lesion. This way the radiation source can be applied to complex locations and minimize radiation to healthy tissue.

Brachytherapy for skin cancer provides good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies with up to five years follow-up have shown that brachytherapy is highly effective in terms of local control, and is comparable to EBRT. Treatment times are typically short, providing convenience for patients.
It has been suggested that brachytherapy may become a standard of treatment for skin cancer in the near future.

===Blood vessels===
Brachytherapy can be used in the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis, in which a catheter is placed inside blood vessels, through which sources are inserted and removed.
In treating In-stent restenosis (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES) have been found to be superior to Intracoronary Brachytherapy (ICBT).
However, there is continued interest in vascular brachytherapy for persistent restenosis in failed stents and vein grafts.
The therapy has also been investigated for use in the treatment of peripheral vasculature stenosis and considered for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

==Side effects==
The likelihood and nature of potential acute, sub-acute or long-term side-effects associated with brachytherapy depends on the location of the tumour being treated and the type of brachytherapy being used.

===Acute===
Acute side effects associated with brachytherapy include localised bruising, swelling, bleeding, discharge or discomfort within the implanted region. These usually resolve within a few days following completion of treatment.
Patients may also feel fatigued for a short period following treatment.

Brachytherapy treatment for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary symptoms such as urinary retention, urinary incontinence or painful urination (dysuria).
Transient increased bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding may also occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over a matter of days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine.

Brachytherapy for skin cancer may result in a shedding of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.

Most of the acute side effects associated with brachytherapy can be treated with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT.

===Long-term===
In a small number of people, brachytherapy may cause long-term side effects due to damage or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term side effects are usually mild or moderate in nature. For example, urinary and digestive problems may persist as a result of brachytherapy for cervical or prostate cancer, and may require ongoing management.

Brachytherapy for prostate cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15–30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, the majority of cases can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.

Brachytherapy for breast or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the treatment area. In the case of breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur as a result of fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.

==Safety around others==
Patients often ask if they need to have special safety precautions around family and friends after receiving brachytherapy. If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.

If permanent brachytherapy is used, low dose radioactive sources (seeds) are left in the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimetres of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised not to hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women for a short time after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.

==Types==
Different types of brachytherapy can be defined according to (1) the placement of the radiation sources in the target treatment area, (2) the rate or &#x27;intensity&#x27; of the irradiation dose delivered to the tumour, and (3) the duration of dose delivery.

===Source placement===
The two main types of brachytherapy treatment in terms of the placement of the radioactive source are interstitial and contact.

In the case of interstitial brachytherapy, the sources are placed directly in the target tissue of the affected site, such as the prostate or breast.

Contact brachytherapy involves placement of the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary brachytherapy) such as the cervix, uterus or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal brachytherapy) such as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface brachytherapy) such as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (intravascular brachytherapy) for the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis.

===Dose rate===
The dose rate of brachytherapy refers to the level or &#x27;intensity&#x27; with which the radiation is delivered to the surrounding medium and is expressed in Grays per hour (Gy/h).

Low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy involves implanting radiation sources that emit radiation at a rate of up to 2 Gy·h−1. LDR brachytherapy is commonly used for cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, sarcomas and prostate cancer

Medium-dose rate (MDR) brachytherapy is characterized by a medium rate of dose delivery, ranging between 2 Gy·h−1 to 12 Gy·h−1.

High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is when the rate of dose delivery exceeds 12 Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR brachytherapy are in tumours of the cervix, esophagus, lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR treatments are performed on an outpatient basis, but this is dependent on the treatment site.

Pulsed-dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy involves short pulses of radiation, typically once an hour, to simulate the overall rate and effectiveness of LDR treatment. Typical tumour sites treated by PDR brachytherapy are gynaecological and head and neck cancers.
The calculation of radiation dose from radioactive seeds is crucial in the planning and administration of brachytherapy treatments. Most modern calculation are done using the formalism published by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. For the geometry in figure 1, this formalism uses five parameters.
*&quot;Strength of the source&quot;: How much radiation is being emitted by the seed, expressed as air kerma strength and denoted by formula_1.
*&quot;Dose rate of the source&quot;: How much dose the seed will deliver to the reference point over a certain period of time, denoted by formula_2.
*&quot;Geometry factor&quot;: How the shape of the seed will affect the dose at points away from the reference point, denoted by formula_3.
*&quot;Anisotropy function&quot;: How the much radiation will be stopped before passing out of the seed, denoted by formula_4.
*&quot;Radial dose function&quot;: How the radiation will interact with the material surrounding the seed, denoted by formula_5.
The equation which links these parameters is, formula_6

===Duration of dose delivery===

The placement of radiation sources in the target area can be temporary or permanent.

Temporary brachytherapy involves placement of radiation sources for a set duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes.

Permanent brachytherapy, also known as seed implantation, involves placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (about the size of a grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period of weeks or months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect. Permanent brachytherapy is most commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer.
==Procedure==
===Initial planning===
To accurately plan the brachytherapy procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed to understand the characteristics of the tumour. In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the tumour and its relation to surrounding tissues and organs. These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The data from many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the tumour and the surrounding tissues.

Using this information, a plan of the optimal distribution of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of applicator used will depend on the type of cancer being treated and the characteristics of the target tumour.

This initial planning helps to ensure that &#x27;cold spots&#x27; (too little irradiation) and &#x27;hot spots&#x27; (too much irradiation) are avoided during treatment, as these can respectively result in treatment failure and side-effects.

===Insertion===
Before radioactive sources can be delivered to the tumour site, the applicators have to be inserted and correctly positioned in line with the initial planning.

Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, fluoroscopy and ultrasound are typically used to help guide the placement of the applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning.

===Creation of a virtual patient===
The images of the patient with the applicators in situ are imported into treatment planning software and the patient is brought into a dedicated shielded room for treatment. The treatment planning software enables multiple 2D images of the treatment site to be translated into a 3D &#x27;virtual patient&#x27;, within which the position of the applicators can be defined. The spatial relationships between the applicators, the treatment site and the surrounding healthy tissues within this &#x27;virtual patient&#x27; are a copy of the relationships in the actual patient.
===Optimizing the irradiation plan===

To identify the optimal spatial and temporal distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation of the distribution of the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called &#x27;dose-painting&#x27;.

===Treatment delivery===
The radiation sources used for brachytherapy are always enclosed within a non-radioactive capsule. The sources can be delivered manually, but are more commonly delivered through a technique known as &#x27;afterloading&#x27;.

Manual delivery of brachytherapy is limited to a few LDR applications, due to risk of radiation exposure to clinical staff.

In contrast, afterloading involves the accurate positioning of non-radioactive applicators in the treatment site, which are subsequently loaded with the radiation sources. In manual afterloading, the source is delivered into the applicator by the operator.

Remote afterloading systems provide protection from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they are connected to an &#x27;afterloader&#x27; machine (containing the radioactive sources) through a series of connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.

On completion of delivery of the radioactive sources, the applicators are carefully removed from the body. Patients typically recover quickly from the brachytherapy procedure, enabling it to often be performed on an outpatient basis.
Between 2003 and 2012 in United States community hospitals, the rate of hospital stays with brachytherapy had a 24.4 percent average annual decrease among adults aged 45–64 years and a 27.3 percent average annual decrease among adults aged 65–84 years. Brachytherapy was the OR procedure with the greatest change in occurrence among hospital stays paid by Medicare and private insurance.

==Radiation sources==
Commonly used radiation sources (radionuclides) for brachytherapy include:

==History==
Brachytherapy dates back to 1901 (shortly after the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896) when Pierre Curie suggested to Henri-Alexandre Danlos that a radioactive source could be inserted into a tumour.
It was found that the radiation caused the tumour to shrink. Independently, Alexander Graham Bell also suggested the use of radiation in this way. In the early twentieth century, techniques for the application of brachytherapy were pioneered at the Curie institute in Paris by Danlos and at St Luke&#x27;s and Memorial Hospital in New York by Robert Abbe.

Working with the Curies in their radium research laboratory at the University of Paris, American physicist William Duane refined a technique for extracting radon-222 gas from radium sulfate solutions. Solutions containing 1 gram of radium were &quot;milked&quot; to create radon &quot;seeds&quot; of about 20 millicuries each. These &quot;seeds&quot; were distributed throughout Paris for use in an early form of brachytherapy named endocurietherapy. Duane perfected this &quot;milking&quot; technique during his time in Paris and referred to the device as a &quot;radium cow&quot;.

Duane returned to the United States in 1913 and worked in a joint role as assistant professor of physics at Harvard and Research Fellow in Physics of the Harvard Cancer Commission. The Cancer Commission was founded in 1901 and hired Duane to investigate the usage of radium emanations in the treatment of cancer. In 1915 he built Boston&#x27;s first &quot;radium cow&quot; and thousands of patients were treated with the radon-222 generated from it.

Interstitial radium therapy was common in the 1930s. Gold seeds filled with radon were used as early as 1942 until at least 1958. Gold shells were selected by Gino Failla around 1920 to shield beta rays while passing gamma rays. Cobalt needles were also used briefly after World War II. Radon and cobalt were replaced by radioactive tantalum and gold, before iridium rose in prominence. First used in 1958, iridium is the most commonly used artificial source for brachytherapy today.

Following initial interest in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use declined in the middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.

==Environmental hazard==
Due to the small size of brachytherapy sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some of these have escaped into the environment to become orphaned sources. A radium needle was found in a Prague playground in 2011, radiating 500 μSv/h from one metre away.

<text>Ğ (g with breve; minuscule: ğ) is a Latin letter found in the Turkish and Azerbaijani alphabets as well as the Latin alphabets of Zazaki, Laz, Crimean Tatar, Tatar, and Kazakh. It traditionally represented the voiced velar fricative or the voiced uvular fricative . However, in Turkish, the phoneme has in most cases been reduced to a silent letter, serving as a vowel-lengthener. In Dobrujan Tatar it represents the voiced palato-alveolar affricate .

== Turkish use ==

=== Current use ===
In Turkish, the is known as (; &#x27;soft g&#x27;) and is the ninth letter of the Turkish alphabet. It always follows a vowel, and can be compared to the (&#x27;soft g&#x27;) in Danish. In modern Turkish, the letter has no sound of its own and serves as a transition between two vowels, since they do not occur consecutively in native Turkish words. (In loanwords they may sometimes be separated by a glottal stop, e.g. or , which may be pronounced as either or .)

The realization of the phoneme depends on its location in a word and the surrounding vowels:
* in word-final and syllable-final positions it lengthens the preceding vowel, for example: (&#x27;mountain[s]&#x27;), (&#x27;shallow&#x27;); when following a front vowel (&quot;e, i&quot;), it may sound instead: (&#x27;cane&#x27;);
* between identical back vowels (&quot;a, ı, u&quot;) it is silent: (&#x27;shelter&#x27;), (&#x27;good luck&#x27;);
* between identical front vowels (&quot;e, i, ü&quot;) it is either silent: (&#x27;that I love&#x27;), or pronounced : (&#x27;wedding&#x27;);
* between different rounded vowels (&quot;o, u, ö, ü&quot;), or between rounded (&quot;o, u, ö, ü&quot;) and unrounded (&quot;a, e&quot;) vowels it is mostly silent, but may be a bilabial glide: (&#x27;cold&#x27;), (&#x27;onion&#x27;); 
* &quot;ağı&quot; may sound as two vowels or as long &quot;a&quot;: (&#x27;heavy&#x27;);
* &quot;ığa&quot; is always two vowels: (&#x27;which fits&#x27;);
* in &quot;eği&quot; and &quot;iğe&quot; it is either silent or pronounced as if written &quot;y&quot;: (&#x27;not&#x27;), (&#x27;other&#x27;); in colloquial speech &quot;eği&quot; is long &quot;i&quot;: ;
* &quot;eği&quot; and &quot;ağı&quot; in the future suffix -&quot;(y)AcAK&quot;- are formally / or colloquially /: (&#x27;I will love&#x27;); (&#x27;I will write&#x27;).

Some webpages may use (uppercase) and (lowercase) for because of improper encoding; see for the reasons of this.

=== Historical use ===
The letter, and its counterpart in the Ottoman Turkish alphabet, , were once pronounced as a consonant, , the voiced velar fricative, until very recently in the history of Turkish, but it has undergone a sound change by which the consonant was completely lost and compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel occurred, hence its function today. The sound change is not yet complete in some Turkish dialects. The previous consonantal nature of the sound is evinced by earlier English loanwords from Turkish, such as &quot;yogurt&quot;/&quot;yoghurt&quot; (modern Turkish ) and &quot;agha&quot; (modern Turkish ), and the corresponding velar fricative found in cognate words in the closely related Azerbaijani language and the Turkish-influenced Crimean Tatar language. In Old Turkic (as well as earlier during Proto-Turkic times), this voiced velar fricative originated as an allophone of , the voiced velar stop, when it occurred intervocalically. The expected process of lenition (weakening and eventual loss of the intervocalic Proto-Turkic consonant *) is thus complete in Turkish and underway in many other Common Turkic languages.

==Azerbaijani and Crimean Tatar use==
In Azerbaijani and Crimean Tatar, represents , the voiced velar fricative. In Azerbaijani, ğ never occurs at the beginning of a word.

== Tatar use ==
The Turkic Tatar language is written mostly in Cyrillic, but a Latin-based alphabet is also in use. In the Latin alphabet, ğ represents , the voiced uvular fricative. In Cyrillic, Tatar uses г for both g and ğ without distinction.

Tatar ğ / г is the Arabic ghayn غ. In Arabic words and names where there’s an ayin ع, Tatar adds the ghayn instead (عبد الله, ʻ&quot;Abd Allāh, ’Abdullah;&quot; Tatar: Ğabdulla&quot;,&quot; Габдулла; Yaña imlâ: غابدوللا /ʁabdulla/).

In the Mishar Tatar Dialect, ğ is not pronounced, and thus, a word like &quot;şiğır&quot; (شعر, шигыр, &quot;poem&quot;) is &quot;şigır&quot; or &quot;şiyır&quot; for Mishars (who in Finland use the Latin alphabet).

== Kazakh use ==

The current Kazakh Latin alphabet proposal, last updated in March 2021 and commissioned by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, uses ğ to replace the Kazakh Cyrillic Ғ to represent the IPA . The earlier 2020 proposal listed Ǵ instead, but was replaced after public criticism.

==Friulian use==
The Faggin–Nazzi alphabet for Friulian language uses the caron, owing to its Slavic influence. However, / is often substituted with / due to the former&#x27;s lack of availability in fonts and input systems. This is because / is in Latin Extended-A alongside / and /, the other caron bearing letters in the alphabet, whereas / is in Latin Extended-B, which is available in fewer fonts and input systems.

<text>The Consumer Technology Association (CTA)® is North America&#x27;s largest standards and technology trade organization representing more than 1,200 technology companies. CTA is led by CEO and Vice Chair Gary J. Shapiro.

== Trade shows ==

=== CES ===

CES is a major technology trade show held each January in Las Vegas.

The first CES was held in 1967 in New York City. It was a spin-off from the Chicago Music Show, which until then had served as the main event for exhibiting consumer electronics. The event had 17,500 attendees and over 100 exhibitors. From 1978 to 1994, CES was held twice each year: once in January in Las Vegas, known as &quot;Winter Consumer Electronics Show&quot; (WCES), and once in June in Chicago, known as &quot;Summer Consumer Electronics Show&quot;. In 1998, the show changed to an annual format with Las Vegas as the location. CES is one of the largest and longest-running trade shows held in Las Vegas, taking up to 17 days to set up, run, and break down.

== Awards programs ==
CTA has several awards programs for industry leaders, inventors, products, and technologies.

Since 1976, the Innovations Design and Engineering Awards has given consumer technology manufacturers and developers an opportunity to have their newest products judged by a panel of designers, engineers and members of the trade press.

== CTAPAC ==

CTAPAC is CTA&#x27;s political action committee.

== CTA Foundation ==
In 2009, CTA established a charitable foundation dedicated to providing seniors and the disabled with technology in order to enhance their quality of life. Selfhelp Community Services, an eldercare service organization, in New York City received the first grant issued by what was originally called the CEA Foundation. The grant was dedicated to reducing social isolation and providing better access to community services among homebound seniors using computer and internet technology.

== Hall of Fame ==
The CTA maintains a Hall of Fame, to which notable contributors to the field of consumer electronics are named.

== Name changes ==

CTA originally started as the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) in 1924. In 1950, it changed its name to Radio-Television Manufacturers Association (RTMA). In 1953, it changed its name to Radio-Electronics-Television Manufacturers Association (RETMA). It was then the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) from 1957 to 1998, when it became the Electronic Industries Alliance. In 1995, EIA&#x27;s Consumer Electronics Group (CEG) became the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA). In 1999, President Gary Shapiro announced the trade group&#x27;s name change from CEMA to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and became an independent sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA). The name of CEA was changed to Consumer Technology Association (CTA) in November 2015.

==Deadliest crash==
The deadliest crash of this year was Iran Air Flight 655, an Airbus A300 which was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz on 3 July, killing all 290 people on board. Later that year, a terrorist bomb exploded aboard Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 which then crashed into Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December, killing all 259 people on board as well as 11 on the ground; this disaster may have been aided by Iran in reaction to the shootdown of Flight 655 not six months earlier.

<text>CES (; formerly an initialism for Consumer Electronics Show) is an annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA). Held in January at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester, Nevada, United States, the event typically hosts presentations of new products and technologies in the consumer electronics industry.

== History ==
The first CES was held in June 1967 in New York City. It was a spin-off of the Chicago Music Show which, until then, had served as the main event for exhibiting consumer electronics. The event had 17,500 attendees and over 100 exhibitors; the kickoff speaker was Motorola chairman Bob Galvin. From 1978 to 1994, CES was held twice each year: once in January in Las Vegas as the &quot;Winter Consumer Electronics Show&quot; (WCES) and once in June in Chicago as the &quot;Summer Consumer Electronics Show&quot; (SCES).

The winter show was held in Las Vegas in 1995 as planned. However, since the summer Chicago shows were beginning to lose popularity, the organizers decided to experiment by having the show travel around to different cities starting in 1995 with a planned show in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. However, the inaugural E3 gaming show was scheduled to be held on the West Coast in May and proved a source of increasing competition, causing the Philadelphia Summer CES show to be cancelled. The 1996 Winter show was again held in Las Vegas in January, followed by a Summer show this time in Orlando, Florida; however, only a fraction of the traditional exhibitors participated. The next &quot;Summer&quot; show was scheduled to be held in conjunction with Spring COMDEX in Atlanta; however, when only two dozen-or-so exhibitors signed on, the CES portion of the show was cancelled.

In 1998, the show changed to a once-a-year format, with Las Vegas as the location. In Las Vegas, the show is one of the largest (the other being CONEXPO-CON/AGG), taking up to 18 days to set up, run and break down.

== Show highlights ==

==== 2007 ====
In a break from recent tradition, the 2007 CES exhibition did not begin on a Thursday, nor span a weekend. It ran from Monday to Thursday on January 8–11, 2007. The venues also changed slightly, with the high-performance audio and home theater expo moving from the Alexis Park venue to The Venetian. The remaining venues were the same as previous years: the Las Vegas Convention Center was the center of events, with the adjacent Las Vegas Hilton, and the Sands Expo and Convention Center hosting satellite exhibitions.

The location for the main keynotes was the other major change for 2007. Previously held at the Las Vegas Hilton&#x27;s Main Theater, they staged for the first time at The Palazzo Ballroom in The Venetian.

Bill Gates gave the keynote speech, in which he formally announced his retirement from his day-to-day duties at Microsoft. Along with the announcement, he presented a lengthy comedy skit on what his last day with Microsoft would be like, complete with cameos from celebrities, to film directors, to politicians including Jay-Z, Steven Spielberg, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and many others.

Panasonic attracted much attention by releasing a 150&quot; Plasma TV as well as a 50&quot; TV as thin as 0.46 inches (11.6 mm).

==== 2009 ====
The 2009 exhibition, held January 7–10, 2009, returned to the previous Thursday–Sunday schedule, and attracted 113,085 attendees. Among more than 2,700 exhibiting companies were approximately 300 first-time exhibitors.

The game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; filmed one episode from the celebrity series and the 2009 Tournament of Champions on a new set at the Sony booth. The set was moved to their main studio at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, starting with the show&#x27;s 26th season through the 29th season.

CES 2009 suffered an attendance drop of at least 22%, which was attributed to the Great Recession.

=== 2010s ===
==== 2010 ====

The 2010 exhibition was held January 7–10, 2010, and attracted more than 120,000 attendees.

Highlights include the Intel Infoscape, which is run on the Intel Core i7 processor. One computer ran two screens, displaying 576 cubes hooked up to 20,000 information sources, including 20 live video feeds. Visitors would touch one of the cubes, and an infobox displaying that content would come forward. One journalist explained, &quot;The graphics on the giant screens were a tons of fun to move around with their uncanny quickness and smooth motion, and the whole thing felt super responsive, Giving us a peek into the future, it seemed a lot like that computer screen in the movie Minority Report. It was the most spectacular demo we saw at CES 2010.&quot; Equally impressive, Parrot presented the first prototype of Parrot AR.Drone, a remote-controlled flying toy which streams video via WiFi to an iPhone.

Sustainable Planet grew by 40% in 2010.

==== 2011 ====

The show organizers claimed that 153,000 people attended the 2012 show, a 2% increase from the previous year and a new all-time attendance record. Intel was caught falsifying a demo of their new Ivy Bridge processors. AMD demonstrated their new Trinity APUs.

AMTC was demonstrating this &#x27;Tier-2&#x27; CE products (&#x27;middleware&#x27;) featuring the Inview Technology platform. Inview claimed that its low processing and memory footprint means connected TV capabilities are available at low-cost, as the software is provided royalty free. Parrot presented the &quot;world&#x27;s most advanced headphones&quot; the Parrot ZIK By Starck.

This was also the first year in which the Photo Marketing Association held its annual trade show in conjunction with CES, with the PMA show branded as PMA@CES.

==== 2013 ====
The 2013 International CES, instead of starting on Thursday went from Tuesday to Friday, January 8–11, 2013, in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.

==== 2014 ====
The 2014 International CES was held during the week from January 7 to 10, 2014, in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The first Li-Fi smartphone prototype was presented at the show. The smartphone uses SunPartner&#x27;s Wysips CONNECT, a technique that converts light waves into usable energy, making the phone capable of receiving and decoding signals without drawing on its battery. The phone also has a transparent photovoltaic screen that lets light recharge the phone.

LG debuted its webOS on smartTVs and new 77-inch curved OLED Ultra HD TV.
Samsung unveiled its curved TVs with two series of concave TVs.

ProtectCELL showcased its comprehensive mobile protection plans for all major devices, including the iPhone 5S and 5C, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 and Galaxy S4. With demonstrations such as blending a Blackberry, ProtectCELL proves they will cover all damages.

The AMD presentation mentioned (among others) – the Kaveri CPU of the Steamroller architecture, Heterogenous System Architecture (HSA) lineup and the intention to build upon that, immersive experience, Mantle and AMD TrueAudio.

In the Intel keynote presentation, its CEO talked about three areas in which technology can improve: living, working, and playing. He also presented Intel Edison, a SoC of the SD card format.

Pebble announced the Pebble Steel smartwatch, which has a thin body, tactile metal buttons, and Corning Gorilla Glass.

Laser diodes were unveiled at the show that are going to be used for high-beam headlights in Audi vehicles. The high beams will be lasers, though the low beams will be light-emitting diodes. The car maker says that their high beams have a 500-meter range, which is roughly twice the distance of LED high beams. Lasers are expensive though. Lasers are smaller, brighter and more energy efficient than LED headlamps. Their laser headlamps use less than half the energy of LEDs. Laser diodes can emit 170 lumens per watt, while LEDs generate only 100 lumens. Lasers are sensitive to heat but that has not stopped their production for vehicles. Laser technology is not as advanced compared with LEDs, which have been around for decades.

Notoriously, CES received a large amount of negative press and backlash from feminists worldwide for its decision (later reversed) to revoke a CES Innovations Award for a female pleasure device presented to Lora DiCarlo, with CES stating the reasoning for the revocation was &quot;products that are immoral, obscene, indecent, profane, or not in keeping with CTA&#x27;s image will be disqualified.&quot;. The award was later reinstated.

<text>Johannes Ockeghem ( – 6 February 1497) was a Franco-Flemish composer and singer of early Renaissance music. Ockeghem was a significant European composer in the period between Guillaume Du Fay and Josquin des Prez, and he was—with his colleague Antoine Busnois—a prominent European composer in the second half of the 15th century. He was an important proponent of the early Franco-Flemish School.

Ockeghem was well associated with other prominent composers of the time, and spent most of his career serving the French royal court under Charles VII, Louis XI and Charles VIII. Numerous poets and musicians lamented his death, including Erasmus, Guillaume Crétin, Jean Molinet and Josquin, who composed the well-known &quot;Nymphes des bois&quot; for him.

It is thought that Ockeghem&#x27;s extant works represent only a small part of his entire &quot;oeuvre&quot;, including around 14 masses, 20 chansons and fewer than 10 motets—though the exact numbers vary due to attribution uncertainties. His better-known works include the canon-based &quot;Missa prolationum&quot;; the &quot;Missa cuiusvis toni&quot;, which can be sung in any mode; the chanson &quot;Fors seulement&quot;; and the earliest surviving polyphonic Requiem.

==Life==
===Background and early life===
The spelling of Ockeghem&#x27;s name comes from a supposed autograph of his which survived as late as 1885, and was reproduced by Eugène Giraudet, a historian in Tours; the document has since been lost. In 15th-century sources, the spelling &quot;Okeghem&quot; predominates. Other spellings include Ogkegum, Okchem, Hocquegam and Ockegham.

Ockeghem is believed to have been born in the Walloon city Saint-Ghislain, Burgundian Netherlands (now Belgium). His birthdate is unknown; dates as early as 1410 and as late as 1430 have been proposed. The earlier date is based on the possibility that he knew Binchois in Hainaut before the older composer moved from Mons to Lille in 1423. Ockeghem would have to have been younger than 15 at the time. This particular speculation derives from Ockeghem&#x27;s reference, in the lament he wrote on the death of Binchois in 1460, to a chanson by Binchois dated to that time. In this lament, Ockeghem not only honored the older composer by imitating his style, but also revealed some useful biographical information about him. The comment by the poet Guillaume Crétin, in the lament he wrote on Ockeghem&#x27;s death in 1497, &quot;it was a great shame that a composer of his talents should die before 100 years old&quot;, is also often taken as evidence for the earlier birthdate for Ockeghem.

In 1993, documents dating from 1607 were found stating that &quot;Jan Hocquegam&quot; was a native of Saint-Ghislain in the County of Hainaut, which was confirmed by references in 16th-century documents. This suggests that, though he first appears in records in Flanders, he was a native speaker of Picard. Previously, most biographies surmised that he was born in East Flanders, either in the town after which he was named (present-day Okegem, from which his ancestors must have come) or in the neighboring town of Dendermonde (French: Termonde), where the surname Ockeghem occurred in the 14th and 15th century. Occasionally, Bavay, now in the Nord department in France, was suggested as his birthplace as well.

Details of his early life are lacking. Like many composers in this period, he started his musical career as a chorister, although the exact location of his education is unknown: Mons, a town near Saint-Ghislain that had at least two churches with competent music schools, has been suggested. The first actual documented record of Ockeghem is from the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe cathedral in Antwerp, where he was employed in June 1443 as a &quot;left-hand choir singer&quot; (&quot;left-handers&quot; sang composed music, &quot;right-handers&quot; sang chant). He probably sang under the direction of Johannes Pullois, whose employment also dates from that year. This church was a distinguished establishment, and it was likely here that Ockeghem became familiar with the English compositional style, which some suggest influenced musical practices on the continent in the late 15th century.

===Training and career===
Ockeghem probably studied with Gilles Binchois, and at least was closely associated with him at the Burgundian court. Since Antoine Busnois wrote a motet in honor of Ockeghem sometime before 1467, it is probable that those two were acquainted as well; and writers of the time often link Dufay, Busnois and Ockeghem. Although Ockeghem&#x27;s musical style differs considerably from that of the older generation, it is probable that he acquired his basic technique from them, and as such can be seen as a direct link from the Burgundian style to the next generation of Netherlanders, such as Obrecht and Josquin.

Between 1446 and 1448 Ockeghem served, along with singer and composer Jean Cousin, at the court of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon in Moulins, now in central France. During this service he became the first among the singing chaplains to appear in the court records. Around 1452 he moved to Paris where he served as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; to the French court, as well as treasurer of the collegiate church of St. Martin, at Tours. In addition to serving at the French court – both for Charles VII and Louis XI – he held posts at Notre Dame de Paris and at St. Benoît. He is known to have travelled to Spain in 1470, as part of a diplomatic mission for the King, which was a complex affair attempting both to dissuade Spain from joining an alliance with England and Burgundy against France, and to arrange a marriage between Isabella I of Castile and Charles, Duke of Guyenne (the brother of king Louis XI). After the death of Louis XI (1483), not much is known for certain about Ockeghem&#x27;s whereabouts, though it is known that he went to Bruges and Tours, and he probably died in the latter town since he left a will there. The number of laments written on Ockeghem&#x27;s death on 6 February 1497 suggests the respect he commanded among contemporaries; among the most famous of the musical settings of these many poems is &quot;Nymphes des bois&quot; by Josquin des Prez. Other authors of these poems included Molinet and Desiderius Erasmus; Johannes Lupi provided another musical setting.

== Music and influence ==
Ockeghem’s output was limited relative to the length of his career and his established reputation, and some of his work was lost. Many works formerly attributed to him are now presumed to be by other composers; Ockeghem&#x27;s total output of reliably attributed compositions, as with many of the most famous composers of the time (such as Josquin), has shrunk with time. Surviving reliably attributed works include some 14 masses (including a Requiem), an isolated Credo (&quot;Credo sine nomine&quot;), five motets, a motet-chanson (a &quot;deploration&quot; on the death of Binchois), and 21 chansons. Thirteen of Ockeghem&#x27;s masses are preserved in the Chigi codex, a Flemish manuscript dating to around 1500. His &quot;Missa pro Defunctis&quot; is the earliest surviving polyphonic Requiem mass (another possibly earlier setting by Dufay has been lost). Some of his works, alongside compositions by his contemporaries, are included in Petrucci&#x27;s &quot;Harmonice musices odhecaton&quot; (1501), the first collection of music published using moveable type.
Dating Ockeghem&#x27;s works is difficult, as there are almost no external points of reference, except of course the death of Binchois (1460) for which Ockeghem composed a motet-chanson. The &quot;Missa Caput&quot; is almost certainly an early work, since it follows on an anonymous English mass of the same title dated to the 1440s, and his late masses may include the &quot;Missa Ma maistresse&quot; and &quot;Missa Fors seulement&quot;, in view of both his innovative treatment of the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; and his increasingly homogeneous textures later in his life.

Ockeghem used the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; technique in about half of his masses; the earliest of these masses used head motifs at the start of the individual movements, a common practice around 1440 but one that had already become archaic by around 1450. Three of his masses, &quot;Missa Ma maistresse&quot;, &quot;Missa Fors seulement&quot;, and &quot;Missa Mi-mi&quot; are based on chansons he wrote himself, and use more than one voice of the chanson, foreshadowing the parody mass techniques of the 16th century. In his remaining masses, including the &quot;Missa cuiusvis toni&quot; and &quot;Missa prolationum&quot;, no borrowed material has been found, and the works seem to have been freely composed.

Ockeghem would sometimes place borrowed material in the lowest voice, such as in the &quot;Missa Caput&quot;, one of three masses written in the mid-15th century based on that fragment of chant from the English Sarum Rite. Other characteristics of Ockeghem&#x27;s compositional technique include variation in voices&#x27; rhythmic character so as to maintain their independence.

Ockeghem influenced Josquin des Prez and the subsequent generation of Netherlandish composers; he was known throughout Europe for his expressive music and his technical skill. Two of the most notable contrapuntal achievements of the 15th century include his &quot;Missa prolationum&quot;, which consists entirely of mensuration canons, and the &quot;Missa cuiusvis toni&quot;, designed to be performed in any of the different modes, but even these technique-oriented pieces demonstrate his uniquely expressive use of vocal ranges and tonal language. Ockeghem&#x27;s use of wide-ranging and rhythmically active bass lines was distinctive among composers in the Netherlandish Schools, and may be because this was his voice range.

<text>Skin Games were a British pop/rock band of the late 1980s and early 1990s that were signed to Epic Records. Their name was inspired by a Dylan Thomas short story. Critically acclaimed as artists, they never gained commercial success, and broke up after just one album, &quot;The Blood Rush&quot;, released in 1989. The soaring vocal style of lead singer Wendy Page has been compared with both Kate Bush and The Cocteau Twins but the music is otherwise hard to categorise. The band released a number of singles from the album, but only &quot;Brilliant Shining&quot; managed to gain any significant airplay. Their first single, &quot;Cowboy Joe&quot;, was produced by Steve Hillage.

Skin Games were:
* Wendy Page (vocals)
* Jim Marr (bass guitar)
* Jonny Willett (lead guitar)
* Dave Innes (drums)
* Adam Lee (keyboards)

Despite sinking with relatively little trace, Wendy Page and Jim Marr went on to pen some hits for Martine McCutcheon (&quot;Perfect Moment&quot;) and Billie Piper (&quot;Honey to the Bee&quot;, &quot;Because We Want To&quot;) and wrote and produced &quot;Dangerous To Know&quot; on Hilary Duff&#x27;s third album. In 1999, Page collaborated with production duo Tin Tin Out on the album &quot;Eleven to Fly&quot;, co-writing and providing lead vocals on the majority of the tracks. She also continues to have a solo career.

<text>George Robert Gissing ( ; 22 November 1857 – 28 December 1903) was an English novelist, who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. In the 1890s he was considered one of the three greatest novelists in England, and by the 1940s he had been recognised as a literary genius. Gissing&#x27;s best-known works have reappeared in modern editions. They include &quot;The Nether World&quot; (1889), &quot;New Grub Street&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Odd Women&quot; (1893). He retains a small but devoted group of followers.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gissing was born on 22 November 1857 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, the eldest of five children of Thomas Waller Gissing, who ran a chemist&#x27;s shop, and Margaret (née Bedford). His siblings were: William, who died aged twenty; Algernon, who became a writer; Margaret; and Ellen. His childhood home in Thompson&#x27;s Yard, Wakefield, is maintained by The Gissing Trust.

Gissing was educated at Back Lane School in Wakefield, where he was a diligent and enthusiastic student. His serious interest in books began at the age of ten when he read &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; by Charles Dickens and subsequently, encouraged by his father and inspired by the family library, his literary interest grew. Juvenilia written at this time was published in 1995 in &quot;The Poetry of George Gissing&quot;. He was also skilled at drawing. Gissing&#x27;s father died when he was 12 years old, and he and his brothers were sent to Lindow Grove School at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, where he was a solitary student who studied hard.

In 1872, after an exceptional performance in the Oxford Local Examinations, Gissing won a scholarship to Owens College, the forerunner of the Victoria University of Manchester, subsequently merged with University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology to form the University of Manchester. There he continued his intense studies, and won many prizes, including the Poem Prize in 1873 and the Shakespeare scholarship in 1875. He also began a relationship with Marianne &quot;Nell&quot; Harrison.

When he ran short of money and stole from his fellow students, Gissing&#x27;s academic career ended in disgrace. The college hired a detective to investigate the thefts, and Gissing was prosecuted, found guilty, expelled, and sentenced to a month&#x27;s hard labour in Belle Vue Gaol, Manchester, in 1876.

In September 1876, with support from sympathisers, he travelled to the United States, where he spent time in Boston and Waltham, Massachusetts, writing and teaching classics. When his money ran out, he moved to Chicago, where he earned a precarious living writing short stories for newspapers, including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. He lived in poverty until he met a travelling salesman in need of an assistant, and Gissing demonstrated his products. These experiences partially inspired his 1891 novel, &quot;New Grub Street&quot;. In September 1877, Gissing left America and returned to England.

===Literary career===

After returning to England, Gissing settled in London with Nell, writing fiction and working as a private tutor. He failed to get his first novel &quot;Workers in the Dawn&quot; accepted by a publisher and published it privately, funding it with money from an inheritance. Gissing married Nell on 27 October 1879. Their marriage was plagued with poverty and they were frequently separated while Nell was hospitalised for poor health. One of his friends was a fellow author and Owens College alumnus Morley Roberts, who wrote a novel based on Gissing&#x27;s life, &quot;The Private Life of Henry Maitland&quot;, in 1912. He was friends with Eduard Bertz, a German socialist with whom he became acquainted in 1879. Gissing spent much time reading classical authors at the British Museum Reading Room, as well as coaching students for examinations. He took long walks through the streets of London observing the poor. In his reading, John Forster&#x27;s &quot;Life of Dickens&quot; particularly interested him. He wrote in his diary entry for 23 January 1888 that Forster&#x27;s work was &quot;a book I constantly take up for impulse, when work is at a standstill&#x27;.

According to his pupil Austin Harrison, from 1882 Gissing made a decent living by teaching; tales of a fight with poverty, including some of his own remembrances, were untrue. Gissing often claimed poverty to his family, whom he largely supported, in order to discourage them from asking for assistance, and the issue of his supposed poverty may be explained by Gissing&#x27;s attitude to teaching, which he felt to be an inferior profession, somewhat beneath him. He was also guilty of extravagance and poor management of his finances.

Gissing&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Mrs Grundy&#x27;s Enemies&quot;, remained unpublished like the first, although bought for publication by Bentley &amp; Son in 1882. George Bentley decided against publishing it despite revisions that Gissing made. Before his next novel, &quot;The Unclassed&quot;, was published in 1884, Gissing and his wife separated, largely because Gissing would not give the time and energy to support her through increasingly chronic ill-health. He continued to pay a small alimony until her death in 1888. Between his return to England and publication of &quot;The Unclassed&quot;, Gissing wrote 11 short stories, but only &quot;Phoebe&quot; appeared at the time, in the March 1884 issue of &quot;Temple Bar&quot;.
The years after the publication of &quot;The Unclassed&quot; brought great literary activity. &quot;Isabel Clarendon&quot; and &quot;Demos&quot; appeared in 1886; &quot;Demos&quot; began a relationship with Smith, Elder &amp; Co., which published him until &quot;New Grub Street&quot; in 1891. The novels he wrote in this period depict a conservative view of the working class. Gissing used £150 earned from the rights to &quot;The Nether World&quot; in 1889 to fund a long-awaited trip to Italy to pursue his interest in the classics. His experiences there formed a basis for the 1890 work &quot;The Emancipated&quot;.

On 25 February 1891, Gissing married another working-class woman, Edith Alice Underwood. They settled in Exeter but moved to Brixton in June 1893 and Epsom in 1894. They had two children, Walter Leonard (1891–1916) and Alfred Charles Gissing (1896–1975), but the marriage was unsuccessful. Edith did not understand his work and Gissing insisted on keeping them socially isolated from his peers, which exacerbated the problems. Whereas Nell was too sick to complain about his controlling behaviour, some historians believe Edith stood up to him argumentatively. She may have gone into violent, uncontrolled rages as Gissing claimed in letters to Bertz, but the truth is elusive at this distance in time. Gissing took revenge (or acted to protect their older child from continual violent assaults, since he stated in letters his safety was in danger) in April 1896, when Walter was spirited away without Edith&#x27;s knowledge and sent to stay with Gissing&#x27;s sisters in Wakefield. Gissing pleaded Edith&#x27;s violence, but he strongly disliked the way she presented him to his son. Alfred, the younger child, remained with his mother. The couple separated in 1897, though this was no clean break - Gissing spent time dodging Edith and afraid she might seek a reconciliation. In 1902, Edith was certified insane and confined to an asylum. At this time Gissing met and befriended Clara Collet who was probably in love with him, although it is unclear whether he reciprocated. They remained friends for the rest of his life and after his death, she helped to support Edith and the children.

Gissing&#x27;s work began to be paid better. &quot;New Grub Street&quot; (1891) brought him £250. In 1892 he befriended and was influenced in his work by a fellow writer, George Meredith. In the 1890s Gissing lived more comfortably on his earnings, but his health suffered, which limited the time he spent in London. Novels from the period include &quot;Born in Exile&quot; (1892), &quot;The Odd Women&quot; (1893), &quot;In the Year of Jubilee&quot; (1894) and &quot;The Whirlpool&quot; (1897). From 1893, Gissing also wrote short stories, some of which were collected in an 1898 volume, &quot;Human Odds and Ends&quot;, and others in volumes published after his death. In 1895, he published three novellas, &quot;Eve&#x27;s Ransom&quot;, &quot;The Paying Guest&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Fires&quot;. This too reflected changing tastes in the reading public, away from three-volume novels.

In 1897 Gissing met H. G. Wells and his wife, who spent the spring with him and his sister at Budleigh Salterton. Wells said Gissing was &quot;no longer the glorious, indefatigable, impracticable youth of the London flat, but a damaged and ailing man, full of ill-advised precautions against the imaginary illnesses that were his interpretations of a general malaise.&quot;

===Later years===

After separating from Edith, Gissing revisited Italy in 1897–1898, as told in a travel book, &quot;By the Ionian Sea&quot; (1901). While in Siena he wrote &quot;Charles Dickens: a Critical Study&quot;. In Rome he met H. G. Wells and his wife and did research for a romantic novel set in the 6th century, &quot;Veranilda&quot;. Meanwhile &quot;The Town Traveller&quot;, written in the final months of his marriage in 1897, was published. After a short stay with his friend Bertz in Potsdam, he returned to England in 1898 and moved to Dorking in Surrey.

In July 1898, Gissing met Gabrielle Marie Edith Fleury (1868–1954), a Frenchwoman who approached him for permission to translate &quot;New Grub Street&quot;. Ten months later, they became partners in a common-law marriage, as Gissing did not divorce Edith. They moved to France, where he remained, returning to England briefly in 1901 for a six-week stay in a sanatorium in Nayland, Suffolk. The couple settled in Paris, but moved to Arcachon when Gissing&#x27;s health deteriorated. The final years of his life were spent in the villages of Ciboure, near St Jean-de-Luz, and Ispoure, near Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.

Gissing&#x27;s relations with Fleury provided inspiration for his 1899 novel &quot;The Crown of Life&quot;. He wrote several novels during his third marriage, including &quot;Among the Prophets&quot;, which remained unpublished and has not survived, &quot;Our Friend the Charlatan&quot; (1901) and &quot;Will Warburton&quot; (published posthumously in 1905). Gissing worked on his historical novel &quot;Veranilda&quot;, but it was unfinished when he died. In 1903, he published &quot;The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft&quot;, written in 1900–1901 and appearing initially as a serial entitled &quot;An author at grass&quot; in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;. It consists of imaginary autobiographical essays from a once-struggling writer who has inherited a legacy enabling him to retire in the countryside. It brought Gissing much acclaim.

Apart from fiction, Gissing followed up his study of Dickens with further writings, including introductions to editions of Dickens&#x27;s works, articles for journals and a revised edition of John Forster&#x27;s Dickens biography.

Gissing died aged 46 on 28 December 1903 having caught a chill on an ill-advised winter walk. He is buried in the English cemetery at Saint-Jean-de-Luz. &quot;Veranilda&quot; was published incompletely in 1904. H. G. Wells, after a Christmas Eve telegram, came to Gissing at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in his final days and helped to nurse him. Wells characterized him as a &quot;flimsy inordinate stir of grey matter&quot;, and wrote of Gissing&#x27;s &quot;poor vexed brain—so competent for learning and aesthetic reception, so incompetent, so impulsive and weakly yielding under the real stresses of life&quot;, adding: &quot;He was a pessimistic writer. He spent his big fine brain depreciating life because he would not and perhaps could not look life squarely in the eyes — neither his circumstances nor the conventions about him nor the adverse things about him nor the limitations of his personal character. But whether it was nature or education that made this tragedy I cannot tell.&quot; &quot;Will Warburton&quot; was published in 1905, as was his final volume, the short-story collection &quot;The House of Cobwebs&quot;.
Gissing is prominent in Russell Kirk&#x27;s &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot;. He was also said to be George Orwell’s favorite writer. His conservatism was rooted in his aristocratic sensibility. After a brief youthful flirtation with socialism, Gissing lost faith in the labour movements and scorned the popular enthusiasms of his day. In 1892, he told his sister Ellen, &quot;I fear we shall live through great troubles yet... We cannot resist it, but I throw what weight I may have on the side of those who believe in an aristocracy of brains, as against the brute domination of the quarter-educated mob.&quot; In &quot;The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft&quot;, Gissing reflected, &quot;To think I once called myself a socialist, communist, anything you like of the revolutionary kind! Not for long, to be sure, and I suspect there was always something in me that scoffed when my lips uttered such things.&quot; In a fictionalised biography of Gissing, &quot;The Private Life of Henry Maitland&quot;, his friend Morley Roberts commented:He had once, as he owned, been touched by Socialism, probably of a purely academic kind; and yet, when he was afterwards withdrawn from such stimuli as had influenced him to think for once in terms of sociology, he went back to his more natural despairing conservative frame of mind. He lived in the past, and was conscious every day that something in the past that he loved was dying and must vanish. No form of future civilisation, whatever it might be, which was gained by means implying the destruction of what he chiefly loved, could ever appeal to him. He was not even able to believe that the gross and partial education of the populace was better than no education at all, in that it must someday inevitably lead to better education and a finer type of society. It was for that reason that he was a conservative. But he was the kind of conservative who would now be repudiated by those who call themselves such, except perhaps in some belated and befogged country house.

==Reception==
Gissing&#x27;s early novels were ill-received, but greater recognition came in the 1890s in England and overseas. The increased popularity affected his novels, the short stories he wrote in the period, and his friendships with influential, respected literary figures such as the journalist Henry Norman, author J. M. Barrie and writer and critic Edmund Gosse. By the end of the century, critics placed him with Thomas Hardy and George Meredith as one of the three leading novelists in England. Sir William Robertson Nicoll called him &quot;one of the most original, daring and conscientious workers in fiction&quot;. Chesterton saw in him the &quot;soundest of the Dickens critics, a man of genius&quot;. George Orwell admired him and in a 1943 &quot;Tribune&quot; article called him &quot;perhaps the best novelist England has produced,&quot; believing his masterpieces were the &quot;three novels, &quot;The Odd Women&quot;, &quot;Demos&quot;, and &quot;New Grub Street&quot;, and his book on Dickens. [The novels&#x27;] central theme can be stated in three words — &#x27;not enough money&#x27;.&quot;

==Style==
The traditional view of critics is that Émile Zola was a primary influence on Gissing, but Jacob Korg suggests that George Eliot was a greater influence.

==&quot;The Gissing Journal&quot;==
&quot;The Gissing Journal&quot;, a quarterly single-author journal devoted to the life and works of George Gissing, publishes essays, and book reviews. It appeared in January 1965, with Jacob Korg of the University of Washington as editor until December 1968. He was followed from January 1969 to April 2013 by Pierre Coustillas, emeritus professor of English at the University of Lille, and from July 2013 by Malcolm Allen of the University of Wisconsin. However, Allen was only able to produce six issues and it ceased publication in December 2014. Markus Neacey, a regular contributor and independent Gissing scholar, restarted &quot;The Gissing Journal&quot; as editor in January 2017. He had in 2016 written a history and index of &quot;The Gissing Journal&quot;.

&quot;The Gissing Journal&quot; is indexed by the Modern Language Association, reviewed annually by &quot;The Year&#x27;s Work in English Studies&quot; and regularly mentioned in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement.&quot; The contents up to 2008 can be read on &quot;The Gissing in Cyberspace&quot; website.

<doc id="273564" wikidata="Q59785" url="?curid=273564" title="Snowy egret">
<text>The snowy egret (Egretta thula) is a small white heron. The genus name comes from Provençal French for the little egret, , which is a diminutive of , &#x27;heron&#x27;. The species name &quot;thula&quot; is the Araucano term for the black-necked swan, applied to this species in error by Chilean naturalist Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782.

The snowy egret is the American counterpart to the very similar Old World little egret, which has become established in the Bahamas. At one time, the plumes of the snowy egret were in great demand as decorations for women&#x27;s hats. They were hunted for these plumes and this reduced the population of the species to dangerously low levels. Now protected in the United States by law, under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, this bird&#x27;s population has rebounded.

== Description ==
Adult snowy egrets are entirely white apart from the yellow lores between the long black bill and the eye, black legs, and bright yellow feet. The nape and neck bear long, shaggy plumes known as aigrettes. Immature snowy egrets have duller, greenish legs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The snowy egret is native to North, Central and South America. It is present all year round in South America, ranging as far south as Chile and Argentina. It also occurs throughout the year in the West Indies, Florida and coastal regions of North and Central America. Elsewhere, in the southern part of the United States, it is migratory, breeding in California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. It is found in wetlands of many types; marshes, riverbanks, lakesides, pools, salt marshes and estuaries. It is not found at high altitudes nor generally on the coast. 
The snowy egret has occurred as a vagrant in Europe, in Iceland, Scotland and the Azores. It has also been recorded in South Africa.

== Diet ==
The birds eat fish, crustaceans (such as crabs, shrimp and crayfish), insects, small reptiles (such as lizards and snakes), snails, frogs, toads and worms (especially earthworms and other annelids). They stalk prey in shallow water, often running or shuffling their feet, flushing prey into view by swaying their heads, flicking their wings or vibrating their bills. They may also hover, or &quot;dip-fish&quot; by flying with their feet just above the water surface. Snowy egrets may also stand still and wait to ambush prey, or hunt for insects stirred up by domestic animals in open fields. They sometimes forage in mixed species groups.

==Breeding==
Snowy egrets breed in mixed colonies, which may include great egrets, night herons, tricolored herons, little blue herons, cattle egrets, glossy ibises and roseate spoonbills. The male establishes a territory and starts building the nest in a tree, vines or thick undergrowth. He then attracts a mate with an elaborate courtship display which includes dipping up and down, bill raising, aerial displays, diving, tumbling and calling. The immediate vicinity of the nest is defended from other birds and the female finishes the construction of the nest with materials brought by the male. It is constructed from twigs, rushes, sedges, grasses, Spanish moss and similar materials and may be across. Up to six pale bluish-green eggs are laid which hatch after about 24 days. The young are altricial and covered with white down when first hatched. They leave the nest after about 22 days.

== Fossil finds ==
Fossils of the snowy egret have been reported from the Talara tar seeps of Peru and in Bradenton in Manatee County and Haile XIB in Alachua County in Florida, United States. The deposits were dated to the Late Pleistocene.

==Status==
In the early twentieth century, the snowy egret was hunted extensively for their long breeding plumes that fashionable ladies wore on their hats. This trade was ended in 1910 in North America but continued for some time in Central and South America. Since then populations have recovered. The bird has a very wide range and the total population is large. No particular threats have been recognised and the population trend seems to be upwards, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>Neurocognitive functions are cognitive functions closely linked to the function of particular areas, neural pathways, or cortical networks in the brain, ultimately served by the substrate of the brain&#x27;s neurological matrix (i.e. at the cellular and molecular level). Therefore, their understanding is closely linked to the practice of neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience – two disciplines that broadly seek to understand how the structure and function of the brain relate to cognition and behaviour.

A neurocognitive deficit is a reduction or impairment of cognitive function in one of these areas, but particularly when physical changes can be seen to have occurred in the brain, such as aging related physiological changes or after neurological illness, mental illness, drug use, or brain injury.

A clinical neuropsychologist may specialise in using neuropsychological tests to detect and understand such deficits, and may be involved in the rehabilitation of an affected person. The discipline that studies neurocognitive deficits to infer normal psychological function is called cognitive neuropsychology.

== Etymology ==
The term neurocognitive is a recent addition to the nosology of clinical Psychiatry and Psychology. It was rarely used before the publication of the DSM-5, which updated the psychiatric classification of disorders listed in the &quot;Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders&quot; chapter of the DSM-IV. Following the 2013 publication of the DSM-5, the use of the term &quot;neurocognitive&quot; − increased steadily.

Adding the prefix &quot;neuro-&quot; to the word &quot;cognitive&quot; is an example of pleonasm because analogous to expressions like &quot;burning fire&quot; and &quot;black darkness&quot;, the prefix &quot;neuro-&quot; adds no further useful information to the term &quot;cognitive&quot;. In the field of clinical neurology, clinicians continue using the simpler term &quot;cognitive&quot;, due to the absence of evidence for human cognitive processes that do not involve the nervous system.

<text>Ruby Blue was a Scottish folk pop band formed by singer Rebecca Pidgeon and guitarist Roger Fife in the 1980s.

Pidgeon was a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1986, her friend Roger Fife, a guitarist, asked her to sing on a demo tape which was then sent to Red Flame Records in London. After hearing the demo, the label signed Pidgeon and Fife and released their first album, &quot;Glances Askances&quot;.

Pidgeon became the lead singer of Ruby Blue, which included Anthony Coote on bass guitar, Erika Spotswood on backing vocals, and Chris Buck on drums. Buck was later replaced on drums by Karlos Edwards. Coote and Pidgeon left in 1990. Pidgeon went to the U.S. and pursued an acting career. Erika Spotswood (now Woods) took her place on lead vocals.

Woods and Fife kept the band&#x27;s name, releasing the album &quot;Almost Naked&quot; in 1993. The album was unsuccessful, and Ruby Blue disbanded. Woods moved to Los Angeles and married Tony Philips, the producer of Ruby Blue&#x27;s &quot;Down from Above&quot; album. Fife became a producer and worked with Cyndi Lauper, Antony and the Johnsons, and Tricky.

<doc id="273581" wikidata="Q334974" url="?curid=273581" title="Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy">
<text>Field Marshal Julian Hedworth George Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, (11 September 1862 – 6 June 1935), was a British Army officer who served as Governor General of Canada, the 12th since the Canadian Confederation.

Known to friends as &quot;Bungo&quot;, Byng was born to a noble family at Wrotham Park in Hertfordshire, England and educated at Eton College, along with his brothers. Upon graduation, he received a commission as a militia officer and saw service in Egypt and Sudan before enrolling in the Staff College at Camberley. There, he befriended individuals who would be his contemporaries when he attained senior rank in France. Following distinguished service during the First World War—specifically, with the British Expeditionary Force in France, in the Battle of Gallipoli, as commander of the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge, and as commander of the British Third Army—Byng was elevated to the peerage in 1919. In 1921, King George V, on the recommendation of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, appointed him to replace the Duke of Devonshire as Canada&#x27;s governor general, a post he occupied until the Viscount Willingdon succeeded him in 1926. Byng proved to be popular with Canadians due to his war leadership, though his stepping directly into political affairs became the catalyst for widespread changes to the role of the Crown in all of the British Dominions.

After his viceregal tenure, Byng returned to the UK to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and was promoted within the peerage to become Viscount Byng of Vimy. Three years after attaining the rank of field marshal, he died at his home, Thorpe Hall, on 6 June 1935.

==Early life==
Byng was born at the family seat of Wrotham Park, in Hertfordshire, as the seventh son and 13th and youngest child of George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford (who, due to the size of his family, ran a relatively frugal household) and Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of Charles Cavendish, 1st Baron Chesham. Until the age of 17, Byng was enrolled at Eton College, although he did not enter the sixth form. At Eton Byng first received the nickname &quot;Bungo&quot;—to distinguish him from his elder brothers &quot;Byngo&quot; and &quot;Bango&quot;—but his time at the college was undistinguished, and he received poor reports; indicative of his attitude towards academics, he once traded his Latin grammar book and his brother Lionel&#x27;s best trousers to a hawker for a pair of ferrets and a pineapple. Byng later claimed that he had been the school&#x27;s worst &quot;Scug&quot;, the colloquial term for an undistinguished boy.

==Early military career==
Byng was from a military family, his grandfather having served with Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. With three brothers already in the army and another already put up for the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, Byng&#x27;s father did not think he could afford a regular army commission for his youngest son. Thus, at the age of 17, Byng was instead sent into the militia and on 12 December 1879 commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 2nd (Edmonton) Royal Middlesex Rifles (later the 7th Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps). He was promoted to lieutenant on 23 April 1881. During this period, Byng also developed a liking for theatre and music halls, and by the age of twenty had taken an interest in the banjo.

At a meeting of the Jockey Club in 1882, Byng&#x27;s father was asked about his sons by his long-time friend, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Upon hearing that Byng had not yet found a permanent career, the Prince offered a place for him in his own regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars. This was the most expensive regiment in the army, and the Earl of Strafford could only afford to give Byng two hundred of the six hundred pounds he would need each year, but the Prince&#x27;s offer could not be refused. Byng himself was delighted at the opportunity, as both his uncle, Lord Chesham, and his cousin, Charles Cavendish, had served in the regiment. By raising money through buying polo ponies cheaply, using his excellent horsemanship to train them, and then selling them on at a profit, Byng was able to transfer to the 10th Royal Hussars on 27 January 1883, and less than three months later he joined the regiment in Lucknow, India.

It was while the regiment was on the way home to Great Britain in 1884 that the Hussars were diverted to the Sudan to join the Suakin Expedition, and on 29 February Byng, along with the rest of his regiment, rode in the first line of the charge at the first Battle of El Teb. The attack, which resulted in the deaths of both of Byng&#x27;s squadron&#x27;s other officers, was unsuccessful, and fighting continued, with Byng&#x27;s horse being killed under him on 13 March at the Battle of Tamai. Most of the rebels were then dispersed shortly after, and on 29 March the regiment re-embarked for Britain, arriving on 22 April, and proceeding to their new base at Shorncliffe Army Camp in Kent. During the summer of 1884, Byng spent much of his time playing polo and training recruits and horses, and in July, for his services in Sudan, he was mentioned in despatches.

In June 1885, the regiment was relocated to the South Cavalry Barracks at Aldershot, where the Prince of Wales&#x27; eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, joined the regiment and thereafter the Prince of Wales and his other son, Prince George, became frequent visitors. Byng struck up a friendship with both Albert Victor and George, but did not socialise with them much outside of army circles. Byng was appointed as the regimental adjutant on 20 October 1886, only nine days before the death of his father, who left Byng a watch and £3,500. The regiment then moved again in 1887 to the barracks at Hounslow, where, after suspecting that contractors were selling him inferior meat, Byng spent several early mornings at the Smithfield market to learn the meat trade, eventually proving his case and having the contractors changed. It was also at this time that Byng became acquainted with the Lord Rowton, who, along with the Guinness Trust, was trying to improve housing for skilled workers in London. Byng accompanied Rowton around the poorest areas of the city and suggested that retired senior soldiers from the rank-and-file be hired to maintain order in the Rowton Houses that Rowton had set up, thus starting a long-lived tradition.

==Further career==
In 1888, the Hussars again moved, this time to York, where Byng kept his men busy by raising successful cricket and football teams. Byng was promoted to captain on 4 January 1890, around the time he began to consider entering the Staff College at Camberley. He thus, in order to dedicate his time to preparatory studies, which continued when the regiment moved in 1891 to Ireland, resigned his commission as adjutant and turned down an invitation from Prince Albert Victor to join him in India as an equerry. After being detached for a time in order to serve and gain more experience in the infantry and artillery, Byng sat and passed his entrance exams into the Staff College and secured a nomination in September 1892. A year before Byng entered the college, Albert Victor fell victim to the influenza pandemic that raged around the world, and, at the Prince&#x27;s funeral on 20 January 1892, Byng commanded the pallbearers (all from the 10th Royal Hussars), which was a significant display of trust shown Byng by the Prince of Wales.

Once Byng was enrolled at the Staff College, he found amongst his fellow students men with whom he would be closely associated more than two decades later—Henry Rawlinson, Henry Hughes Wilson, Thomas D&#x27;Oyly Snow, and James Aylmer Lowthorpe Haldane—and in 1894, while en route to visit a friend at Aldershot, travelled with a cadet at the nearby Sandhurst, Winston Churchill. Byng also journeyed with his class to see the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War at Alsace-Lorraine and accompanied to the United States one of his lecturers who was compiling information on a book on Stonewall Jackson. By December 1894, Byng graduated from the Staff College and was immediately appointed to command A Squadron of the hussars. Only three years later, though, the regiment returned to Aldershot and Byng left to become adjutant of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, shortly before becoming the Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) of the Aldershot Command, and was promoted to the rank of major on 4 May 1898. Later that same year, Byng met at a local party Marie Evelyn Moreton, the only daughter of Sir Richard Charles Moreton, who had himself served as comptroller at the Canadian royal and viceroyal residence of Rideau Hall, under the then Governor General of Canada the Marquess of Lorne. Evelyn, as she was known, later described her early encounters with Byng:

==Commanding officer==
Byng was deployed in November 1899 to South Africa, where he was to act as a provost marshal, but was instead immediately given the local rank of lieutenant colonel and tasked with raising and commanding the South African Light Horse during the Second Boer War. Byng thereafter served on the front lines, during which time he ended up in command of a group of columns, was mentioned in despatches five times (including by Lord Kitchener on 23 June 1902), and in November 1900 was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and in February 1902 to brevet colonel. The beginning of 1902 brought more significant events for Byng, with his return to England in March, an audience with King Edward VII the following month, at which he was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a member 4th class (MVO), and his marriage to Moreton at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, on 30 April 1902. Following a second visit to the King in early October, Byng was sent back to India to command the 10th Royal Hussars at Mhow and was appointed to the rank of a substantive lieutenant colonel on 11 October 1902.

In his first two years of marriage, Byng&#x27;s wife suffered several miscarriages, resulting in the declaration that she would be unable to bear children. By January 1904, Byng had also, while playing polo, broken his right elbow so severely that it was feared he would have to quit the Army. After four months&#x27; treatment in England, though, he was pronounced to be again fit for duty and in May became the first commandant of the new cavalry school at Netheravon. The posting was to be only a brief one, as, on 11 May 1905, Byng was made commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade at Canterbury, with the simultaneous temporary rank of brigadier general and substantive rank of colonel. After an appointment in the 1906 Birthday Honours as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in June 1906, he was again back in Aldershot, in command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade.

It was April 1909 when Byng was promoted to major general and, though he was placed on half pay, Byng—with added income from editing the &quot;Cavalry Journal&quot; and serving as the first North Essex district commissioner for the Boy Scouts—purchased his first house, Newton Hall, in Dunmow, Essex. He would, however, only reside there for two years, as, exactly the same amount of time after taking command of the East Anglian Division of the Territorial Force (TF) in October 1910. In May 1912 he became colonel of the 3rd (King&#x27;s Own) Hussars.

==First World War==
In October 1912 Byng became general officer commanding (GOC) British Troops in Egypt, where he remained until the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914. Kitchener, then on leave on England and soon to become Secretary of State for War, recalled Byng back to Britain to become GOC of the newly created 3rd Cavalry Division. This he did in late September, and, with his division, soon departed for the Western Front, landing at Ostend on 8 October, to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Both he and his division soon saw action at the First Battle of Ypres towards the end of the month, which lasted over four weeks. His actions there were rewarded in March 1915 with appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.

Beginning in May 1915, Byng served as GOC of the Cavalry Corps, at which time he was also made a temporary lieutenant-general, which he led during the Second Battle of Ypres. After this, Byng was sent to Gallipoli to head the IX Corps and supervise the successful withdrawal of the British, Australian, and New Zealand forces from there.

For this, he was on 1 January 1916 elevated within the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander, but was not allowed much rest, as he spent the next month commanding the Suez Canal defences before returning to the Western Front to lead the XVII Corps. He assumed command of the corps on 27 February, when he was re-granted the temporary rank of lieutenant general. By May, he found himself in command of the Canadian Corps–&quot;which was generally regarded, not least by those in it, as one of the crack formations on the Western Front&quot;–and was promoted when, for distinguished service, the King made substantive Byng&#x27;s rank of lieutenant-general. He led the corps in the Battle of the Somme later in the year.

Byng&#x27;s greatest glory then came when he led the Canadian victory in April 1917 at the battle of Vimy Ridge, a historic military milestone for the dominion that inspired nationalism at home.

In June 1917, and by now holding the temporary rank of general, Byng was rewarded for his success at Vimy Ridge and succeeded General Sir Edmund Allenby in command of Britain&#x27;s largest field army, the Third Army, which he was to lead until the cessation of hostilities some seventeen months later. With his Third Army having missed the Battle of Passchendaele, Byng led the Army in the First Battle of Cambrai in November, conducting the first surprise attack using tanks. The battle–described by historian Robin Neillands as &quot;the great &#x27;might-have-been&#x27; of the Great War&quot;–was later considered a turning point in the war and Byng was honoured on 24 November 1917 by having his temporary rank of general made substantive; however according to the war memoirs of Arthur S. Bullock, the battle failed to breach the Hindenburg Line, due to a lack of reserves, and it was at General Byng&#x27;s second attempt to take Cambrai in 1918 that the British triumphed, owing to sufficient troops and supplies being in place &quot;to sustain the attack day and night until the Germans were broken&quot;.

The Germans launched their spring offensive on 21 March 1918, which continued over the following weeks and managed to inflict heavy losses on Byng&#x27;s Third Army, although it was able to retreat without breaking his line. By the summer of 1918 the tide of the war began to turn in favour of the Allies. Byng&#x27;s Third Army launched an attack on the Germans on 21 August, where, on 27 September, it managed to break through the Hindenburg Line before continuing on to Maubeuge, which was reached on 10 November, the day before the Armistice with Germany.

==Post-war==
As a result of the success at Cambrai, Byng was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 New Year&#x27;s Honours. In the United States, Byng&#x27;s exploits during the First World War were commemorated near the town of Ada, Oklahoma, when in 1917 a post office and power plant were named after him, leading to the later emergence of the town of Byng. Further, Byng was in his own right elevated on 7 October 1919 to the peerage as Baron Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex. The next month, though he was offered Southern Command, but turned it down on the grounds that he did not wish to harm the promotion prospects of more junior officers. Byng therefore retired from the army in November 1919 and moved to Thorpe Hall. In April 1921, he unveiled the Chipping Barnet War Memorial, near to his family seat of Wrotham Park.

==Governor General of Canada==
After Byng was made in July 1921 a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, it was announced on 2 August that King George V had, by commission under the royal sign-manual and signet, approved the recommendation of his British prime minister, David Lloyd George, to appoint Byng as his representative in Canada. The designation proved less controversial than his predecessor, the Duke of Devonshire, due partly to the General&#x27;s popularity, but also because the practice of prior consultation with the Canadian prime minister, at that time Arthur Meighen, was revived. Byng had not been Meighen&#x27;s first choice for presentation to the King, since he preferred someone with more civilian credentials. Nevertheless, Byng was eventually chosen because he was both willing and available.

The Governor General travelled the length and breadth of the country, meeting with Canadians wherever he went. He also immersed himself in Canada&#x27;s culture and came to particularly love ice hockey, rarely missing a game played by the Ottawa Senators. His wife Lady Byng, also a hockey fan, would donate a trophy to the National Hockey League starting in 1925 to be handed out each year to the player who best exhibited gentlemanly and sportsmanlike conduct on the ice while maintaining a high level of play; the trophy, known as the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, is still awarded to this day. He was also fond of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, held each year in Toronto, and established the Governor General&#x27;s Cup to be presented at the competition. He was the first Governor General of Canada to appoint Canadians as his aides-de-camp (one of whom was future Governor General Georges Vanier) and approached his vice-regal role with enthusiasm, gaining popularity with Canadians on top of that received from the men he had commanded on the European battlefields. Lord Byng also named and inaugurated the first annual Warriors&#x27; Day Parade military parade in Toronto in 1921.

===King–Byng Affair===

While it had been acceptable prior to the turn of the 20th century for Canadian governors general to involve themselves in political affairs, being, as they were, representatives of the King in his British Council, Byng&#x27;s tenure as governor general was notable in that he became the first to step directly into political matters since the country had gained a degree of further autonomy following the First World War. In the summer of 1926 he denied the recommendation of his prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who sought to have parliament dissolved in order to avoid a vote of non-confidence in his government. The Governor General&#x27;s course of action in what came to be colloquially known as the &quot;King–Byng Affair&quot; remains debated, though the consensus amongst constitutional historians is that Byng&#x27;s moves were appropriate under the circumstances. Mackenzie King, however, made much of the scenario and its outcome in the election that eventually followed on 14 September, in which King&#x27;s Liberal Party won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, while Meighen lost his seat. As a result, King was once again appointed prime minister. At the 1926 Imperial Conference, King then went on to use Byng and his refusal to follow his prime minister&#x27;s advice as the impetus for widespread constitutional change throughout the British Commonwealth. Byng himself said of the matter: &quot;I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision.&quot;

==Post-viceregal life==
Byng returned to England on 30 September 1926, and in January 1928 was created Viscount Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex. Later that year, he was appointed as the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and, before his retirement in 1931, introduced a number of changes to the force, including a system of promotion based on merit rather than length of service, improvement in discipline, retirement of inefficient senior officers, an irregularity to policemen&#x27;s beats (which had previously allowed criminals to work out the system), police boxes, the extensive use of police cars, and a central radio control room. In July 1932, Byng was once more promoted in the British military to the rank of field marshal—the highest rank an officer can attain—before he died suddenly of an abdominal blockage at Thorpe Hall on 6 June 1935.

Lord Byng of Vimy was buried at the 11th Century Parish Church of St. Leonard in Beaumont-cum-Moze.

<doc id="273586" wikidata="Q1397896" url="?curid=273586" title="Rich client">
<text>In computer networking, a rich client (also called a heavy, fat or thick client) is a computer (a &quot;client&quot; in client–server network architecture) that typically provides rich functionality independent of the central server. This kind of computer was originally known as just a &quot;client&quot; or &quot;thick client,&quot; in contrast with &quot;thin client&quot;, which describes a computer heavily dependent on a server&#x27;s applications. A rich client may be described as having a rich user interaction.

While a rich client still requires at least a periodic connection to a network or central server , it is often characterised by the ability to perform many functions without a connection. In contrast, a thin client generally does as little processing as possible on the client, relying on access to the server each time input data needs to be processed or validated.

== Introduction ==
The designer of a client–server application decides which parts of the task should be executed on the client, and which on the server. This decision can crucially affect the cost of clients and servers, the robustness and security of the application as a whole, and the flexibility of the design for later modification or porting.

The characteristics of the user interface often force the decision on a designer. For instance, a drawing package could require the download of an initial image from a server, and allow all edits to be made locally, returning the revised drawing to the server upon completion. This would require a rich client and might be characterised by a long delay to start and stop (while a whole complex drawing was transferred), but quick to edit.

Conversely, a thin client could download just the visible parts of the drawing at the beginning and send each change back to the server to update the drawing. This might be characterised by a short start-up time, but a tediously slow editing process.

=== History ===
The original server clients were simple text display terminals including Wyse VDUs, and rich clients were generally not used until the increase in PC usage. The original driving force for thin client computing was often cost; at a time when CRT terminals and PCs were relatively expensive, the thin-client–server architecture enabled the ability to deploy the desktop computing experience to many users. As PC prices decreased, combined with a drop in software licensing costs, rich client–server architectures became more attractive. For users, the rich client device provided a more-responsive platform and often an improved graphical user interface (GUI) than what could be achieved in a thin client environment. In more recent years, the Internet has tended to drive the thin client model despite the prodigious processing power that a modern PC has available.

=== Centrally hosted rich client applications ===
Probably the thinnest clients, sometimes called &quot;ultra thin,&quot; are remote desktop applications, e.g. the Citrix products, and Microsoft&#x27;s Remote Desktop Services, which effectively allow applications to run on a centrally-hosted virtual PC and copy keystrokes and screen images between the local PC and the virtual PC. These ultra-thin clients are often used to make available complex or data-hungry applications that have been implemented as rich clients but the true client is hosted very near to the network server.

== Advantages ==
*Lower server requirements. A rich client server does not require as high a level of performance as a thin client server (since the rich clients themselves do much of the application processing). This results in drastically cheaper servers.
*Working offline. Rich clients have advantages in that a constant connection to the central server is often not required.
*Better multimedia performance. Rich clients have advantages in multimedia-heavy applications that would be bandwidth intensive if fully served. For example, rich clients are well suited for video gaming.
*More flexibility. On some operating systems software products are designed for personal computers that have their own local resources. Running this software in a thin client environment can be difficult.
*Using existing infrastructure. As many people now have very fast local PCs, they already have the infrastructure to run rich clients at no extra cost.
*Higher server capacity. The more work that is carried out by the client, the less the server needs to do, increasing the number of users each server can support.
*Require more resources but fewer servers.

<text>Agadir (, ; ) is a major city in Morocco, on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean near the foot of the Atlas Mountains, just north of the point where the Souss River flows into the ocean, and south of Casablanca. Agadir is the capital of the Agadir Ida-U-Tanan Prefecture and of the Souss-Massa economic region.

Agadir is one of the major urban centres of Morocco. The municipality of Agadir recorded a population of 924,000 in the 2014 Moroccan census. According to the 2004 census, there were 346,106 inhabitants in that year and the population of the Prefecture of Agadir-Ida Outanane was 487,954 inhabitants.

Agadir is known for being the capital of Amazigh culture in Morocco. It is one of the few big Moroccan cities where Tamazight, one of Morocco&#x27;s two official languages, is spoken by more than half of the population. The native variety to the region, Tachelhit, is spoken by 222,000 speakers, representing 53.7% of the entire population. Agadir is also a place for many festivals related to Amazigh culture, such as The New Amazigh Year, celebrated on 13 January every year throughout the city, especially in the downtown area. The Bilmawen Festival is another old Berber tradition celebrated in the suburbs of the city. Additionally, the Issni N’Ourgh International festival is a festival for Amazigh films. Agadir is also the birthplace of many of the pillars of Shilha and Amazigh music, such as Izenzaren, Oudaden, and many others.

It was the site of the 1911 Agadir Crisis that exposed tensions between France and Germany, foreshadowing World War I. The city was destroyed by an earthquake in 1960; it has been completely rebuilt with mandatory seismic standards. It is now the largest seaside resort in Morocco, where foreign tourists and many residents are attracted by an unusually mild year-round climate. Since 2010 it has been well served by low-cost flights and a motorway from Tangier.

The mild winter climate (January average midday temperature 20.5 °C/69 °F) and good beaches have made it a major &quot;winter sun&quot; destination for northern Europeans.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Agadir&quot; is a common Berber noun, meaning &#x27;wall, enclosure, fortified building, citadel&#x27;. This noun is attested in most Berber languages. It may come from the Tuareg word &quot;aǧādir&quot; (&#x27;wall&#x27; or &#x27;bank&#x27;) or from Phoenician (&#x27;wall&#x27; or &#x27;fortress&#x27;). The former word may also be a loanword from the latter. The Phoenician etymology, if correct, would be the same as that of Cádiz in Spain.

There are many more towns in Morocco called Agadir. The city of Agadir&#x27;s full name in Tashelhit is &quot;Agadir Ighir&quot; or &quot;Agadir-n-Irir&quot;, literally &#x27;the fortress of the cape&#x27;, referring to the nearby promontory named Cape Ighir on maps (a pleonastic name, literally &#x27;Cape Cape&#x27;).

==History==
=== Early occupation ===
The oldest known map that includes an indication of Agadir is from 1325: at the approximate location of the modern city, it names a place it calls &quot;Porto Mesegina&quot;, after a Berber tribe name that had been recorded as early as the 12th century, the &quot;Mesguina&quot; (also known as the &quot;Ksima&quot;). At the end of the medieval period, Agadir was a town of some renown. The first known mention of its name, &quot;Agadir al-harba&quot;, was recorded in 1510.

=== Portuguese occupation ===
In the late 15th century the Portuguese began to occupy positions along the Moroccan coast. In 1505 the Portuguese nobleman João Lopes de Sequeira occupied the area. He built a wooden castle at the foot of a hill, near a spring, and a Portuguese colony named &quot;Santa Cruz do Cabo do Gué&quot; was created. The site still bears the name of Funti or Founti (from the Portuguese word &quot;fonte,&quot; meaning &quot;fountain&quot;). The castle was later bought by the King of Portugal on 25 January 1513.

The Portuguese presence elicited growing hostility from the local population of the Sous region, who initiated a years-long economic and military blockade of the port. In 1510 Muhammad al-Qa&#x27;im, the leader of a Sharifian family in that had established themselves in the Sous, was declared leader of the local military efforts against the Sous. His descendants went on to found the Sa&#x27;di dynasty which rose to power over the following decades and eventually established their capital at Marrakesh. In 1540 the Sa&#x27;di sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh occupied the main hill (now Agadir Oufla) above the Portuguese and installed artillery to prepare an attack on the fortress below. The siege of the colony began on 16 February 1541 and was successfully concluded on 12 March of the same year.

Six hundred Portuguese survivors were taken prisoner, including the governor, Guterre de Monroy, and his daughter, Dona Mecia. The captives were redeemed by the holy men, who were mostly from Portugal. Dona Mecia, whose husband was killed during the battle, became the wife of Sheikh Mohammed ash-Sheikh but died in childbirth in 1544. In the same year, Mohammed ash-Sheikh released Guterre de Monroy, whom he had befriended. After this, the Portuguese were forced to abandon most of the Moroccan areas that they had acquired control of between 1505 and 1520, including Agadir, Safi and Azemmour. By 1550, Portugal&#x27;s only holding in Morocco was Mazagan (now El Jadida), Tangier and Ceuta. As Morocco became less important to the Portuguese, they turned their attention to India and Brazil.

The story of the Portuguese presence (from the installation in 1505 until their defeat on 12 March 1541) is described in a manuscript (published for the first time, with a French translation by Pierre de Cenival, in 1934) entitled &quot;Este He O Origem e Comeco e Cabo da Villa de Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gue D&#x27;Agoa de Narba&quot;, written by an anonymous author who was captured in 1934 and was imprisoned for five years in Taroudannt (cf. &quot;Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gue d&#x27;Agoa de Narba – Estudo e Crónica&quot;, Joao Marinho e Santos, José Manuel Azevedo e Silva e Mohammed Nadir, bilingual edition, Viseu 2007).

=== Moroccan rule ===
After the Sa&#x27;di victory the site was then left unoccupied for years until Muhammad al-Shaykh&#x27;s successor, Abdallah al-Ghalib (r. 1557–1574), built a new fortress (or kasbah) on the hilltop. It was now called &quot;Agadir N&#x27;Ighir&quot; (literally: &quot;fortified granary of the hill&quot; in Tachelhit.

In the 17th century, during the reign of the Berber dynasty of Tazerwalt, Agadir was a harbour of some importance, expanding its trade with Europe. There was, however, neither a real port nor a wharf. Agadir traded mainly in sugar, wax, copper, hides and skins. In exchange, Europeans sold their manufactured goods there, particularly weapons and textiles. Under the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail (1645–1727) and his successors, the trade with France, which had previously been an active partner, diminished, and trade with the English and Dutch increased.
In 1731, the town was completely destroyed by an earthquake. After that, Agadir&#x27;s harbour was ordered to be closed, and an alternative, Essaouira, was established farther north.

After a long period of prosperity during the reigns of the Saadian and Alawite dynasties, Agadir declined from 1760 because of the pre-eminence given to the competing port of Essaouira by the Alawite Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who wanted to punish the Souss for rebelling against his authority. This decline lasted a century and a half. In 1789, a European traveler gave a brief description of Agadir: &quot;It is now a ghost town, there are no more than a few houses and these are crumbling into ruins&quot;.

In 1881, Sultan Moulay Hassan reopened the harbour to trade in order to supply the expeditions he planned in the south. These expeditions, which were to reassert his authority over the Souss tribes and counter the plans of English and Spanish, were held in 1882 and 1886.

In 1884, Charles de Foucauld described in &quot;Reconnaissance au Maroc&quot; (Reconnaissance in Morocco) his rapid passage to Agadir from the east:

On the pretext of a call for help from German companies in the valley of the Souss, Germany decided on 1 July 1911, to extend its interests in Morocco and assert a claim on the country. It sent to the bay of Agadir, (which harbour was, until 1881, closed to foreign trade) the which was quickly joined by the cruiser &quot;Berlin&quot;. Very strong international reaction, particularly from Great Britain, surprised Germany and triggered the Agadir Crisis between France and Germany. War threatened. After tough negotiations, a Franco-German treaty was finally signed on 4 November 1911, giving a free hand to France, who would be able to establish its protectorate over Morocco in return for giving up some colonies in Africa. It was only then that the gunboat &quot;Panther&quot; and the cruiser &quot;Berlin&quot; left the bay of Agadir. Due to a miscalculation, the German sales representative Hermann Wilberg, who was sent to provide the pretext for the intervention, only arrived at Agadir three days after the &quot;Panther&quot; arrived.

In 1913, the cities (Agadir N&#x27;Ighir and Founti) totaled less than a thousand inhabitants. On 15 June 1913 French troops landed in Agadir. In 1916, the first pier was built near Founti – a simple jetty, later known as the &quot;Portuguese jetty&quot;, which remained until the end of the 20th century. After 1920, under the French protectorate, a port was built and the city saw its first development with the construction of the old Talborjt district located on the plateau at the foot of the hill. Two years later, beside Talborjt along the faultline of the river Tildi construction of the popular district of Yahchech began.

Around 1930, Agadir was an important stop for the French airmail service Aéropostale and was frequented by Saint-Exupéry and Mermoz.

In the years from 1930, a modern central city began to be built according to the plans of the urban planner Henri Prost, director of the Urban Planning Department of the Protectorate, and his deputy Albert Laprade: a horseshoe layout based on the waterfront around a large avenue perpendicular to the waterfront – the Avenue Lyautey, since renamed Avenue du Général Kettani. In the 1950s, urban development continued under the direction of the Director of Urban Planning Morocco, Michel Ecochard.

After 1950 and the opening of the new commercial port, the city grew with fishing, canning, agriculture, and mining. It also began to open up to tourism due to its climate and hotel infrastructure. Several years later from 1950 to 1956 Agadir organized the and, from 1954 to 1956, the Moroccan Grand Prix.

In 1959, the port was visited by the yacht of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and his guest, Winston Churchill.

By 1960, Agadir numbered over 40,000 residents when at 15 minutes to midnight on 29 February 1960, it was again almost totally destroyed by an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 on the Richter scale that lasted 15 seconds, burying the city and killing more than a third of the population. The death toll was estimated at 15,000. The earthquake destroyed the old Kasbah.

===Agadir after 1960===

The current city was rebuilt further south, led by the architects associated with GAMMA, including Jean-François Zevaco, Elie Azagury, Pierre Coldefy, and Claude Verdugo, with consultation from Le Corbusier. Agadir became a large city of over half a million by 2004, with a large port with four basins: the commercial port with a draft of 17 metres, triangle fishing, fishing port, and a pleasure boat port with marina. Agadir was the premier sardine port in the world in the 1980s and has a beach stretching over 10 km with fine seafront promenades. Its climate has 340 days of sunshine per year which allows for swimming all year round. The winter is warm and in summer, haze is common.

With Marrakech, Agadir is a very important centre for tourism to Morocco, and the city is the most important fishing port in the country. Business is also booming with the export of citrus fruit and vegetables produced in the fertile valley of Souss.

On 12 December 2022, an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 hit Agadir Province. The earthquake struck at a depth of three kilometres beneath the epicentre, off the coast of Agadir.

== Geography ==
The current conurbation of Agadir is actually a combination of four communes:

* the former town of Agadir city
* the urban commune of Anza
* the rural town of Bensergao
* the rural town of Tikiwine

===New Talborjt===
This area is named after the old district of Talborjt (meaning &quot;small fort&quot; in local Berber, in remembrance of the water tower which was first built on the plateau in the former Talborjt). Lively, the New Talborjt which has been rebuilt away from the Old Talborjt, has as the main artery the Boulevard Mohammed Sheikh Saadi, named after the victor against the Portuguese in 1541. Other major avenues are the Avenue President Kennedy and the Avenue 29 February. There is also the Mohammed V mosque, the Olhão garden (Olhão is a coastal city in southern Portugal that is twinned with Agadir), and its memorial museum and the Garden Ibn Zaydoun. Some good hotels and restaurants have been built on the main arteries.

===Residential districts===
* Swiss Village: the oldest district of villas bordered by the Avenue of FAR (Royal Armed Forces), Avenue Mokhtar Soussi, Cairo Avenue, and the Avenue of the United Nations.
* Mixed Sector District (THE NEW IHCHACH): the French and Spanish Consulates are in this district.
* Founty or &quot;Bay of palm trees&quot;: a seaside area with residential villas, large hotels, holiday homes, and the royal palace.
* High Founty: a new district of buildings and residential villas, located in the new city centre between the new Court of Appeal and the Marjane supermarket.
* Illigh: to the east in front of the Hassan II hospital, is a residential area of large villas, housing the &quot;new bourgeoisie&quot;.
* Charaf: The Hassan II hospital is in this district.
* Les Amicales: also known as the &quot;city of government employees&quot;
* Dakhla: close to the Ibn Zohr University, it has a mix between modern buildings, ordinary villas, and studio apartments. This new town created in 1979 was the last work before his death of the renowned French urbanist, Gérald Hanning.
* Hay Mohammadi: a new urbanization zone in Agadir with a villa zone and a zone for large groups of buildings to frame the extension of the Avenue des FAR in the northwest.
* Adrar City: a new district next to the Metro hypermarket.
* Other neighbourhoods: Amsernat, Lakhyam, Erac Bouargane, Massira, Essalam, Tilila, Tassila, Bensergao, Riad Assalam, Islane, Ihchach (Yachech) Nahda, Anza, Assaka, Bir Anzarane, Tikouine, Zaitoune, Taddart and El Houda.

===The Kasbah===

The K&quot;asbah&quot; (&quot;Agadir Oufla&quot;, &quot;Agadir le haut&quot;, &quot;Agadir N&#x27;Ighir&quot;, or &quot;Agadir de la colline&quot;) was, along with Founti by the sea, the oldest district of Agadir. An authentic fortress with winding streets and lively, the Kasbah was built in 1572 by Abdallah al-Ghalib. Above the front door; today, the original inscription in Arabic and in English reads: &quot;God, the Nation, the King.&quot;

Of this fortress there remains, after the earthquake of 29 February 1960, a restored long high wall that surrounds land that is not buildable. There is, however, a view over the bay of Agadir and the ports. The old people of Agadir remember the &quot;Moorish café&quot; of the Kasbah and its panoramic view.

The hill bears the inscription in Arabic: &quot;God, Country, King&quot; which, like the walls, is illuminated at night.

===Old Talborjt===
Overlooking the waterfront and Wadi Tildi, this old district (whose name is sometimes spelled &quot;Talbordjt&quot;) was once a shopping area and very lively with its large square where there was a weekly market, hotels, schools, mosque. 90% of the buildings in Old Talborjt were destroyed or severely damaged by the earthquake in 1960. Razed to the ground after the earthquake and now overgrown, it is classified as non-buildable area. Its main thoroughfare, the Avenue El Moun stretches over and serves only for driving schools that teach their students to drive.

===Souk El Had===
This is the largest market in the region. It has about 6,000 small shops. It is surrounded by walls and has several entrances. It is organized into different sectors: furniture, crafts, clothing, vegetables, meat, spices etc. It is possible to find all kinds of handicrafts and traditional decorations.

The walls have been restored and the interior design is being finished.

===La Médina===
&quot;La Médina&quot; is a handicrafts space created in 1992 by the Italian artist Coco Polizzi, at Ben Sergao, a district close to Agadir from the city centre. Built using techniques of traditional Berber construction, it is a kind of small open-air museum, on five hectares and home to artisan workshops, a museum, individual residences, a small hotel, and an exotic garden.

===Subdivisions===
The prefecture is divided administratively into communes.

=== Climate ===

Agadir has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) with warm summers and mild winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Agadir has a very mild climate. The daytime temperature generally stays in the 20s °C (70s °F) every day with averages around , with the winter highs typically reaching in January.

Rainfall is almost entirely confined to the winter months and is heavily influenced by the NAO, with negative NAO indices producing wet winters and positive NAO correlating with drought. For instance, in the wettest month on record of December 1963, as much as fell, whereas in the positive NAO year from July 1960 to June 1961 a mere occurred over the twelve months. The wettest year has been from July 1955 to June 1956 with .

Occasionally however, the region experiences winds from the Sahara called &quot;Chergui&quot;, which may exceptionally and for two to five days raise the heat above . The confirmed record high temperature was set on 12 August 2023. This makes Agadir one of few coastal locations in the world to have recorded a temperature above 50 °C. The record of 51.7 °C degrees, which was on 19 August 1940, is disputed.

In 1950, a poster from the Navigation Company Pacquet proclaimed: &quot;Winter or summer, I bathe in Agadir&quot;.

== Economy ==
The city had an annual growth rate of over 6% per year in housing demand while housing production barely exceeds 3.4%.

Agadir&#x27;s economy relies mainly on tourism and fisheries. Agricultural activities are based around the city. Agadir has one of the biggest souks in Morocco (Souk El Had).

The fishing port is a major sardine port. The commercial port is also known for its exports of cobalt, manganese, zinc and citrus products. The Avenue du Port, the main artery of the Anza district, is surrounded by canneries and has many popular small restaurants adjacent to the fish market. The city has a cement company called Ciments du Maroc (CIMAR), a subsidiary of the Italian group Italcementi which is in process of being transferred to a new plant from the city. There is also a shipyard in the port and the only merchant marine school in Morocco.

Agadir is served by Al Massira Airport, from the city.

<text>New Zealand is a hamlet in the civil parish of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, on the A413 heading out to the north of Aylesbury town centre. It gained its name from a breed of cow that was supposedly farmed there. It has been swallowed up by the urban growth of Aylesbury, but a pub of the same name remains.

<text>Jedda, released in the UK as Jedda the Uncivilised, is a 1955 Australian film written, produced and directed by Charles Chauvel. His last film, it is notable for being the first to star two Aboriginal actors, Robert Tudawali and Ngarla Kunoth (later known as Rosalie Kunoth-Monks) in the leading roles. It was also the first Australian feature film to be shot in colour.

&quot;Jedda&quot; is often seen as an influential film in the development of Australian cinema and setting a new standard for future Australian films. It won more international attention than previous Australian films during a time when Hollywood films were dominating Australian cinema. Chauvel was nominated for the Golden Palm Award at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival but lost to Delbert Mann for &quot;Marty&quot;.

 Jedda is an Aboriginal girl born on a cattle station in the Northern Territory of Australia. After her mother dies giving birth to her, the child is brought to Sarah McMann, the wife of the station boss. Sarah has recently lost her own newborn to illness. She at first intends to give the baby to one of the Aboriginal women who work on the station, but then raises Jedda as her own, teaching her European ways and separating her from other Aboriginal people.

Jedda wants to learn about her own culture, but is forbidden by Sarah. When Jedda grows into a young woman, she becomes curious about an Aboriginal man from the bush named Marbuck. This tall stranger arouses strong feelings in her. She is lured to his camp one night by a song. Marbuck abducts her and sets off back to his tribal land, through crocodile-infested swamps.

Joe, a half-caste stockman in love with Jedda, tracks the two for several days. They travel across high, rocky country, and down a river until Marbuck reaches his tribe. The tribal council declares that Marbuck has committed a serious crime by bringing Jedda to them, because she is not of the right skin group. They sing his death song as punishment. Marbuck defies the elders and takes Jedda into an area of steep cliffs and canyons, taboo lands.

Driven insane by the death song, he pulls Jedda with him over a tall cliff, and both perish. Joe, the narrator, says her spirit has joined &quot;the great mother of the world, in the dreaming time of tomorrow&quot;.

==Development==
Charles Chauvel said the original inspiration for the film came from a meeting he had in Hollywood in early 1950 with Merian C. Cooper. Cooper encouraged the director to make a film exploiting Australian locations. Chauvel was further encouraged along these lines by Bess Meredyth, who had made a number of films in Australia in the 1920s.

Chauvel decided to make the project in the Northern Territory. With his wife Elsa he made an extensive survey of the Territory later that year with the assistance of the Commonwealth government. He undertook colour tests, intending to make Australia&#x27;s first colour movie. The Chauvels then wrote a screenplay, originally entitled &quot;The Northern Territory Story&quot;.

The lead Aboriginal character was reportedly inspired by the warrior Nemarluk, who killed three Japanese pearlers in the 1930s and died in prison.

In 1951 Chauvel formed Chauvel Productions Ltd to make the film, with a notional capital of £500,000. It went public in August 1951, offering 240,000 shares.

Chauvel later stated that he turned down an American offer of $100,000 (£44,000) to finance the film because it was conditional upon Linda Darnell being cast in the lead. Chauvel&#x27;s regular backers Universal Pictures did not want to invest in the movie but Chauvel managed to secure finance from various businessmen, including Mainguard Australia Ltd. It took the Chauvels 18 months to find a suitable filming location.

==Production==

Filming started in May 1952, when the unit left Sydney for Darwin. By this stage the lead role of Jedda had still yet to be cast, but filming acting sequences did not begin until July. Robert Tudawali was an Aboriginal man from Melville Island, the largest island in the Tiwi Islands group. Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks) was an Arrernte and Anmatyerre woman, born at Utopia cattle station, north east of Alice Springs; she was selected over seven other actors screen tested, and was cast by July.

The shoot took five months to complete, plus post-production work done in Sydney. Most of the scenes were shot on the Coolibah Station in the Northern Territory, as well as at Standley Chasm, Ormiston Gorge and Mary River in the north.

The production process was laborious, as the colour technique used, Gevacolor, could only be processed in England. The film stock was fragile and heat-sensitive, which was a problem in the tropical climate of the Northern Territory. During production, the film was stored in cool caves to protect it from deteriorating. By mid 1952 the film had incurred expenses of £24,673.

The last roll of negative was destroyed in a plane crash on its way for developing in England. Chauvel re-shot these lost scenes at Kanangra Walls in the Blue Mountains and Jenolan Caves west of Sydney. Cave scenes were filmed in the River Cave, Diamond Cave, Imperial Cave, and Mud Tunnels at Jenolan. Editing and sound recording were completed in London.

The music was written by Isador Goodman. Elsa Chauvel, the director&#x27;s wife, replaced large parts of Goodman&#x27;s score with old-fashioned commercial &quot;mood&quot; music.

The Chauvels celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary during filming. Wason Byers, who had a small role, was arrested for stealing over £1,000 worth of cattle.

==Reception==

The film had its world premiere on 3 January 1955 at the Star Theatre in Darwin. The theatre&#x27;s manager Tom Harris arranged for a member of the Warhiti tribe &quot;to sing songs and burn sticks to prevent any unwanted rainfalls during the screening. He decorated the theatre for the opening with pandanus, grass mats and Aboriginal artefacts. Large crowds gathered along Smith Street to catch a glimpse of the film&#x27;s stars Ngarla Kunoth and Robert Tudawali were permitted to sit in the balcony with the Northern Territory Administrator Frank Wise and his wife.

The film then opened in Sydney in May. Its commercial reception was solid rather than sensational: Charles Chauvel Productions Ltd received £17,915 from the film in May and June 1955. The company&#x27;s name was changed to Jedda Ltd to help exploit the film. In December 1956 Jedda Ltd reported a profit of £50,454 for the year to 30 June, reducing the debit balance in the production account to £69,697. The film had been successful in Australia but performed disappointingly overseas.

The film was released in the UK as &quot;Jedda the Uncivilised&quot;.

Some time after the film was completed and released in locations around the world, the film in Gevacolor was found to have faded from ageing. In 1972 the film was reproduced from original tri-separations found in London.

This was Charles Chauvel&#x27;s last feature film. He had intended to adapt Kay Glasson Taylor&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wars of the Outer March&quot;, but was hired by the BBC to make the TV series &quot;Walkabout&quot;. Before he could resume work on his feature projects he died on 11 November 1959.

==Influence==
The making of the film inspired the play &quot;Burst of Summer&quot;.

<doc id="273595" wikidata="Q1642094" url="?curid=273595" title="Hematidrosis">
<text>Hematidrosis, also called hematohidrosis, haematidrosis, hemidrosis and blood sweat, is a very rare condition in which a human sweats blood. The term is from Ancient Greek / (/), meaning blood, and (), meaning sweat.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Blood usually oozes from the forehead, nails, umbilicus, and other skin surfaces. In addition, oozing from mucocutaneous surfaces causing nosebleeds, blood-stained tears, and vicarious menstruation are common. The episodes may be preceded by intense headache and abdominal pain and are usually self-limiting. In some conditions, the secreted fluid is more dilute and appears to be blood-tinged, while others may have darker, bright red secretions resembling blood.

While the extent of blood loss generally is minimal, hematidrosis also results in the skin becoming extremely tender and fragile.

== Causes ==
Hematidrosis is a condition in which capillary blood vessels that feed the sweat glands rupture, causing them to exude blood, occurring under conditions of extreme physical or emotional stress. Severe mental anxiety activates the sympathetic nervous system to invoke the fight-or-flight response to such a degree as to cause hemorrhage of the vessels supplying the sweat glands. It has been suggested that acute fear and extreme stress can cause hematidrosis.

== Diagnosis ==
Investigations such as platelet count, platelet aggregation test, coagulation profile, and skin biopsy reveal no abnormalities, and direct light microscopy of fluid demonstrates presence of normal red blood cells. Investigations also fail to show any vasculitis or skin appendages (i.e. sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles) abnormalities.

A 2015 case study investigated hematidrosis with a patient who has epilepsy.

== Treatment ==
Effects on the body include weakness and mild-to-moderate dehydration from the severe anxiety and both blood and sweat loss.

The condition is very rare, but there are reports in the medical literature of successful treatment with beta blockers (propranolol 10 mg), with significant reduction in the frequency of spontaneous blood oozing. The successful use of beta blockers supports the theory that the condition is induced by stress and anxiety. However, this etiology is not yet fully established, as the high prevalence of stress and anxiety in the modern era has not changed the incidence of this extremely rare disease, suggesting that other co-abnormalities also play a key role. Atropine sulfate transdermal patches have also been used successfully.

Favorable results with psychiatric counselling to reduce stress highlight the relationship between psychogenic causes and hematohidrosis.

==Instances==
Dermatological research notes the presence of hematidrosis in people awaiting execution. It has also been proposed as a possible explanation for Jesus&#x27; agony in the garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:44), and for claims associated with stigmata.

Leonardo da Vinci described a soldier who sweated blood before battle. The phenomenon has also been observed in individuals in fear for their lives; a case occurred during the London Blitz, and a case of fear of a storm while sailing, etc.

In 1867, printing and publishing firm, Hazell, Watson and Viney, opened an inkworks in a disused silk mill in California. In 1878, this was moved to purpose built premises on the Tring Road (opposite the current site of Tesco), which closed in 1952.

===20th century===
In 1924, the Bishop of Oxford transferred lands owned in California into the hands of the Municipal Borough of Aylesbury, which in 1929 was partially used in the construction of a new church and parsonage house, which is currently located on Penn Road.

<doc id="273602" wikidata="Q20679960" url="?curid=273602" title="List of presidents of Bolivia">
<text>The president of Bolivia is the head of state and head of government of Bolivia, directly elected to a five-year term by the Bolivian people. The officeholder leads the executive branch of the government and is the captain general of the Armed Forces of Bolivia.

Since the office was established in 1825, 65 men and 2 women have served as president. The first president, Simón Bolívar, was elected by the General Assembly of Deputies of the Province of Upper Peru. For purposes of numbering, members of jointly-ruling juntas and other governing bodies are not included in the official count of presidents, unless one member later assumed the presidency in their own right. Three presidents: Antonio José de Sucre, Germán Busch, and Hernán Siles Zuazo became, after a brief, non-consecutive, interim exercise of power, presidents for longer terms later. In these cases, they are numbered according to that second term. Therefore, Busch is counted as the 36th president, not the 35th, Siles Zuazo as the 46th instead of the 45th, etc.

The presidency of Pedro Blanco Soto, who was assassinated six days after taking office in 1828, was the shortest in Bolivian history. Evo Morales served the longest, over thirteen years, before resigning in 2019. He is the only president to have served more than two consecutive terms. José Miguel de Velasco and Víctor Paz Estenssoro each served for four terms. However, all of Velasco&#x27;s were non-consecutive and two were in an acting capacity while Paz Estenssoro only served twice consecutively in 1960 and 1964.

Three presidents died in office, one of natural causes and two through tragic circumstances (Adolfo Ballivián, Germán Busch, and René Barrientos). Three were assassinated (Pedro Blanco Soto, Agustín Morales, and Gualberto Villarroel). The latter resigned mere hours before his death. Additionally, Manuel Antonio Sánchez and Pedro José de Guerra died of natural causes while exercising provisional presidential functions while eight former presidents were assassinated after leaving office (Antonio José de Sucre, Eusebio Guilarte, Manuel Isidoro Belzu, Jorge Córdova, Mariano Melgarejo, Hilarión Daza, José Manuel Pando, and Juan José Torres).

Five vice presidents assumed the presidency during a presidential term (José Luis Tejada Sorzano, Mamerto Urriolagoitía, Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas, Jorge Quiroga, and Carlos Mesa). Tejada Sorzano was the first to do so in 1934 while Quiroga was the only one to complete the term of their predecessor (Tejada Sorzano extended his mandate past the term of his predecessor).

22 presidents were deposed in 23 coups d&#x27;état (1839, 1841; twice, 1848; twice, 1857, 1861, 1864, 1871, 1876, 1879, 1920, 1936, 1937, 1943, 1964, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1978; twice, 1979, and 1980). Velasco was deposed twice in 1841 and December 1848. Additionally, the Council of Ministers of Hernando Siles Reyes was deposed in 1930. Three presidents were deposed by a civil war, a popular uprising, and a revolution. Transmissions of command from one &quot;de facto&quot; government to another &quot;de facto&quot; government occurred in seven cases (1841, 1946, 1965, 1966, 1981; twice, and 1982). Two special cases occurred in 1939 when Carlos Quintanilla was installed by the military &quot;after&quot; the death of Germán Busch and in 1951 when President Mamerto Urriolagoitía resigned in a self-coup in favor of a military junta. Two unconstitutional successions occurred in 1930 when Hernando Siles Reyes entrusted command to his council of ministers and 1934 when Daniel Salamanca was ousted in favor of his vice president, José Luis Tejada Sorzano. Finally, some supporters of Evo Morales claim that he was ousted by a coup d&#x27;état and that the presidency of Jeanine Áñez was an unconstitutional succession of power. However, this is disputed.

There are seven living former presidents. The most recent to die was Luis García Meza, on 29 April 2018.

<doc id="273607" wikidata="Q2448770" url="?curid=273607" title="The History of Cardenio">
<text>The History of Cardenio, often referred to as simply Cardenio, is a lost play, known to have been performed by the King&#x27;s Men, a London theatre company, in 1613. The play is attributed to William Shakespeare and John Fletcher in a Stationers&#x27; Register entry of 1653. The content of the play is not known, but it was likely to have been based on an episode in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; involving the character Cardenio, a young man who has been driven mad and lives in the Sierra Morena. Thomas Shelton&#x27;s translation of the First Part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; was published in 1612 and would thus have been available to the presumed authors of the play.

Two existing plays have been put forward as being related to the lost play. A song, &quot;Woods, Rocks and Mountains&quot;, set to music by Robert Johnson, has also been linked to it.

==Attribution==
Although there are records of the play having been performed, there is no information about its authorship earlier than a 1653 entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register. The entry was made by Humphrey Moseley, a bookseller and publisher, who was thereby asserting his right to publish the work. Moseley is not necessarily to be trusted on the question of authorship, as he is known to have falsely used Shakespeare&#x27;s name in other such entries.
It may be that he was using Shakespeare&#x27;s name to increase interest in the play. However, some modern scholarship accepts Moseley&#x27;s attribution, placing the lost work in the same category of collaboration between Fletcher and Shakespeare as &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;. Fletcher based several of his later plays on works by Cervantes, so his involvement is plausible.

==Synopsis of &quot;Cardenio&quot;, the episode in the novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;==
After a few adventures together, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza discover a bag full of gold coins along with some papers, which include a sonnet describing the poet&#x27;s romantic troubles. Quixote and Sancho search for the person to whom the gold and the papers belong. They identify the owner as Cardenio, a madman living in the mountains.

Cardenio begins to tell his story to Quixote and Sancho: Cardenio had been deeply in love with Luscinda, but her father refused to let the two marry. Cardenio had then been called to service by Duke Ricardo, and befriended the duke&#x27;s son, Don Fernando. Fernando had coerced a young woman named Dorotea into agreeing to marry him, but when he met Luscinda, he decided to steal her from Cardenio. At this point in Cardenio&#x27;s narration, however, Quixote interrupts, prompting Cardenio to leave in a fit of violent madness. Quixote, inspired by Cardenio, decides to imitate the madness of various chivalric knights, and so sends Sancho away.

Coming to an inn, Sancho encounters the barber and the priest, who have been following Quixote with intentions to bring him back home. Following Sancho into the mountains, the barber and priest encounter Cardenio for themselves. Cardenio, back to his wits, relates his complete story to them: after sending Cardenio away on an errand, Fernando convinced Luscinda&#x27;s father to let him marry Luscinda instead. Luscinda then wrote to Cardenio, telling him of the planned wedding, and of her intentions to commit suicide rather than marry Fernando. Cardenio arrived at the wedding and, hidden, saw Luscinda agree to the exchange of vows, then promptly faint. Feeling betrayed, Cardenio left for the mountains.

After concluding his story, Cardenio and the two other men stumble upon a woman, who is revealed as being Dorotea. Having been scorned by Fernando, she had traveled to confront him, only to learn the events of the wedding, including the discovery of a dagger on Luscinda&#x27;s person after her fainting, and how she later ran away to flee Fernando and find Cardenio. Dorotea had then been driven into the mountains after her accompanying servant tried to force himself on her.

Reinvigorated by their meeting, Cardenio and Dorotea resolve to help each other regain their respective lovers. After helping the barber, the priest, and Sancho lure Quixote out of the mountains, Cardenio and Dorotea return to the inn with the others. At the inn, Cardenio and Dorotea find themselves suddenly reunited with Fernando and Luscinda. Cardenio and Luscinda redeclare their love for each other, while Fernando repents and apologizes to them all.

==Lewis Theobald and &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;==

In 1727, Lewis Theobald claimed to have obtained three Restoration-era manuscripts of an unnamed play by Shakespeare, which he edited, &quot;improved&quot;, and released under the name &quot;Double Falshood, or the Distrest Lovers&quot;. &quot;Double Falshood&quot; has the plot of the &quot;Cardenio&quot; episode in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

It has been suggested that Theobald was unable to publish the original script, because of Jacob Tonson&#x27;s exclusive copyright on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. But that contention has been discounted, as the Tonson copyright applied only to the plays he had already published, not to any newly discovered play by Shakespeare; and Theobald edited an edition of the complete works for Tonson, whose commercial interests would have been substantially bettered if he had been able to advertise the edition as containing a hitherto &quot;lost&quot; play. (A prior instance of commercially &quot;enhancing&quot; an edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays by adding new ones was the second reprint of the Third Folio of 1664, which added seven plays, only one of which (&quot;Pericles&quot;) has been accepted as at least partly by Shakespeare.)

The fate of Theobald&#x27;s three alleged manuscripts is unknown. The very existence of three genuine manuscripts of that age is problematical, and Theobald was said to have invited interested persons to view the alleged manuscript, but he then avoided actually displaying them. These facts have led many scholars to conclude that Theobald&#x27;s play was a hoax written by himself. However, more recent stylometric analysis may lead to the conclusion that &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; was based on one or more manuscripts written in part by Fletcher and in part by another playwright. The open question is whether that second playwright was Shakespeare. The text does not appear to contain many passages that may be even tentatively attributed to Shakespeare, but it is possible that Theobald so heavily edited the text that Shakespeare&#x27;s style was entirely submerged.

In the late period represented by Shakespeare&#x27;s known collaborations with Fletcher in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, his style had become so involved that it is difficult for a listener or even a reader to catch the meanings of many passages on a quick hearing or a first read, so Theobald might have found it necessary to alter the text in a way that made Shakespeare&#x27;s voice unrecognisable. However historian Michael Wood has found an &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; verse in the Theobald adaptation which he believes could only have been written by Shakespeare. Wood also asserts that the lyrics of at least one song by Shakespeare&#x27;s regular collaborator, composer Robert Johnson, are related to &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, indicating that Theobald had access to a genuine original text. As &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; is substantially shorter than any other play of Shakespeare&#x27;s and is completely lacking in a subplot, which all other Shakespearean plays have, it is likely that one of Theobald&#x27;s revisions was to remove a subplot from his manuscript version. The removed subplot likely would have included the characters of Don Quixote and Sancho, who are conspicuously absent from &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;.

In 2010, the Arden Shakespeare published &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; in its series of scholarly editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s collected works. The editor, Professor Brean Hammond, made a case for the Shakespearean origins of Theobald&#x27;s play. In 2011 the Royal Shakespeare Company presented an adaptation of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; as &quot;&quot;Cardenio&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x27;lost play&#x27; re-imagined,&quot; directed by Gregory Doran. The critic Michael Billington believes that this version is more suggestive of Fletcher than Shakespeare. In 2012 Terri Bourus directed a production of Gary Taylor&#x27;s &quot;unadaptation&quot; of &quot;Cardenio&quot;, an attempt to reverse Theobald&#x27;s alterations of the original. Taylor&#x27;s text, along with detailed evidence supporting the view that Theobald had used the original playscript, was published in a collection of essays the following year. This text subsequently received its UK premiere on 18 March 2017 at the Mary Wallace Theatre, Twickenham, in a production by Richmond Shakespeare Society in association with Cutpurse.

===&quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, a synopsis===
The stage play &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; varies its tone from that of the episode in the novel and gives the story a fast-moving comic treatment. This is noted in the preface that Theobald wrote in 1727. All of the characters are given new names for the play: Don Fernando becomes Henriquez, Cardenio becomes Julio, Luscinda becomes Leonora, Don Bernard is Leonora&#x27;s father, and Dorotea becomes Violante. The play borrows from the novel&#x27;s plot events leading to and including the wedding: Henriquez is in love with Leonora, who has planned to wed Julio. Julio is sent away on an errand, and Leonora is forced to the altar. She gets a letter to Julio alerting him, and he arrives as the wedding is occurring. The bride has a dagger hidden on her in order to commit suicide. Julio jumps out from behind a tapestry to stop the wedding, but he is overpowered. Earlier on, Henriquez had raped Violante, which motivates him, at the end, to marry her in order to make up for his misdeed. A significant difference between the stage play and the novel, in addition to the absence of Don Quixote and Sancho, is that the play contains a series of dramatic encounters between the principals that do not occur in the novel.

==Charles Hamilton and &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;==

In 1990, handwriting expert Charles Hamilton, after seeing a 1611 manuscript known as &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (usually attributed to Thomas Middleton), identified it as a text of the missing &quot;Cardenio&quot; in which the characters&#x27; names had been changed. This attribution has not gained much support among other authorities.

Several theatre companies have capitalised on Hamilton&#x27;s attribution by performing &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; under the name of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cardenio&quot;. For instance, a production at Oxford&#x27;s Burton Taylor Theatre in March 2004, claimed to have been the first performance of the play in England since its putative recovery (although a successful amateur production had premiered at Essex University&#x27;s Lakeside Theatre on 15 October 1998).

A full production of the play, which noted the contested authorship, was mounted at the Next Theatre in Evanston, Illinois in 1998. Another production of the play, billed as &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Cardenio&quot;, was staged by the Lone Star Ensemble in 2002 in Los Angeles, directed by James Kerwin.

In 2010 the Aporia Theatre began work on a new edit from translator and director Luis del Aguila and director Jonathan Busby. It was presented under Busby&#x27;s direction at the Warehouse Theatre, Croydon, in November 2010. Critic Michael Billington believes the play is more suggestive of Middleton than Shakespeare.

===&quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot;, a synopsis===
The main plot of &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; begins with &quot;the Tyrant&quot; overthrowing the previous king, Giovanus, and attempting to seduce Giovanus&#x27; wife, &quot;the Lady&quot;. When the Lady rejects the Tyrant&#x27;s advances, she and Giovanus are placed under house arrest. After another failed attempt at wooing the Lady, using her father as a middleman, the Tyrant sends soldiers to bring her to his bed by force. Learning of this, the Lady opts to commit suicide. Giovanus buries the Lady&#x27;s body, but the Tyrant, driven by lust, digs the corpse back up. The ghost of the Lady appears to Giovanus, telling him of what the Tyrant has done. Meanwhile, the Tyrant, seeing how pale the corpse of the Lady is, sends for a painter to paint it. Giovanus, disguised as a painter, paints the corpse with poison. After the Tyrant kisses the corpse, he succumbs to the poison and dies, allowing Giovanus to return to the throne.

Hamilton argued that &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; borrows for its plot the events of Cervantes&#x27; novel, leading up to the wedding ceremony of Luscinda and Don Fernando. According to him, Giovanus is Cardenio, the Tyrant is Don Fernando, and the Lady is Luscinda.

==Legacy and References==
&quot;The History of Cardenio&quot; is the MacGuffin in the graphic novel &quot;La pièce manquante&quot; (&quot;The Missing Play&quot;, 2023) by . 18th-century actress Peg Woffington is on a quest to find the play so that she can be the first person to play Dorotea. She counts with the help of her manager and friend Ignatius Sancho, with the story highlighting the coincidence of Sancho&#x27;s surname with Don Quixote&#x27;s squire, and is opposed by several interests. In the end of the story, the main characters believe the last copy of &quot;Cardenio&quot; was accidentally destroyed, yet a few secondary characters have instead smuggled it and perform it, with few resources and an amateur troupe, in Libertalia.

<doc id="273608" wikidata="Q7233833" url="?curid=273608" title="Postage stamps and postal history of India">
<text>Indian postal systems for efficient military and governmental communications had developed long before the arrival of Europeans. When the Portuguese, Dutch, French, Danish and British conquered the Marathas who had already defeated the Mughals, their postal systems existed alongside those of many somewhat independent states. The British East India Company gradually annexed the other powers on the sub-continent and brought into existence a British administrative system over most of modern-day India, with a need to establish and maintain both official and commercial mail systems.

Although the Indian Post Office was established in 1837, Asia&#x27;s first adhesive stamp, the Scinde Dawk, was introduced in 1852 by Sir Bartle Frere, the East India Company&#x27;s administrator of the province of Sind. The Indian postal system developed into an extensive, dependable and robust network providing connectivity to almost all parts of India, Burma, the Straits Settlements and other areas controlled by the East India Company (EIC). Based on the model postal system introduced in England by the reformer, Rowland Hill, efficient postal services were provided at a low cost and enabled the smooth commercial, military and administrative functioning of the EIC and its successor, the British Raj. The Imperial Posts co-existed with the several postal systems maintained by various Indian states, some of which produced stamps for use within their respective dominions, while British Indian postage stamps were required for sending mail beyond the boundaries of these states. Telegraphy and telephony made their appearance as part of the Posts before becoming separate departments. After the independence of India in 1947, the Indian postal service continues to function on a countrywide basis and provides many valuable, low cost services to the public of India. Pakistan has also had its own postal service since 1947, Burma since 1948, and Bangladesh since 1971.

==Postal history of India==
===Ancient and medieval India===
The history of India&#x27;s postal system begins long before the introduction of postage stamps. The antecedents have been traced to the systems of the Persian Empire instituted by Cyrus the Great and Darius I for communicating important military and political information. The Atharvaveda (or Arthveda) which is one of the oldest books in the world, records a messenger service in ancient India millenniums ago. Systems for collecting information and revenue data from the provinces are mentioned in Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra (meaning military strategy and skill)( century BCE).


The first Sultan of Delhi, before the Mughals colonised India, Qutb-ud-din Aybak was Sultan for only four years, 1206–1210, but he founded the Mamluk Dynasty and created a messenger post system. This was expanded into the &quot;dak chowkis,&quot; a horse and foot runner service, by Alauddin Khalji in 1296. Sher Shah Suri (1541–1545) replaced runners with horses for conveyance of messages along the northern Indian high road, today known as the Grand Trunk Road, which he constructed between Bengal and Sindh over an ancient trade route at the base of the Himalayas, the Uttarapatha. He also built 1700 &#x27;serais&#x27; where two horses were always kept for the despatch of the Royal Mail. Akbar introduced camels in addition to the horses and runners.

In the South of India, in 1672 Raja Chuk Deo of Mysore began an efficient postal service which was further improved upon by Haider Ali.

===Posts and the East India Company===

The East India Company took constructive steps to improve the existing postal systems in India when, in 1688, they opened a post office in Bombay followed by similar ones in Calcutta and Madras. Lord Clive further expanded the services in 1766 and in 1774 Warren Hastings made the services available to the general public. The fee charged was two annas per 100 miles. The postmarks applied on these letters are very rare and are named &#x27;Indian Bishop Marks&#x27; after Colonel Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom who introduced this practice in Britain. The Post Office Department of the East India Company was first established on 31 March 1774 at Calcutta, followed in 1778 at Madras and in 1792 at Bombay. After 1793, when Cornwallis introduced the Regulation of the Permanent Settlement, the financial responsibility for maintaining the official posts rested with the zamindars. Alongside these, private &quot;dawk&quot; mail systems sprang up for the commercial conveyance of messages using hired runners. Also, the East India Company created its own infrastructure for the expansion and administration of military and commercial power. The runners were paid according to the distance they travelled and the weight of their letters.

Carrying the mail was dangerous work:

The Post Office Act XVII of 1837 provided that the Governor-General of India in Council had the exclusive right of conveying letters by post for hire within the territories of the East India Company. Section XX required all private vessels to carry letters at prescribed rates for postage. A handstamp was applied to preadhesive ship letters. The mails were available to certain officials without charge, which became a controversial privilege as the years passed. On this basis the Indian Post Office was established on 1 October 1837.

The urgent European mails were carried overland &quot;via&quot; Egypt at the isthmus of Suez. This route, pioneered by Thomas Waghorn, linked the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, and thence by steamer &quot;via&quot; Marseille, Brindisi or Trieste to European destinations. The Suez Canal did not open until much later (17 November 1869). The time in transit for letters using the Overland Mail route was dramatically reduced. Waghorn&#x27;s route reduced the journey from 16,000 miles &quot;via&quot; the Cape of Good Hope to 6,000 miles; and reduced the time in transit from three months to between 35 and 45 days.

===The Scinde District Dawk===

The use of the Scinde Dawk adhesive stamps to signify the prepayment of postage began on 1 July 1852 in the Scinde/Sindh district, as part of a comprehensive reform of the district&#x27;s postal system. A year earlier Sir Bartle Frere had replaced the postal runners with a network of horses and camels, improving communications in the Indus river valley to serve the military and commercial needs of the British East India Company.

The new stamps were embossed individually onto paper or a wax wafer. The shape was circular, with &quot;SCINDE DISTRICT DAWK&quot; around the rim and the British East India Company&#x27;s Merchant&#x27;s Mark as the central emblem. The paper was either white or greyish white. The blue stamp was printed onto the paper by the die during the embossing, while the wax version was embossed on a red sealing wax wafer on paper; but all had the same value of 1/2 anna. They were used until October 1854, and then officially suppressed. These are quite scarce today, with valuations from US$700 to $10,000 for postally used examples. The unused red stamp was previously valued at £65,000.00 by Stanley Gibbons (basis 2006); however, it now appears that no unused examples have survived.

===1854 reforms and the first issues===

The first stamps valid for postage throughout India were placed on sale in October 1854 with four values: 1/2 anna, 1 anna, 2 annas, and 4 annas. Featuring a youthful profile of Queen Victoria &quot;aet.&quot; 15 years, all four values were designed and printed in Calcutta, and issued without perforations or gum. All were lithographed except for the 2 annas green, which was produced by typography from copper clichés or from electrotyped plates. The 4 annas value (illustrated) was one of the world&#x27;s first bicolored stamps, preceded only by the Basel Dove, a beautiful local issue.

These stamps were issued following a Commission of Inquiry which had carefully studied the postal systems of Europe and America. In the opinion of Geoffrey Clarke, the reformed system was to be maintained &quot;for the benefit of the people of India and not for the purpose of swelling the revenue.&quot; The Commissioners voted to abolish the earlier practice of conveying official letters free of postage (&quot;franking&quot;). The new system was recommended by the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, and adopted by the East India Company&#x27;s Court of Directors. It introduced &quot;low and uniform&quot; rates for sending mail efficiently throughout the country within the jurisdiction of the East India Company. The basic rate was 1/2 anna on letters not more than 1/4 tola in weight. The stamps were needed to show the postage was prepaid, a basic principle of the new system, like the fundamental changes of the British system advocated by Rowland Hill and the Scinde reforms of Bartle Frere. These reforms transformed mail services within India.
The East India Company already had attempted a 1/2 anna vermilion stamp in April 1854, known as the &quot;9½ arches essay&quot;. This could not be produced in quantity because it required an expensive vermilion pigment not readily available from England, and the substituted Indian pigment destroyed the printing stones.

A new design for stamps, with Queen Victoria in an oval vignette inside a rectangular frame, was inscribed &quot;EAST INDIA POSTAGE&quot;. These stamps were recess printed by De La Rue in England (who produced all the subsequent issues of British India until 1925). The first of these became available in 1855. They continued in use well after the British government took over the administration of India in 1858, following the 1857 Rebellion against the East India Company&#x27;s rule. From 1865 the Indian stamps were printed on paper watermarked with an elephant&#x27;s head.

===1866 reforms and the Provisionals===
The volume of mail moved by the postal system increased relentlessly, doubling between 1854 and 1866, then doubling again by 1871. The Post Office Act XIV introduced reforms by 1 May 1866 to correct some of the more apparent postal system deficiencies and abuses. Postal service efficiencies also were introduced. In 1863 new lower rates were set for &quot;steamer&quot; mail to Europe at 6 annas 8 pies for a 1/2 ounce letter. Lower rates were introduced for inland mail, as well.

New regulations removed the special postal privileges which had been enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for to combat the abuse of privileges by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the simple expedient of overprinting &#x27;Service&#x27; on postage stamps and &#x27;Service Postage&#x27; on revenue stamps. This innovation became widely adopted by other countries in later years.

Shortages developed, so these stamps also had to be improvised. Some of the &quot;Service Postage&quot; overprinted rarities of this year resulted from the sudden changes in postal regulations. New designs for the 4 annas and &quot;6 annas 8 pies&quot; stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six annas stamps were improvised by cutting the tops and bottoms from a current Foreign Bill revenue stamp, and overprinting &quot;POSTAGE&quot;.

Another four new designs appeared, one at a time, between 1874 and 1876.

A complete new set of stamps was issued in 1882 for the Empire of India that had been proclaimed five years earlier, in 1877. The designs consisted of the usual Victoria profile, in a variety of frames, inscribed &quot;INDIA POSTAGE&quot;. The watermark also changed to a star shape. These stamps were heavily used and are still quite common today.

Three stamps, featuring a detail from Heinrich von Angeli&#x27;s 1885 portrait of Queen Victoria, in 2, 3 and 5 rupee denominations, were introduced in 1895. Other existing designs were reprinted in new colours in 1900.

==Postal history of Indian states==

British India had hundreds of Princely States, some 652 in all, but most of them did not issue postage stamps. The stamp-issuing States were of two kinds: the Convention States and the Feudatory States. The postage stamps and postal histories of these States provide great challenges and many rewards to the patient philatelist. Many rarities are to be found here. Although handbooks are available, much remains to be discovered.

The convention states are those which had postal conventions (or agreements) with the Post Office of India to provide postal services within their territories. The adhesive stamps and postal stationery of British India were overprinted for use within each convention state. The first convention state was Patiala, in 1884, followed by others (Chamba, Faridkot (formerly feudatory; convention from 1887), Gwalior, Jind (formerly feudatory; convention from 1885) and Nabha) between 1885 and 1887. The stamps of the convention states all became invalid on 1 January 1951 when they were replaced with stamps of the Republic of India valid from 1 January 1950.

The feudatory states maintained their own postal services within their territories and issued stamps with their own designs. Many of the stamps were imperforate and without gum, as issued. Many varieties of type, paper, inks and dies are not listed in the standard catalogues. The stamps of each feudatory state were valid only within that state, so letters sent outside that state needed additional British India postage. The feudatory states, with their start and end years, were:

* Alwar (1877–1899)
* Bamra (1888–1893)
* Barwani (1921–1938)
* Bhopal (1876–1932)
* Bhor (1879–1901)
* Bijawar (1935–1937)
* Bundi (1894–1941)
* Bussahir (1895–1900)
* Bahawalpur (1947–1949)
* Charkhari (1894–1943)
* Cochin (1892–1933)
* Dhar (1897–1898)
* Duttia (1893–1916)
* Faridkot (1879–1900)
* Hyderabad (1869–1949)
* Idar (1939–1944)
* Indore (1886–1941)
* Jaipur (1900–1947)
* Jammu and Kashmir (1878–1886)
* Jammu (1866–1877)
* Jind (1874–1885)
* Kashmir (1866–1867)
* Jasdan (1942–1942)
* Jhalawar (1887–1887)
* Kishangarh (1899–1928)
* Las Bela (1897–1904)
* Morvi (1931–1935)
* Nandgaon (1892–1893)
* Nowanuggur (1877–1893)
* Orchha (1913–1939)
* Poonch (1876–1884)
* Rajasthan (1949–1949)
* Rajpipla (1880)
* Sirmur (1879–1899)
* Soruth (1864–1937)
* Travancore (1888–1946)
* Travancore-Cochin (1949–1950)
* Wadhwan (1888–1889)
Both Faridkot and Jind, as feudatory states, issued their own stamps before they joined the Postal Convention. Faridkot joined on 1 January 1887. Jind joined in July 1885; its stamps from the feudatory period became invalid for postage, but they continued to be used for revenue purposes.

==Early 20th century==
In 1902 a new series depicting King Edward VII generally reused the frames of the Victoria stamps, with some color changes, and included values up to 25 rupees. The higher values were often used for the payment of telegraph and parcel fees. Generally, such usage will lower a collector&#x27;s estimation of a stamp&#x27;s value; except those from remote or &quot;used abroad&quot; offices.

The 1911 stamps of King George V were more florid in their design. It is reported that George V, a philatelist, personally approved these designs. In 1919 a 1½ anna stamp was introduced, inscribed &quot;ONE AND HALF ANNA&quot;, but in 1921 this changed to &quot;ONE AND A HALF ANNAS&quot;. In 1926 the watermark changed to a pattern of multiple stars.

The first pictorial stamps appeared in 1931. The set of six, showing the fortress of Purana Qila, Delhi and government edifices, was issued to mark the government&#x27;s move from Calcutta to New Delhi. Another pictorial set of seven stamps, also showing buildings, commemorated George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1935.

The stamps issued in 1937 depicted various forms of mail transports, with King George VI&#x27;s effigy appearing on the higher values. A new issue in 1941, constrained by the austerity of World War II, consisted of rather plain designs using minimal amounts of ink and paper. As Indian Post Offices annually required some billions of stamps for postage, as a measure of economy the large pictorial stamps were immediately withdrawn and smaller stamps were issued. Even this did not ease the paper situation and it was thought desirable to reduce the size even more.

A victory issue in January 1946 was followed in November 1947 by a first Dominion issue, whose three stamps were the first to depict the Ashoka Pillar and the new flag of India (the third showed an aeroplane).

Postage stamps were generally issued separately from the revenue stamps. However, in 1906, the set of King Edward VII stamps were issued in two values, half anna and one anna with the caption &quot;INDIA POSTAGE &amp; REVENUE&quot;. The George V Series (1911 to 1933) added two more values, two annas and four annas to the Postage &amp; Revenue stamps. These dual-purpose issues were an exception and generally the two types were issued separately.

===India Security Press===

From 1 January 1926 all printing and overprinting of India&#x27; postage stamps was conducted at India Security Press, Nasik. The possibility of printing postage stamps and other security items in India had been enquired into before the First World War but could not be pursued at that time. In 1922, the feasibility of this issue was explored in England by Lt Col C.H. Willis, C.I.E., then master of the Bombay Mint, and Mr F.D. Ascoti, I.C.S., Controller of Printing, Stationery and Stamps. Their favourable report, followed by a successful demonstration of production techniques in Delhi in 1923, led to the decision of the Government to establish a security press at Nashik. The responsibility of setting up the Press was entrusted to none other than the London firm of Thomas De La Rue which already had a six-decade long association with Indian stamps. The construction began in 1924 at an original estimate of Rs 27½ lakhs and was completed in 1925 with additional costs of Rs 67 and 1/400,000.

The printing of stamps at Nasik began in 1925. The first stamps produced were the definitive series of George V, printed using typography from the same plates used earlier in England by De La Rue, which were now transferred to India. The watermark was changed by the Press to multiple stars. Lithography was now re-introduced and the first stamps printed with this technique were the first Air Mail series of 1929. The Security Press continued to use typography for most stamps, reserving the lithographic process for the most important commemorative issues, the next being the 1931 series commemorating the inauguration of New Delhi as the seat of government in 1931. The one rupee stamp shows the Secretariat and Dominion Columns. This practice continued after independence. The first definitive series to be issued was the misnamed &quot;Archaeological&quot; series of 16 values; the top four values were produced by lithography and the remaining values by typography.

The new technique of photogravure printing was installed in 1952. The October 1952 series of six values on the theme of Saints and Poets was the first to be so produced. However, these were not the first photogravure stamps of India, having been preceded by the first Gandhi series of 1948, which were printed by Courvoisier of Geneva using the photogravure technique. Since then, photogravure has been used to produce all Indian stamps; typography and lithography being reserved for service labels only.

==Independent India==

The First Stamp of Independent India was issued on 21 November 1947. It depicts the Indian Flag with the patriots&#x27; slogan, Jai Hind (Long Live India), on the top right hand corner. It was valued at three and one-half annas.

A memorial to Mahatma Gandhi was issued 15 August 1948 on the first anniversary of Independence. Exactly one year later a definitive series appeared, depicting India&#x27;s broad cultural heritage, mostly Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh and Jain temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses. A subsequent issue commemorated the inauguration of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950.

Definitives included a technology and development theme in 1955, a series all showing the map of India in 1957, denominated in naye paisa (decimal currency), and a series with a broad variety of images in 1965.
The old inscription of &quot;INDIA POSTAGE&quot; was replaced in 1962 with &quot;भारत INDIA&quot;, though three stamps issued between December 1962/January 1963 carried the earlier inscription.
India has printed stamps and postal stationery for other countries, mostly neighbours. Countries which have had stamps printed in India include Burma (before independence), Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Portugal, and Ethiopia.

==Today==
The Department of Posts, operating as India Post, is a government-operated postal system, simply referred to within India as &quot;the post office&quot;. With its far-flung reach and its presence in remote areas, the Indian postal service provides many services such as small savings banking and financial services. As of 31 March 2011, the Indian Postal Service has 154,866 post offices, of which 139,040 (89.78%) are in rural areas and 15,826 (10.22%) are in urban areas. It has 25,464 departmental POs and 129,402 ED BPOs. At the time of independence, there were 23,344 post offices, which were primarily in urban areas. Thus, the network has registered a sevenfold growth since Independence, with the expansion primarily in rural areas. On an average, a post office serves an area of 21.23 sq;km and a population of 7,114 people. India is believed to have the most widely distributed system in the world (China has 57,000, Russia 41,000 and the United States 38,000 offices). This proliferation of offices results from India&#x27;s history of having many disparate postal systems, eventually unified in the Indian Union after Independence.

India has been divided into 22 postal circles, each circle headed by a Chief Postmaster General. Each Circle is further divided into Regions comprising field units, called Divisions, headed by a Postmaster General, and further divided into units headed by SSPOs &amp; SPOs and Sub Divisions headed by ASPs and IPS. Other functional units like Circle Stamp Depots, Postal Stores Depots and Mail Motor Service exist in various Circles and Regions. Besides the 22 circles, there is a special Base Circle to provide the postal services for the Armed Forces of India. The Base Circle is headed by an Additional Director General, Army Postal Service holding the rank of a Major General.

Gandhi, Nehru and other historic personalities continued to appear on the postal issues coming from the country since Independence, with almost half a century seeing the Gandhi definitives of denominations most frequently used in the era concerned, becoming synonymous with a postage stamp to the Indian people of that respective time period. New themes are now finding their place on Indian postage stamps, with some stamps issued jointly with postal agencies of other countries, renewable energy sources, the local flora and fauna and even the special annual issues wishing season&#x27;s greetings. On 9 March 2011 India Post launched an online e-post office. The portal provides electronic money orders, instant money orders, stamps for collectors, postal information, tracking of express and international shipments, PIN code search and registration of feedback and complaints online.

===National Philatelic Museum===
The National Philatelic Museum of India was inaugurated on 6 July 1968 in New Delhi. It had its beginning at a meeting of the &quot;Philatelic Advisory Committee&quot; on 18 September 1962. Besides the large collection of India Postage stamps designed, printed and issued, it has a large collection of Indian states, both confederate and feudatory, early essays, proofs and colour trials, a collection of Indian stamps &quot;used abroad&quot; and as well as early Indian postcards, postal stationery and thematic collections.

The museum was extensively renovated in 2009. It now includes more exhibits, a philatelic bureau and other postal objects such as beautiful Victorian post boxes.

An international philatelic exhibition was held from 12 to 18 February 2011, on the centenary of India&#x27;s first official air mail. For the occasion of INDIPEX 2011 India Post brought out a special stamp on Mahatma Gandhi to commemorate the event. It is printed on &quot;khadi&quot;, the handspun cotton material that Gandhi held out as the symbol of self-determination and self-reliance. The Presentation Pack was released by Pratibha Patil, the President of India on Saturday 12 February 2011 at INDIPEX 2011, the World Philatelic Exhibition held in New Delhi, the capital of India.

<text>A diamond jubilee celebrates the 60th anniversary of a significant event related to a person (e.g. accession to the throne or wedding, among others) or the 60th anniversary of an institution&#x27;s founding. The term is also used for 75th anniversaries, although the human lifespan makes this usage more common for institutions.

== Western monarchies ==
George III of the United Kingdom died nine months before his diamond jubilee was due in 1820. The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria celebrated her 60-year reign on 22 June 1897. The Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, was celebrated across the Commonwealth of Nations throughout 2012.

== Asian monarchies ==

In East Asia, the diamond jubilee coincides with the traditional 60-year sexagenary cycle, which is held in special importance despite not generally being called a &quot;diamond jubilee.&quot; Monarchs such as the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of China and Emperor Hirohito of Japan held celebrations for their 60th year of reign, as did King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand on 10 June 2006.

National governments also mark their 60th anniversary as diamond jubilees, as did the Republic of Korea in 2005 and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 2009. In South Asia, the term is also used for certain 100-day anniversaries. In the Indian and Pakistani film industries, a &quot;diamond jubilee&quot; film is a title that has been featured in cinemas for 100 days, and beyond.

== African monarchies ==
The longest reigning monarch in history, Sobhuza II of Swaziland, celebrated his (60 year) diamond jubilee in 1981, dating from when he gained direct rule. There does not appear to have been any (75 year) diamond jubilee celebration.
== List of diamond jubilees ==
In 1984, the phrase &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot; was used by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in its logo for the sixtieth anniversary of the studio.
In 2015 it marked Disneyland Park&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee to celebrate 60 years. In 2025, Singapore will celebrate the diamond jubilee year from independence from Malaysia with the inaugural event on 31st December 2024.

<doc id="273617" wikidata="Q2369783" url="?curid=273617" title="Demographics of Wales">
<text>Demographics of Wales include population, place of birth, age, ethnicity, religion, and number of marriages in Wales.

==Historical population==


The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851, and to 1,122,000 in 1911. Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death-rates dropped and birth-rates remained steady. However, there was also a large-scale migration of people into Wales during the Industrial Revolution.

==Current population==
The 2021 census showed Wales&#x27; population to be 3,107,500, the highest in its history. In 2011, 27 per cent (837,000) of the total population of Wales were not born in Wales, including 636,000 people (21 per cent of the total population of Wales) who were born in England. The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, including the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and the nearby valleys, with another significant population in the north-east around Wrexham and Flintshire.According to the 2001 census, 96 per cent of the population was White British, and 2.1 per cent non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland, though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to other regions of the United Kingdom.
The 2001 UK census was criticised in Wales for not offering &quot;Welsh&quot; as an option to describe respondents&#x27; national identity. Partly to address this concern, the 2011 census asked the question &quot;How would you describe your national identity?&quot;. Respondents were instructed to &quot;tick all that apply&quot; from a list of options that included Welsh. The outcome was that 57.5 per cent of Wales&#x27; population indicated their sole national identity to be Welsh; a further 7.1 per cent indicated it to be both Welsh and British. No Welsh national identity was indicated by 34.1 per cent. The proportion giving their sole national identity as British was 16.9 per cent, and another 9.4 per cent included British with another national identity. No British national identity was indicated by 73.7 per cent. 11.2 per cent indicated their sole national identity as English and another 2.6 per cent included English with another national identity.

The 2011 census showed Wales to be less ethnically diverse than any region of &#x27;England and Wales&#x27;: 93.2 per cent classed themselves as White British (including Welsh, English, Scottish or Northern Irish), 2.4 per cent as Other White (including Irish), 2.2 per cent as Asian (including Asian British), 1 per cent as Mixed, and 0.6 per cent as Black (African, Caribbean, or Black British). The lowest proportion of White British (80.3 per cent) was in Cardiff.

In 2001, a quarter of the Welsh population were born outside Wales, mainly in England; about 3 per cent were born outside the UK. The proportion born in Wales varies across the country, with the highest percentages in the South Wales valleys and the lowest in Mid Wales and parts of the north-east. In both Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil, 92 per cent were Welsh-born, compared with only 51 per cent and 56 per cent in the border counties of Flintshire and Powys. Just over 1.75 million Americans report themselves to have Welsh ancestry, as did 440,965 Canadians in Canada&#x27;s 2006 census.

The total fertility rate (TFR) in Wales was 1.90 in 2011, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. The majority of births are to unmarried women (58 per cent of births in 2011 were outside marriage). About one in 10 births (10.7 per cent) in 2011 were to foreign-born mothers, compared to 5.2 per cent in 2001.
==Vital statistics==


(c) = Census results.

===Current vital statistics===


==Place of birth==
According to the 2011 census 2.2 million (73%) of the usual residents were born in Wales, a reduction of two percent since 2001. In 2001, 590,000 (20%) of the population of Wales was born in England. By 2011, the proportion of English-born citizens of Wales had increased by one percent to 21%. In 2011, 27% (837,000) of the total population of Wales were born outside Wales, and of these immigrants 636,000 (76%) were born in England.

Below are the 5 largest foreign-born groups in Wales according to 2014 ONS estimates.


==Age==

According to the 2011 census, some 563,000 of the population were aged 65 and over, an increase of 56,700 or one percent since 2001. As in 2001, six per cent (178,000) of the population in Wales were children under five, an increase of 11,300.

==National identity==
=== 2011 ===
A question on national identity was asked in the 2011 census: &quot;What do you feel is your national identity?&quot; Respondents could identify themselves as having one or more national identity.

An analysis of the 2011 data by Manchester University&#x27;s Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity revealed that:
*58% identified as &quot;Welsh only&quot;
*16% identified as &quot;British only&quot;
*12% identified as &quot;English only&quot;
*7% identified as &quot;Welsh and British&quot;

The remainder chose other national identities. The Welsh-Caribbean population were the most likely to respond as &quot;Welsh Only&quot;, at 59% of 11,099 citizens.

=== 2018 ===
A 2018 poll, commissioned by the BBC and carried out by YouGov, found that almost eight in 10 (79%) people in Wales identified strongly as British; while six in 10 (62%) identified strongly as Welsh.

=== 2020 ===
A 2020 YouGov poll asking a sample of 1110 people &quot;Which, if any, of the following best describes the way you think of yourself?&quot; found the following responses:

* 21% &quot;Welsh not British&quot;
* 17% &quot;More Welsh than British&quot;
* 22% &quot;Equally Welsh and British&quot;
* 9% &quot;More British than Welsh&quot;
* 17% &quot;British not Welsh&quot;
* 11% &quot;Other&quot;
* 3% &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot;

==== Summary ====
Total Welsh at all: 69%

Total at least more Welsh than British: 38%

Total at least more British than Welsh: 26%

==Ethnicity==

According to the 2011 census, 2.2 million (73%) of usual residents of Wales were born there, two percent less than in 2001. The change can be attributed to both international and internal migration. In 2001, 590,000 (20%) of the population of Wales was born in England. In 2011, this had increased by one percent. Nearly 418,000 people identified themselves as Welsh in 2001. The 1991, 2001 and 2011 census estimated the following ethnic groups:

==Religion==
*There are no solid statistics covering Christian denominations in Wales. However it is clear that the Presbyterian Church of Wales, a Nonconformist denomination, and the Church in Wales, part of the Anglican Church, have historically been the largest. Important to Wales have been Nonconformist denominations, which became widespread in the 18th century, and Roman Catholicism until the 16th century. The translation of the Bible into Welsh by William Morgan in 1588 not only helped the survival of the Welsh language (after the Laws in Wales Acts effectively outlawed it in public life) but also enabled a faster uptake of Protestantism. 
*A Jewish community has existed in Wales since the 13th century or earlier, but there are now only about 2,000 Jews left (since peaking at around 5,000 in 1913), and most live in the Cardiff area. There used to be enough Jews to sustain synagogues in valley communities like Merthyr Tydfil and Tredegar, but there are now only three active synagogues in the whole country.
*Wales before Christianity had a Celtic religion. Wales retained Celtic aspects in the church during the Middle Ages.

==Language==

The 2011 census collected information about English and Welsh language proficiency. In 2011, 2.9 million (97%) of residents age three and over spoke English or Welsh. In a further 18,000 households, at least one adult spoke English or Welsh. In 22,000 households, no resident spoke either language. There were 562,000 (19%) residents over age three proficient in at least speaking the Welsh language. This was a reduction of approximately two per cent compared to 2001, though the method of analysis differed between the two censuses. There was also a two per cent increase in those over three years of age who had no Welsh language skills.


:Source: &quot;2011 Census: KS207WA Welsh language skills, unitary authorities in Wales, Accessed 23 December 2012&quot;

The most common main languages spoken in Wales according to the 2011 census are shown below.

==Marriage and civil partnership==
In 2011, those who were married were still the largest marriage or civil partnership status group in Wales for residents aged 16 and over, though since 2001 this group has decreased by 37,000 (over 5%). In contrast, single people (i.e. those who have never married or been part of a same sex partnership), have increased by 190,000 (6%) in the ten-year period. Civil partnerships, which were given legal status in 2005, appear for the first time in the census results. The number of widows, widowers and surviving partners is 20,000 lower than in 2001. The final groups, relating to separation and divorce or legal dissolution of civil partnerships, have both seen an increase in both numerical and relative terms since 2001.

Table key
* Single = Single never married or registered a same-sex civil partnership)
* Divorced or legally dissolved = divorced or formerly in a same-sex civil partnership which is now legally dissolved
* Widowed or surviving partner = Widowed or surviving partner from a same-sex civil partnership
* Separated = Separated (but still legally married or still legally in a same-sex civil partnership)
* Civil partnership = In a registered same-sex civil partnership

:Source: &quot;2011 Census: KS103EW Marital and civil partnership status, unitary authorities in Wales, Accessed 23 December 2012&quot;

== Military staff and veterans ==

Out of all the armed services, the Army has the largest presence in Wales, with over 1,400 personnel based there. As of 2019, there were 3,230 military and civilian personnel based in Wales.

In the 2021 census, around 115,000 people in Wales reported that they had previously served in the armed forces, around 4.5% of usual residents in Wales aged 16 years or older.

==Miscellaneous data==
* Population density (2006): 143 people per square kilometre
* Fertility rate: 1.90 (2007)
* In 2010, 58% of births were outside marriage in Wales. Currently, Wales and Scotland are the only countries of the United Kingdom where the majority of births are outside of marriage (51.3% of births in Scotland in 2012 were outside of marriage). Wales (along with Scotland) also had the highest death rate (10.9 per thousand) in 2005.

<text>Channel 4 News is the main news programme on British television broadcaster Channel 4. It is produced by ITN, and has been in operation since Channel 4&#x27;s launch in November 1982.

==Current productions==
===&quot;Channel 4 News&quot;===
&quot;Channel 4 News&quot; is the name of Channel 4&#x27;s main evening news programme.

The editor is Esme Wren, appointed in 2022.
The programme is presented by Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Cathy Newman, Matt Frei, Jackie Long and Fatima Manji and is on the air Monday to Thursday from 7:00 to 7:55 pm, Friday from 7:00 to 7:30 pm, and at variable times at weekends. Alex Thomson is the chief correspondent.

Channel 4 News has been on air since the channel launched in 1982. The channel wanted its news to be very different from what was on offer elsewhere on UK TV. As Channel 4&#x27;s commissioner for news, Liz Forgan, put it, she wanted: &quot;no sport, no royal stories, no plane crashes and lashing of foreign news.&quot;

This was a problem for ITN, which had won the contract to produce the programme, and which specialised in exactly the kind of fast-moving tabloid-style bulletins Forgan did not want. A new team was put together to produce the show. At Channel 4&#x27;s insistence, the editor, Derrik Mercer, was brought in from outside ITN, as were many of the staff. Mercer was a distinguished newspaperman but he had never worked in broadcasting. When the new show went on air there were many problems. The lead presenter, Peter Sissons, later described it as &quot;an unmitigated disaster.&quot;

But, gradually, the team worked out production solutions. Mercer left the show. He was replaced by a senior ITN executive, Paul McKee; and then by a very experienced ITN journalist Stewart Purvis. The ratings began to pick up. The show found its feet during the year-long UK miners&#x27; strike that started in 1984. By the time the strike ended, Channel 4 News had established itself as a force to be reckoned with. It started to win awards - the first was an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, which in 1985 named the show the Best News or Current Affairs Programme of 1984; and in 1987 it won its first BAFTA for the Best News or Outside Broadcast of 1986.

&quot;Channel 4 News&quot; went on to win many more awards, including, in 2006, a record five Royal Television Society Television awards. These included TV Journalist of the Year for Jon Snow; the Home News Award; and the International News Award.

It won the News Coverage British Academy Television Award in 2004 and the 2004 International Emmy for the best news programme produced and aired outside the United States. Jon Snow won the Richard Dimbleby British Academy Television Award in 2005 for outstanding contribution to the world of news and current affairs.

In November 2011, Liam Dutton became Channel 4&#x27;s first ever weather presenter, joining from BBC Weather. The exposé of Cambridge Analytica in conjunction with &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; which aired in 2018 won a Peabody Award.

In April 2021, Channel 4 and ITN announced that Snow would leave the programme after 32 years. His last show was on 23 December 2021.

===&quot;Channel 4 News Summary&quot;===
A replacement for the &quot;Channel 4 News at Noon&quot; in the 12.00 pm slot, it first aired on 21 December 2009, giving a five-minute summary of the news.

==Former productions==
===&quot;Channel Four News at Noon&quot;===
&quot;Channel Four News at Noon&quot; was first introduced in 2003 for the duration of the Iraq War, and due to its instant success, it was kept on in Channel 4&#x27;s daytime schedule (except when live Horse Racing was being broadcast). It was presented by Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Prior to this bulletin, the programme in the slot was &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, a political news programme, also produced for Channel 4 by ITN. As a consequence of the advertising slowdown during the 2009 recession, the programme was cancelled, along with &quot;More4 News&quot; and replaced with the five minute &quot;Channel 4 News Summary&quot;, the last broadcast airing on 18 December 2009.

===&quot;More4 News&quot;===

Aired Monday to Friday on sister channel More4, &quot;More4 News&quot; was anchored by Sarah Smith then later Kylie Morris, it ran for 30 minutes, aiming to go in-depth into a certain issue. As a consequence of the advertising slowdown during the 2009 recession, the programme was cancelled, along with the &quot;Channel Four News at Noon&quot;, the last broadcast airing on 18 December 2009.

===Design team===
==Non-broadcast media==
&quot;Channel 4 News&quot; also produces a variety of non-broadcast media, including a range of journalist authored blogs to deliver insight and analysis of the news from the news team. &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; also produces &quot;Snowmail&quot;, a free daily email from the news reporter team, giving their personal take on the day&#x27;s news agenda and behind-the-scenes newsroom goings-on.

==Historical roles==
In 2003, &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; broke the story of the Dodgy Dossier which led to a political crisis in Britain.

The story of the Conservative Party&#x27;s election expenses scandal was first broken, and then pursued for over a year, by Michael Crick.

In March 2018, an undercover investigation by &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; explored the campaign activities of Cambridge Analytica.

==Retractions==
On the evening of the 2017 Westminster attack, &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; claimed they were able to name the dead attacker as Abu Izzadeen, also known as Trevor Brooks. The claim was repeated by &quot;The Independent&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. However, &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; was forced to issue an on-air retraction during the same bulletin after Izzadeen&#x27;s solicitor stated that he was alive and serving time in prison.

==Theme music==
The music in the &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; titles is an orchestration of &quot;Best Endeavours&quot; by Alan Hawkshaw. It was introduced a few months after the channel&#x27;s launch, and has remained in use since its inception.

<doc id="273623" wikidata="Q1516929" url="?curid=273623" title="Postal history">
<text>Postal history is the study of postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of the use of postage stamps and covers and associated postal artifacts illustrating historical episodes in the development of postal systems. The term is attributed to Robson Lowe, a professional philatelist, stamp dealer and stamp auctioneer, who made the first organised study of the subject in the 1930s and described philatelists as &quot;students of science&quot;, but postal historians as &quot;students of humanity&quot;. More precisely, philatelists describe postal history as the study of rates, routes, markings, and means (of transport).

==A collecting speciality==
Postal history has become a philatelic collecting speciality in its own right. Whereas traditional philately is concerned with the study of the stamps &quot;per se&quot;, including the technical aspects of stamp production and distribution, philatelic postal history refers to stamps as historical documents; similarly re postmarks, postcards, envelopes and the letters they contain. Postal history can include the study of postal rates, postal policy, postal administration, political effects on postal systems, postal surveillance and the consequences of politics, business, and culture on postal systems; basically anything to do with the function of the collection, transportation and delivery of mail. The specialized area of philatelic history defines postal history as the study of rates charged for postal services provided, routes followed and special handling of letters. Areas of special interest include disrupted or transitional periods, such as wars and military occupations, and mail to remote areas.

The philatelic-based definition of the term developed as the discipline developed. Philatelic students discovered that understanding and authentication of stamps depended on knowing why postal authorities issued particular stamps, where they were used and how. For instance, a stamp apparently used before any other stamp of its type could be proved a forgery if it was postmarked at a location known not to have received any stamps until a later date.

Much information is still not known about the workings of postal systems, and millions of old covers have survived, constituting a rich field of &quot;artifacts&quot; for analysis.

==Possible areas of study==
In studying or collecting any postal history subject some overlap is inevitable because it is impossible to separate the different areas that affect the mail from one another; transportation, rates, geography and subject are all intertwined, but the emphasis remains different depending on the chosen topic. The postal history topics described below are some of the better known and popular topics.

===Geographically based studies===

* Regional studies are typically based on a geographical area, such as countries of origin, native districts, cities, towns or villages, places associated with family roots, or workplaces. In the past collectors usually based their studies on &quot;mail from,&quot; but &quot;mail to&quot; and &quot;mail through&quot; a place expand the postal service story because outgoing mail mainly shows marking associated with the areas of study while incoming mail tells a much broader story and are now more likely to be included. It is best to select a topic to study that is broad enough because narrow geographical boundaries will likely bring frustration due to the lack of material available. Examples are: &quot;Postal History of Brünn 1638-1875&quot;, and &quot;Private and Foreign Post Offices in St. Thomas&quot;.
* Postal routes are alternate geographical based study areas that provide great variety due to the many places and services available along a route. For instance; a study of the Thurn und Taxis route from Antwerp to Florence via Mantua would include much of the early postal history of Western Europe and the &quot;Postal History of the First Transcontinental Railroad&quot; can show a good range of stamps, stationery, and associated marking across 3,000 miles that started in 1869.

The era for a geographical based study can add dimension depending on the services available or the changes that took place. The period should seek to tell a complete story and not limit the chosen topic.
===Transportation based studies===
* Aerophilately specialises in the study of airmail. Philatelists observe the development of mail transport by air from its beginning, and most aspects of airmail service have been extensively studied and documented by specialists, some of which are individually listed. Crash covers, Imperial Airways Empire route mail to Australia and South Africa, CAM (Contract Air Mail) or FAM (Foreign Air Mail) routes to and from the United States are a few topics.
* Balloon mail was employed during the Siege of Paris to get mail out of the city during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Balloons can be both manned and unmanned but balloon mail is not a common form of mail transport.
* Maritime mail is a theme that offers a wide variety of possibilities. Study of a particular shipping line like, Cunard, P &amp; O, Danube steamers, South American packets or American steamboat mail are a few options as are; Ship Letter marks, mail between a mother country and its colonies or mail between two countries separated by seas or oceans. Many ships applied their own s so collecting examples of all ships of a particular shipping line can be aspired to. Maiden voyages and wreck covers are very desirable. Maritime mail rates changed frequently and occasionally varied for different shipping lines over the same route that could be due to treaty changes or arguments between countries that involved retaliatory rates. Naval mail can also fall in the Military mail category and are also known to apply identifying endorsements or postmarks.
* Railway mail refers to mail carried partly, or fully, by rail transport from its inception in 1830 between Liverpool and Manchester in the UK until its decline in the late 20th century that include Railway letter stamped mail, TPO and RPO handstamps, instructional handstamps or manuscript notations, or even the First transcontinental railroad (also mentioned as a geographic study above).
* Rocket mail is the delivery of mail by rocket or missile and is a specialised collecting area of aerophilately called Astrophilately. One of the early famous rocketeers was Stephen Smith, a Secretary of the Indian Airmail Society, who launched 270 rockets between 1934 and 1944 of which 80 contained mail. Other topics for consideration are: USPS rocket mail from 1936 or 1959 launches, Russian submarine-launched rocket mail, or reusable launch vehicle mail.
* Zeppelin mail is a popular topic for the mail carried on the German Zeppelin airships between 1908 and 1939. Much mail exists because up to 12 tons was carried on each flight. Mail from within Germany and from the several trans-Atlantic flights are extant however mail from the famous Hindenburg disaster are very scarce.

===Subject based studies===


* Express mail is an accelerated delivery service for which the customer pays a surcharge and receives faster delivery. &quot;Haste Poste Haste&quot; letters of the 17th century can be considered precursors of modern Express mail as was the Pony Express mail. The service for domestic mail is governed by a country&#x27;s own postal administration but since 1998 the international accelerated delivery services are governed by the EMS Cooperative of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). Studies of domestic, or international express mail are possible as are studies of the Express mail rates.
* Marcophily is the study of postmarks, cancellation and postal markings applied by hand or machine. Though not strictly speaking a postal history topic can be collected as such. It offers vast areas to select a topic for study or collection as the marcopholist is more interested in the details, style and design of the markings than the reason why and where a letter was sent. Large cities that have many post offices offer great study opportunities due to the vast range of handstamps or machine cancellations in use over any time period.
* Military mail is mail associated with any of the armed services or peacekeeping forces, or formed around any particular military campaign, like the First and Second Opium Wars, Spanish Civil War, World War I and II, or even the recent conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq. Covers mailed from navy vessels are also widely sought, the cover usually having a distinctive postmark bearing the ship&#x27;s name and date of mailing, the date often being of particular historical significance and interest. Many older letters from these sources, when available, provide insight into the conditions of the people involved.
* Parcel post is perhaps the least collected, or studied, area of postal history due to the size of potential material much of which is never saved. From 1883 Special labels were applied to parcels in Great Britain. International parcels handling tend to gather Customs evidence making for attractive material.
* Postal censorship, both overt and covert, has been performed on mail long before the World Wars of the 20th century and can include both civil and military censorship. It has mainly taken place during times of conflict though has also been performed during other times like; periods of civil disorder or a state of emergency. An example of covert postal censorship is the Cabinet noir.
* Postal rates are an extensive area of study that can be made by country, time period, or even currency. Postal rates were often set bilaterally, by postal conventions between nations, such as the 1817 and 1837 postal treaties between France and Prussia, and the 1847 and 1853 conventions between the United States and Bremen (a city-state at the time). Stamp collectors may study the rates in effect during the time of issue of the postage stamps they collect thereby augmenting their collections.
* Postal stationery are mailable products, issued by postal authorities, such as envelopes, letter sheets, postcards, lettercards, aerograms or wrappers, on which the amount of postage has usually been pre-printed with an imprinted stamp or &quot;indicium&quot;, at the rate required for a particular postal service. Postal stationery is generally sold at post offices. Each stationery type can be an area of study in its own right but can also be studied by country or by time period. Studies of mint (unused) postal stationery are considered to be traditional philately, while studies of how postal stationery was used are considered to be postal history.
* Pre-adhesive mail, also called pre-stamp mail, is mail used before the issuance of the Penny Black and Two pence Blue stamps on 6 May 1840 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and in other countries, mail used prior to the postal authority adopting their own adhesive labels. The material can range from court and government letters before official public mail services to distinctive town-marks worldwide.
* Prisoner-of-war mail can be a subcategory of either, or both, Military mail or Postal censorship.
* Registered mail are often used to mail items, or documents, considered valuable and need a chain of custody that provides more control than regular mail. The letters have their details recorded in a register to enable their location to be tracked and offer many distinctive handstamps. Many countries have issued special postal stationery for Registered mail expanding the possible areas being studied beyond regular registered letters. Earlier similar services were known as &quot;Money Letters&quot;

<text>Thomas Francis Wilson Jr. (born April 15, 1959) is an American actor, stand-up comedian, musician, podcaster, and YouTuber. He is best known for playing Biff Tannen, Griff Tannen, and Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film trilogy (1985–1990). He played coach Ben Fredricks in the comedy series &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; (1999–2000) and voices various characters, mainly villains, on the animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (2001–present).

==Early life==
Thomas Francis Wilson Jr. was born in Philadelphia on April 15, 1959, and grew up in nearby Wayne. While attending Radnor High School, he was involved in dramatic arts, served as president of the debate team (where his partner was future &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks), played the tuba in the high school band, and was the drum major of the school marching band. He studied international politics at Arizona State University and attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. In 1979, he got his first significant stage experience as a comedian.

==Career==
In 1981, Wilson moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. He shared an apartment with fellow aspiring comedians Andrew Dice Clay and Yakov Smirnoff, and later joked that he &quot;taught them both about America&quot;. He had a small role in the second season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Knight Rider&quot; in an episode titled &quot;A Knight In Shining Armor&quot;.

Wilson&#x27;s breakthrough role was as the bully Biff Tannen in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. He returned in the sequels &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, reprising his role as Biff, and as Biff&#x27;s grandson Griff Tannen and great-grandfather Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen. In each &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film, his character ends up in a pile of manure after trying to kill or hurt Michael J. Fox&#x27;s character Marty McFly. He reprised his role as Biff and voiced various Tannen relatives in the animated series. Wilson did not reprise his role as Biff in the initial versions of Telltale&#x27;s &quot;Back to the Future: The Game&quot; released in 2011, being replaced by Kid Beyond. When the game was ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in 2015 in commemoration of the original film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Wilson returned to provide Biff&#x27;s voice in these newer versions. Wilson found the car scene in the first &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, in which he molests Lea Thompson&#x27;s character, Lorraine the most difficult scene he shot. In between takes Wilson whispered to Thompson &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry, Lea.&quot; to which Thompson replied with &quot;It&#x27;s just acting, Tom.&quot;

In 1992, he voiced gangster Tony Zucco in &quot;&quot; and police detective Matt Bluestone in the animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. In 1994, Wilson was briefly reunited with his &quot;Back to the Future&quot; co-star Christopher Lloyd in the film &quot;Camp Nowhere&quot;. He later went to co-star with Mark Hamill in the video game &quot;Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger&quot;. It was the third chapter in the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series, but the first to feature live action. The character played by Wilson was Major Todd &quot;Maniac&quot; Marshall, a fellow starfighter pilot to Hamill&#x27;s character. Wilson starred in the sequels &quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot; (1995) and &quot;Wing Commander: Prophecy&quot; (1997) and contributed his voice to the animated series &quot;Wing Commander Academy&quot; (1996) in the same role. He guest starred in an episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; in 1997.

Wilson played McKinley High School&#x27;s Coach Ben Fredricks in the 1999–2000 NBC comedy drama &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;.

Wilson has done voice-over work for the Nickelodeon television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. He has voiced many villainous characters that are physically strong and menacing, such as Flats the Flounder in the third-season episode &quot;The Bully&quot;, The Tattletale Strangler in &quot;SpongeBob Meets the Strangler&quot;, and the non-villainous character Reg the Club Bouncer in &quot;No Weenies Allowed&quot;. In 2005, he played Coach Phelps in the TV series &quot;Zoey 101&quot;.

In 2009, he released his first stand-up comedy special and second comedy album, &quot;Tom Wilson: Bigger Than You&quot;.

According to a 2012 Gawker article, the rise in popularity of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; series led many people to repeatedly ask Wilson questions about the films and his co-stars. Because he found the repetitive nature of the questions to be both amusing and frustrating, he wrote a song about them titled &quot;Biff&#x27;s Question Song&quot; which he includes in his stand-up routine. He hosted a podcast, &quot;Big Pop Fun&quot;, on the Nerdist Network from 2011 to 2014. The podcast featured Wilson sharing stories of his career, as well as informal chats with show business friends including Samm Levine, Blake Clark, Steve Oedekerk and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.

Wilson maintains a YouTube channel, where he regularly vlogs. As of March 2023, his channel has over 36,100 subscribers.

==Personal life==
Wilson married Caroline Thomas on July 6, 1985. They have four children, and live in Los Angeles, California. 

Wilson is a devout Catholic and released a contemporary Christian album in 2000 called &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;. He is a painter in his spare time, and many of his paintings focus on classic children&#x27;s toys. In 2006, he was selected to join the California Featured Artist Series at Disneyland.

<doc id="273629" wikidata="Q12010762" url="?curid=273629" title="Wobble board">
<text>The wobble board is a musical instrument invented and popularized by Australian musician and artist Rolf Harris, and is featured in his best-known song &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot;. A wobble board, like some other musical instruments, can be ornately decorated because its large surface area can act as a canvas without detracting from its musical capability.

The instrument is played by holding the board lengthwise with the hands holding the edges and flicking the board outward, thereby making a characteristic &quot;whoop-whoop&quot; noise. The angle at which the board is held, and the way the board is &quot;flicked&quot;, can alter the timbre of the sound produced. It is similar to the thunder sheet, a metal instrument used to imitate the sound of thunder in 18th century theatre.

==History==

According to an interview he gave to Tony Barrell for &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; in 2001, Harris discovered the musical properties of hardboard by chance in 1959, when he was about to paint a portrait of the conjurer Robert Harbin. Before his subject arrived, Harris prepared the background, covering a large piece of hardboard with Prussian blue oil paint mixed with turpentine. But the surface refused to dry. &quot;It was all sticky and nasty. He was due to arrive in about half an hour.&quot; In desperation, Harris propped the board over a paraffin heater. When he touched it later, it was so hot it burned his finger. &quot;So I propped it between the palms of my hands and shook it to cool it down. And ... I thought, &#x27;What a marvellous sound.

Rolf Harris said:

Official Rolf Harris wobble boards were sold commercially for a time in the 1970s but most were made by the player. Almost any large, springy and flexible sheet of material can be used as an impromptu wobble board, although some materials are markedly better than others. Harris&#x27;s instrument was originally made from a type of wood composite known as hardboard (Masonite in the United States and Australia).

Two wobble boards donated by Harris were part of the National Museum of Australia collection before they were removed in the light of his arrest for indecent assault in 2013.

<doc id="273632" wikidata="Q1080800" url="?curid=273632" title="Christian left">
<text>The Christian left, otherwise referred to as the religious left, is a range of Christian political and social movements that largely embrace social justice principles and uphold a social doctrine or social gospel based on their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity. Given the inherent diversity in international political thought, the term &quot;Christian left&quot; can have different meanings and applications in different countries. While there is much overlap, the Christian left is distinct from liberal Christianity, meaning not all Christian leftists are liberal Christians and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

In the United States, the Christian left usually aligns with modern liberalism and progressivism, using the social gospel to achieve better social and economic equality. Christian anarchism, Christian communism, and Christian socialism are subsets of the socialist Christian left. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, authors of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;, both had Christian upbringings; however, neither were devout Christians.

== Terminology ==

As with any section within the left–right political spectrum, a label such as &quot;Christian left&quot; represents an approximation, including within it groups and persons holding many diverse viewpoints. The term left-wing might encompass a number of values, some of which may or may not be held by different Christian movements and individuals. As the unofficial title of a loose association of believers, it provides a clear distinction from the more commonly known Christian right, or religious right, and from its key leaders and political views. The Christian left does not hold the notion that left-leaning policies, whether economic or social, stand in apparent contrast to Christian beliefs.

The most common religious viewpoint that might be described as left-wing is social justice, or care for impoverished and oppressed minority groups. Supporters of this trend might encourage universal health care, welfare provisions, subsidized education, foreign aid, and affirmative action for improving the conditions of the disadvantaged. With values stemming from egalitarianism, adherents of the Christian left consider it part of their religious duty to take actions on behalf of the oppressed. Matthew 25:31–46, among other verses, is often cited to support this view. As nearly all major religions contain the concept of a Golden Rule as a requirement to help others), adherents of various religions have cited social justice as a movement in line with their faith.
The term &quot;social justice&quot; was coined in the 1840s by Luigi Taparelli, an Italian Catholic scholar of the Society of Jesus, who was inspired by the writings of Thomas Aquinas. The Christian left holds that social justice, renunciation of power, humility, forgiveness, and private observation of prayer (as in ) as opposed to publicly mandated prayer, are mandated by the Gospel. The Bible contains accounts of Jesus repeatedly advocating for the poor and outcast over the wealthy, powerful, and religious. The Christian left maintains that such a stance is relevant and important. Adhering to the standard of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot;, which they believe supersedes the Old Testament law of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, the Christian left sometimes hearkens towards pacifism in opposition to policies advancing militarism.

The medieval Waldensians sect had a leftist character. Some among the Christian left, as well as some non-religious socialists, find support for anarchism, communism, and socialism in the Gospels, for example Mikhail Gorbachev citing Jesus as &quot;the first socialist&quot;. The Christian left is a broad category that includes Christian socialism, as well as Christians who would not identify themselves as socialists.

== History ==
=== Early years ===

For much of the early history of anti-establishment leftist movements, such as socialism and communism, which was highly anti-clerical in the 19th century, some established churches were led by clergy who saw revolution as a threat to their status and power. The church was sometimes seen as part of the establishment. Revolutions in the United States, France and Russia were in part directed against the established churches, or rather their leading clergy, and instituted a separation of church and state.

In the 19th century, some writers and activists developed the school of thought of Christian socialism, which infused socialist principles into Christian theology and praxis. Early socialist thinkers such as Robert Owen, Henri de Saint-Simon based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels reacted against these theories by formulating a secular theory of socialism in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;.

=== Alliance of the left and Christianity ===
Starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, some began to take on the view that genuine Christianity had much in common with a leftist perspective. From St. Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot; through St. Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;, major Christian writers had expounded upon views that socialists found agreeable. Of major interest was the extremely strong thread of egalitarianism in the New Testament. Other common leftist concerns such as pacifism, social justice, racial equality, human rights, and the rejection of excessive wealth are also expressed strongly in the Bible. In the late 19th century, the Social Gospel movement arose (particularly among some Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Baptists in North America and Britain,) which attempted to integrate progressive and socialist thought with Christianity to produce a faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as Christian socialism. In the United States during this period, Episcopalians and Congregationalists generally tended to be the most liberal, both in theological interpretation and in their adherence to the Social Gospel. In Canada, a coalition of liberal Congregationalists, Methodists, and Presbyterians founded the United Church of Canada, one of the first true Christian left denominations. Later in the 20th century, liberation theology was championed by such writers as Gustavo Gutierrez and Matthew Fox.

=== Christians and workers ===
To a significant degree, the Christian left developed out of the experiences of clergy who went to do pastoral work among the working class, often beginning without any social philosophy but simply a pastoral and evangelistic concern for workers. This was particularly true among the Methodists and Anglo-Catholics in England, Father Adolph Kolping in Germany and Joseph Cardijn in Belgium.

=== Christian left and campaigns for peace and human rights ===

Some Christian groups were closely associated with the peace movements against the Vietnam War as well as the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Religious leaders in many countries have also been on the forefront of criticizing any cuts to social welfare programs. In addition, many prominent civil rights activists were religious figures.

=== In the United States ===

In the United States, members of the Christian Left come from a spectrum of denominations: Peace churches, elements of the Protestant mainline churches, Catholicism, and some evangelicals.

==== Martin Luther King Jr. ====
Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesman and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination. In 1957, King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King, as well as the national organizing of the group in Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker. King led the SCLC until his death.
As a Christian minister, King&#x27;s main influence was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his religious meetings, speeches at church, and in public discourses. King&#x27;s faith was strongly based in Jesus&#x27; commandment of loving your neighbor as yourself, loving God above all, and loving your enemies, praying for them and blessing them. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus&#x27; teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52). In his famous &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus&#x27; &quot;extremist&quot; love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors, which was very usual for him. In another sermon, he stated:Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don&#x27;t plan to run for any political office. I don&#x27;t plan to do anything but remain a preacher. And what I&#x27;m doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of my feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man.

== Beliefs ==
=== Homosexuality ===

The Christian left generally approaches homosexuality differently from some other Christian political groups. This approach can be driven by focusing on issues differently despite holding similar religious views, or by holding different religious ideas. Those in the Christian left who have similar ideas as other Christian political groups but a different focus may view Christian teachings on certain issues, such as the Bible&#x27;s prohibitions against killing or criticisms of concentrations of wealth, as far more politically important than Christian teachings on social issues emphasized by the religious right, such as opposition to homosexuality. Others in the Christian left have not only a different focus on issues from other Christian political groups, but different religious ideas as well.

For example, some members of the Christian left may consider discrimination and bigotry against homosexuals to be immoral, but they differ on their views towards homosexual sex. Some believe homosexual sex to be immoral but unimportant compared with issues relating to social justice, or even matters of sexual morality involving heterosexual sex. Others assert that some homosexual practices are compatible with the Christian life. Such members believe common biblical arguments used to condemn homosexuality are misinterpreted, and that biblical prohibitions of homosexual practices are actually against a specific type of homosexual sex act, i.e. pederasty, the sodomizing of young boys by older men. Thus, they hold biblical prohibitions to be irrelevant when considering modern same-sex relationships.

=== Consistent life ethic ===

A related strain of thought is the (Catholic and progressive evangelical) consistent life ethic, which sees opposition to capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, abortion and the global unequal distribution of wealth as being related. It is an idea with certain concepts shared by Abrahamic religions as well as some Buddhists, Hindus, and members of other religions. The late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago developed the idea for the consistent life ethic in 1983. Sojourners is particularly associated with this strand of thought.

=== Liberation theology ===
Liberation theology is a theological tradition that emerged in the developing world, primarily in Latin America. Since the 1960s, Catholic thinkers have integrated left-wing thought and Catholicism, giving rise to Liberation theology. It arose at a time when Catholic thinkers who opposed the despotic leaders in Southern and Central America allied themselves with the communist opposition. However, it developed independently of and roughly simultaneously with Black theology in the U.S. and should not be confused with it. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith decided that while liberation theology is partially compatible with Catholic social teaching, certain Marxist elements of it, such as the doctrine of perpetual class struggle, are against Church teachings.

<text>The Communist Party of Spain (; PCE) is a communist party that, since 1986, has been part of the United Left coalition, which is currently part of Sumar. Two of its politicians are Spanish government ministers: Yolanda Díaz (Minister of Labour and Social Economy) and Sira Rego (Minister of Youth and Children).

The PCE was founded by 1921, after a split in the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (; PSOE). The PCE was founded by those who opposed the social democratic wing of the PSOE, because the social democrat wing did not support the PSOE&#x27;s integration in the Communist International founded by Vladimir Lenin two years prior. The PCE was a merger of the Spanish Communist Party () and the Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party (). The PCE was first legalized after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in April 1931. The republic was the first democratic regime in the history of Spain. The PCE gained much support in the months before the Spanish coup of July 1936, which marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, and it was a major force during the war as well. The Republicans lost, and Franco established a military dictatorship, under which the PCE was one of the most heavily repressed parties, with specific laws banning communist parties, among others.

Under the dictatorship, the PCE was the main opposition to the Francoist dictatorship. In the early years of the dictatorship, many PCE members joined the Spanish Maquis, a group of guerrillas who fought against the regime. Years later, the Maquis&#x27; power declined, and the PCE abandoned the military strategy. Instead, it chose to interfere in the only legal syndicate (which was part of the Francoist apparatus), the Vertical Syndicate.

Franco died on 20 November 1975, and two days later, Juan Carlos I was crowned. Juan Carlos I would lead the Spanish transition to democracy, a time when the PCE became also extremely relevant, due to Franco&#x27;s anti-communist legacy. Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez legalized the PCE on 9 April 1977, a decision which was particularly controversial, but ended peacefully. The PCE largely contributed to the restoration of democracy in Spain during the lead of Secretary-General Santiago Carrillo.

Since 1986, it is part of the United Left coalition. In its statutes, the PCE defines its goals as &quot;democratically participate in a revolutionary transformation of society and its political structures, overcoming the capitalist system and constructing socialism in the Spanish State, as a contribution to the transition to socialism worldwide, with our goals set in the realization of the emancipating ideal of communism&quot;. It defines itself as revolutionary, internationalist, solidarity, republican, feminist, and secularist, specifically, of the laïcité variety.

The youth organization of PCE is the Communist Youth Union of Spain. PCE publishes &quot;Mundo Obrero&quot; (Workers World) monthly.

==History==

===Establishment and pre-republican era===
The PCE was the result of a merger between two organizations: the original Spanish Communist Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Español&quot; or PCE) and the Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Obrero Español&quot; or PCOE). The former was created in April 1920 from portions of the Socialists&#x27; youth organization (&quot;Federación de Juventudes Socialistas&quot; or FJS) while the latter had been formed from a union of dissident Socialists (&quot;terceristas&quot;) and members of the General Union of Workers (&quot;Unión General de Trabajadores&quot; or UGT) who regarded the original PCE as not properly representative of the working class.

The two parties joined in the new Partido Comunista de España on 14 November 1921. The unified PCE became a member of the Third International and held its first congress in Sevilla in March 1922. In May, Jules Humbert-Droz, the top Comintern official in Western Europe, arrived in Spain to supervise the still fractious party and would continue to do so until the establishment of the republic.

By the end of 1922, the party had approximately 5,000 members. The PCE&#x27;s left-wing engaged in political violence, especially in Bilbao, largely directed against other leftists. A party leader&#x27;s bodyguard shot and killed a Socialist in November 1922 and organized party militants attempted a general strike in August 1923 that ended in a shootout at the barricaded party headquarters, resulting in twenty communists dead or injured and another seventy arrested.

With the advent of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera in September 1923, political parties, including the PCE, were repressed and rendered largely powerless though not dissolved. The party continued to publish its weekly newspaper &quot;La Antorcha&quot; until 1927. In November 1925, PCE leaders joined with Comintern officials and leaders of the Catalan-separatist Estat Català in endorsing a revolutionary program calling for the following:
:* Abolition of Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship and of the monarchy,
:* Creation of a &quot;república federativa popular&quot; (federal popular republic),
:* Recognition of independence for Catalonia, the Basque Country, and Morocco,
:* Total freedom of association,
:* Expropriation of large estates and distribution of land to peasants,
:* Organization of workers&#x27; councils in industry,
:* Formation of a central committee for revolution consisting of representatives from several parties as well as a military committee, and
:* A planned insurrection in Madrid.

However, Moscow urged a cautious approach, and the CNT and Basque nationalists were reluctant to cooperate with communists, so the plans were never carried out. The PCE continued to suffer from repression and dissension. The party&#x27;s second secretary general, José Bullejos, purged the party of politically suspect members, and was himself arrested in 1928. In 1930, the arguments over doctrine led the Catalan-Balearic Communist Federation (FCCB) to break from the party and associate with the International Right Opposition. Amid this infighting, Comintern official Dmitry Manuilsky reportedly stated that, while Spain had &quot;an excellent proletariat&quot;, it had only &quot;a few little groups, but not a communist party&quot;.

Thus, the PCE was in a very debilitated state when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931. On 3 December 1933 the first PCE parliamentarian, Cayetano Bolívar Escribano, was elected. Bolívar was jailed at the time of elections and left imprisonment to occupy his post in the parliament.

===Popular Front and Civil War===

PCE was a small party during the initial years of the Republic, until it began to grow due to the victory of the Popular Front (of which the Communists had been a constituent part) in February 1936 and the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in July of that year. The PCE, directed by José Díaz and Dolores Ibárruri (known popularly as &quot;La Pasionaria&quot;), worked consistently for the victory of the Republican forces and the Popular Front government, but was wary of the social revolution that was being waged by Spanish workers.

The PCE leadership judged that while progressive laws could be passed, an attempt at a full-scale socialist revolution would needlessly divide the forces of the Republic. It would cause massive conflict behind republican lines, thus diverting military forces from the battle against Franco and driving many democratic republicans who were prepared to fight against the rebels into the arms of the rebels.

Being a well-knit and highly disciplined organization, the PCE could in spite of its numerical weakness play an important part in the war. In the first five months of the war, PCE grew from 30,000 members to 100,000. It also founded a Spanish branch of the International Red Aid, which assisted the Republican cause considerably.

In 1936, due to the special political situation in Catalonia, Partit Comunista de Catalunya (the Catalan branch of PCE) was separated from the party to fuse with other socialists to form Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya. Since then the PCE does not have an organization in Catalonia, but relies on a regional referent party. This set-up has been imitated by many of the communist splinter groups in Spain.

The PCE clashed with anarchists in Barcelona during the May Days of 1937.

===Resistance and reorientation===
After the Republican defeat in April 1939, the PCE was persecuted by the Nationales of caudillo Francisco Franco (1939–1975), although maintained the best organization among the opposition parties inside Spain. During the initial years of the Francoist State, PCE organized guerrilla struggles in some parts of the country.

A large part of the party membership was forced into exile. Some PCE members went to the Soviet Union and fought as volunteers for the Red Army during the Second World War, such as General Enrique Líster. A large section of PCE members were based in France, where a major party organization was set up, although the French government forced them to leave in 1950 during the rising ideological tension of the Cold War. During the latter half of the Franco years, PCE changed its strategy and started organizing Workers&#x27; Commissions (CC.OO.) within the official trade union apparatus. CC.OO. and PCE gained strength and became the backbone of the opposition forces in the country.

Dolores Ibárruri, &quot;La Pasionaria&quot;, a dedicated follower of consequent Comintern policies, replaced Jose Diaz as General Secretary in 1944, and held the position until 1960. Santiago Carrillo was General Secretary from 1960 to 1982. In 1963, after the Communist Party of Spain abandoned the armed struggle, hard-line Communists, led by Julio Álvarez del Vayo, founded the Spanish National Liberation Front (FELN), a small splinter group.

Carrillo put the party on a eurocommunist course, distancing it from its Leninist origins. Carrillo accepted concessions to the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, accepting the restoration of a liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy. This was regarded by many Party members as treason, for these concessions were made to classes the Party&#x27;s doctrine called &quot;exploiters&quot;.

Communists played a fundamental role in the 1962 miners&#x27; strike, the first large-scale social movement since the end of the civil war, by putting their informal networks at its service, but also by involving their exiled activists to organize international solidarity. At the peak of the mobilization, more than 60,000 workers stopped work. A first breach in the edifice of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, which had ruled the country for more than twenty years.

===Transition to democracy===
The Party was legalized after the January 1977 Atocha massacre, on 9 April 1977, as one of the last steps in the Spanish transition to democracy. Only weeks after the legalization, PCE had over 200,000 card-holding members. But the concessions made by Carrillo (labelled &quot;revisionist&quot; by his orthodox communist opponents) and the social democratization of the party under his leadership provoked dissent amongst party ranks. Several party members left the party. Enrique Líster broke away in 1973 and formed the Partido Comunista Obrero Español. Other more radical left-wing groups that broke away were Partido Comunista de los Trabajadores (formed by the Left Opposition of PCE in 1977) and PCE (VIII-IX Congresos) (formed in 1971).

In the first elections after the transition in 1977, the PCE obtained 9% of the votes, and in 1979 it increased its vote share to 11%. By this time, however, the party had become increasingly divided into three currents. Carrillo&#x27;s supporters were squeezed between, on the one hand, pro-Soviet communists who had remained within the party and felt his Eurocommunist course took the party too far on a social democratic path and, on the other hand, &quot;renovators&quot; who advocated for democratizing the party and opening it up towards more collaboration with other groups on the left. In the midst of successive waves of expulsions of members who belonged to the minority currents, the PCE suffered an electoral defeat in 1982, getting just 4% of the vote.

===Divisions in the party, collaboration with other groups in the United Left===
After the 1982 elections, Carrillo was removed as general secretary, and the new party leader Gerardo Iglesias pursued a strategy of leftist convergence and collaboration with non-communist parties and social movements. Over the objections of Carrillo, who was expelled in 1985 and went on to found a new party and warn that supporting IU was tantamount to &quot;burying communism&quot;, the PCE developed the &quot;United Left&quot; alliance Izquierda Unida (IU). This broad coalition initially encompassed parties ranging from the pro-Soviet PCPE to the socialist PASOC, the Progressive Federation, and the Carlist Party.

Despite its role in the anti-NATO protests of 1986, IU fared weakly in the 1986 elections, and by 1988, the Communist Party elected Julio Anguita as new General Secretary, which he remained until 1998. Under Anguita, the party took a turn towards the left and fundamental opposition to both PSOE and PP, and many of the members who had previously been expelled for pro-Soviet views returned to the party. By 1991, the party had 70,000 members, and IU rebounded in the 1989 elections, winning 9.1% of the vote that year and slightly increasing it to 9.6% in 1993 and 10.5% in 1996.

Notably, PSUC, the Catalan referent of PCE, did not reverse its eurocommunist course in the late 1980s, as the PCE had done, and gradually, PSUC and PCE grew apart. Finally, PSUC decided to dissolve itself into Iniciativa per Catalunya, and cease to function as a communist party. This provoked a 45% minority to break away and form PSUC viu (Living PSUC). Since 1998, PSUC viu (United and Alternative Left) is the referent of PCE in Catalonia.

In 2008 the party was referred to as left-wing by various academic political writers. After the 2008 election, Llamazares resigned as IU coordinator, and later that year, PCE politician Cayo Lara was elected to replace him on the platform &quot;For an anti-capitalist, republican, federal, and alternative United Left&quot;. IU shifted back towards a more confrontational attitude towards the PSOE, and José Luis Centella succeeded Frutos as PCE general secretary the next year. For the 2015 elections, IU joined up with further partners in the Popular Unity (UP) alliance, led by PCE politician Alberto Garzón. It received 4% of the vote, and was eclipsed by the new left-wing party Podemos. UP subsequently joined with Podemos in the Unidos Podemos alliance, which received 21% of the vote in the 2016 election. The PCE, meanwhile, moved in its XX Congress in 2017 to explicitly embrace Marxism–Leninism again, marking a break with the previous forty years.

<doc id="273637" wikidata="Q27977064" url="?curid=273637" title="President of Costa Rica">
<text>The president of the Republic of Costa Rica is the head of state and head of government of Costa Rica. The president is currently elected in direct elections for a period of four years, which is not immediately renewable. Two vice presidents are elected in the same ticket with the president. The president appoints the Council of Ministers. Due to the abolition of the military of Costa Rica in 1948, the president is not a commander-in-chief, unlike the norm in most other countries, although the Constitution does describe him as commander-in-chief of the civil defense public forces.

From 1969 to 2005, the president was barred from seeking reelection. After the amendment banning reelection was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2005, an incumbent president became eligible to run again after waiting for at least eight years after leaving office.

==Election==
The President of Costa Rica is elected using a modified two-round system in which a candidate must receive at least 40% of the vote to win in the first round; if no candidate wins in the first round, a runoff is held between the two candidates with the largest number of votes.

==Qualifications==
According to Article 131 of the Constitution, The following is required to be president or vice president of the Republic:

==Attributes and duties==
According to article 139 of the Constitution of Costa Rica, the following powers are exclusive attributes of the president:

Article 140 gives the president the following duties alongside the respective minister:

==Limitations==
The Constitution also establishes limitations on the president&#x27;s powers which can be prosecuted if broken.

Article 148.

Article 149

<text>The president of Brazil (), officially the president of the Federative Republic of Brazil () or simply the &quot;President of the Republic&quot;, is the head of state and head of government of Brazil. The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian Armed Forces.

The presidential system was established in 1889, upon the proclamation of the republic in a military coup d&#x27;état against Emperor Pedro II. Since then, Brazil has had six constitutions, three dictatorships, and three democratic periods. The Constitution of Brazil, along with several constitutional amendments, establishes the requirements, powers, and responsibilities of the president, their term of office and the method of election.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the 39th and current president. He was sworn in on 1 January 2023.

==Constitutional powers==
As a republic with a presidential executive, Brazil grants significant powers to the president, who effectively controls the executive branch, represents the country abroad, and appoints the cabinet and, with the approval of the Senate, the judges for the Supreme Federal Court. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Presidents in Brazil have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the National Congress or by using (provisional measures), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law or electoral law). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. The 60-day period can be extended once, up to 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or the 120-day, in the case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.

Article 84 of the current Federal Constitution, determines that the president has the power to
# appoint and dismiss the ministers of state;
# exercise, with the assistance of the ministers of state, the higher management of the federal administration;
# initiate the legislative procedure, in the manner and in the cases set forth in the Constitution;
# sanction, promulgate, and order the publication of laws, as well as issue decrees and regulations for the true enforcement thereof;
# veto bills, wholly or in part;
# provide, by means of decree, on organization and structure of federal administration if there is neither increase of expenses nor creation or extinction of public agencies; and extinction of offices or positions, when vacant;
# maintain relations with foreign States and to accredit their diplomatic representatives;
# conclude international treaties, conventions and acts, subject to the ratification of the National Congress of Brazil;
# decree the state of defense and the state of siege, in accordance with the constitutional procedures that precede and authorize those emergency decrees;
# decree and enforce federal intervention, in accordance with the constitutional procedures that precede and authorize such exceptional action;
# upon the opening of the legislative session, send a government message and plan to the National Congress, describing the state of the nation and requesting the actions he deems necessary;
# grant pardons and reduce sentences, after hearing the entities instituted by law, if necessary;
# exercise the supreme command of the armed forces, appoint the commanders of navy, army and air force, promote general officers and to appoint them to the offices held exclusively by them;
# appoint, after approval by the Federal Senate, the Justices of the Supreme Federal Court and those of the superior courts, the Governors of the territories, the Prosecutor General of the Republic, the president and the directors of the Central Bank and other civil servants, when established by law;
# appoint, with due regard for the provisions of Article 73, the Justices of the Court of Accounts of the Union;
# appoint judges in the events established by this constitution and the Attorney General of the Union;
# appoint members of the Council of the Republic, in accordance with article 89, VII;
# summon and preside over the Council of the Republic and the National Defense Council;
# declare war, in the event of foreign aggression, authorized by the National Congress or confirmed by it, whenever it occurs between legislative sessions and, under the same conditions, to decree full or partial national mobilization;
# make peace, authorized or confirmed by the National Congress;
# award decorations and honorary distinctions;
# permit, in the cases set forth by supplementary law, foreign forces to pass through the national territory, or to remain temporarily therein;
# submit to the National Congress the pluriannual plan, the bill of budgetary directives and the budget proposals set forth in this constitution;
# render, each year, accounts to the National Congress concerning the previous fiscal year, within sixty days of the opening of the legislative session;
# fill and abolish federal government positions, as set forth by law;
# issue provisional measures, with force of law, according to Article 62;
# perform other duties set forth in the constitution.

==Election==
=== Requirements ===
The Constitution of Brazil requires that a president be a native-born citizen of Brazil, at least 35 years of age, a resident of Brazil, in full exercise of their electoral rights, a registered voter, and a member of a political party (write-in or independent candidates are prohibited).

=== Term limits ===
The president of Brazil serves for a term of four years, and may be re-elected for a single consecutive term. This two-term limit, however, is not for life—a former president who has served for two consecutive terms may run for the presidency again after at least one term has elapsed.

A vice president or other officer who succeeds to the presidency or who serves, albeit briefly, as acting president during a certain presidential term may subsequently be elected or reelected to the presidency only once, as the consecutive term limit already applies. In practice, Brazilian vice-presidents almost always serve as acting president at some point during a presidential term, given that, according to the Constitution, the vice-president becomes acting president during the president&#x27;s travels abroad.

===Running for other offices===
A sitting president (or governor or mayor) who wishes to run for a different office, regardless of the intended jurisdiction or branch of government, must resign from office at least six months before election day.

=== History ===
The possibility of reelection was established by the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, in 1997. Before that, presidents had been barred from immediate reelection for all of Brazil&#x27;s republican history, with the single exception of the latter half of the Vargas Era, from 1937 to 1945. The office was limited to men until the 1937 Constitution. Under the original text of the 1988 Constitution the presidential term lasted 5 years, but it was reduced to 4 years in 1994 by a constitutional amendment.

==Compensation and privileges of office==

As of 2015, the president receives a monthly salary of R$30,934.70, along with an undisclosed expense account to cover travel, goods and services while in office. Given that in Brazil all private and public sector employees and civil servants receive an additional compensation equivalent to one monthly salary after a year of work (this compensation is known as the &quot;thirteenth salary&quot;), the president receives 13 payments per year, resulting in an annual salary of R$402,151.10.
The Palácio do Planalto in Brasília is the official workplace of the president and the &quot;Palácio da Alvorada&quot; their official residence. The president is entitled to use its staff and facilities. The &quot;Residência Oficial do Torto&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Granja do Torto&quot;, is a ranch located on the outskirts of the capital and is used as a country retreat by the president. The &quot;Palácio Rio Negro&quot; in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, is a summer retreat of the president, although used rarely. The official residence of the vice president is the Jaburu Palace in Brasília.

In the 2000s, the federal government decided to establish &quot;Regional Offices of the Presidency of the Republic&quot; in certain key Brazilian cities. Those regional offices are not presidential residences, but they are fully staffed offices ready to receive the president and his ministers at any time, and they function as a presidential workplace when the president is in those cities. The first regional office of the presidency was established in the city of São Paulo, and is located at the Banco do Brasil building at the Paulista Avenue; the building also houses Banco do Brasil&#x27;s regional headquarters in São Paulo. The presidency of the republic also maintains regional offices in Porto Alegre and in Belo Horizonte.
For ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which is an armored version of the 2024 Chery Tiggo 8 Max Drive. A 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith is used by the president on ceremonial occasions, such as Independence Day commemorations, state visits and the inauguration of the president-elect. The presidential aircraft is a military version of an Airbus A330-200, called KC-30. Two modified Embraer 190 jets, air force designation VC-2, are used for short and medium range presidential travel. When the president is on board, the aircraft receive the call sign &quot;Brazilian Air Force One&quot;. Two modified military versions of the Eurocopter Super Puma, air force designation VH-34, are currently used as the main presidential helicopters.

==Removal==

The president may be removed from office using one of two procedures. In either case, two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies must accept charges against the officeholder (impeachment); and if the Senate accepts the investigation, the president is suspended from exercising the functions of office for up to 180 days. In the case of &quot;common criminal offenses&quot;, a trial then takes place at the Supreme Federal Court. In the case of &quot;crimes of malversation&quot;, which must fall into one of seven broad areas and which is defined in more detail in law, a trial takes place at the Federal Senate. During the trial, the vice president exercises executive power. If the trial does not result in a conviction within 180 days, the president resumes office; a conviction results in removal from office and succession by the vice president. The seven areas are:

# The existence of the Union
# The free exercise of the Legislative Power, the Judicial Power, the Public Prosecution and the constitutional Powers of the units of the Federation
# The exercise of political, individual and social rights
# The internal security of the country
# Probity in the administration
# The budgetary law
# Compliance with the laws and with court decisions

==Post-presidency==
The following privileges are guaranteed to former presidents by law:
*Permanent security protection (by the presidential guard – &quot;Batalhão da Guarda Presidencial&quot;)
*The use of two official vehicles (for life)
*Repository funding for a presidential library
*Lifelong monthly pension for their widows and unmarried daughters
*Pension for sons of deceased ex-presidents until they come of age

==Office-holders==
All presidents of Brazil have borne the title &quot;President of the Republic&quot;. That title has been used by all the constitutions of Brazil since the proclamation of the Republic to refer to the head of the Executive Branch. However, from the proclamation of the Republic in 1889 until 1937 the country was officially styled &quot;Republic of the United States of Brazil&quot;, and from 1937 to 1967 the country was styled simply &quot;The United States of Brazil&quot;, and thus the full title of the presidents of the Republic from 1891 until 1967—that is, from Deodoro da Fonseca&#x27;s inauguration as President (between 1889 and 1891 he served as Head of the Provisional Government) until the end of Humberto Castello Branco&#x27;s term in 1967—was &quot;President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil&quot;. On 15 March 1967, the country&#x27;s official name was changed to &quot;Federative Republic of Brazil&quot;. On that same date, Arthur da Costa e Silva was sworn in as President succeeding Castello Branco. Since Costa e Silva, therefore, all presidents of Brazil have borne the full title of &quot;President of the Federative Republic of Brazil&quot;.

<doc id="273640" wikidata="Q246708" url="?curid=273640" title="Popular Front (Spain)">
<text>The Popular Front () was an electoral alliance and pact formed in January 1936 to contest that year&#x27;s general election by various left-wing political organizations during the Second Spanish Republic. The alliance was led by Manuel Azaña. In Catalonia and the modern-day Valencian Community, the coalition was known as the Front of the Lefts ().

The Popular Front included the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), Communist Party of Spain (PCE), and the republicans: Republican Left (IR), (led by Azaña) and Republican Union (UR), led by Diego Martínez Barrio. This pact was supported by Galician (PG) and Catalan nationalists (ERC), the POUM, socialist union Workers&#x27; General Union (UGT), and the anarchist trade union, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Many anarchists who would later fight alongside &quot;Popular Front&quot; forces during the Spanish Civil War did not support them in the election, urging abstention instead.

The Comintern had decided in 1935 that, in response to the growth of fascism, popular fronts allying communist parties with other anti-fascist parties including Socialist and even bourgeois parties were advisable. In Spain, it was a coalition between leftist republicans and workers&#x27; organizations to defend social reforms of the first government (1931–1933) of the Second Spanish Republic, and liberate the prisoners, political prisoners according with the front propaganda, held since the Asturian October Revolution (1934).

The Popular Front defeated the (a collection of right-wing parties) and won the 1936 election, forming the new Spanish Government. Manuel Azaña was elected President of the Republic in May 1936, but the PSOE did not join the government because of the opposition of Francisco Largo Caballero.

In July 1936, conservative/monarchist generals instigated a coup d&#x27;état which started the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). The Government dissolved the Spanish Republican Army in the loyal territory and brought weapons to armed groups organized by the unions (UGT and CNT) and workers&#x27; parties (PSOE, PCE, POUM) that had initial success in defeating the Francoist forces in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia. In October the same year, the Spanish Republican Army was reorganized. After a protracted war of attrition, General Francisco Franco would defeat the Republican forces and rule Spain as a dictatorship until he died in 1975.

==History==
===Foundation and the manifesto of the Popular Front===
The Popular Front was formed in 1936 by a coalition of left-wing republican parties. The Popular Front&#x27;s founding manifesto condemned the actions of the conservative-led government, demanding the release of political prisoners detained after November 1933, the re-hiring of state employees who had been suspended, fired, or transferred &quot;without due process or for reasons of political persecution&quot;, it proposed establishing a judiciary independent from government control, the investigation and prosecution of acts of unwarranted violence by police, and revision of the Law of Public Order to protect the rights of citizens against arbitrary power. The manifesto stressed political moderation against radicalism.

The manifesto advocated a moderate left-leaning economic policy that rejected the idea of nationalization of land and instead supported the provision of state economic assistance to agriculture, a new progressive tenancy law, and promotion of collective forms of production. It supported protectionist measures to defend national industry, encouraged state research to assist national industry, promised protection of small businesses, major expansion of public works, and progressive tax reform. The manifesto declared the Popular Front&#x27;s opposition to class-based society, stating &quot;The Republic conceived of by the Republican parties is not a Republic dominated by social or economic class interests, but a regime of democratic liberty...&quot; but it promised the restoration of certain economic policies of the 1931–33 Spanish government, including increased wages for farmworkers.

The manifesto promised the restoration of legislation guaranteeing regional autonomy that was revoked by the conservative-led government.

===Members===
Members to the coalition were:
*Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party – Socialist
*Communist Party of Spain – Communist
*Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification – Libertarian Marxist
*Syndicalist Party – Syndicalist
*Republican Left – Republican
*Republican Union – Republican
*Republican Left of Catalonia – Catalan nationalist
*Galicianist Party – Galician nationalist
*Basque Nationalist Action – Basque nationalist

It was also supported by:
*Workers&#x27; General Union – Socialist trade union
*CNT-FAI – Anarcho-syndicalist trade union

===1936 election and immediate aftermath===
In the 1936 general election, the Popular Front won the election with its leader Manuel Azaña elected President of Spain. The Popular Front received 4,654,116 votes compared to the opponent combined right-wing vote of 4,503,524 votes. It elected 278 deputies – 99 of which belonged to the Socialists (PSOE), while the right-wing elected 124 deputies – 88 of which belonged to the CEDA. Many of the elected members of the Popular Front were professional persons, several of whom were from wealthy backgrounds. People of various political backgrounds within the Popular Front were appointed to President Azaña&#x27;s cabinet, such as , architect and wealthy landowner, and , a former Radical Socialist. Upon the election of the Popular Front, the Popular Front held a victory march in Madrid with over 250,000 supporters, with its Socialist and Communist party components marching in uniform in the thousands. The Popular Front immediately delivered its promise in its manifesto of rehiring workers fired for political reasons without due process and to reimburse them based on individual cases for wages lost to an extent of not less than thirty-nine days&#x27; wages nor more than six months.

Azaña responded to the recent surge of acts of violence, arson, and vandalism by radical leftists against right-wing parties and Catholic Church institutions by denouncing these actions. Uncontrolled political violence continued through to March with the greatest disturbance taking place in Granada where a violent act by right-wing political forces provoked a general strike and mass riot by left-wing political forces there. In particular, violence involving Communists and Socialists versus Falangists resulted in multiple murders. By July there had been 269 political killings.

Azaña acceded to demands by left-wing movements for punishment of General Eduardo López Ochoa, the army leader of the 1934 Asturian campaign against workers&#x27; movements there. The Spanish Republican government also made major changes to the Spanish Army, pro-Republican or neutral commanders were installed in multiple posts while commanders with questionable loyalties were moved to lesser or remote positions: for example, General Francisco Franco was removed as chief of staff of the army and moved to a position in the Canary Islands and General Emilio Mola was demoted from a major command in Spanish Morocco to a position as commander of a brigade in Pamplona.

The government did not stay in power long, mainly because of the conflict of ideological views by many of the parties. The only factor working for the government was unity for the conquest of fascism. After the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War, the popular front was dissolved, and Franco ruled Spain as a dictator until his death in 1975.

<text>The ultraproduct is a mathematical construction that appears mainly in abstract algebra and mathematical logic, in particular in model theory and set theory. An ultraproduct is a quotient of the direct product of a family of structures. All factors need to have the same signature. The ultrapower is the special case of this construction in which all factors are equal.

For example, ultrapowers can be used to construct new fields from given ones. The hyperreal numbers, an ultrapower of the real numbers, are a special case of this.

Some striking applications of ultraproducts include very elegant proofs of the compactness theorem and the completeness theorem, Keisler&#x27;s ultrapower theorem, which gives an algebraic characterization of the semantic notion of elementary equivalence, and the Robinson–Zakon presentation of the use of superstructures and their monomorphisms to construct nonstandard models of analysis, leading to the growth of the area of nonstandard analysis, which was pioneered (as an application of the compactness theorem) by Abraham Robinson.

==Definition==

The general method for getting ultraproducts uses an index set formula_1 a structure formula_2 (assumed to be non-empty in this article) for each element formula_3 (all of the same signature), and an ultrafilter formula_4 on formula_5 

For any two elements formula_6 and formula_7 of the Cartesian product 
formula_8 
declare them to be , written formula_9 or formula_10 if and only if the set of indices formula_11 on which they agree is an element of formula_12 in symbols,
formula_13
which compares components only relative to the ultrafilter formula_14 
This binary relation formula_15 is an equivalence relation on the Cartesian product formula_16 

The is the quotient set of formula_17 with respect to formula_18 and is therefore sometimes denoted by
formula_19 or formula_20

Explicitly, if the formula_4-equivalence class of an element formula_22 is denoted by
formula_23
then the ultraproduct is the set of all formula_4-equivalence classes
formula_25

Although formula_4 was assumed to be an ultrafilter, the construction above can be carried out more generally whenever formula_4 is merely a filter on formula_1 in which case the resulting quotient set formula_29 is called a &quot;&quot;.

When formula_4 is a principal ultrafilter (which happens if and only if formula_4 contains its kernel formula_32) then the ultraproduct is isomorphic to one of the factors. 
And so usually, formula_4 is not a principal ultrafilter, which happens if and only if formula_4 is free (meaning formula_35), or equivalently, if every cofinite subset of formula_36 is an element of formula_14 
Since every ultrafilter on a finite set is principal, the index set formula_36 is consequently also usually infinite.

The ultraproduct acts as a filter product space where elements are equal if they are equal only at the filtered components (non-filtered components are ignored under the equivalence). 
One may define a finitely additive measure formula_39 on the index set formula_36 by saying formula_41 if formula_42 and formula_43 otherwise. Then two members of the Cartesian product are equivalent precisely if they are equal almost everywhere on the index set. The ultraproduct is the set of equivalence classes thus generated.

Finitary operations on the Cartesian product formula_17 are defined pointwise (for example, if formula_45 is a binary function then formula_46). 
Other relations can be extended the same way:
formula_47
where formula_48 denotes the formula_4-equivalence class of formula_50 with respect to formula_51 
In particular, if every formula_2 is an ordered field then so is the ultraproduct.

===Ultrapower===

An &quot;ultrapower&quot; is an ultraproduct for which all the factors formula_2 are equal. 
Explicitly, the is the ultraproduct formula_54 of the indexed family formula_55 defined by formula_56 for every index formula_57 
The ultrapower may be denoted by formula_58 or (since formula_59 is often denoted by formula_60) by
formula_61

For every formula_62 let formula_63 denote the constant map formula_64 that is identically equal to formula_65 This constant map/tuple is an element of the Cartesian product formula_66 and so the assignment formula_67 defines a map formula_68 
The \, M&lt;/math&gt;}} is the map formula_69 that sends an element formula_70 to the formula_4-equivalence class of the constant tuple formula_72

==Examples==

The hyperreal numbers are the ultraproduct of one copy of the real numbers for every natural number, with regard to an ultrafilter over the natural numbers containing all cofinite sets. Their order is the extension of the order of the real numbers. For example, the sequence formula_73 given by formula_74 defines an equivalence class representing a hyperreal number that is greater than any real number.

Analogously, one can define nonstandard integers, nonstandard complex numbers, etc., by taking the ultraproduct of copies of the corresponding structures.

As an example of the carrying over of relations into the ultraproduct, consider the sequence formula_75 defined by formula_76 Because formula_77 for all formula_78 it follows that the equivalence class of formula_79 is greater than the equivalence class of formula_80 so that it can be interpreted as an infinite number which is greater than the one originally constructed. However, let formula_81 for formula_82 not equal to formula_83 but formula_84 The set of indices on which formula_73 and formula_86 agree is a member of any ultrafilter (because formula_73 and formula_86 agree almost everywhere), so formula_73 and formula_86 belong to the same equivalence class.

In the theory of large cardinals, a standard construction is to take the ultraproduct of the whole set-theoretic universe with respect to some carefully chosen ultrafilter formula_14 Properties of this ultrafilter formula_4 have a strong influence on (higher order) properties of the ultraproduct; for example, if formula_4 is formula_94-complete, then the ultraproduct will again be well-founded. (See measurable cardinal for the prototypical example.)

==Łoś&#x27;s theorem==

Łoś&#x27;s theorem, also called , is due to Jerzy Łoś (the surname is pronounced , approximately &quot;wash&quot;). It states that any first-order formula is true in the ultraproduct if and only if the set of indices formula_82 such that the formula is true in formula_2 is a member of formula_14 More precisely:

Let formula_94 be a signature, formula_4 an ultrafilter over a set formula_1 and for each formula_3 let formula_2 be a formula_94-structure. 
Let formula_104 or formula_105 be the ultraproduct of the formula_2 with respect to formula_14 
Then, for each formula_108 where formula_109 and for every formula_94-formula formula_111
formula_112

The theorem is proved by induction on the complexity of the formula formula_113 The fact that formula_4 is an ultrafilter (and not just a filter) is used in the negation clause, and the axiom of choice is needed at the existential quantifier step. As an application, one obtains the transfer theorem for hyperreal fields.

===Examples===

Let formula_115 be a unary relation in the structure formula_116 and form the ultrapower of formula_117 Then the set formula_118 has an analog formula_119 in the ultrapower, and first-order formulas involving formula_120 are also valid for formula_121 For example, let formula_122 be the reals, and let formula_123 hold if formula_124 is a rational number. Then in formula_122 we can say that for any pair of rationals formula_124 and formula_127 there exists another number formula_128 such that formula_128 is not rational, and formula_130 Since this can be translated into a first-order logical formula in the relevant formal language, Łoś&#x27;s theorem implies that formula_119 has the same property. That is, we can define a notion of the hyperrational numbers, which are a subset of the hyperreals, and they have the same first-order properties as the rationals.

Consider, however, the Archimedean property of the reals, which states that there is no real number formula_124 such that formula_133 for every inequality in the infinite list. Łoś&#x27;s theorem does not apply to the Archimedean property, because the Archimedean property cannot be stated in first-order logic. In fact, the Archimedean property is false for the hyperreals, as shown by the construction of the hyperreal number formula_73 above.

==Direct limits of ultrapowers (ultralimits)==
In model theory and set theory, the direct limit of a sequence of ultrapowers is often considered. In model theory, this construction can be referred to as an ultralimit or limiting ultrapower.

Beginning with a structure, formula_135 and an ultrafilter, formula_136 form an ultrapower, formula_137 Then repeat the process to form formula_138 and so forth. For each formula_139 there is a canonical diagonal embedding formula_140 At limit stages, such as formula_141 form the direct limit of earlier stages. One may continue into the transfinite.

==Ultraproduct monad==

The ultrafilter monad is the codensity monad of the inclusion of the category of finite sets into the category of all sets. 

Similarly, the is the codensity monad of the inclusion of the category formula_142 of finitely-indexed families of sets into the category formula_143 of all indexed families of sets. So in this sense, ultraproducts are categorically inevitable. 
Explicitly, an object of formula_143 consists of a non-empty index set formula_36 and an indexed family formula_146 of sets. 
A morphism formula_147 between two objects consists of a function formula_148 between the index sets and a formula_149-indexed family formula_150 of function formula_151 
The category formula_142 is a full subcategory of this category of formula_143 consisting of all objects formula_146 whose index set formula_36 is finite. 
The codensity monad of the inclusion map formula_156 is then, in essence, given by
formula_157

Proofs

 M_i.&lt;/math&gt; The relation formula_158 always holds since formula_159 is an element of filter formula_14 Thus the reflexivity of formula_161 follows from that of equality formula_162 Similarly, formula_161 is symmetric since equality is symmetric. For transitivity, assume that formula_164 and formula_165 are elements of formula_12 it remains to show that formula_167 also belongs to formula_14 The transitivity of equality guarantees formula_169 (since if formula_170 then formula_171 and formula_172). Because formula_4 is closed under binary intersections, formula_174 Since formula_4 is upward closed in formula_1 it contains every superset of formula_177 (that consists of indices); in particular, formula_4 contains formula_179 formula_180&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="273644" wikidata="Q12376089" url="?curid=273644" title="Prime Minister of Thailand">
<text>The Prime Minister of Thailand (, , ; literally &#x27;chief minister of state&#x27;) is the head of government of Thailand. The prime minister is also the chair of the cabinet of Thailand. The post has existed since the Siamese Revolution of 1932, when the country became a constitutional monarchy. Prior to the 2014 coup d&#x27;état, the prime minister was nominated by a vote in the Thai House of Representatives by a simple majority, and is then appointed and sworn in by the King of Thailand. The house&#x27;s selection is usually based on the fact that either the prime minister is the leader of the largest political party in the lower house or the leader of the largest coalition of parties. In accordance with the 2017 Constitution, the Prime Minister can hold the office for no longer than eight years, consecutively or not. The current prime minister is Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who took office on 16 August 2024 after the removal of Srettha Thavisin.

==History==
The office of the &quot;President of the People&#x27;s Committee&quot; (), later changed to &quot;Prime Minister of Siam&quot; (), was first created in the Temporary Constitution of 1932. The office was modeled after the prime minister of the United Kingdom, as Siam became a parliamentary democracy in 1932 after a bloodless revolution. However, the idea of a separate head of government in Thailand is not new.

Prior to 1932, Thailand was ruled by absolute monarchs, who acted as both the head of state and the government. However, during the middle and latter reigns of the Chakri Dynasty, several individuals were perceived to hold a post equivalent to a head of government. During the reign of King Mongkut, Somdet Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse had a very significant role in an otherwise absolutist system. During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, Prince Damrong Rajanubhab took over this role. In fact, the office most considered the precursor of that of the prime minister was the ancient office of &quot;Samuha Nayok&quot; (สมุหนายก), which was run by an &quot;Akkhra Maha Senabodi&quot; (อัครมหาเสนาบดี) or &quot;chief minister in charge of civilian affairs&quot;.

The first prime minister of Siam was Phraya Manopakorn Nititada, a judge. The title of the office was changed from &quot;Prime Minister &quot;of Siam&quot;&quot; to &quot;Prime Minister &quot;of Thailand&quot;&quot; in 1945 and then permanently with the renaming of Siam to Thailand in 1949. For most of its existence, the office has been occupied by Army leaders; sixteen out of thirty. Military dominance began with the country&#x27;s second prime minister, Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena, who ousted his civilian predecessor in a coup in 1933. The longest-serving prime minister was Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram at 14 years, 11 months, and 18 days. The shortest was Thawi Bunyaket at just 18 days. Nine were removed by coups d&#x27;état, three were disqualified by court order, and eleven resigned from office. The youngest ever to occupy office is Paetongtarn Shinawatra at 37 years old. Thailand received its first female prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, in 2011. Every prime minister since Manopakorn Nititada has been Buddhist.

The current 2017 constitution states that the Prime Minister shall hold the office for no longer than eight years, consecutively or not. The term limit was the subject of legal challenge in 2022 after there were debates of how to count the term. The Constitutional Court ruled 6–3 that the term would be counted from the promulgation of the 2017 constitution, so that Prayut Chan-o-cha was allowed to continue his premiership despite having held the position since the 2014 coup.

==Appointment==

According to the 2007 constitution, The prime minister of the Kingdom of Thailand must be a member of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the qualifications for the office of prime minister are the same as the qualifications for membership in the house.

Prior to the 2014 coup d&#x27;état, to be appointed, the nominee for the office must have the support of one-fifth of the members of the House of Representatives. Then after a simple majority vote in the house, a resolution will be passed and submitted to the king, who will then make a formal appointment by giving his royal assent to the resolution. This must take place within thirty days after the beginning of the first session of the House of Representatives after an election. If no candidate can be found within this time period, then it is the duty of the president of the National Assembly of Thailand to submit the name considered most worthy for the king to formalize.

The nominee and eventual prime minister is always the leader of the largest political party in the lower house or the leader of the majority coalition formed after an election.

Under the junta, until 2019, the nominee for the office was selected by National Legislative Assembly, with the House of Representatives having been abolished. Under the constitution written by the junta, between 2019 to 2024 appointed by the full National Assembly, including the military-appointed Senate, the prime minister is currently appointed by the House of Representatives only.

==Function==
The prime minister is the &quot;de facto&quot; chair of the Cabinet of Thailand. The appointment and removal of ministers can only be made with their advice. As the leader of the government, the prime minister is therefore ultimately responsible for the failings and performance of their ministers and the government as a whole. The prime minister cannot hold office for a consecutive period of more than eight years. As the most visible member of the government, the prime minister represents the country abroad and is the main spokesperson for the government at home. The prime minister must, under the constitution, lead the cabinet in announcing the government&#x27;s policy statement in front of a joint session of the National Assembly, within fifteen days of being sworn in.

The prime minister is also directly responsible for many departments. These include the National Intelligence Agency, the Bureau of the Budget, the Office of the National Security Council, the Office of the Council of State, the Office of the Civil Service Commission, the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board, the Office of Public Sector Development Commission, and the Internal Security Operations Command. Legislatively all money bills introduced in the National Assembly must require the prime minister&#x27;s approval.

The prime minister can be removed by a vote of no confidence. This process can be evoked, firstly with the vote of only one-fifth of the members of the House of Representatives for a debate on the matter. Then after the debate a vote is taken and with a simple majority the prime minister can be removed. This process cannot be repeated within one parliamentary session.

==Office and residence==
The prime minister is aided in his work by the Office of the Prime Minister () a cabinet-level department headed usually by two ministers of state. These offices are housed in the Government House of Thailand () in the Dusit area of Bangkok.

The official residence of the prime minister is the Phitsanulok Mansion (), in the center of Bangkok. The mansion was built during the reign of King Vajiravudh. It became an official residence in 1979. The mansion is rumored to have many ghosts, therefore most prime ministers live in their private residences and only use the house for official business.

==Deputy prime ministers==

Several deputy prime ministers of Thailand () can be appointed. This position can be combined with other ministerial portfolios.

<doc id="273645" wikidata="Q1625960" url="?curid=273645" title="President of Albania">
<text>The president of Albania (), officially the president of the Republic of Albania (), is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the military and the representative of the unity of the Albanian people.

The president sets the date of elections and referendums, grants pardons and awards, grants citizenship and permits it to be given up, accepts the credentials of diplomats serving in Albania, appoints plenipotentiary representatives and the director of the State Intelligence Service at the proposal of the prime minister, and officially promulgates all laws passed by the Albanian parliament or by referendum. The Office of the President consists of the immediate staff of the president as well as support staff reporting to the president. The office is seated in the Presidential Office in the capital city Tirana. The spouse of the president is recognized as the first lady of Albania, but holds no official role in the presidency. She often plays a protocol role at the Presidential Palace and during official visits.

The president is elected through a secret vote and without debate by the Parliament of Albania by a majority of three-fifths of all its members and is elected for 5 years. The Constitution of Albania limits the president to a maximum of two terms in office. The president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the members of the parliament.

If the President is unable to discharge the duties of office or if the position is vacant, the speaker of the Parliament assumes the office&#x27;s powers and duties as acting president until the president resumes those powers and duties, or until the election of a new president.

== History ==
Albania has experienced different models of governance, including an international protectorate, a monarchy, a state-party regime and the parliamentary republic as well. Throughout all this period the function of the president of Albania and head of state has been exercised in various forms.

The first government after the independence was headed by Ismail Qemali, who also enjoyed the competences of the head of state. On 6 February 1914, Prince Wilhelm Wied was appointed as head of state by the Ambassadors Conference. From September 1914 until January 1920, Albania was transformed into a battle field and experienced the change of a number of governments, where the post of the head of state was played by different governments regencies. On 8 January 1920 the Congress of Lushnjë elected the &#x27;High Council&#x27; composed by four members, one of whom would exercise the functions of the head of state by introducing and bringing back the parliamentarian way of governance. In 1924, Fan Noli was elected as head of government while exercising at the same time the functions of the head of state. After the frequent changes in governance, the Parliament of Albania approved and passed the republican form of regime on 25 January 1925 and elected Zog I of Albania as the president of Albania. The nation was proclaimed a monarchy and Ahmet Zogu was crowned the King of Albanians on 28 September 1928. After Albania was occupied by Italy in April 1939 and the unification of the two countries, Victor Emmanuel III became the King of Albania. From 1943 to 1944 the regencies governance was introduced once again under the German occupation.

The end of the second World War and the liberation of Albania that took place in 1944 were followed by the holding of the first parliamentary elections in December 1945 and also by the transformation of the head of state&#x27;s function into a collegial body, the Presidium of the Parliament of Albania. During the communism from 11 January 1946 until 12 December 1990, the functions of the head of state were carried out by Omer Nishani from 10 January 1946 to 1 August 1953, by Haxhi Lleshi from 1 August 1953 to 22 November 1982 and by Ramiz Alia from 22 November 1982 to 22 February 1991. The &#x27;Presidential Council&#x27;, headed by Ramiz Alia was founded on 22 February 1991 and it lasted until 30 April 1991.

The election of the first president of the parliamentary Republic of Albania on 30 April 1991 by a multi political parties Assembly, marked the foundation of the constitutional institution of the president of Albania.

===Electoral system===
The President of Albania is elected by a secret vote and without debate in the Parliament of Albania. A candidate needs to receive votes from three-fifths of the total number of parliamentarian to win. If the required majority is not reached in the first round of voting, a second round takes place within seven days. If a majority is still not reached, a third round must take place within a further period of seven days. If required, a further two rounds must be held within seven days, with the majority needed to win reduced to an absolute majority of 50% +1 votes of the total number of parliamentarian. In the fifth round, only the two top candidates from the fourth round are kept. If after five rounds of voting no candidate has attained the necessary majority outlined for each round of voting, Parliament will be dissolved and elections must be held within 45 days.

Following the disintegration of the communist regime, the first multi-party elections in Albania were held in 1991, simultaneously with the 1991 parliamentary elections. The result was a victory for Ramiz Alia of the Party of Labour of Albania (PPSh), who received 56.2% of the vote in the third round of the elections, ahead of 3 other candidates. Sali Berisha, the Democratic Party of Albania (PD) candidate and runner-up in the election, received almost 38.7% of the vote. Ramiz Alia resigned as the president on 3 April 1992. The same year, the second presidential elections were held on 22 March 1992. The result was a victory for Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party of Albania (PD), who received 57.3% of the vote in the second round of the elections, ahead of 5 other candidates, he was elected as president on 9 April 1992. Berisha also won the third presidential election in 1997 and was re-elected on 3 February 1997, he resigned due to the Albanian unrest. The fourth presidential election were held after the 1997 parliamentary election. The result was a victory for Rexhep Meidani of the Socialist Party of Albania (PS), who was elected by the Parliament of Albania through a vote of 110 to 3. The fifth presidential elections were held on 24 June 2002. The result was a victory for Alfred Moisiu, he was chosen by both Socialist Party of Albania (PS) and Democratic Party of Albania (PD) leaders at the time Fatos Nano (PS leader) and Sali Berisha (PD leader). He was elected by the Parliament of Albania through a vote of 97 to 19.

The sixth presidential elections were held on 20 June 2007 with almost four rounds. In the first round on 20 June 2007 and 27 June 2007, no candidate was presented. The Government of Albania and the opposition presented their proposed candidate lists on 5 July 2007, but did not accept either list. Afterwards, on 14 July 2007 the third round were held. At least in the fourth round on 20 July, Bamir Topi of the Democratic Party of Albania (PD) won the election. The seventh presidential elections were held on 30 May 2012 with four rounds until 11 June 2012. The first through third rounds of voting were inconclusive. In the fourth round, the result was a victory for Bujar Nishani of the Democratic Party of Albania (PD). The most recent and eighth presidential elections were held on 19, 20, 27 and 28 April 2017. In the fourth round the incumbent Chairman of the Parliament of Albania, Ilir Meta of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) was elected as seventh president of Albania with 87 votes.

=== Oath ===

=== Office and residence ===


The Presidential Office () is the official workplace of the president. It consists of the immediate staff of the president, as well as support staff reporting to the president. Since the collapse of communism, the building was used as the Office of the president, having been used for this purpose uninterrupted up to this day. The building consists three floors where two entrance gates lead an oval driveway from the Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard.

The Presidential Palace (), popularly known as the Palace of Brigades (), is the official residence of the president of Albania. The Palace was commissioned by King Zog I of Albania to serve as his main official residence. After the second World War it has been used by the Government of Albania for holding official ceremonies and state receptions. Due to its location near the Grand Park of Tirana, its gardens are quite extensive. It is surrounded by trees for nearly 200 metres and decorated in patterns and shapes of various designs. In addition the Palace was designed by Italian well-known architect Gherardo Bosio.

The title First Lady of Albania is an unofficial title; it is not an elected one, carries no official duties, and receives no salary. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in Albanian society. The role has evolved over the years, but she is, first and foremost, the spouse of the president. However, she accompanies the president in state and official visits abroad the borders of Albania. She generally oversees the administration of Presidential Palace, the mansion that serves as the official residence, while the Presidenca serves as the official office.
