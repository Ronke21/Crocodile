<text>Buzz Lightyear is a fictional character in the Disney–Pixar &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise. He is a superhero action figure from an in-universe media franchise. Buzz is recognizable by his lime green, purple, and white space suit. Originating as a one-man band toy named Tinny, he evolved into a space ranger action figure during the development of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, a decision made by director John Lasseter. He is named after American astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the Moon. Buzz Lightyear is a recurring character in all of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise&#x27;s animated feature films, including spin-offs. In the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films he is voiced by Tim Allen.

Although Woody serves as the protagonist in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; filmography, Buzz is a prominent character, with their rivalry and friendship being a fundamental aspect of the story. In &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), unlike most of the other toys, Buzz initially believes himself to be the &quot;real&quot; Buzz Lightyear and comes to terms with being just a toy. In &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), he encounters other Buzz Lightyear action figures from the toyline who similarly believe themselves to be &quot;real&quot;, including his in-universe archenemy and father Emperor Zurg. In &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), Buzz explores a romance with cowgirl figure Jessie, while uncovering his Spanish mode. In &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019), he finds his inner voice and bids farewell to Woody, who leaves to be with Bo Peep.

The fictional character on which the toy Buzz is based also appears in the 2000 direct-to-video film &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins&quot; and its subsequent spin-off television series, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;. In these productions, he is voiced by Tim Allen and Patrick Warburton, respectively. Chris Evans voiced a version of the character in the 2022 spin-off film &quot;Lightyear&quot;, an in-universe film exploring his origin story, with James Brolin additionally voicing Zurg, an elderly, nihilistic version of Buzz from an alternate future.

Buzz received a positive reception on the release of &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Critics have described him as a pop culture icon and the greatest or most iconic Pixar character. He was named as one of the most influential toys of the 1990s by &quot;Time&quot;. His catchphrase &quot;To infinity and beyond&quot; has been described as one of the greatest film quotes of all time and he has been referenced in popular culture, including song lyrics by Beyoncé and Justin Bieber. He was named the &quot;longest-serving astronaut in space&quot; by NASA after a Buzz Lightyear action figure spent 15 months on board the International Space Station from May 2008 to September 2009.

== Development ==

=== Conception and writing ===
&quot;Toy Story&quot; originated in the 1988 short &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, an animated Pixar film about a tin toy and a baby. The film was so successful that Disney approached Pixar to develop more animated films from computer generated animation. A feature film was conceived involving a windup toy named &quot;Tinny&quot; who rivals a former favorite toy, a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy. Tinny was eventually converted into a spaceman and evolved through various design changes eventually transforming into Buzz Lightyear. Disney entered into the joint project with Pixar, then a young production studio chaired by Steve Jobs, for three computer-animated feature films in a $26 million deal. The Pixar team working on the project included John Lasseter as director, screenwriters Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter, and Ed Catmull. In the early 1980s, Lasseter and his colleagues created short films at Pixar using computer software that was still being designed but they had not produced a feature film. When Disney came on board with Lasseter&#x27;s idea, they pushed for edgier characters. Lasseter recalled that this made them unlikeable: &quot;The characters were yelling, they were cynical, they were always making fun of everybody, and I hated it.&quot; Worried about losing the deal with Disney, the Pixar team reworked the story concept within two weeks with the belief that toys could appeal to adults and teenagers. The new story centred around a boy named Andy, a cowboy leading a group of toys, and a space toy, and the film was greenlit by Disney. Lasseter named various influences on the story concept, including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the space race, and buddy comedies.
The film&#x27;s script went through various changes during development. The first draft was produced in March 1991 and followed Tinny, a one-man band toy, who is given to a boy as a birthday gift. The boy&#x27;s family take Tinny on holiday but accidentally leave him at a gas station, where he meets the ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy. From there, the two characters have to work out how to find their way back to Tinny&#x27;s owners. After a series of adventures they find their way to a kindergarten playground where they are reunited with the children. By summer 1991, Jeff Katzenberg at Disney decided that it should be a buddy film in which two conflicting characters must learn to work together. In September 1991, the Pixar team drew up a new version in which the ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy is already the favorite toy in the house and Tinny is introduced as its rival, which causes friction between the two characters.

=== Design ===
Further changes to the character followed during the development. Lasseter considered a one-man band toy to be an outdated idea and decided to change Tinny to an action figure, similar to G.I. Joe. He said, &quot;we started to analyze what a little boy would get these days that would make him so excited that he stopped playing with anything else.&quot; G.I. Joe was Lasseter&#x27;s favorite character in childhood, but later Tinny evolved into a space hero similar to Major Matt Mason. This character then went through various design iterations, initially named Lunar Larry, which was then changed to Tempus and then Morph, who wore a red space suit. Finally, the dummy character was redesigned into a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody and Morph became Buzz Lightyear. Buzz was designed to be the ultimate child&#x27;s toy. Lasseter recalled, &quot;We reached back to every favorite idea we could remember. And that of course had to involve outer space&quot;. The team knew that being a space hero, Buzz&#x27;s frame needed to be strong so that it could endure through many space missions, so they designed him with many holes for screws and rivets so that it was clear how he was constructed. They took inspiration from other action figures, incorporating a &quot;karate chop action&quot; into the arms. Buzz was also designed with pop out wings with landing lights to give children the ability to make him fly and a blinking red light bulb on his wrist to act as a laser. A button was included on his chest, which when pushed, provides digitised audio. The lime green and purple color scheme in Buzz&#x27;s design was created by Lasseter while sketching the character and was chosen as an apology to his wife for working late; lime green was the favorite color of Lasseter and purple was his wife&#x27;s favorite. The appearance of television actor Ed Kemmer was also an inspiration for Lightyear. Kemmer played Commander Buzz Corry in &quot;Space Patrol&quot;, one of the first science-fiction series on American television.

Buzz Lightyear was named in honor of Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the Moon. The film producers thought that Aldrin had &quot;the coolest astronaut name&quot;. Aldrin acknowledged the tribute when he pulled a Buzz Lightyear toy out during a speech at NASA. Aldrin did not receive any endorsement fees for the use of his nickname. In 2009, he admitted to being exasperated by Disney using his name for the character: &quot;You don&#x27;t want to tangle with Disney, the friend of children. You don&#x27;t want to challenge their lawyers – for sure, you&#x27;re going to lose.&quot;

===Voices===

Originally, when a screen test was being made, Lasseter wanted Buzz to be voiced by Billy Crystal and used audio from the film &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;. Crystal turned the role down, being of the opinion that he was the wrong voice for the character, but later said that the decision was the biggest regret of his career. Several other actors were considered for the role, including Bill Murray who turned it down and Jim Carrey. Chevy Chase also passed on the role, leaving it open for Tim Allen, before Allen was the voice and others rejected him, there were other candidates who were considered like Michael Keaton, Kevin Costner, Bruce Willis, Dan Aykroyd, Matthew Broderick, Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell, Richard Gere, Wayne Knight, Michael J. Fox, John Travolta, Adam Sandler, Dennis Quaid and Jason Alexander, who cited Chase as his idol and the reason he chose to accept the role. Allen was cast due to Lasseter enjoying his standup comedy, as he wanted the character to be funny. The honesty in Allen&#x27;s first reading for Buzz influenced Pixar to change him to a character who is unaware that he is a toy. Lasseter explained that casting Allen &quot;gave us that quality we wanted of a macho guy with a soft underbelly. Tim&#x27;s perfect at doing an everyday guy&quot;. For both Allen and Tom Hanks, the voice of Woody, it was their first time working on an animated film. Allen admitted that he was initially sceptical that the film would be successful as he thought it &quot;too high tech&quot; and too similar to a video game.

Allen continued to voice Buzz in all of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; feature films and also voiced the character for &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins&quot;, a spin-off released for direct-to-video in 2000. In addition, Allen also voiced the character in the animated short film series &quot;Toy Story Toons&quot; and in &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. Other actors have also voiced Buzz, including Pat Fraley who took on the role in the mid-1990s for various productions including &quot;Toy Story Treats&quot;, &quot;Toy Story: The Video Game&quot;, &quot;Toy Story: Animated Storybook&quot;, and &quot;Toy Story: Activity&quot;. Patrick Warburton also voiced the character in 2000 for &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, a 2D animated TV series based on the direct-to-video film. From 2008 to 2016, a show titled &quot;Toy Story: The Musical&quot; on board Disney Cruise Line featured Buzz portrayed by Noel Orput. In &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, the Spanish version of Buzz was voiced by Javier Fernandez-Peña, who returned for &quot;Toy Story Toons: Hawaiian Vacation&quot;. From 2010, Mike MacRae voiced Buzz in various video games, including &quot;Toy Story 3: The Video Game&quot;, three instances of Toy Story for &quot;Disney Infinity&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. Corey Burton portrayed Buzz in performances of &quot;Disney on Ice&quot; in 2010. Teddy Newton voiced a small Buzz character in the short film &quot;Toy Story Toons: Small Fry&quot; (2011). Additionally, James Brolin voices an older version of Buzz in &quot;Lightyear&quot;.

Chris Evans was cast as the voice of Buzz for the 2022 animated spin-off film &quot;Lightyear&quot;. After being initially intimidated by the role, Evans said that he used Allen as his inspiration but did not want to do a &quot;shameless impression&quot;. Instead, he tried to create his own interpretation of the character by lowering his voice tone while also making it a homage to Allen. Director Angus MacLane explained that his casting was intended to separate the more serious action hero version of the character from Allen&#x27;s comedic toy version in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films, which he described as &quot;a little goofier&quot; and &quot;a little dumber&quot;. &quot;Lightyear&quot; was Evans&#x27; first voice acting role. He admitted that speaking Buzz&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;To infinity and beyond&quot; was like &quot;wearing someone else&#x27;s clothes&quot; and felt that the line belonged to Allen. The casting announcement caused confusion in the media and prompted Hanks, who had remained friends with Allen since the first &quot;Toy Story&quot; film, to question why he had not been recast in the role. Allen responded to the casting in June 2022, stating that he had not commented earlier as he felt that &quot;Lightyear&quot; had no connection to the original Buzz. He criticised the film for not having a closer connection to toy Buzz and commented, &quot;There&#x27;s really no &quot;Toy Story&quot; Buzz without Woody&quot;. In February 2023, Allen was confirmed to be returning to the role for &quot;Toy Story 5&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Buzz Lightyear is a toy given as a birthday present to a boy named Andy. He is a space ranger toy with electronic features, including flashing lights and catchphrases and is based on a character in Andy&#x27;s favorite film. Like the other toys in &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Buzz comes to life, but is unaware that he is a toy, instead believing himself to be a real space ranger. An in-universe television commercial advertising Buzz Lightyear toys promotes him as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest superhero&quot; and illustrates that Buzz is a toy based on a fictional character in a successful media franchise. His delusion is expressed immediately upon entering Andy&#x27;s room, which he mistakes for a strange planet. He declares that he is stationed in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four and is tasked with protecting the galaxy from the Evil Emperor Zurg, the enemy of the Galactic Alliance. He explains to Woody that he must rendezvous with Star Command to deliver information on Zurg&#x27;s secret weapon, which can destroy entire planets and that Woody is causing him to be delayed. As an action figure, Buzz has various features, including a space suit that glows in the dark. He also takes his heroic role very seriously and is prepared to face dangerous enemies by setting his &quot;laser&quot; from stun to kill. His earnestness is often used as a form of comic relief. Being the newest toy in Andy&#x27;s room, the other toys, except for Woody, are impressed and treat him with reverence like a real space ranger. He is particularly convinced that he can fly and attempts to demonstrate this to the other toys in Andy&#x27;s room. He often uses one of his catchphrases &quot;To infinity and beyond&quot; as a rallying cry when attempting a heroic feat. Despite initially being a figure of fun for Woody, he is often proven to be courageous and the calmer and more sensible of the two, making safer decisions that demonstrate his leadership qualities. Over time Buzz develops a deep friendship with Woody and their bond continues throughout the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films. He eventually discovers that he is just a toy, which leads to a personal crisis and moments of self reflection upon discovering other Buzz Lightyear action figures in a toy store. Buzz accepts that he is not a space ranger while helping Woody to reach Andy in a moving van, where he activates his wings to glide through the air and proclaims that he is not flying, but &quot;falling with style&quot;.

==Characterization==
=== In &quot;Toy Story&quot; ===

During the development of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Buzz Lightyear was conceived to be the opposite to Andy&#x27;s favorite toy Woody. Writer Andrew Stanton explained that while Woody is an old cowboy doll, Buzz is a &quot;flashy, new space ranger toy with all the gizmos&quot;. Their rivalry over their status as Andy&#x27;s favorite toy is a fundamental aspect of the story, which Stanton said evolved into &quot;a classic buddy picture&quot;. Stanton said that it took time to develop Buzz as a character, but it became easier to define him once the team framed him not as a superhero but as a cop. Directing animator Rich Quade said that this helped to choreograph the character. Buzz was designed to move bluntly to reflect how he thinks. Story artist Jason Katz commented, &quot;the only universe Buzz patrols is in his head&quot;. Directing animator Ash Brannon said that structurally, Buzz is the opposite to Woody&#x27;s soft, floppy physique. Except for his soft, squeaky head, Buzz is produced from hard plastic and this rigidity reflects his direct, unironic character. Commenting on Buzz&#x27;s personality, Allen said he would like to have Buzz&#x27;s innocence: &quot;I wish I could look at things that simply&quot;. He said that in contrast to Woody, Buzz has a limited sense of what is real and this lack of consciousness is used for comedic effect. He noted that the dynamic between the two characters is what gives Buzz a personality, stating that his &quot;sense of being&quot; is created in the moment when he sees Woody for the first time. He described Buzz as being &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;duty-oriented&quot;, but commented that when he eventually finds his &quot;inner voice&quot;, it is &quot;plastic, ...but it works for Buzz&quot;. Allen admitted that the character Duke Caboom presented a problem for him due to the similarities in his personality to Buzz&#x27;s bravado. Consequently, he discussed the character with Keanu Reeves, the character&#x27;s voice actor, who then made some changes to the character. In &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, director Lee Unkrich said that the production team knew they wanted Buzz to switch from his usual state, so after some brainstorming, they decided that he would switch to a Spanish mode. As a result, his personality was changed into the form of a &quot;Latin lover&quot;. According to &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; director Josh Cooley, Buzz plays a pivotal role in Woody&#x27;s story arc in the moment when he decides to move on in the final scenes of the film. He commented, &quot;Buzz had to be the one who kind of gave him permission and said, &#x27;You need to do this. This is for you.&#x27;&quot; Producer Jonas Rivera described their relationship in this moment as &quot;sophisticated&quot; due to them having the ability to communicate without speaking.

===In &quot;Lightyear&quot;===

In the 2022 spin-off film &quot;Lightyear&quot;, Buzz is characterized as the fictional character in the favorite film of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; character Andy, which the Buzz Lightyear action figures were based on. For Buzz&#x27;s character in &quot;Lightyear&quot;, the Pixar team wanted to create a distinction between the heroic fictional human Buzz and the toy Buzz of &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Consequently, they needed to ensure he was both a dramatic and comedic character, rather than a character used for comic relief. He also needed to appear heroic without coming across as arrogant. Director Angus MacLane was influenced by his love of sci-fi action adventure films to imagine Buzz as he would appear to Andy in a blockbuster movie. Describing Buzz as a &quot;cool toy&quot;, he considered Buzz&#x27;s absolute confidence in himself to be the ideal comedic partner for Woody and questioned whether his backstory involving Emperor Zurg could be produced in film. Having worked as an animator on the first two &quot;Toy Story&quot; sequels, he decided that for &quot;Lightyear&quot;, Buzz&#x27;s character trait was &quot;a disagreement over the nature of reality&quot;, referring to &quot;Toy Story&quot;, in which Buzz believes himself to be a space ranger and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, where he believes that he is the Buzz Lightyear. Using his own personal experience of time passing at Pixar as his inspiration, he imagined Buzz rapidly travelling through time and consequently losing his connection to the important people in his life: &quot;This felt like a natural fit for Buzz as a hero out of time, a well-worn story in the science fiction drama.&quot; He cited various influences on his depiction of Buzz&#x27;s story, including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;. MacLane framed Buzz in the heroic form of Captain America, reinforced by casting Evans in the role, but their personalities differed due to the Captain being a team player and Buzz being an isolated character. The writers gave Buzz a character to respect and admire in the form of Alicia Hawthorne and used this relationship to eventually show Buzz what he is missing from his life. MacLane explained that Buzz&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;To infinity and beyond&quot; was used to emphasise the character&#x27;s story arc: &quot;His personal and moral failure is the realization that he isn’t perfect, and the need to embrace his imperfections.&quot; He recalled that in &quot;Toy Story&quot; the catchphrase is a joke: &quot;you can&#x27;t go beyond infinity&quot;, but in &quot;Lightyear&quot;, it was used as a &quot;secret handshake&quot; shared with his friend Alicia. Producer Galyn Susman said that it had two meanings in the film, initially being about Buzz&#x27;s next adventure and finally being &quot;much more about being together and being here in the present.&quot; In the film, Buzz is transported to Zurg&#x27;s spaceship, where he contemplates whether Zurg is his father, a reference to a comedic moment in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; that mimics a &quot;Star Wars&quot; scene, where Zurg tells a Buzz Lightyear figure that he is his father. &quot;Lightyear&quot;″s story flips this by revealing that Zurg is really an older version of Buzz from an alternate timeline. MacLane realised that employing the same plot point as in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; would not have worked with audiences because it would be expected: &quot;What we were really going for was the idea that Buzz&#x27;s greatest enemy is himself, literally and figuratively&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Toy Story&quot; films===
====&quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995)====

Buzz Lightyear, an action figure, is given to a boy named Andy Davis from his mother as a birthday present. He quickly impresses the other toys with his skills, flashy accessories and wings, and soon becomes Andy&#x27;s favorite toy. Sheriff Woody, the former favorite toy, quickly becomes jealous. It soon becomes apparent that Buzz is unaware he is a toy, genuinely believing that he is a space ranger sent to stop the Evil Emperor Zurg. He further believes that his red light bulb &quot;laser&quot; is a deadly weapon, his wings are functional aircraft-grade steel, and that he cannot breathe with his helmet open.

After Woody unintentionally knocks Buzz out of Andy&#x27;s bedroom window, Buzz follows and confronts Woody in Andy&#x27;s car. The two become separated from Andy while fighting, and Woody tries to convince Buzz he is a toy but fails. The two are soon captured by Andy&#x27;s sadistic neighbor, Sid Phillips. Buzz sees a commercial on a TV in Sid&#x27;s house which reveals he is a toy. In denial, Buzz tries to fly and ends up breaking his arm. He falls into despair.

Sid&#x27;s toys fix Buzz&#x27;s arm, and Sid tapes him to a rocket with the intention to blow him up. Woody convinces Buzz his purpose is to make Andy happy; eventually causing Buzz to regain his resolve. He teams up with Woody to escape Sid and return to Andy. As the two pursue Andy&#x27;s van, Woody is attacked by Sid&#x27;s dog Scud. Buzz fights off the dog to rescue Woody, and Woody uses RC to rescue Buzz. When the two are still unable to catch up to Andy, Woody is forced to light the rocket and launch them into the air; Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape holding him to the rocket, saving them from exploding and flying solo for the first time, albeit, while carrying Woody. After they are reunited with Andy, Buzz and Woody remain close friends.

====&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999)====

Woody is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin, who is intent on selling him and other &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot; toys to a toy museum in Japan. Buzz leads Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex, and Hamm on a daring rescue mission. They travel to Al&#x27;s Toy Barn store, to find Woody. Buzz uses traffic cones to help the group cross a busy road. In the store, the toys get separated. Buzz discovers an aisle full of his fellow Buzz Lightyear toys, one of which has a fancy Utility Belt. The Utility Belt Buzz comes to life and &quot;arrests&quot; Andy&#x27;s Buzz and imprisons him in an empty Buzz Lightyear case. The other toys mistake Utility Belt Buzz for Andy&#x27;s Buzz, who is forced to escape the box on his own. He pursues them to Al&#x27;s apartment, but inadvertently frees an Evil Emperor Zurg action figure that is intent on destroying him.

Andy&#x27;s Buzz rejoins the group, and convinces Woody to come home. Woody invites the other Roundup toys to come with them; Jessie and Bullseye agree, but Stinky Pete refuses and locks them in (and Buzz out) when they try to escape. Al reappears and takes Woody and the Roundup toys to the airport. Andy&#x27;s Buzz and Utility Belt Buzz pursue Al into the elevator shaft with the other toys. Zurg confronts them, and reveals he is Utility Belt Buzz&#x27;s father. Rex accidentally knocks him down the elevator shaft.

Utility Belt Buzz stays behind with Zurg, while Andy&#x27;s Buzz and the other toys steal a Pizza Planet truck and drive to the airport. There they subdue Stinky Pete and rescue Woody and Bullseye in the baggage handling system. Buzz and Woody ride Bullseye onto the runway to rescue Jessie from the airplane before it takes off for Japan. The toys all return home in a stolen baggage cart. Buzz develops a crush on Jessie. He and Woody decide not to worry about Andy growing up, as they will always have each other as friends for &quot;infinity and beyond&quot;.

====&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010)====

Woody, Buzz, and the other toys accidentally end up in a daycare center after Andy&#x27;s mother mistakes them for trash while Andy is packing for college. Buzz decides that the best thing the toys can do is to stay together at the daycare, causing Woody to strike out on his own in search of Andy. Andy&#x27;s toys are greeted by Lots-o’-Huggin&#x27; Bear who is seemingly the leader of the daycare toys. He assigns them to the Caterpillar Room, where they are subjected to a rough playtime by young children. Buzz approaches Lotso and requests a transfer to the Butterfly Room but rejects Lotso&#x27;s offer to join his gang, resulting in Lotso ordering his henchmen to switch Buzz to &quot;demo&quot; mode.

Buzz&#x27;s memories and personality appear to be erased; his space ranger delusions from the first film return. Lotso takes the opportunity to make Buzz think Andy&#x27;s toys are minions of Emperor Zurg. Buzz angrily imprisons his friends and is tasked to watch over the &quot;prisoners&quot; every night, while Woody returns to Sunnyside. Attempting to restore Buzz&#x27;s memories, Andy&#x27;s toys subdue him, but accidentally reset him to his &quot;Spanish Mode&quot;. Woody manages to convince him that Andy&#x27;s toys are his &quot;amigos&quot;. Spanish Buzz helps the toys escape Sunnyside; making no secret of his love for Jessie. Lotso confronts them as they reach the dumpster outside the daycare. In the ensuing altercation, Lotso and all of Andy&#x27;s toys are dumped into a garbage truck. Buzz rescues Jessie from the trash, but is crushed by a broken TV. Jessie breaks down in tears over Buzz&#x27;s &quot;dead&quot; body, only for Buzz to awaken unharmed with his usual personality and memories restored.

At the landfill, the toys are pushed onto a conveyor belt. Buzz and Woody rescue Lotso from a shredder and help him reach an emergency stop button. Lotso abandons them and they fall into an incinerator. The three toy aliens operating a claw rescue them and they make their way home. Andy donates them all to Bonnie, a little girl Woody met at the daycare. When introducing her to Buzz, Andy describes him as &quot;the coolest toy ever&quot;. As the toys settle in at Bonnie&#x27;s house, Buzz performs a rumba with Jessie to the Spanish version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot;, to the amusement of the other toys.

====&quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019)====

When Woody and Bonnie&#x27;s new favorite toy, Forky, are separated from the group during an RV trip, Buzz, guided by his &quot;inner voice&quot;, pursues them into a carnival. He is captured by a vendor and placed with other toys as a prize, where he encounters conjoined plushies Bunny and Ducky. They are initially antagonistic, as they believe Buzz has come to lower their chances of ever being won and owned by a child. The two refuse to listen to his explanations and become further enraged when Buzz frees them and himself from the game. Thinking they will now never be owned, they pursue and attack Buzz, until Woody offers to take the two plushies to Bonnie after Forky is rescued.

Buzz, Bunny, and Ducky join forces and are tasked with retrieving keys from an antique store owner to free Forky, who is trapped inside the store. They succeed, but the mission to rescue Forky fails due to the antique store owner&#x27;s cat. After Woody and Bo Peep have a falling-out, Buzz&#x27;s inner voice guides him to rejoin Andy&#x27;s toys. Later, Forky is freed by Woody and reports that Woody and several other toys need rescuing. Buzz, Jessie and the others take over the controls of the RV and force Bonnie&#x27;s dad to drive it back to the carnival.

Woody and Buzz meet up at a carousel and Buzz notices that Woody is heartbroken about having to part with Bo again. Buzz suggests that Woody stay behind to be with Bo, knowing that Bonnie will be okay even without him. They share a final goodbye hug and part ways.

====&quot;Toy Story 5&quot; (2026)====
Buzz is set to appear in &quot;Toy Story 5&quot; and will once again be voiced by Tim Allen.

===Buzz Lightyear spin-offs===
====&quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; (2000)====

In the animated television series &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, Buzz Lightyear is a space ranger working for Star Command, protecting the universe from Evil Emperor Zurg. He works in a team alongside Mira Nova, a princess; Booster, a janitor; and XR, a robot. The series depicts a different version of Buzz Lightyear from his incarnation in &quot;Toy Story&quot;. It originated in the 2000 direct-to-video film &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins&quot;, which was written as an origin story.

====&quot;Lightyear&quot; (2022)====

In the &quot;Toy Story&quot; universe, the 2022 animated film &quot;Lightyear&quot; is Andy&#x27;s favorite movie starring the fictional character upon which his Buzz Lightyear action figure was based. The film, which was directed by Angus MacLane, tells the story of young astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Evans) who, after being marooned on a hostile planet with his commander and crew and a talking robot cat called Sox, tries to find a way back home while confronting a threat to the universe&#x27;s safety.

===Theme parks and shows===
Buzz Lightyear is a meetable character at Disney Parks and Resorts, located in Toy Story Land. A dark shooting ride named Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin launched in 1998 in Tomorrowland in Magic Kingdom. Other versions of the ride located in other Disney parks are named Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue, and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Buzz also makes a prominent appearance in the interactive 4D attraction Toy Story Mania! as a game host. He was originally intended to be excluded by Disney due to already appearing in the Astro Blasters ride, but Pixar insisted that he should appear, being an essential &quot;Toy Story&quot; character. He has also appeared alongside other &quot;Toy Story&quot; characters in Disney on Ice.

===Video games===
Various video games have been produced based on the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise. In 1995, Buzz appeared in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; video game based on the story of the first film. Buzz was voiced by Pat Fraley in the computer games &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Activity Center: Toy Story&quot;, both released in 1996. A &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; video game was released in 1999, in which Buzz is tasked with rescuing Woody. In the 1999 game &quot;Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue&quot;, the player controls Buzz instead of Woody. In the 2010 video game tie in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, the player can play as Buzz in the Toy Box mode. In 2000, a video game titled &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; was released that was based on the cartoon series of the same name. It features a playable Buzz Lightyear racing against enemies on different planets. A racing game similar to &quot;Mario Kart&quot; was released in 2001 with the title &quot;Toy Story Racer&quot;. In 2003, Buzz and Woody appeared in a skateboarding game titled &quot;Disney’s Extreme Skate Adventure&quot;. He also appears alongside Woody and the other toys in the 2009 shooting game &quot;Toy Story Mania!,&quot; a game based on the attraction in Disney parks. In 2013, a Toy Story in Space playset featuring Buzz was announced for the toys-to-life video game &quot;Disney Infinity&quot;. Woody and Buzz appear in the 2019 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III.&quot; In June 2019, Buzz appeared as a character skin with the other &quot;Toy Story&quot; characters in a Toy Story Mash Up Pack in &quot;Minecraft&quot;. In December 2022, Buzz and Woody were introduced in a content update to &quot;Disney Dreamlight Valley&quot;. In October 2023, skins based on Buzz and Woody were made available in the video game &quot;Fall Guys&quot;. In December 2024, &quot;Brawl Stars&quot; introduced Buzz Lightyear as a new playable character, available until February 2025. Additionally, a Buzz-inspired skin for the brawler Surge was released following the event.

===Other appearances===
Buzz appears in a series of television shorts titled &quot;Toy Story Treats&quot;, which aired in 1996 on ABC&#x27;s Saturday mornings. A Buzz Lightyear action figure appears in a dentist waiting room in Pixar&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. He also appears in all three &quot;Toy Story Toons&quot; episodes &quot;Hawaiian Vacation&quot;, &quot;Small Fry&quot;, and &quot;Partysaurus Rex&quot;, and the two specials &quot;Toy Story of Terror!&quot; and &quot;Toy Story That Time Forgot&quot;. Buzz and Woody appear as piñatas in Pixar&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Coco&quot;. Buzz also makes an appearance alongside various other Disney characters in the 2018 Walt Disney Animation Studios film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;.

==Merchandise==
Prior to the release of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Disney offered a licensing deal to various toy manufacturers, including Mattel and Hasbro, but they failed to foresee the success of the film. By April 1995, only five months before the film&#x27;s release, Thinkway Toys, a small Canadian manufacturer, took on the deal within the tight timeframe. Albert Chan, president and CEO of Thinkway Toys said he saw the deal as an opportunity while many manufacturers considered it a risk to produce toys for the first CGI film. Lasseter explained that in the film, Buzz Lightyear was designed as a 12-inch action figure and therefore he wanted the same size for the real Buzz Lightyear toy. This differed from the standard 5 and a half inch action figures produced in North America. Chan had reservations about the size and price but was convinced to trust Lasseter&#x27;s judgement. Anne Osberg, the president of Disney Consumer Products admitted that she had underestimated the merchandising potential of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; characters when compared to Mickey Mouse: &quot;I saw Buzz as not competitive with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Due to the enormous success of &quot;Toy Story&quot; upon its release, Thinkway Toys was unable to meet the demand for Buzz Lightyear figures in the holiday season of 1996. With the assumption that Woody would be the most popular character, only 50,000 Buzz Lightyear toys were manufactured compared to 200,000 Woody toys. The supply deficit resulted in hundreds of shoppers queuing in the hope of purchasing a Buzz Lightyear toy and required the delivery of emergency supplies, with the BBC describing Buzz as &quot;the year&#x27;s most sought-after Christmas present&quot;. Although character sales from the film resulted in $100 million in revenue, &quot;Marketing Week&quot; described it as a &quot;toy fiasco&quot; for Disney, due to the estimated loss of $300 million in unrealised sales as a result of the &quot;Buzz Lightyear drought&quot;. This was later referenced as an in-joke in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, in a scene involving Barbie giving the toys a tour of a toy store and commenting on the unforeseen demand for Buzz Lightyear toys. In subsequent years, sales of Buzz Lightyear figures remained strong. In 2010, with the release of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, over a million Buzz Lightyear action figures were sold. In 2019, Disney reported that the Buzz figure was the Disney Store&#x27;s best selling toy of all time in the UK. By 2022, Disney had sold more than 35 million Buzz Lightyears.
In May 2008, NASA and Disney announced that a Buzz Lightyear action figure would join the crew of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on mission STS-124. The 12-inch toy remained on the International Space Station (ISS), where it took part in an experiment and appeared in a video downlink from space whilst the Space Shuttle delivered the largest module of the space station – &quot;Kibō&quot;, the Japanese Experiment Module pressurized section. The flight was arranged as part of NASA&#x27;s Toys in Space program that began in 1985. The mission launched with Buzz Lightyear aboard on May 31, 2008, to celebrate the opening of Toy Story Midway Mania! at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and Disney California Adventure Park theme parks. While on board the ISS, the action figure &quot;ate&quot; dinner with the ten astronauts and cosmonauts and was seen peering out of a window. It returned after 15 months on September 11, 2009, aboard mission STS-128, as it carried the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module &quot;Leonardo&quot; as its primary payload. Its return was celebrated in a parade led by Buzz Aldrin at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. The Buzz Lightyear figure was named by NASA as the &quot;longest-serving astronaut in space&quot;. In 2012, it was donated to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

In 2009, Disney announced new merchandise for the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, including an Ultimate Buzz Lightyear robot and the Lego &quot;Toy Story&quot; product line, which was introduced with the construction of a five-foot model of Buzz Lightyear built from 40,000 Lego bricks shown at the Licensing International Expo in June 2009. In July 2010, to coincide with the release of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, Lego released a buildable Construct-a-Buzz set and other playsets featuring a Buzz Lightyear minifigure. Buzz was also included as a minifigure in the 2016 Lego Disney minifigures product line. In April 2022, a series of Lego sets was announced to coincide with the release of &quot;Lightyear&quot;, including a buildable playset of Buzz&#x27;s XL-15 spaceship. Buzz Lightyear has also been featured in numerous other licensed merchandise produced by various brands, including action figures by Mattel, costumes, clothing and accessories.

==Reception and legacy==
Buzz was well received by critics upon his debut in &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Roger Ebert described him as &quot;the most endearing toy in the movie&quot; due to him being under the illusion that he is a space ranger, while noting the &quot;poignancy&quot; of the moment when he discovers that he is just a toy. In a review of the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin considered the rivalry between Woody and Buzz as a highlight and praised Allen for &quot;posturing manfully&quot; in the role of Buzz. Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; also appreciated the emotional impact of Buzz facing up to his true identity. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; considered Buzz to be &quot;one of &#x27;Toy Story&#x27;s&#x27; pleasant surprises&quot; citing his &quot;self-absorbed and delusional&quot; personality and his inability to realize that he is a toy. Owen Gleiberman writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found Buzz to be both &quot;hilarious and touching&quot;, noting his egotistical and macho character and commenting, &quot;His belief in his own superpowers, notably the ability to fly, is so complete that the very innocence of his self-delusion becomes oddly charming.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; highlighted that in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, Buzz finally achieves his destiny as an action hero by leading a team to rescue Woody. He described Allen&#x27;s voice as &quot;sweet doltishness&quot; and commented that his &quot;tinny&quot; tone worked well in conveying an emptiness inside Buzz&#x27;s head. Emily St. James writing for &quot;Vox&quot; found a moment in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; particularly funny when Buzz faces up to his previous delusion by coming face to face with another Buzz Lightyear that does not realize he is a toy and described it as a subtle way to illustrate the character&#x27;s personal growth. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; enjoyed the comedy in Spanish mode Buzz in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, describing it as &quot;inspired&quot;. Tom Charity of &quot;CNN&quot; was also impressed by Buzz&#x27;s transformation into a fluent speaker of Spanish, complete with flamenco moves and declarations of love for cowgirl Jessie, describing him as an &quot;intergalactic toreador of love&quot;. In contrast, Austin Allison of &quot;Collider&quot; felt that Pixar struggled to decide what to do with Buzz in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; sequels outside of his identity crisis and being Woody&#x27;s friend and opined that &quot;the world built around him that fans and Pixar itself wanted to tell was too big for the stories of &quot;Toy Story&quot; to hold&quot;.

His starring role in &quot;Lightyear&quot; was met with a mixed response from critics. In an initial reaction to the film&#x27;s announcement, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Ben Child expressed bewilderment, commenting that Buzz had always been defined by his &quot;toy-ness&quot; since his first appearance and felt that it was impossible to expect an audience to reimagine him after several decades. Stephanie Zacharek writing for &quot;Time&quot; was &quot;staggered&quot; on discovering that Buzz Lightyear was not a toy but a movie character, &quot;a case of commerce imitating art&quot; and criticized the film&#x27;s plot twist for causing the audience to have less sympathy for the character. Nicholas Barber of the BBC found Buzz&#x27;s characterization in the film to be unsatisfying, describing him as &quot;a lot less endearing than the swaggering lunk we know and love from &quot;Toy Story&quot;&quot; and commenting that the writers had failed to define who he is. &quot;Vulture&quot; film critic Alison Willmore found Buzz to be the film&#x27;s core problem, stating that, in &quot;Toy Story&quot;, he was a &quot;deluded parody of the kind of one-note character that, as voiced by Evans in &quot;Lightyear&quot;, he pretty much just is&quot;. Film journalist Helen O&#x27;Hara wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that it was just another example of an unnecessary origin story for a character that had already appeared onscreen &quot;fully formed&quot;. Conversely, Alex Abad-Santox writing for &quot;Vox&quot; thought that the film successfully conveys the same character traits in &quot;Lightyear&quot; as the &quot;daring, stubborn, strong&quot; character previously seen in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films. Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also appreciated that the character in &quot;Lightyear&quot; is recognizable as Buzz Lightyear despite having a human appearance rather than that of a toy and praised Evans for &quot;channeling some of Captain America&#x27;s get-it-done spirit&quot;.

Buzz Lightyear has been described by critics as a pop culture icon. He has been listed as one of the greatest Pixar characters. &quot;IGN&quot; stated that he &quot;may be the most iconic of all Pixar characters&quot;. Charlie Green writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered his entrance in &quot;Toy Story&quot; as one of the five greatest character introductions in film. Richard Fink of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; ranked him as the best Pixar character and cited his catchphrase &quot;To infinity and beyond&quot; as one of the &quot;most iconic film quotes of all time&quot;. &quot;Yardbarker&quot; writer Chris Morgan also listed it as one of the most memorable catchphrases in film. In November 2014, the catchphrase ranked in top position in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll as the best film quote of all time. &quot;Time&quot; named Buzz Lightyear as one of the most influential toys of the 1990s, highlighting his cultural impact as a persistently popular toy and his involvement with NASA in promoting aerospace science to children. The 2008 song &quot;Single Ladies&quot; by Beyoncé includes the lyric &quot;...and delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond.&quot; Buzz Lightyear is mentioned in the 2012 song &quot;Boyfriend&quot; by Canadian pop star Justin Bieber in the lyric &quot;I can be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe.&quot;

<text>Robert Paul Kroetsch (June 26, 1927 – June 21, 2011) was a Canadian novelist, poet and nonfiction writer. In his fiction and critical essays, as well as in the journal he co-founded, &quot;boundary 2&quot;, he was an influential figure in Canada in introducing ideas about postmodernism.

He was born in Heisler, Alberta. He began his academic career at Binghamton University (State University of New York); after returning to Canada in the mid-1970s he taught at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. Kroetsch spent several years in Victoria, British Columbia, before returning to Winnipeg, then to retirement in Alberta, where he continued to write. In 2004 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

It was the first game played in the 1996 Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match, and the first time that a chess-playing computer defeated a reigning world champion under normal chess tournament conditions (in particular, standard time control; in this case 40 moves in two hours).

==Overview==
Deep Blue was a computer developed by IBM to beat grandmaster Garry Kasparov, the top chess player in the world at the time according to Elo ratings. Playing White, Deep Blue won this first game in the match on February 10, 1996, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Kasparov rebounded over the next five games, winning three and drawing two, to soundly beat the machine in the 1996 match.

==The game==

White: Deep Blue Black: Kasparov Opening: Sicilian Defense, Alapin Variation (&quot;ECO&quot; B22)

1. e4 c5 2. c3
:It is more common to play 2.Nf3, but Kasparov has deep experience with that line, so White&#x27;s opening book goes in a different direction. The IBM team determined the opening moves played by Deep Blue.
2... d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 e6 7. h3 Bh5 8. 0-0 Nc6 9. Be3 cxd4 10. cxd4 Bb4 (diagram)
:A more common move here is Be7. This was a new approach by Kasparov, developing the bishop in an unusual way. If 11.Nc3 Qa5 12.Qb3 then the game transposes into a game Kasparov previously played against Kramnik. The merit of the new move is debated. After this move, the computer left its opening book and began calculating its moves.

11. a3 Ba5 12. Nc3 Qd6 13. Nb5 Qe7 14. Ne5 Bxe2 15. Qxe2 0-0 16. Rac1 Rac8 17. Bg5
:Black now has a problem with the pinned knight on f6.

17... Bb6 18. Bxf6 gxf6
:Kasparov avoids ...Qxf6 because White would gain with 19.Nd7 by forking the Queen and Rook. Note that Kasparov&#x27;s king is now far more exposed.

19. Nc4!
:Black cannot take the d4-pawn due to Qg4+.

19... Rfd8 20. Nxb6! axb6 21. Rfd1 f5 22. Qe3!?
:Two questionable moves by Deep Blue. 21.Qg4+ Kh8 22.Rcd1 was better, bringing White&#x27;s queen and to attack Black&#x27;s .
22... Qf6 (diagram) 23. d5!
:This type of pawn sacrifice is typical of Kasparov&#x27;s style of play. Kasparov commented that he might have played 23.d5 himself in this position, since it hurts Black&#x27;s pawn structure and opens up the board, and Black&#x27;s exposed king suggests that there is probably a way to exploit the result. Kasparov has been attacking White&#x27;s d-pawn, and the computer wisely decides to advance it for an attack instead of trying to defend it.

23... Rxd5 24. Rxd5 exd5 25. b3! Kh8
:Kasparov attempts to prepare a counterattack by preparing to move his rook to the g-, but it will not work. Burgess suggests that 25...Ne7 26.Rxc8+ would have been better, though White would still have some advantage. Keene suggests that 25...Rd8! 26.Qxb6 Rd7 was Black&#x27;s best try, strengthening his passed d-pawn and .

26. Qxb6 Rg8 27. Qc5
:Black was threatening 27...Qg5 forking g2 and the white rook.

27... d4? 28. Nd6 f4 29. Nxb7
:This is a very materialistic move, typical of computers at the time; White grabs a pawn for a small gain in material. Deep Blue has not identified any threat of checkmate from Black, however, so it simply acquires the material.

29... Ne5 30. Qd5
:30.Qxd4 would lose to 30...Nf3+. If White tries 30.Nd6 with the idea of 31.Qxe5 winning the knight, Black gets decisive pressure on the g-file after 30...Nf3+ 31.Kh1 Qg6. Kasparov later commented on his opponent: &quot;My late game attack would intimidate many players into making a mistake or two, but not this one.&quot;
30... f3? 31. g3 (see diagram) Nd3
:It seems as though Black could annihilate White with 31...Qf4, threatening both ...Qxc1+ and 32.Kh2 Rxg3 winning. But instead White could play 32.Rc8!! and turn the tables on Black. Kasparov may have seen this and planned 32...Qg5 33.h4 Rxc8!! 34.hxg5 Rc1+ 35.Kh2 Ng4+ 36.Kh3 Nxf2+ and mate next move, however Deep Blue could then spoil everything with 33.Rc5.

32. Rc7 Re8??
:Kasparov makes a huge blunder, thinking he can muster an attack on White&#x27;s king. Deep Blue realizes this is not a real threat and continues to gobble material.

33. Nd6 Re1+ 34. Kh2 Nxf2 35. Nxf7+ Kg7
:35...Qxf7 36.Qd8+ and White wins.

36. Ng5+ Kh6 37. Rxh7+ 
:After 37...Kg6 38.Qg8+ Kf5 39.Nxf3, Black cannot meet the simultaneous threats of 40.Nxe1, 40.Rf7 and 40.Qd5+. Kasparov resigned.

<doc id="284337" wikidata="Q57959" url="?curid=284337" title="Jan Ullrich">
<text>Jan Ullrich (; born 2 December 1973) is a German former professional road bicycle racer. Ullrich won gold and silver medals in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He won the 1999 Vuelta a España and the HEW Cyclassics in front of a home crowd in Hamburg in 1997. He had podium finishes in the hilly classic Clásica de San Sebastián. His victorious ride in the 1997 Tour de France led to a bicycle boom in Germany. He retired in February 2007.

In 2006, Ullrich was barred from the Tour de France amid speculation of having doped. In February 2012, Ullrich was found guilty of a doping offence by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He was retroactively banned from 22 August 2011, and all results gained since May 2005 were removed from his palmarès. In 2013 he admitted to blood doping, and in 2023 to using performance enhancing substances.

==Biography==

=== Early life and amateur career ===
At a young age, Ullrich joined SG Dynamo Rostock (de) in his hometown. He won his first bicycle race at the age of nine while riding in sports shoes and on a rented bicycle. He was educated in the sports training system of the German Democratic Republic attending the KJS sports school in Berlin in 1986. In 1988, he was champion of the German Democratic Republic. The school closed two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. He, his trainer Peter Sager, and teammates joined an amateur club in Hamburg until 1994. In 1991, he was 5th in the amateur cyclo-cross world championships.

In 1993, aged 19, Ullrich won the amateur road title at the UCI Road World Championships in Oslo, as Lance Armstrong won the professional championship. The following year, he finished third behind Chris Boardman and Andrea Chiurato in the world time trial championship in Sicily.

=== Early professional career ===
In 1995, Ullrich turned professional for the Telekom team under Walter Godefroot.

Ullrich was inconspicuous in his first 18 months as a professional. In 1995 he became national time trial champion. He also achieved top ten placings on stages of the 1995 Tour de Suisse. At 21 he wanted to start the 1995 Tour de France but Godefroot thought it was early. Instead he went to the small German stage race, the Hofbräu Cup, where he ended third. Ullrich started the 1995 Vuelta a España later that year only to abandon on stage 12.

=== 1996 Tour de France ===
Ullrich gave up a place in the 1996 German Olympic team to ride his first Tour. He finished the prologue 33 seconds down. He stayed within the top 20 until the mountains on stage 7 when Miguel Induráin cracked. Ullrich finished 30 seconds back, 22 behind his teammate Bjarne Riis while Indurain finished four minutes down. On the following stage, he finished in the same group as Indurain 40 seconds behind Riis. On stage 9, Riis rode into the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification while Ullrich finished 44 seconds back and also into 5th place overall 1-minute 38 seconds from Riis.

Over the final mountains, Ullrich rode into second place behind Riis, but he conceded time on each mountain stage, eventually being nearly four minutes behind Riis. He won the final individual time trial and secured his first Tour stage win. He cut 2 minutes 18 seconds into Riis&#x27;s lead. This led Indurain to comment that Ullrich would win the Tour some day, adding that it was a remarkable victory considering that Ullrich had been helping Riis. Ullrich dismissed suggestions he would have done better if he had not had to help Riis, saying Riis had inspired the team. Jan finished his first tour in second place at 1-minute 41 seconds from his teammate Bjarne Riis.

=== 1997 Tour de France ===
Ullrich had 2 wins before the 1997 Tour; a stage in the Tour de Suisse and the national Road Race championship a week before the tour. He became favorite in the 1997 Tour de France. He started strongly, finishing second in the prologue behind Chris Boardman. On stage 9, the first mountain stage which was won by Laurent Brochard, Ullrich worked for Riis. Only on the last ascent when Richard Virenque attacked did Ullrich react. Riis struggled to keep up and finished 30 seconds behind Virenque, Marco Pantani and Ullrich. On stage 10 from Luchon to Andorra Arcalis, with Riis again falling back, Ullrich dropped back to the team car to ask permission to attack. He returned to the lead group and pushed up the climb leaving Pantani and Virenque. He finished a minute ahead which earned his first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, greeted Ullrich with &quot;Voilà le Patron&quot; (&quot;Here is the boss&quot;). Ullrich won the Stage 12 time trial with three minutes between himself and the second placed rider, Virenque, who had started three minutes in front of him.

Marco Pantani attacked on the stage to the Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Ullrich, who was nine minutes ahead of Pantani overall, limited his losses to 47 seconds. Pantani attacked again on the Morzine stage and won, while Ullrich again limited his losses. In the final time trial, won by Abraham Olano, Ullrich extended his lead over Virenque and the following day became the first German to win the Tour de France. At 23, Ullrich was the fourth youngest winner of the Tour since 1947. Two weeks later, he won the Hews Cycling Classic in Hamburg. A further two weeks later Ullrich was beaten by Davide Rebellin in a sprint in the GP Suisse. He was chosen &quot;sports person of the year&quot; in Germany in 1997.

=== 1998 Tour de France ===
Ullrich was defending champion in 1998. He took the lead in the general classification on stage 7, a time trial, over 58 km of undulating roads. However, on stage 15 Marco Pantani blew the Tour apart with a victory which began on the Galibier. Ullrich was without support when Pantani attacked. Pantani topped the Galibier alone. It was misty and the roads were wet. The descent was dangerous and Pantani increased his lead. By the bottom of the final climb, Les Deux Alpes, Pantani had nearly four minutes. Telekom brought Udo Bölts and then Riis to pace Ullrich. Pantani was race leader as he crossed the line. Ullrich finished almost nine minutes back, dropping to fourth position, six minutes behind Pantani.

Ullrich attacked on stage 16 on the Col de la Madeleine. Only Pantani could match him. Over the top, they started to work together. Ullrich won a photo-finish sprint and moved into third. He won the final stage, a 20 km time trial, and moved into second.

The Tour of 1998 was haunted by doping affairs, giving it the nickname &quot;Tour de Dopage.&quot;

In the following year during the inaugural Deutschland Tour, Ullrich fell after getting entangled with Udo Bölts during stage 3. He had a knee injury and could not ride the 1999 Tour, which ended in the first of seven &#x27;victories&#x27; for Lance Armstrong. Ullrich set his targets on the world time trial championship in October by riding the Vuelta.

=== 1999 Vuelta a España ===
On the first mountain stage, Ullrich narrowly won against the defending Vuelta a España champion Abraham Olano of Team ONCE in a group sprint that included Frank Vandenbroucke, Roberto Heras and Davide Rebellin. Olano took the leader&#x27;s golden jersey with Ullrich second. Olano won the following stage, a time trial, with almost one minute over Ullrich and increased his lead in stage 8. On stage 11, Ullrich gained 30 seconds back on Olano. Ullrich took the lead on stage 12 won by Igor González de Galdeano, Olano faltered due to a broken rib and finished seven minutes behind Ullrich. He later abandoned the race.

Gonzales de Galdeano had moved into second overall and became a threat to Ullrich. On stage 18 Banesto and other Spanish teams tried to crack Ullrich, who struggled on the final climb but recovered to limit his losses to González. In the final time trial, Ullrich won by almost three minutes and built his overall lead to four minutes on González. Ullrich won his second major Tour. Several weeks later he became world time trial champion over Sweden&#x27;s Michael Andersson and Briton Chris Boardman.

===&#x27;Eternal second&#x27; behind Armstrong===

====2000–2002 Tours====
The 2000 Tour de France brought Ullrich, Marco Pantani and Armstrong against each other for the first time. Armstrong proved too strong and won then and again in 2001. Ullrich crashed during a descent in 2001 and Armstrong waited for him to return to his bike. Ullrich cited his failure to defeat Armstrong as why he fell into depression the following year.

Ullrich rode well in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. After establishing a three-man break with Telekom teammates Andreas Klöden and Alexander Vinokourov, Ullrich won the gold with Vinokourov second and Klöden rounding out the all-Telekom podium. He won the silver in the time-trial, losing by only seven seconds to Viatcheslav Ekimov but beating Armstrong soundly into third.

In May 2002, Ullrich had his driver&#x27;s license revoked after a drunk driving incident. After a positive blood sample for amphetamine in June 2002, Ullrich&#x27;s contract with Team Telekom was ended, and he was banned for six months. He said he had taken ecstasy with amphetamine. He had not been racing since January due to a knee injury, and the German Cycling Federation&#x27;s disciplinary committee agreed that he was not attempting to use the drug for performance enhancement, so he was given a minimum suspension.

Following a disappointing 2002 season, Ullrich was looking for a new team, with interest coming from , , and .

====2003 Tour and sportsmanship====
On 13 January 2003, Ullrich, along with his advisor Rudy Pevenage, joined Team Coast on a multi-million Euro deal. Financial problems at the team were known from the beginning of the season. These led to the Coast team folding in May 2003. Ullrich moved on to the newly founded Team Bianchi, set up from the remainders of Coast by Jacques Hanegraaf, a former cyclist at Team Telekom.

The 2003 Tour de France was the first for many years that Ullrich had not been considered a favorite. In the first week, Ullrich became sick and almost retired. He lost a minute and a half on Armstrong in the Alps. Ullrich fought back in the time trial. Armstrong had trouble with the heat and lost one and a half minutes to Ullrich. Ullrich was within a minute of Armstrong in the classification. The next day, he closed the gap by another 19 seconds in the first mountain stage. Two days later Ullrich rode away from Armstrong on the Tourmalet but Armstrong caught up. Halfway into the next climb, Luz Ardiden, Armstrong&#x27;s handlebar got caught in a spectator&#x27;s yellow musette waving in the air and he fell. Ullrich waited for Armstrong to recover, returning the courteous display by Armstrong 2 years previously. Armstrong then caught the group and attacked shortly afterwards.

Ullrich lost 40 seconds in the final kilometers, but the final time trial would be decisive. In it, Ullrich crashed and saw a stage and Tour victory disappear. He finished second, by 71 seconds.

For waiting on Armstrong after his fall during the stage to Luz Ardiden, the German Olympic Association (&quot;Deutsche Olympische Gesellschaft&quot;) gave Ullrich their fair-play medal. Commenting on Ullrich&#x27;s wait for Armstrong to recover, Dan Boyle, of the Institute for International Sport said &quot;It was an act that will live with him forever, cynics will say he lost money, but it was a highly commendable thing that he did.&quot;

====2004 and 2005 Tour====
For 2004 Ullrich returned to Team Telekom, now named T-Mobile. He won the Tour de Suisse, beating Swiss Fabian Jeker by one second overall. In the Tour de France, he finished fourth, 8:50 behind Armstrong, his first finish lower than second. Klöden finished second and Ivan Basso third.

For 2005, Ullrich again captained T-Mobile. He maintained a low profile for the early season, surfacing in the 2005 Tour de Suisse, which he finished third behind Aitor González and Michael Rogers.

The day before the 2005 Tour de France, Ullrich was training when his team car stopped unexpectedly. Ullrich hit the back window, ending up in the back seat of the car. Less than 24 hours later Ullrich was passed by Armstrong in the time trial. Ullrich fell again in the mountains, bruising his ribs. He could not keep up with Armstrong or Ivan Basso. Ullrich began focusing on finishing ahead of Michael Rasmussen for a podium position. He rode a good second time trial, beating all but Armstrong. Rasmussen had several crashes and bike changes, which gave Ullrich a podium place in the Tour.

=== Post-Armstrong ===
Armstrong retired after the Tour in 2005. Ullrich decided to ride one or two more years. Early reports said Ullrich was in better shape than previous years and could be ready for his second victory in the Tour. Ullrich finished 115th in the Tour de Romandie on 30 April. However, he injured his knee in the off-season, which could have limited his performance in the 2006 Tour, had he participated (see below).

In May, riding the Giro d&#x27;Italia to prepare for the Tour, Ullrich targeted the stage 11 50 km time trial, and won by 28 seconds over Ivan Basso, who beat Marco Pinotti by another 33 seconds. Only five riders finished within two minutes of Ullrich.

Ullrich dropped out of the Giro during stage 19, with back pain. Rudy Pevenage said the problem was not bad but that Ullrich wanted to avoid Tour de France problems.

Ullrich won the Tour de Suisse for a second time, winning the final time trial and jumping from third to first.

===Doping===
During the 2006 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Ullrich was mentioned in a doping scandal, Operación Puerto. Ullrich denied the rumors. However, on 30 June 2006, one day before the Tour de France, he was suspended from participating. Ivan Basso and other riders were also excluded. On 20 July 2006, Ullrich was fired from T-Mobile. General manager Olaf Ludwig announced the news during the 18th stage of the Tour between Morzine and Macon. Ullrich said his dismissal was &#x27;unacceptable.&#x27;

:I am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally but that it was faxed to my lawyers. I find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that I have done for the team, I am merely sent a fax.

On 3 August 2006, doping expert Werner Franke claimed Ullrich purchased, in a single year, about €35,000 worth of doping products; his claim was based on documents uncovered in the Operación Puerto doping case. A German court imposed a gag order on Franke after it found there was not enough evidence to link Ullrich to doping. On 14 September 2006, officials raided Ullrich&#x27;s house and collected DNA material while Ullrich was honeymooning with his new wife Sara. On 4 April 2007, Ullrich&#x27;s DNA sample, had &quot;without a doubt&quot; matched nine bags of blood taken from Eufemiano Fuentes&#x27; office.

On 18 October 2006, Ullrich laid off his personal physiotherapist Birgit Krohme. Speculation rose that this was a sign that Ullrich had given up hope of returning to racing. Ullrich denied these rumors. One day later, Ullrich canceled his licence of the Swiss Cycling Federation, and was looking for a different federation for a licence of 2007. Ullrich claimed that the Swiss Cycling Federation had to stop their doping investigation, but the Swiss federation continued the investigation. On 25 October 2006, a document from the Spanish court on Ullrich&#x27;s website stated that no charges would be filed.

On Monday, 26 February 2007, Ullrich retired. At the press conference in Hamburg he said, &quot;Today, I&#x27;m ending my career as a professional cyclist. I never once cheated as a cyclist.&quot; He said he would be an advisor to .

The IOC has investigated if Ullrich should be stripped of his gold medal won at the 2000 Olympic Games, which was possible because there was an eight-year deadline for investigations, and the investigation started after seven years. It was decided that there was no solid evidence against Ullrich, and that Ullrich could keep his medal.

In 2008, the German investigation was closed after a settlement, which by German law means Ullrich was found not guilty. The Swiss investigation was still ongoing at that time, but they closed the case in February 2010, because Ullrich was no longer member of the Swiss Cycling Federation, and so they had no jurisdiction after he retired. The UCI appealed that decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

In 2010, with the doping allegations still ongoing, Ullrich was diagnosed with burn-out, and avoided public appearances for a few months. When Lance Armstrong announced his comeback as a professional cyclist, Ullrich made clear that he was not going to do the same.

In February 2012, Ullrich was found guilty of a doping offence by the CAS. He was retroactively banned from 22 August 2011, and all results gained since May 2005 were removed from his Palmares. Ullrich published a statement on his website, that said he would not appeal the decision. He admitted that he had had contact with Fuentes, which he considered a mistake that he now regrets.

In June 2013, Ullrich went on record stating that he&#x27;d &quot;always said that Lance wouldn&#x27;t get out of it. He made too many enemies.&quot; Later that month, he admitted that he doped with the help of Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes. His name was on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004.

In 2023, Ullrich admitted to using performance enhancing substances throughout his career, starting from when he turned professional in 1995 with the Telekom team.

===Refusal to return Olympic medals===
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics Ullrich finished 1st in the men&#x27;s road race and 2nd in the men&#x27;s time trial race. Unlike Armstrong who had been stripped of his medal and had returned it, he said that he refused to return his medals if he was stripped of his finishes. In an interview with Sky Sports he said: &quot;Almost everyone at the time was taking performance-enhancing substances. I didn&#x27;t take anything that was not taken by the others. It would only have been cheating for me if I had gotten an advantage, which was not the case. I just wanted to ensure I had an equal opportunity.&quot; To date, Ullrich has not been stripped of his finishes.

== Ullrich bicycles ==
In May 2006 Ullrich launched Jan Ullrich Collection bicycles, which he helped to develop.

The bicycles are built in a partnership with German builders Ghost Bikes.

==Personal life==

Ullrich lived in Merdingen, Germany, from 1994 to 2002 with his partner, Gaby Weiss, with whom he had a daughter. They moved to Scherzingen, municipality of Münsterlingen, Switzerland, in 2002. Since separating in 2005, allegedly because Weiss&#x27;s reluctance to be in the media spotlight conflicted with Ullrich&#x27;s celebrity life, Ullrich has continued to live in Scherzingen. Weiss returned with Sarah to Merdingen. In September 2006 Ullrich married Sara Steinhauser, the sister of his former teammate and training partner, Tobias Steinhauser. They had three children.

In 2017, Ullrich was convicted of drunk driving in Switzerland after a 2014 car crash in which two people were injured. He received a suspended sentence of four years plus a fine of €10,000. Personal issues with alcohol and drugs led to his separation from his wife, Sara, at the end of 2017.

In August 2018, Ullrich faced charges in Spain after he broke in to the Mallorca home of his neighbour, the German actor and filmmaker Til Schweiger, and threatened him. An alleged attack on an escort in a Frankfurt hotel led to his admission to a psychiatric hospital. On 28 August 2019, a German court ordered him to pay a fine of €7,200.

Ullrich featured on a podcast with Lance Armstrong covering the 2021 UCI Road World Championships, in which Ullrich said that he was fully recovered from his personal difficulties but that he had almost suffered the same fate as Marco Pantani, who died following acute cocaine poisoning in 2004. Ullrich told Armstrong: &quot;Three years ago I had big problems and then you came to see me. I was so glad you came and yes, I was just like Marco Pantani . . . nearly dead.&quot;

In 2018 Ullrich revealed that he has been diagnosed with ADHD.

<doc id="284343" wikidata="Q710233" url="?curid=284343" title="2000 Taiwanese presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Taiwan on 18 March 2000 to elect the president and vice president. With a voter turnout of 83%, Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) were elected president and vice president respectively with a slight plurality.

This election ended more than half a century of Kuomintang (KMT) rule on the island, during which it had governed as a one-party state since the retreat of the government from the Chinese mainland during the closing stages of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. This was also the first time in Chinese history that a ruling political party peacefully transferred power to an opposition party under a democratic system. The nominees included the then-current vice president Lien Chan for the KMT, former provincial governor James Soong as an independent candidate (upon his loss of the KMT nomination), and former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian for the DPP.

Controversy arose throughout the course of the election; in particular, the candidacy of James Soong was beset by accusations of splitting the Kuomintang vote and involvement in corruption during the presidency of Lee Teng-hui, culminating in protests and the expulsion of the latter from the Kuomintang, while Chen&#x27;s campaign attracted criticism from neighboring China due to his party&#x27;s traditionally pro-independence stance. The issues of corruption and cross-strait relations were dominant during this election. Chen&#x27;s victory was initially seen as unlikely, but several compounded effects like the splitting of the Kuomintang vote and the aforementioned controversies are seen as having led to his victory. Chen performed most strongly in the southern part of Taiwan, while Soong tended to win in northern areas.

==Candidates and platforms==
===Kuomintang===
The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) ran vice president Lien Chan for president and Premier Vincent Siew for vice president. Both were career civil servants and Lien, originating from the Taiwanese aristocracy, was seen as aloof and unable to empathize with the common people.

Though more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, the outspoken former Taiwan governor James Soong failed to gain the Kuomintang&#x27;s nomination. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. The Kuomintang responded by expelling Soong in November 1999. It is a very common belief among KMT supporters that president Lee Teng-hui was secretly supporting Chen Shui-bian, and purposely supported the less popular Lien in order to split the Kuomintang, and this belief was given a great deal of credibility after the 2000 election with Lee&#x27;s defection to the Pan-Green coalition, though Lee&#x27;s defection came only after his expulsion by the KMT. Soong, a mainlander, tried to appeal to the native Taiwanese by nominating surgeon Chang Chao-hsiung, who is a native Taiwanese, as his running-mate. This, combined with the fact that Chang had connections to both the Democratic Progressive Party and the KMT reinforced Soong&#x27;s campaign message of bridging political and cultural divide.

In December 1999 the KMT began to attack Soong&#x27;s integrity. They sued Soong for theft, alleging that as party secretary-general, he stole millions of Taiwan dollars in cash intended for the family of the late president Chiang Ching-kuo and hid the money in the Chunghsing Bills Finance Co. Soong defended himself by saying he was acting under Lee&#x27;s direction, though Lee denied this and many found the explanation unconvincing. Initially holding a commanding lead in the polls, Soong ended up losing by just over 300,000 votes.

Both candidates had some obstacles presenting themselves as reform candidates with regard to corruption, given their high rank in the Kuomintang government. Soong&#x27;s strategy was to openly admit his past wrongdoing and present his insider status as an advantage: i.e. that he could most easily tackle the corruption because of his experience with it; however, many saw his credibility as a reformer as broken by his financial scandal. Lien advocated for reform, but had some difficulty in direct criticism as such attacks may have offended the ruling government; this is thought to have contributed to his defeat.

===Democratic Progressive Party===

The DPP ran former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian and Taoyuan County magistrate Annette Lu for vice president. Having run for the 1996 election on a radical independence platform and lost by a landslide, the DPP in May 1999 moderated its stance by issuing the &quot;Resolution on the Future of Taiwan&quot;. The resolution accepted the status quo and promoted the moderate view that Taiwan was already independent, so any formal declaration would not be urgently necessary, if at all, and Chen presented a more conciliatory stance regarding the mainland. Also included was the pledge that any change in Taiwan&#x27;s international status will have to be done through a referendum, thus alleviating the fear that, if elected, a DPP government would unilaterally declare independence without popular approval. The Chen-Lu ticket also promised to be more aggressive in fighting black gold, a system of connections and corruption which had become intertwined with the KMT. The last minute public endorsement of Chen Shui-bian by President of the Academia Sinica and Nobel laureate Yuan T. Lee is also thought to have played a role in his election, with Yuan T. Lee offering to negotiate with the PRC on Taiwan&#x27;s behalf.

===Other candidates===
All independent presidential tickets were required to turn in a petition of 224,000 names to the Central Election Commission to confirm their candidacy and appear on the ballot.

Former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, who had quit the party after failing to prevent Chen from running, ran as an independent with New Party (NP) legislator Josephine Chu as his running mate. As DPP Chairman, Hsu had moderated the platform of the party, promoting reconciliation with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the opening of direct links, a move not then supported by the KMT. During the 2000 campaign, the Hsu-Chu ticket promoted unification under something similar to, but not the same as, &#x27;one country, two systems&#x27;, claiming that that exact system would be &quot;bound to bring immediate loss to Taiwan&quot;.

The New Party nominated independent social commentator Li Ao—an acclaimed author, historian, and former political prisoner—for president and legislator Elmer Fung for vice president. Li, who supported &quot;one country, two systems&quot;, said he took the election as an opportunity to educate the people in Taiwan on his ideas, and show them the nation&#x27;s &quot;dark side&quot;. Despite his nomination Li refused to join the NP. Both he and the NP publicly encouraged people to vote for James Soong to the point of stating during the televised presidential debates that he was not planning to vote for himself and that people should vote for Soong so that the pro-unification vote would not be split.

A white paper issued by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) prior to the election had mentioned that they would &quot;not permit the &#x27;Taiwan question&#x27; to drag on&quot;, which generated condemnation from American leaders, including John Kerry and Stanley Roth; along with a downturn in the stock market, but little in terms of a Taiwanese reaction. Then, shortly before the election, Zhu Rongji, the premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China attempted to influence the outcome, warning that voters should &quot;not just act on impulse at this juncture, which will decide the future course that China and Taiwan will follow&quot; and should &quot;shun a pro-independence candidate&quot;, further stating that &quot;[n]o matter who comes into power in Taiwan, Taiwan will never be allowed to be independent. This is our bottom line and the will of 1.25 billion Chinese people.&quot; According to Christopher R. Hughes, emeritus professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, a conclusion was made that the statements of Chinese government had actually been counterproductive and helped Chen to win; consequently, China avoided making such an open attempt to influence the 2004 elections, adopting a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude with Chen.

==Results==
Voting was held on 18 March 2000. The Soong-Chang ticket appeared first on the ballot, followed by the Kuomintang&#x27;s Lien and Siew, then two independent tickets, Li-Fung and Hsu-Chu. The eventual winning DPP ticket of Chen and Lu were listed fifth. Chen&#x27;s ticket won by a margin of about 2.46%, ahead of Soong in second place and Chan in third. Generally, the Soong ticket led in the northern half of Taiwan, while the Chen ticket led in the south; however, there were exceptions, including Yilan County in the north, whose vote Chen won, and Taitung County in the south, whose vote Soong won.

== Aftermath ==
Chen&#x27;s victory was seen as unlikely before Soong&#x27;s financial scandal broke out. Under the first-past-the-post voting system, the split of the KMT vote between James Soong and Lien Chan, who together polled nearly 60% of the vote (compared to Chen&#x27;s 39%), played a large role in the Taiwan independence-leaning candidate Chen&#x27;s victory. Soong Chu-yu&#x27;s financial scandals, Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh&#x27;s endorsement, and arguably the last minute saber-rattling by the PRC tipped the balance to Chen&#x27;s favor. Chen&#x27;s victory marked the first time since the retreat from the mainland that a party other than the KMT won the presidency, ending 50 years of rule by the latter, which was partly under a one-party state. This also marked the first peaceful transition of power under a democratic regime in Chinese history.

As the results were announced, several thousand protesters, mostly KMT loyalists who believed Lee Teng-hui had intentionally tried to sabotage the pro-unification vote, gathered outside the KMT headquarters in Taipei and demanded Lee resign as Chairman. Lee promised to resign at the party congress in September 2000. Though the protest was without permit, the government did not order an end to it, though Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou attempted to dispel the crowd on the first night. The protesters blocked the entrances to the building and kept Lee holed in his office for hours until riot police with water cannon were able to open a path for the motorcade. Protesters also dragged presidential advisor Hsu Li-teh out of his car and beat him. The protests ended in success on March 24 when Lee resigned as KMT Chairman and was replaced by Lien. Ma Ying-jeou also resigned from the Central Standing Committee of the KMT as a result of his dissatisfaction with the leadership at the time, calling for reform.

On the day of the election, Soong announced the formation of the People First Party before a crowd of his supporters, though he urged calm and the avoidance of &quot;bloodshed&quot;. In the following party congress, Lien Chan was able to achieve Lee&#x27;s expulsion and began to move the party back towards a unificationist platform. Lee and his supporters later formed the radical pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union. Lee was expelled from KMT on 21 September 2001, the first party chairman thus far to have membership revoked. To avoid a repeat of the 2000 split, Lien and Soong agreed to run on a single ticket as president and vice president, respectively, in the 2004 election. They made the announcement on 14 February 2003, more than a year before the next presidential election. Nevertheless, they were still defeated by Chen Shui-bian in the next election.

Some authors, including John Fuh-hsieng Hsieh and Shelley Rigger, surmised that Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s ascent to the presidency was not as groundbreaking as might be thought: the presidency&#x27;s supposed power was largely drawn from the power a KMT leader would have when both the legislature and the presidency were controlled by the party, but the government of Taiwan was largely dominated by the legislative branch, which remained under the control of the KMT. As such, Chen ascended into a relatively weak presidency. Consequently, Chen&#x27;s first cabinet consisted of some KMT members along with DPP members. However, after the legislative elections in 2001, Chen was expected to be able to exert more influence, due to the KMT&#x27;s loss of a majority. Chen&#x27;s more pro-independence stance initially caused concerns on behalf of the United States to raise such that they sent senior officials to the PRC to ease tensions. Tensions later relaxed, though a somewhat rocky relationship remained.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Taiwan on 23 March 1996. It was the first direct presidential election in Taiwan, officially the Republic of China. In the previous eight elections the president and vice president had been chosen in a ballot of the deputies of the National Assembly, in accordance with the 1947 constitution. These were the first free and direct elections in the history of Taiwan.

Lee Teng-hui was re-elected President and Lien Chan as Vice President. Lee stood as the candidate of the ruling Kuomintang. He won a majority of 54% of the votes cast. His election followed missile tests by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). These were an attempt to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate and discourage them from supporting Lee, however the tactic backfired. Voter turnout was 76.0%.

==Candidates==
The ruling Kuomintang nominated president Lee Teng-hui in August 1995 at its 14th Party Congress after plans to institute a closed primary system by his opponents were thwarted. As his running mate, Lee chose Lien Chan, who had attempted to resign his position as Premier of the Republic of China to join Lee&#x27;s ticket. Lee did not accept Lien&#x27;s resignation, as Lien&#x27;s potential successors to the premiership stood little chance of legislative confirmation. After the election, the Judicial Yuan allowed Lien to keep both posts.

The opposition Democratic Progressive Party conducted an extensive nomination process: the presidential candidate was selected after two rounds of voting and fifty public debates by the two finalists. Hsu Hsin-liang, Lin Yi-hsiung, You Ching, and Peng Ming-min contended for this position. The seventy-two-year-old Peng emerged victorious and nominated legislator Frank Hsieh to be his running mate. Peng opposed trade with mainland China unless the PRC promised to &quot;treat Taiwan as an equal.&quot; Though he argued that the One-China policy would lead to another February 28 Incident, he took the position that Taiwan was already &quot;de facto&quot; independent so a formal declaration of Taiwan independence was unnecessary unless the PRC attacked. However, Peng rejected unification with the mainland outright, describing the notion as &quot;suicide&quot; and &quot;self-destruction.&quot;

Former Taiwan Provincial Governor Lin Yang-kang ran as an independent with former Premier Hau Pei-tsun as his running mate. After the pair registered as candidates, they were endorsed by New Party. Both Lin and Hau were expelled from the Kuomintang on 13 December 1995. They supported the One-China principle and favored opening direct links with the mainland. They argued that the KMT, led by Lee, had abandoned all attempts at unification.

A second independent ticket consisted of former Control Yuan President Chen Li-an for President and Control Yuan member Wang Ching-feng for Vice President. Chen Li-an, the son of former Premier and Vice President Chen Cheng, used his Buddhist background (lay leader of the Fo Guang Shan order) and stressed moral purity and honest government. He walked for eighteen days wearing a farmer&#x27;s straw hat to spread his views.

Former Taipei mayor Kao Yu-shu declared an end to his candidacy in January 1996. Feminist writer Shih Chi-ching also bid for the presidency, selecting Wu Yue-chen as her vice president. However, Shih and Wu&#x27;s campaign ended after the Judicial Yuan ruled against them, finding that the ticket failed to meet the endorsement quota. Mudslinging was rampant between the remaining four presidential tickets. The KMT claimed that the Taiwanese mafia had amputated Peng&#x27;s arm to recoup gambling debts. However, Peng had lost his arm in an American air raid on Nagasaki during World War II. Independent candidate Lin Yang-kang alleged that Lee Teng-hui had been a Chinese Communist Party member, which he denied at the time, but later admitted involvement in a 2002 interview. The Kuomintang&#x27;s website was also subject to cyberattacks. Chen Li-an criticized every other candidate for their advanced age.

==1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis==

From March 8 to March 15, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army sent ballistic missiles within (just inside the ROC&#x27;s territorial waters) off the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung. This action was intended to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate into voting against Lee and Peng, which Beijing branded &quot;absolutely identical in attempting to divide the motherland.&quot; Similarly, Chen Li-an warned, &quot;If you vote for Lee Teng-hui, you are choosing war.&quot; The crisis came to an end when two U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups were positioned near Taiwan.

Lee, who told his people to resist &quot;state terrorism,&quot; was seen as a strong leader who could negotiate with the PRC. Because of this, many constituents from southern Taiwan who favored independence voted for him. One Taipei newspaper, &quot;United Daily News&quot; reported that up to 14 to 15 percent of Lee&#x27;s 54% vote share came from DPP supporters.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Taiwan on 20 March 2004. A consultative referendum took place on the same day regarding relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party were re-elected by a narrow margin of 0.22% over a combined opposition ticket of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong. Lien and Soong refused to concede and unsuccessfully challenged the results.

==Formation of the tickets==
===Democratic Progressive Party===

In the months leading up to December 2003, there was speculation as to whether President Chen would choose Vice President Annette Lu as his running mate. Polls had consistently showed that Chen would do better with another candidate such as Taipei county administrator Su Tseng-chang or Kaohsiung mayor Frank Hsieh, and many of the DPP&#x27;s most popular lawmakers had petitioned Chen to seriously consider another candidate. After several weeks of very public infighting between various factions of the DPP, Chen formally nominated Lu as his running mate on December 11. They were backed by the Pan-Green Coalition.

The existence of only two tickets on the ballot led to several protest movements against both coalitions (most notably the Alliance of One Million Invalid Ballots) asking people to disqualify their ballots on purpose. This was partly responsible for the high number of invalid votes compared to the 2000 election.

===Kuomintang and People First Party===
In February 2003, the KMT and PFP agreed to run a combined ticket representing the entire Pan-Blue Coalition with Lien Chan for president and James Soong for vice president. The campaign emblem for the Lien-Soong campaign was a two-seat bicycle with a blue figure in the first seat and an orange figure in the second. There were initial doubts to this pairing since it was believed that the two men personally disliked each other—during the 2000 presidential election, Lien had accused Soong of positioning his family graves to interfere with Lien&#x27;s Feng Shui, forcing Lien to reposition his graves. Additionally, it was thought to be difficult for the two men to agree upon who would run for president and who would run for vice president. Though Soong polled ahead of Lien in 2000 and was thought to be much more charismatic, he ended up running for vice president. The PFP&#x27;s poor showing in the 2001 legislative election may have played a role in this decision. Initially, it was believed that the Lien-Soong ticket would be a sure win, given that both men garnered a combined 59.9% of the vote in 2000.

==Issues==

Although the political spectrum on Taiwan is defined in terms of Taiwan independence versus Chinese unification, both campaigns took moderate positions on this issue. Members of the electorate who were influenced greatly by either independence or unification were loyal iron votes for the Pan-Green or Pan-Blue coalitions respectively, so the goal of both campaigns was to capture the moderate middle.

The theme of the Pan-Green Coalition was to portray themselves as Taiwanese nationalists and reformers and the opposition as corrupt and lacking in loyalty to Taiwan. The theme of the Pan-Blue Coalition was to question Chen&#x27;s competence and also to focus in on issues which interested specific interest groups. The Pan-Blue Coalition staunchly defended the existence of the Republic of China and also rejected unification under one country, two systems. They also abandoned the Under the Roof of One China policy.

The main issues in the campaign were relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, political reform, and the economy. In addition, although they tend not be noticed by the international press, local issues were important in the campaign, particularly because these issues influence undecided voters. These issues varied from county to county but included funding for irrigation projects, the location of expressways, and location of local administrative boundaries.

As the election approached, the tone of campaigning became increasingly negative, with charges of tax evasion, draft dodging, illegal financial transactions, and domestic violence on the part of Lien Chan. Most observers attributed the negative nature of the campaign to the fact that each campaign had moderated their platforms to the extent that they were similar to each other, leaving nothing other than personal attacks to attract the few uncommitted voters in the race.

==Demographic trends and public opinion==

On the day of the election, each member of the electorate (most adult citizens aged 20 and upwards) stamped one from the two choices of president/vice-president tickets on the ballot. Since Taiwan does not provide absentee ballots, large numbers of Taiwanese expatriates living in North America and mainland China returned to Taiwan to vote. Typical estimates indicate that about 20,000 people travelled from North America and between 100,000 and 150,000 people travelled from mainland China. Most analysts believe that the voters from North America would be split evenly between the two candidates, but that those from mainland China voted overwhelmingly for Pan-Blue.

Polls indicated that Taiwan is split with about one-third identifying themselves as Pan-Blue, one-third identifying themselves as Pan-Green, and one-third as centrist. They also showed very little cross-party voting with over 90% of people who identify with one party group stating that they would vote for the party.

Pan-Blue did well among mainlanders, Taiwanese aborigines, and Hakka. They also showed strong support among 30–50-year-olds, the very rich, the very poor, and residents of northern and eastern Taiwan. Pan-Green did well among people aged 20–30 and 50–60, people with formal education (such as doctors), and residents of southern Taiwan.
The margin in favor of Pan-Blue narrowed significantly after the 228 Hand-in-Hand Rally, with some polls showing Pan-Green in the lead. Taiwanese law forbids publishing any poll results, either current or historical, less than ten days before the election.

==Platforms and strategies==

The DPP attempted to portray the Lien-Soong ticket as one which would sell out Taiwan to the PRC, and emphasized constitutional reform, proposing a new constitution, and a &quot;peace referendum&quot;. This has led to fears that Chen intends to use a new constitution and a referendum to declare Taiwan independence. Worries about this have caused the United States at several points to ask for, and receive assurances that Chen has not abandoned the Four Noes and One Without policy.

The Lien-Soong ticket attempted to portray Chen as someone who let politics get in the way of improving the Taiwanese economy. Originally emphasizing Chen&#x27;s inability to establish the Three Links with mainland China, the Lien-Soong ticket changed its message, in light of the SARS outbreak in mid-2003, to focus more on what they see as Chen&#x27;s inability to deal with the recession. Until October 2003, the Lien-Soong strategy appeared to be to avoid doing or saying anything controversial to keep its lead. This strategy was widely seen as counterproductive by the end of October when Pan-Green started to pull ahead.

Chen&#x27;s rise in the polls in 2003 caused the opposition to change its campaign strategy. To counter Chen&#x27;s platform for a new constitution by 2008, the opposition campaigned for a major constitutional change by 2004. In addition, the opposition stopped its stalling of a referendum bill. 

By the end of November 2003, the Lien-Soong ticket had appeared to recover some of the losses in polls that had occurred in October.

Both groups, in January 2004, seemed not to be focusing on issues of external policies, but instead on issues of personal finances. The Pan-Green Coalition raised the issue of Lien Chan&#x27;s personal wealth and the properties which they asserted that the Kuomintang had illegally acquired while it was the ruling party. In response, the Pan-Blue Coalition asked why Chen Shui-bian has become much wealthier after assuming the presidency.

In March 2004, as the campaign was winding down, a series of posters comparing Chen to Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Osama bin Laden were released by the Pan-Blue Coalition, creating controversy. The coalition eventually apologized to Taiwan&#x27;s Jewish community for the comparison, although it refused to do so to Chen himself.

==Reaction from the PRC==

Most observers believed that the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) would have preferred to see Chen Shui-bian replaced by an administration less sympathetic to Taiwan independence and more in favor of Chinese unification. However, some observers believed that the PRC cared less about who became the President of the ROC, than that this person establish economic linkages which Beijing believes would bind Taiwan irrevocably to the mainland.

In contrast to the elections of 1996 and 2000, the PRC was quiet in this election until early November. Most observers believed that this was because the PRC learned that any comments, especially in the form of threats, were likely to be counterproductive. The PRC broke its silence in mid November 2003 and issued several very sharp threats that it would not stand by if Taiwan declared independence. This widely was seen as in response to two factors. In early November 2003, Chen Shui-bian took an unofficial trip to the United States in which he was much more publicly seen than before. This trip increased his popularity on Taiwan to the point where most polls indicated that he was even with or slightly ahead of Lien. The trip in November 2003, also alarmed the PRC in that it appeared to convince them that the United States would do less to constrain Chen Shui-bian than they had earlier believed. In December 2003, after the United States clarified its position on Taiwan stating support for the One-China policy and opposition to any referendum that would tend to move Taiwan toward independence, the PRC toned down its criticism and focused its attention on the proposed referendum rather than on the presidential race.

===Incident of the Pan-Blue campaign offices===

In February 2004, former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao, attempted to establish four campaign office branches on mainland China with the purpose of convincing Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland to support Pan-Blue. News of this caused an uproar on Taiwan, especially after Liao was photographed with several fugitives from Taiwan. Lien Chan quickly distanced himself from this action, and Liao wrote an essay stating that his activities were not authorized. Shortly thereafter, the PRC Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman said, &quot;We did not, do not and will not interfere with elections in Taiwan...We do not care who will be elected. What we care about is the winner&#x27;s attitude towards cross-Taiwan Strait relations and national reunification,&quot; and PRC issued instructions to local officials not to allow Taiwanese businessmen to openly campaign on the mainland.

At the same time, a number of organizations were operating to help Taiwanese businessmen return to Taiwan in order to vote. Though these organizations were formally politically neutral, most Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland widely favored Pan-Blue.

==Election mechanics==
The official campaigning period was from 07:00 to 22:00 every day from February 21, 2004, to March 19, 2004, though campaign activities had gone on for over a year. Taiwanese law forbids reports of polls in the last ten days of campaigning and any campaigning on the day of the election. Ballots in Taiwan are counted by hand with results generally available within two hours of the end of the election.

Because of Pan-Blue&#x27;s strategy of having people cast no ballot in the referendum, one major controversy was the format of the election, specifically as whether the referendum questions would be on the same or different ballots as the presidency. After much debate the CEC decided that there would be a U-shaped line in which people would first cast a ballot for president and then cast a separate ballot for each of the two questions. Voters who choose not to cast a referendum ballot could exit the line at the base of the U. Near the end of the campaign, the CEC issued a number of conflicting and constantly changing directives as to what would constitute a valid ballot.

==Other developments==

===Official televised debates of the candidates===

Televised debates between the two major candidates were held on February 14 and February 22. The parties were unable to reach agreement on dates for other presidential debates and for vice-presidential debates, though both candidates provided televised statements on February 28.

===Popular mobilization===

The main figures from the Pan-Green Coalition, including Chen Shui-bian and former president Lee Teng-hui, initiated the 228 Hand-in-Hand Rally, in which more than two million people joined hands from the very north of Taiwan to south to form an unbroken human chain. As an act of defiance against the P.R.China as well as a promotion of Taiwanese national identity, it occurred on February 28 in remembrance of the February 28 Incident. This demonstration was inspired by the human chain of two million that was organized in the Baltic states in 1989, where the Soviet Union later invaded to stop the Baltic states from declaring independence. Although billed as non-political, some of the symbolism of the demonstration, particularly the point in the event where participants &quot;turn away from China,&quot; veered clearly toward support of Taiwan independence, and hence was not attended by members of the Pan-Blue Coalition.

In response, the Pan-Blue Coalition planned a series of events they dubbed &quot;&quot;Heart Connecting to Hearts&quot;.&quot; These events included several rallies on 228, a blood drive, and a run in which a torch was passed from person to person through all 369 townships and cities of Taiwan in the course of two weeks. However, these events were unsuccessful at preventing a shift in support to Pan-Green after the 228 demonstration.

In response to declining polls numbers, the Pan-Blue coalition quickly organized a program of major rallies near the end of the election. Originally, the
rallies were to protest black gold or political corruption, but the theme of the rallies were changed to
&quot;Change the President, save Taiwan.&quot; Critics of Pan-Blue argued that this change in theme was because Pan-Blue could not credibly be seen as anti-corruption. Supporters argued that this change was intended to focus the election on Chen&#x27;s presumed lack of competence as president.

On March 13, the Pan-Blue Coalition held 24 rallies across Taiwan. The two million people attending beat gongs and made other noise and shouted &quot;Change the President, save Taiwan&quot; at 3:20 PM, in reference to the election date. The theme of the rallies were widely seen as an effort by Pan-Blue to shed the image that they were not really committed to Taiwan and would sell the island out to the PRC.

Soong led the rally in Taichung and knelt to kiss the ground along with his wife. Ten minutes later, Lien after giving a speech in Taipei which heavily talked about the need to love Taiwan and defend it, unexpectedly lay down prone on the ground kissing it with his wife and KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng.

Because of the poll blackout, there are no published reports which track the effect of 313 on Taiwanese public opinion, although anecdotal reports suggest that Pan-Blue supporters were deeply moved by Lien&#x27;s actions while Pan-Green supporters saw them as disgusting and hypocritical.

===Public endorsements===

Buddhist master Wei Chueh endorsed Lien on March 11 and also urged his followers to boycott the referendum. This led to criticism from some other Buddhist leaders that his blunt condemnation of Chen broke the convention that religious figures remain politically neutral. In addition, Wei Chueh&#x27;s temple was the object of many protests and had to be shut down until after the election.

Lee Yuan-tseh, widely credited for Chen&#x27;s upset victory in 2000, issued a written statement on March 17 endorsing the Pan-Green candidates: &quot;Four years ago, I endorsed Chen Shui-bian. Four years has elapsed, and I must admit in terms of the ability to run the country, the DPP has a lot of room to improve. But in terms of ideals and momentum to carry out reforms, the DPP is still the better choice.&quot; In response, Lien Chan, when asked about Lee&#x27;s endorsement, remarked in English, &quot;So what?&quot;

===Assassination attempt===
On March 19, 2004, the last day of the election campaign, President Chen Shui-bian and Vice-president Annette Lu were both shot while campaigning in Tainan. They were traveling in an open convertible jeep in the presidential motorcade. One bullet struck Chen&#x27;s abdomen and was later found in his clothes. It resulted in a flesh wound 8 cm long and 2 cm deep (four inches long, an inch wide, and an inch deep). Another bullet grazed Lu&#x27;s knee and was found in the jeep. At first both believed that they had been hit by firecrackers, which are commonly used in Taiwanese political activities; the first sign of something more serious was when Chen noticed that he was bleeding from the abdomen, and that there was a bullet hole in the window.

Their injuries were not life-threatening, and both Chen and Lu were released from Chi-Mei Hospital on the same day without losing consciousness or having surgery. Nevertheless, the attack provoked shock and unease on Taiwan, where political violence of this kind is unknown in recent times.

Chen released a video in which he urged calm and indicated that neither his health nor the security of Taiwan were under threat. Within hours, police announced they were certain that the crime was not politically motivated, and that mainland China was not involved. On Internet chat rooms and talk radio, some Pan-Blue supporters theorized that the incident was faked in order for Chen to gain sympathy votes. These speculations were, however, considered highly offensive by Pan-Green supporters, and were not condoned by the Pan-Blue leadership until after Chen won the election.

Both Chen and Lien&#x27;s election campaigns were suspended, but the next day&#x27;s election was not postponed, as Taiwanese law only allows for suspension of election upon the death of a candidate. Lien Chan and Wang Jyng-ping tried to visit Chen on the night of the incident, but were unable to see the president because he was resting. Chen Shui-bian appeared publicly the next day when he voted.

===Subsequent events===

After all 13,749 polling places had reported, Lien appeared before his campaign headquarters and demanded a recount calling the vote &quot;unfair&quot;. He demanded a full inquiry into the assassination attempt on Chen that had happened the day before, characterizing it as surrounded by &quot;clouds of suspicion,&quot; seeming to fuel theories that it had been staged to get Chen re-elected.

On the next day, the KMT filed several lawsuits in major cities and Lien led 20,000 supporters in a march to the presidential office and staged an all night sit-in. This first set of lawsuits where thrown out because they were filed before a winner had been officially declared. Sit-ins were held in front of courthouses across Taiwan, with some protests becoming violent. The High Court ordered all ballot boxes be sealed, per Lien&#x27;s demand. Protesters continued to camp on Ketagalan Boulevard outside the presidential office, despite Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou&#x27;s calls on Sunday night to have people return to work. On Monday morning, hundreds still remained, with numbers swelling to about 10,000 in the evening. The crowds still remained until one week later, demanding a recount and an international investigation into the apparent assassination attempt.

On March 23, President Chen issued three directives to quell the contested results:
* The Legislative Yuan should revise election laws to allow automatic recount if the margin of victory is less than 1% of the votes. The law, if passed, retroactively applies to the 2004 elections
* If the law is passed, the President agrees to have the recount as soon as possible and expects Lien to acknowledge the results from the recount.
* Since the President has shown goodwill in accepting Pan-Blue coalition&#x27;s demand for a recount, the demonstrators in front of the Presidential Mansion should disperse and all protests be stopped.

The Legislature Yuan convened on March 26 to discuss the passage of the law, but the measure was not put to a vote. The Pan-Blue coalition demanded a recount by an executive order, bypassing the legislature; Chen claimed he had no such right, and that doing so would amount to declaring martial law.

Chen&#x27;s controversial victory was officially confirmed by the Central Election Commission on March 26, 2004. Pan-Blue protesters stormed and hurled eggs at the CEC in response.

On March 27, 500,000 protesters massed in front of the presidential office (where protesters had remained all week). Lien told the crowd that he had counted more than 1,000 election irregularities (though he was not specific), but urged the crowd to disperse, promising more protests in the future if their demands were not met. Chen agreed to set up an independent task force to investigate the shooting and invited Henry Lee to be its leader.

At daybreak on March 28, 1,000 riot police moved into Ketagelan Boulevard to forcibly remove the last 200 protesters remaining. Another protest was held on the following Saturday, April 3, in which 15,000 people attended. The protest was deemed illegal and violently broken up by police.

On March 29, Chen and Lu signed letters promising not to contest the newly re-filed Pan-Blue petition for a recount, bypassing a lengthy judicial inquiry. On April 2, the High Court gave both sides five days to agree on a means to conduct the recount. Meanwhile, the Pan-Blue Coalition dropped its demand for another round of voting by disenfranchised members of the military and the police. By April 7, a procedural agreement for the recount still had not been reached and Pan-Blue held another rally the following Saturday, this time more than 100,000 strong. This protest was peaceful for most of the day, but several hundred demonstrators tried to storm the president&#x27;s office in the evening. Police fired water cannons to push back the protesters.

A second lawsuit, originally filed on April 5 and refiled on April 7, charged that the Central Election Commission improperly allowed the presidential election to occur concurrently with the referendum and failed to postpone it after the apparent assassination attempt. This lawsuit sought to annul the results of the election. This was rejected by the High Court on November 4, 2004, but the Pan-Blue coalition is appealing to the Supreme Court. The Court also asked Pan-Blue to pay for the cost of the lawsuit.

A judicial recount under the jurisdiction of a special panel of the High Court began on May 10 and ended on May 18. It was conducted by about 460 teams situated in 21 courthouses across the Taiwan area. Each team comprised seven members - one judge, two members each from the district court and the local government election authorities, and two witnesses each representing the plaintiff (pan-blue alliance) and the defendant (pan-green alliance). Any disputed votes were sent to High Court in Taipei for verification. After the recount, Chen was confirmed the winner of the election by a smaller margin (25,563 from 29,518).

The High Court ruled that the election was legitimate in both lawsuits and also eventually turned down the appeals. The judges declared in the 2nd lawsuit that the voter lists did not need to be considered as evidence despite reports that widespread election fraud was found in the voter lists.

In late 2005 the Central Election Commission ruled that video cameras would no longer be allowed in voting stations and also took measures to remove certain practices such as stamping the back of IDs to prevent repeat voting.

<text>The Col du Galibier (el. ) is a mountain pass in the southern region of the French Dauphiné Alps near Grenoble. It is the eighth highest paved road in the Alps, and recurrently the highest point of the Tour de France.

It connects Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne and Briançon via the col du Télégraphe and the Col du Lautaret. The pass is closed during the winter. It is located between the massif d&#x27;Arvan-Villards and the massif des Cerces, taking its name from the secondary chain of mountains known as the Galibier.

Before 1976, the tunnel was the only point of passage at the top, at an altitude of 2556 m. The tunnel was closed for restoration until 2002, and a new road was constructed over the summit. The re-opened tunnel is a single lane controlled by traffic lights, which are among the highest such installations in Europe.

==History==
In 1876 the first passable road was opened between Maurienne and Briançon in the Oisans region. In the north the pass road begins in Valloire, only reachable via the Col du Télégraphe which is before Galibier and connects Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne with Valloire. In the south, the road begins at a level of 2,057 m Col du Lautaret, which connects Grenoble in the west with Briançon in the east. The highest point of this road was at an altitude of 2,658 m, 16 meters higher than nowadays. The road between Col du Lautaret is 24,5 kilometers long, 16 kilometers is the northern part, 8,5 kilometers is the south part. The road over the Galibier was first a natural road, later asphalted.

==Construction and opening of tunnel==

The area of the summit was a difficult passage, therefore, in 1890, a 363-meter-long tunnel was built, which was opened in 1891. This tunnel is four meters wide, allowing only for the passage of vehicles in one direction at a time.

== Details of the climb ==
From the north, starting at Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne (including the Col du Télégraphe), the climb is long, gaining in height (an average of 6.1%). The actual climb to the summit starts at Valloire and is long at an average of 6.9% (height gain: ). The maximum gradient is 10.1% at the summit.

From the south, the climb starts from the Col du Lautaret (el. ) and is long at an average gradient of 6.9% (height gain: ) with a maximum of 12.1% at the summit.

On both sides of the Col du Galibier mountain pass cycling milestones are placed every kilometre. They indicate the distance to the summit, the current altitude, and the average slope in the following kilometre.

== The Tour de France ==

The Col du Galibier was first used in the Tour de France in 1911; the first rider over the summit was Emile Georget, who, with Paul Duboc and Gustave Garrigou were the only riders not to walk.

The original summit was at 2556 m.; while the tunnel was closed from 1976 until 2002, the tour route went only over the pass closer to the mountain peak at 2645 m. In 2011, the Tour de France went through the tunnel for the first time during the 19th stage from Modane Valfréjus to L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez.

At the south portal of the tunnel, at the edge of the road, there is a monument to Henri Desgrange, instigator and first director of the Tour de France. The memorial was inaugurated when the tour passed on 19 July 1949. Whenever the tour crosses the Col du Galibier, a wreath is laid on the memorial. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange is awarded to the first rider across the summit of the highest mountain in each year&#x27;s tour. In 2006, the prize of 5,000 euros was claimed on the Col du Galibier by Michael Rasmussen.

Since 1947, the Col de Galibier has been crossed 31 times by the Tour de France. It was scheduled to be used in 1996, but was left out at the last minute due to bad weather. As a result of snow on both the Col de l&#x27;Iseran and the Col du Galibier, the scheduled 190 km stage from Val-d&#x27;Isère to Sestriere in Italy was reduced to a 46 km sprint from Le-Monetier-les-Bains which was claimed by Bjarne Riis, resulting in him taking the yellow jersey which he retained to the finish in Paris.

In the 2008 Tour, the Col du Galibier had been crossed on 23 July in the 210 km stage 17 from Embrun to Alpe d&#x27;Huez.

The 2011 Tour climbed the Col du Galibier twice to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first appearance of the pass in the Tour de France, including the first ever summit finish, won by Andy Schleck after a 60 km solo breakaway. This was the highest ever stage finish in the Tour de France. It was scheduled to be used again in stage 20 of the 2015 Tour, but was left out nine days before the race start due to landslides in the Chambon Tunnel, situated towards the bottom of the descent of the climb. It was also used twice, on stages 11 and 12, of the 2022 Tour.

=== Appearances in the Tour de France (since 1947) ===

== The Giro d&#x27;Italia ==
The 2013 Giro d&#x27;Italia climbed the Col du Galibier, although the stage had to be shortened by 4 km due to heavy snowfall.

<doc id="284355" wikidata="Q435462" url="?curid=284355" title="Raymond Poulidor">
<text>Raymond Poulidor (; 15 April 1936 – 13 November 2019), nicknamed &quot;Pou-Pou&quot; (), was a French professional racing cyclist, who rode for his entire career.

His distinguished career coincided with two other outstanding riders – Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx. This underdog position may have been the reason Poulidor was a favourite of the public. He was known as &quot;The Eternal Second&quot;, because he never won the Tour de France despite finishing in second place three times, and in third place five times (including his final Tour at the age of 40). Despite his consistency, he never wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification in 14 Tours (of which he completed 12). He did win one Grand Tour, the 1964 Vuelta a España. Of the eighteen Grand Tours that he entered in his career, he finished in the top 10 fifteen times.

==Early life and amateur career==
Raymond Poulidor was the son of Martial and Maria Poulidor, small farmers outside the hamlet of Masbaraud-Mérignat, where the Creuse region east of Limoges meets the département of Haute-Vienne. Poulidor began working on the farm where, he remembered, &quot;the soil was poor and we had to work hard; farming incomes were poor.&quot; The need for working hands on the farm meant he left school at 14 even though he wanted to continue his studies. Local entertainment went little further than village fairs, with coconut shies, sack-races, competitions for bottles of home-made jam... and inter-village cycle races. Poulidor continued to help out on his parents&#x27; farm even after he turned professional.

Poulidor was given his first bike by a local shop owner at the age of 14. He started racing bicycles at the age of 16, picking up the interest from the magazine &quot;Miroir-Sprint&quot; given to him by one of his school teachers. He initially hid his passion from his mother, who was afraid of the dangers the sport entailed.

It was only when Poulidor was taken into the army for compulsory national service in 1955 that he first travelled in a train. Pierre Chany, a French reporter who followed 49 Tours de France, drew the comparison with Poulidor&#x27;s eventual rival, Jacques Anquetil: by the time Poulidor first stepped into a train, Anquetil had already been to Helsinki, ridden the Olympic Games, won a medal for France, turned professional and won the Grand Prix des Nations. Yet there was less than two years between them.

The army sent Poulidor to the war then going on in Algeria, where he worked as a driver and put on 12 kg through lack of exercise. In 1960 he dedicated himself to cycling again and lost the weight in a month. He won his first race after army service by six minutes. When he then came second in the GP de Peyrat-le-Château and won 80,000 old francs, he calculated that he had won more in one race than he would have earned in six years on the farm.

==Professional career==
Poulidor turned professional in 1960 with the Mercier team, directed by former Tour winner Antonin Magne. Magne offered Poulidor 25,000 old francs a month. Poulidor asked for 30,000. Magne countered that that was more than he paid Gauthier and Louis Privat and refused. Later, aware that he had a rival for Anquetil, he conceded.

In just his second season, Poulidor won Milan–San Remo, one of cycling&#x27;s &quot;monument classics&quot;. from the finish, he was about to abandon after he suffered a puncture and was two minutes behind the leading riders. Magne convinced him to continue and Poulidor bridged the gap. On the climb of the Capo Berta, he attacked, joined by Albertus Geldermans and teammate Jean-Claude Annaert, who set the tempo until they reached the foot of the final climb, the Poggio. Here, Poulidor attacked again and opened a gap. Despite being guided in the wrong direction by a police man in the final corner, he was able to hold off the chasing field by three seconds to take the victory. Also in 1961, he became French road race champion.

===The Anquetil years===

Poulidor&#x27;s rivalry with Anquetil is a legend in cycling. While a good climber, Poulidor had a hard time matching Anquetil in the individual time trial, often having victory snatched from him by losing time in time-trial stages of the Tour de France.

Poulidor&#x27;s riding style was aggressive and attacking, whereas Anquetil preferred to control the race in the mountains and win time in the time-trials. Poulidor became the darling of the French public, to the ire of Anquetil. Poulidor&#x27;s mid-France upbringing and his slow Limousin speech also contrasted with Anquetil&#x27;s northern background and sharper accent. Poulidor&#x27;s face was deeply tanned and furrowed; Anquetil had high cheekbones, a smoother face and brushed-up blond hair.

Poulidor&#x27;s best chance of defeating Anquetil came in the 1964 Tour de France, in the finish on the Puy de Dôme. Anquetil rode beside Poulidor but both were so exhausted that only in the last few hundred metres could Poulidor take nearly enough time to threaten Anquetil&#x27;s first place in the general classification. The Tour organiser, Jacques Goddet, was behind the pair as they turned off the main road and climbed through what police estimated as half a million spectators.

Anquetil rode on the inside by the mountain wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other&#x27;s hot gasps on their bare arms. At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Poulidor says he was so tired that he has no memory of the two touching, although a photograph shows that they did. Of Anquetil, the veteran French reporter Pierre Chany wrote: &quot;His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks.&quot; Anquetil was only semiconscious, he said. Poulidor gained time but when they reached Paris, Anquetil still had a 55-second lead and won his last Tour de France thanks to the time-trial on the final day.

===Anquetil-Poulidor: the social significance===
Anquetil unfailingly beat Poulidor in the Tour de France and yet Poulidor remained the more popular. &quot;The more unlucky I was, the more the public liked me and the more money I earned&quot;, he said. Divisions between fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. Research showed that more than 4,000 newspaper articles appeared about him in France in just 1974 and that no other rider &quot;had ever incited so many sociological investigations, so many university theses, seeking to find the cause of his prodigious popularity.&quot;

===Poupou, the nickname===

Poulidor&#x27;s original nickname was Pouli. It was Émile Besson of the daily newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; who first wrote of Poupou. The name was taken up throughout France, leading to headlines such as &quot;Poupoularité&quot; in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. A &quot;poupée&quot; is a doll and the nickname hints at that and follows the French tradition of repeating the first syllable of a word in childspeak. Poulidor never liked the name but accepted it.

===The Merckx years===

The end of the Anquetil era presented opportunities for Poulidor to finally win the Tour de France. This was not to be due to injuries in 1967 and 1968, and the arrival of Eddy Merckx in 1969. Poulidor was no match for Merckx, although he offered much resistance.

In the 1973 Tour Poulidor almost lost his life on the descent from the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet when he plunged into a ravine, taking a serious blow to the head and crawling out with the help of the race director, Jacques Goddet.

===Poulidor and Dr Mabuse===
Antonin Magne remained manager of Poulidor&#x27;s Mercier team until 1970, when he was replaced by another former rider, Louis Caput. Caput brought with him as deputy directeur sportif a man who described himself as a homeopath, Bernard Sainz.
Sainz is known in cycling as Dr Mabuse, after a pulp-fiction character created by Norbert Jacques. Mabuse is a criminal mastermind who becomes rich through hypnotic powers. He plots to take over the world but is foiled by the police. From his cell he masterminds criminal plots by writing endless gibberish. Sainz recognises the nickname and used it in the name of his autobiography.

Sainz is a former velodrome rider of national level who stopped racing after a fall and became involved in horse racing, where he was twice convicted of maltreating horses. It was in horse-racing, where he turned unremarkable animals into champions, that he acquired his nickname. He has been repeatedly investigated by police and has been convicted of illegally practising medicine and incitement to doping. Sainz claims that he only engages in homeopathic treatment, though whatever methods he engages in are effective, casting doubt on this claim.

Louis Caput approached Edmond Mercier, the bicycle-maker behind Poulidor&#x27;s team, and asked to bring Sainz into the team management. Mercier agreed, said Sainz, because he was already treating Mercier for his own health problems. Mercier had also brought in the insurance company, GAN, as main sponsor. GAN, said Sainz, demanded that Poulidor be in the team photo even if all he did was train with the team at the start of the season. In 1971 Poulidor had decided against riding any more. The tactic, Sainz said, was bluff, to increase his motivation. In Paris–Nice, the first important stage race of the season, Poulidor was 22 seconds behind Eddy Merckx on the morning of the last day. Poulidor attacked from the start, setting a speed record on the Col de la Turbie that stood for more than 10 years and won Paris–Nice by two seconds. Next year he won Paris–Nice again and also the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré.

==Drug testing==
Raymond Poulidor was the first rider to be tested for drugs in the Tour de France. Testers arrived at the Tour for the first time in 1966, in Bordeaux, although only after word had spread and many riders had left their hotels. The first competitor they found was Poulidor.

A few other riders were found, including Rik Van Looy, and some obliged and others refused. Next morning, the race left the city on the way to the Pyrenees and stopped in the suburb of Gradignan, in the university area of La House. The riders climbed off and began walking, shouting protests in general and in particular abuse at the race doctor, Pierre Dumas, whom some demanded should also take a test to see if he&#x27;d been drinking wine or taking aspirin to make his own job easier. Riders also criticised Poulidor for accepting to be tested. He dismissed their protests and stayed at the back of the strike. Other prominent riders, including Jacques Anquetil, were at the front. Poulidor said his indifference to the controls and the strike harmed his relations with fellow riders. &quot;After that, they did me no favours in the peloton&quot;, he said.

==Retirement and death==
Poulidor has several times accepted that his career was handicapped by a lack of ambition and by the psychological domination of Jacques Anquetil. Poulidor said in an interview in 1992: I knew straight away that I was getting places everywhere. I got all the leaders&#x27; jerseys but I used to lose them. Tonin [Magne] said to me &quot;Raymond, you&#x27;re always in a daydream!&quot; &quot;And was that true? Were you distracted?&quot; It was true. I thought what was happening to me was already marvellous enough. I never thought of winning. Never, ever, did I get up in the morning with the idea of winning!

On 25 January 1973 Poulidor was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 2003 the President, Jacques Chirac increased the award. Poulidor also has a rose named after him, reflecting his love of gardening in general and roses in particular.

He lived with his wife Gisèle in Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, east of Limoges, where he made short trips on his mountain bike. Their daughter, Corinne, is married to the former world cyclo-cross champion and Tour of Flanders winner Adri van der Poel. His grandsons David and Mathieu van der Poel are also cyclists: Mathieu became cyclo-cross world champion six times, and won three of the five Monuments and a stage in the 2021 Tour de France at which he dedicated his win and yellow jersey to his grandfather.

Poulidor worked in public relations for Crédit Lyonnais, sponsor of the yellow jersey, during the Tour. He had bicycles made under his name by the France-Loire company, and has appeared in television commercials aimed at older people.

When asked about his longevity compared to fellow cyclists, Poulidor said he took things in moderation and did not overstretch himself.

Poulidor has written several biographies, the first of which was &quot;Gloire sans le Maillot Jaune&quot;, written in 1964. &quot;Poulidor Intime&quot; was published in May 2007 by Éditions Jacob-Duvernet in France. In 2004 he helped write &quot;Poulidor par Raymond Poulidor&quot; with the radio reporter Jean-Paul Brouchon. The preface is by Eddy Merckx.

On 13 November 2019, Raymond Poulidor died in Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat. He had been in a hospital for two months prior, having suffered from heart problems.

<doc id="284356" wikidata="Q17717" url="?curid=284356" title="Oscar Robertson">
<text>Oscar Palmer Robertson (born November 24, 1938), nicknamed &quot;the Big O&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Robertson played point guard and was a 12-time All-Star, 11-time member of the All-NBA Team, and one-time winner of the MVP award in 14 seasons. In 1962, he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season (the only player in history besides Russell Westbrook). In the 1970–71 NBA season, he was a key player on the team that brought the Bucks their first NBA title. His playing career, especially during high school and college, was plagued by racism.

Robertson is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, having been inducted in 1980 for his individual career, and in 2010 as a member of the 1960 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team and president of the National Basketball Players Association. Also in 1980, Robertson was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team. He was again voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. The United States Basketball Writers Association renamed their College Player of the Year Award the Oscar Robertson Trophy in his honor in 1998, and he was one of five people chosen to represent the inaugural National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame class in 2006. He was ranked as the 36th best American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN. In October 2021, Robertson was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.com/75&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was also an integral part of &quot;Robertson v. National Basketball Ass&#x27;n&quot; of 1970. The landmark NBA antitrust suit, which was filed when Robertson was the president of the NBA Players&#x27; Association, led to an extensive reform of the league&#x27;s strict free agency and draft rules and, subsequently, to higher salaries for all players. He was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Early life==
Robertson was born into poverty in Charlotte, Tennessee, on November 24, 1938. When he was approximately 18 months old, his parents moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he grew up in the segregated housing project of Lockefield Gardens. He preferred to play basketball over baseball, which was more popular in the neighborhood because it was &quot;a poor kids&#x27; game&quot;. He learned how to shoot by using tennis balls and rags wrapped with rubber bands and tossing them into a peach basket in the back of his family&#x27;s home.

==High school career==
Robertson attended Crispus Attucks High School, an all-black high school, where he was coached by Ray Crowe, whose emphasis on a fundamentally sound game had a positive effect on his style of play. As a sophomore in 1954, he starred on an Attucks team that lost in the semi-state finals (state quarterfinals) to eventual state champions Milan, a story that would later be the basis of the 1986 movie &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. When Robertson was a junior, Crispus Attucks dominated its opposition, going 31–1, and winning the 1955 state championship, the first for any all-black school in the nation. It was also the first state championship won by an Indianapolis team in the Hoosier tournament. In 1956, the team finished with a 31–0 record and won a second straight IHSAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship, becoming the first team in Indiana to secure a perfect season and compiling a state-record 45 straight victories. After their championship game wins, the team was paraded through town in a regular tradition, but they were then taken to a park outside downtown to continue their celebration, unlike other teams. Robertson stated: &quot;[Officials] thought the blacks were going to tear the town up, and they thought the whites wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot;

In his senior season, Robertson scored 24.0 points per game and was named Indiana Mr. Basketball in 1956. After his graduation that year, Robertson enrolled at the University of Cincinnati.

==College career==

Robertson continued to excel while playing for the Cincinnati Bearcats, recording a scoring average of 33.8 points per game, the third-highest in college history. In each of his three years, he won the national scoring title, was named an All-American, and was chosen College Player of the Year, while setting 14 NCAA and 19 school records.

Robertson&#x27;s stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79–9 overall record during his three varsity seasons, including two Final Four appearances; however, a championship eluded Robertson, something that would become a repeated occurrence until late in his professional career. When Robertson left college, he was the all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall-of-Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970. Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university&#x27;s greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961 and 1962, missing a third consecutive title in 1963 by just two points. He continues to stand atop the Bearcats&#x27; record book and the many records he still holds include points in one game at 62 (one of his six games of 50 points or more), career triple-doubles at 10, career rebounds per game at 15.2, and career points at 2,973.

Robertson had many outstanding individual game performances, including 10 triple-doubles. His personal best may have been his line of 45 points, 23 rebounds, and 10 assists against Indiana State in 1959. Despite his success on the court, Robertson&#x27;s college career was soured by racism. In those days, Southern university programs such as Kentucky, Duke, and North Carolina did not recruit black athletes, and road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult, with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels. Years later, he told &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forgive them.&quot; Decades after his college days, Robertson&#x27;s stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when they renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the Oscar Robertson Trophy in 1998. This honor brought the award full circle for Robertson, as he had won the first two awards ever presented.

==1960 Olympics==
After college, Robertson and Jerry West co-captained the 1960 U.S. basketball team at the 1960 Summer Olympics. The team, described as the greatest assemblage of basketball talent ever at that point, steamrolled the competition to win the gold medal. Robertson was a starting forward along with Purdue&#x27;s Terry Dischinger, but played point guard as well. He was the leading scorer of the team, as the U.S. team won its nine games by an average margin of 42.4 points. Ten of the twelve college players on the American squad later played in the NBA, including Robertson as well as future Basketball Hall-of-Famers West, Jerry Lucas, and Walt Bellamy.

==Professional career==
===Cincinnati Royals (1960–1970)===

Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson made himself eligible for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus. In his NBA debut, Robertson recorded 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 140–123 win over the visiting Lakers. On November 15, 1960, Robertson recorded a then-career-high of 44 points to go along with 15 rebounds and 11 assists in a 124–115 win over the Philadelphia Warriors. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team—which would happen in each of Robertson&#x27;s first nine seasons—and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory; however, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division. On February 10, 1962, Robertson recorded 32 points, 21 rebounds, and 16 assists in a 134–118 win over the Hawks.

In the 1961–62 season, Robertson became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire season, with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists. Robertson also set a then-NBA record for the most triple-doubles during the regular season with 41 triple-doubles; the record would stand for over half a century until 2016–17, when Russell Westbrook recorded 42 and joined Robertson as the only other player to average a triple-double for an entire season. He broke the assists record by Bob Cousy, who had recorded 715 assists two seasons earlier, by logging 899, and joined Johnny Green and Elgin Baylor as the only players in NBA history with the height of 6&#x27;5 or smaller to have grabbed 900+ rebounds in a season. The Royals earned a berth to the 1962 NBA playoffs; however, they were eliminated in the first round by the Detroit Pistons. In the 1962–63 season, Robertson further established himself as one of the greatest players of his generation, averaging 28.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 9.5 assists, narrowly missing out on another triple-double season. The Royals advanced to the Eastern Division Finals, but succumbed in a seven-game series against a Boston Celtics team led by Bill Russell.
In the 1963–64 season, the Royals achieved a 55–25 record, which put them second place in the Eastern Division. Under new coach Jack McMahon, Robertson flourished. Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to win it from 1960 to 1968. Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory. In the 1964 NBA playoffs, the Royals defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1.

Robertson averaged a triple-double over his first five seasons in the NBA with the Royals, recording averages of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game in 451 contest. On December 18, 1964, Robertson recorded a career-high 56 points on 17-for-33 shooting from the field, to go along with 9 rebounds and 12 assists in a 111–107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. From the 1964–65 season on, things began to turn sour for the franchise. Despite Robertson recording averages of at least 24.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.1 assists in the six following seasons, the Royals were eliminated in the first round from 1965 to 1967, then missed the playoffs from 1968 to 1970. In the 1969–70 season, the sixth disappointing season in a row, fan support was waning. To help attract the public, 41-year-old head coach Bob Cousy made a short comeback as a player. For seven games, the former Celtics point guard partnered with Robertson in the Royals&#x27; backcourt, but they missed the playoffs.

===Milwaukee Bucks (1970–1974)===

Prior to the 1970–71 season, the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk. No reasons were officially given, but many pundits suspected head coach Bob Cousy was jealous of all the attention Robertson was getting. Robertson himself said: &quot;I think he was wrong and I will never forget it.&quot;

The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured to the point that Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player; the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown, but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star. The trade proved highly beneficial for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in the 1971 NBA playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. In his first NBA finals game, Robertson recorded 22 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists for the Bucks. For the first time in his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.

From a historical perspective, Robertson&#x27;s most important contribution was made not on a basketball court but in a court of law. It was the year of the landmark &quot;Robertson v. National Basketball Ass&#x27;n&quot;, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA&#x27;s Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft, as well as the free agency clauses, were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist until 1988. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.

On the hardwood, the veteran Robertson still proved he was a valuable player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson&#x27;s last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson had the chance to end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson&#x27;s importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.

In 1995, Robertson was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame.

===Post-playing career===

After he retired as an active player, Robertson stayed involved in efforts to improve living conditions in his native Indianapolis, especially concerning fellow African-Americans. In addition, he worked as a color commentator with Brent Musburger on games televised by CBS during the 1974–75 NBA season. His trademark expressions were, &quot;Oh, my!&quot; and &quot;Oh, Brent, did you see that!&quot; in reaction to flashy or spectacular situations such as fast breaks, slam dunks, player collisions, etc. He also returned to the booth for the 1988–89 season calling games on TBS with Hot Rod Hundley.

After his retirement, the Kansas City Kings (the Royals moved there while Robertson was with the Bucks) retired his No. 14; the retirement continues to be honored by the Kings in their current home of Sacramento. The Bucks also retired the No. 1 he wore in Milwaukee. In 1994, a nine-foot bronze statue of Robertson was erected outside the Fifth Third Arena at Shoemaker Center, the current home of Cincinnati Bearcats basketball. Robertson attends many of the games there, viewing the Bearcats from a chair at courtside. In 2006, the statue was relocated to the entrance of the Richard E. Lindner Athletics Center at the University of Cincinnati.

Starting in 2000, Robertson served as a director for Countrywide Financial Corporation, until the company&#x27;s sale to Bank of America in 2008. In July 2004, Robertson was named interim head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats men&#x27;s basketball team for approximately a month while head coach Bob Huggins served a suspension stemming from a drunk-driving conviction.

After many years out of the spotlight, Robertson was recognized on November 17, 2006, for his impact on college basketball when he was chosen to be a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five people, along with John Wooden, Bill Russell, Dean Smith, and James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. In January 2011, Robertson joined a class action lawsuit against the NCAA, &quot;O&#x27;Bannon v. NCAA&quot;, challenging the organization&#x27;s use of the images of its former student athletes.

In 2015, Robertson was among a group of investors that placed a marijuana legalization initiative on the Ohio ballot. The initiative sought exclusive grow rights for the group members while prohibiting all other cultivation except small amounts for personal use. Robertson appeared in a television advertisement advocating for passage of the initiative, but it was ultimately defeated. Second efforts by groups in Ohio succeeded in 2023.

==Legacy==

Robertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history, a triple threat who could score inside, outside and also was a stellar playmaker. His rookie scoring average of 30.5 points per game is the third-highest of any rookie in NBA history, and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of his first seven seasons. Only three other players in the NBA have had more 30+-point-per-game seasons in their career. Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game, doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today. Robertson is also the first guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game, doing so three times. It was a feat that would not be repeated until Russell Westbrook managed to achieve it during the 2016–17 season. In addition to his 1964 regular-season MVP award, Robertson won three All-Star Game MVPs in his career (in 1961, 1964, and 1969). He ended his career with 26,710 points (25.7 per game, ninth-highest all time), 9,887 assists (9.5 per game), and 7,804 rebounds (7.5 per game). He led the league in assists six times; at the time of his retirement, he was the NBA&#x27;s all-time leader in career assists and free throws made, and was the second all-time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain.

Robertson also set yardsticks in versatility. If his first five NBA seasons are strung together, Robertson averaged a triple-double over those, averaging 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists. For his career, Robertson had 181 triple-doubles, a record that had never been approached for decades until by Westbrook in the 2020-21 season. These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three-point shot, which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players, did not exist when he played. In the 1967–68 season, Robertson became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season (also achieved by Nate Archibald). The official scoring and assist titles went to other players that season because the NBA based the titles on point and assist totals (not averages) prior to the 1969–70 season. During his career, Robertson won a total of six NBA assist titles, and was the first to reach the 7,000, 8,000, and 9,000 career assist milestones. For his career, Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free-throw percentage twice—in the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons.

Standing , Robertson is recognized by the NBA as the first legitimate &quot;big guard&quot;, paving the way for other oversized backcourt players like Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson. Furthermore, he is also credited with having invented the head fake and the fadeaway jump shot, a shot which Michael Jordan later became famous for. For the Cincinnati Royals, now relocated and named the Sacramento Kings, he scored 22,009 points and 7,731 assists, and is the all-time leader in both statistics for the combined Royals/Kings teams.
Robertson was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 28, 1980. On October 30, 1980, Robertson was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team. In 1996, Robertson was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team. He received the &quot;Player of the Century&quot; award by the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 2000 and was ranked third on &quot;SLAM&quot; &quot;Top 75 NBA Players&quot; in 2003, behind fellow NBA legends Jordan and Chamberlain. Furthermore, in 2006, ESPN named Robertson the second greatest point guard of all time, praising him as the best post-up guard of all time and placing him only behind Johnson. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Robertson as the 12th greatest player in NBA history. He was the second highest ranked point guard on the list again behind only Johnson. In 2017, it was announced that a life-sized bronze sculpture of Robertson would be featured alongside other Indiana sports stars at The Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis&#x27; Old National Bank Sports Legends Avenue of Champions, located in the museum&#x27;s sports park opening in 2018. In October 2021, Robertson was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

In 1959, the Player of the Year Award was established to recognize the best college basketball player of the year by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association. Five nominees are presented and the individual with the most votes receives the award during the NCAA Final Four. In 1998, it was renamed the Oscar Robertson Trophy in his honor, as the player that won the first two awards, because of his outstanding career and his continuing efforts to promote the game of basketball. In 2004, an 18&quot; bronze statue of Robertson was sculpted by world-renowned sculptor Harry Weber. In 2022, the NBA renamed its Western Conference championship trophy after Robertson. In 2024, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that the league had commissioned a statue of Robertson from sculptor Ryan Feeney to be permanently placed at Crispus Attucks High School.

==Personal life==
Robertson is the son of Mazell and Bailey Robertson. He has two brothers, Bailey Jr. and Henry. He remembers a tough childhood, plagued by poverty and racism. When a biography was going to be written about him in the 1990s, Robertson joked that his life had been &quot;dull&quot; and that he had been &quot;married to the same woman for a long time&quot;. In 1997, Robertson donated one of his kidneys to his daughter Tia, who suffered lupus-related kidney failure. He has been an honorary spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation ever since. In 2003, he published his own autobiography, &quot;The Big O: My Life, My Times, My Game&quot;. Robertson also owns the chemical company Orchem, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Regarding basketball, Robertson has stated that legendary Harlem Globetrotters players Marques Haynes and &quot;clown prince&quot; Goose Tatum were his idols. In his eighties, he still follows basketball on TV and attends most home games for the University of Cincinnati, his alma mater. He lists woodworking as his prime hobby. Robertson adds that he still could average a triple-double season in today&#x27;s basketball and that he is highly skeptical that anyone else could do it; it was later done by Russell Westbrook, whose first of four seasons doing so was the 2016–17 season. On June 9, 2007, Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both his philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts. He is also a member of the Beta Eta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

In August 2018, Robertson auctioned off his 1971 championship ring, Hall of Fame ring, and one of his Milwaukee Bucks game jerseys. Each item sold between $50,000 and $91,000. On July 20, 2021, on the eve of the Bucks winning their second championship and first since his tenure, Robertson wrote a piece in &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot; voicing his support for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.

<text>The Year 1812, Solemn Overture, Op. 49, popularly known as the 1812 Overture, is a concert overture in E major written in 1880 by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The piece commemorates Russia&#x27;s successful defense against the French invasion of the nation in 1812.

The overture&#x27;s first public performance, under the baton of Ippolit Al&#x27;tani, took place in Moscow on , under a tent, near the still unfinished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, which also memorialised the 1812 defence of Russia.

The fifteen-minute overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire, ringing chimes, and a brass fanfare finale. It has also become a common accompaniment to fireworks displays on the United States&#x27; Independence Day. The &quot;1812 Overture&quot; went on to become one of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s most popular works, along with his ballet scores to &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
The &quot;1812 Overture&quot; is scored for an orchestra that consists of the following:
* Brass band: &quot;Open&quot; instrumentation consisting of &quot;any extra brass instruments&quot; available. In some indoor performances, the part may be played on an organ. Military or marching bands also play this part. Note: the brass band or its substitute is meant to play during the finale only.
* Woodwinds: 1 piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 1 cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B and 2 bassoons
* Brass: 4 horns in F, 2 cornets in B, 2 trumpets in E, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass) and 1 tuba
* Percussion: timpani, orchestral bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, tambourine, triangle, carillon
* Strings: violins I &amp; II, violas, cellos and double basses.
* Artillery: One battery of cannons or ceremonial field artillery.

The carillon is sometimes replaced with tubular bells or recordings of carillons, or even church bells. In the sections that contain cannon shots, actual cannons are sometimes replaced by howitzers, tanks, fireworks, recorded cannons, or played on a piece of staging, usually with a large wooden mallet or sledgehammer as used in Mahler&#x27;s 6th Symphony. The bass drum, and gong/tam-tam are also regularly used as cannon substitutes or adjuncts in indoor performances.

In his 1966 Deutsche Grammophon recording, Herbert von Karajan scored the first 02&#x27;43&quot; (or 36 bars) for voices instead of strings at the start and the subsequent dialogue between strings and woodwind, adding the Russian Orthodox plainchant &quot;God Preserve Thy People&quot; text to the melody and slightly rearranging the texture to suit voices &quot;a capella&quot; rather than instruments. Two years later, the American conductor Igor Buketoff, son of a Russian Orthodox priest, went a stage further on his RCA Victrola recording with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. Not only did he deploy voices for the opening chant but he also had a children&#x27;s chorus sing the folk tune &quot;By the Gates&quot; and brought the choir back to bolster the chant and the Russian Imperial national anthem &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot;.

===Historical background: Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia===
On 7 September 1812, at Borodino, west of Moscow, Napoleon&#x27;s forces met those of General Mikhail Kutuzov in a concerted stand made by Russia against the seemingly invincible French Army. The Battle of Borodino saw casualties estimated as high as 100,000 and the French were masters of the field. It was, however, ultimately a pyrrhic victory for the French invasion.

With resources depleted and supply lines overextended, Napoleon&#x27;s weakened forces moved into Moscow, which they occupied with no delegation to receive the conquerors. Expecting a capitulation from Tsar Alexander I, the French instead found themselves in a barren and desolate city. To make things worse, 48 hours after Napoleon&#x27;s entry to the Russian city on 14 September 1812, three quarters of Moscow was burned to the ground.

Deprived of winter stores, Napoleon had to retreat. Beginning on 19 October and lasting well into December, the French Army faced several overwhelming obstacles on its long retreat: famine, typhus, freezing temperatures, harassing cossacks, and Russian forces barring the way out of the country. Abandoned by Napoleon in November, the was reduced to one-tenth of its original size by the time it reached Poland and relative safety.

In 1869, the full edition of &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy was published. The novel reported a very accurate description of the Napoleonic invasion of 1812, reviving memories of the Russian resistance. This led to the commissioning of new monuments, paintings and also of new musical compositions, including Tchaikovsky&#x27;s.

===Commission===
The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, commissioned in 1812 by Tsar Alexander I to commemorate the Russian victory, was nearing completion in Moscow in 1880; the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II would be at hand in 1881; and the 1882 All-Russia Arts and Industry Exhibition at Moscow was in the planning stage. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s friend and mentor Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that he write a grand commemorative piece for use in related festivities. Tchaikovsky began work on the project on 12 October 1880, finishing it six weeks later.

Organizers planned to have the overture performed in the square before the cathedral, with a brass band to reinforce the orchestra, the bells of the cathedral, and all the others in downtown Moscow playing &quot;zvons&quot; (pealing bells) on cueand cannons, fired from an electric switch panel to achieve the precision the musical score required. However, this performance did not take place, possibly due in part to the over-ambitious plan. Regardless, the assassination of Alexander II that March deflated much of the impetus for the project. In 1882, during the All-Russia Arts and Industry Exhibition, the Overture was performed in a tent next to the unfinished cathedral. The cathedral was completed on 26 May 1883.

Meanwhile, Tchaikovsky complained to his patron Nadezhda von Meck that he was &quot;... not a conductor of festival pieces,&quot; and that the &quot;Overture&quot; would be &quot;... very loud and noisy, but [without] artistic merit, because I wrote it without warmth and without love.&quot; He put it together in six weeks. It is this work that would make the Tchaikovsky estate exceptionally wealthy, as it is one of the most performed and recorded works from his catalog.

In Russia, during the Soviet era, the imperial anthem was replaced with the chorus &quot;Glory, Glory to you, holy Rus&#x27;!&quot; (&quot;Славься, славься, святая Русь!&quot;), which came from the finale of Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s opéra &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;, a historical drama about a patriotic commoner of the same name. The original version of the song, written by Vasily Zhukovsky and Egor Fyodorovich Rozen, praised the Tsar and the Russian Tsardom, while the latter version by Sergey Gorodetsky was one of a patriotic form and is sometimes regarded as the unofficial anthem of Russia in the 20th century and even today. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War, the original score returned.

===Adaptation in other contexts===
As a rousing patriotic hymn, the Overture has subsequently been adapted into and associated with other contexts than that of the Russian resistance to Napoleon&#x27;s invasion. The &quot;1812 Overture&quot; is popularly known in the United States as a symbol of the United States Independence Day, a tradition that dates back to a 1974 choice made by Arthur Fiedler for a performance at the Boston Pops July 4th concert.

The piece was parodied by composer Malcolm Arnold in &quot;A Grand, Grand Overture&quot; which features 4 rifles, three Hoover vacuum cleaners (two uprights in B♭ and one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an electric floor polisher in E♭; it is dedicated to President Hoover.

==Structure==
The piece begins with the simple, plaintive Russian melody of the Eastern Orthodox &quot;Troparion of the Holy Cross&quot; (also known as &quot;O Lord, Save Thy People&quot;) played by four cellos and two violas. This represents the Russian people praying for a swift conclusion to the invasion. Then, the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, is heard, representing the invading French army. Then, the melody of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is heard competing against Russian folk music, representing the two armies fighting each other as the French approached Moscow. At this point, five cannon shots are heard, representing the Battle of Borodino. This is where &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is most prominent, and seems to be winning. After this, a long descending run represents the French army retreating out of Moscow as the freezing winter winds rage on. At the end of this run the opening motif is repeated, which can be interpreted as prayers being answered. The grand finale culminates with eleven more cannon shots and the melody of &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot;.

===Anachronism of nationalist motifs===
Although La Marseillaise was chosen as the French national anthem in 1795, it was banned by Napoleon in 1805 and would certainly not have been played during the Russian campaign. It was only reinstated as the French anthem in 1879the year before the commission of the overturewhich can explain its use by Tchaikovsky in the overture. &quot;Chant du départ&quot;, nicknamed &quot;the brother of the Marseillaise&quot; by French Republican soldiers, served as the official anthem of Napoleon&#x27;s regime. However, it had been largely forgotten by 1882, while educated Russians of the time were likely to be familiar with the tune of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and recognize its significance.

Although &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; was the Russian national anthem during Tchaikovsky&#x27;s lifetime, it did not exist in 1812. There was no official Russian anthem until 1815, from which time until 1833 the anthem was &quot;The Prayer of Russians&quot; (), sung to the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot;. The two songs both start with the same words, God Save the Tsar!, but diverge after that.

&quot;O Lord, Save thy People&quot; represents the praying for deliverance from the invading army. A part of this hymn translates to &quot;Grant victory to all Orthodox Christians over their enemies.&quot; By including this hymn in the piece, Tchaikovsky is suggesting that God granted the Orthodox Russians victory over the French imperial troops. Later in the piece when &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is played, it seems as though the Russians will lose the battle. Then &quot;O Lord, Save thy People&quot;, along with &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot;, is played powerfully in the brass section with a strong display of chimes in the background. The ringing chimes are written to represent the bells of Moscow. The Bells of Moscow hold significance, because in the Russian Orthodox religion, the bells symbolize the voice of God.

== Lyrics ==
In the introduction, the prayer Tropar Krestu (Troparion to the Cross) is used. There are four versions of this prayer used in the introduction.

==Performance practice==
In a live performance, the logistics of safety and precision in placement of the shots require either well-drilled military crews using modern cannons, or the use of sixteen pieces of muzzle-loading artillery, since any reloading schemes, to attain the sixteen shots, or even a semblance of them, in the two-minute time span involved, makes safety and precision impossible with 1800s artillery. Time lag alone precludes implementation of cues for the shots for fewer than sixteen 1812-era field pieces.

==Recording history==

The earliest traceable orchestral recording, which does not include the shots and features no percussion apart from bells, was by the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra conducted by Landon Ronald, and issued by His Master&#x27;s Voice on three 12-inch 78-rpm sides in 1916. A Royal Opera Orchestra recording of about the same time similarly contains no shots at all.

Antal Doráti&#x27;s 1954 Mercury Records recording with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, partially recorded at West Point, and using the Yale Memorial Carillon in New Haven, Connecticut, uses a Napoleonic French single muzzleloading cannon shot dubbed in 16 times as written. On the first edition of the recording, one side played the &quot;Overture&quot; and the other side played a narrative by Deems Taylor about how the cannon and bell effects were accomplished. (Later editions placed the commentary after the performance on side 1 and the &quot;Capriccio Italien&quot; on side 2.) A stereophonic version was recorded on 5 April 1958, using the bells of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon, at Riverside Church. On this Mercury Living Presence Stereo recording, the spoken commentary was also given by Deems Taylor and the 1812 was coupled with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Italien&quot;. Later editions coupled the &quot;1812 Overture&quot; with Dorati&#x27;s recording of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, which featured the London Symphony Orchestra and real cannon.

The Black Dyke Band has recorded a brass band arrangement of the piece. This recording on their album &quot;Symphonic Brass&quot; includes the cannon shots as originally written.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Herbert Von Karajan, and the Don Cossacks Choir recorded the piece in 1967 for Deutsche Grammophon.

In 1971, CBS released a recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy, also featuring the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Valley Forge Military Academy band and real artillery shots. British rock drummer Cozy Powell sampled the overture at the end of the track &quot;Over The Top&quot; in his eponymous 1979 studio album.

The first digital recording occurred in 1979 by Telarc with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra headlining under the leadership of Erich Kunzel. The Kiev Symphony Chorus was secured and brought stateside for the express purpose of this recording, while the Children&#x27;s Choir of Greater Cincinnati (presently doing business as the Cincinnati Youth Choir), a regular Symphony and Pops collaborator to this day, supplied the children&#x27;s voices. The recording features the tones of the Emery Memorial Carillon (in adjacent Mariemont, Ohio) to a uniquely magnificent effect alongside high-definition cannon shots using full-sized 19th century military cannons, also specially recorded locally. In addition to becoming Telarc&#x27;s best-selling record and helping to establish them as a company, the record soon became a popular and well-known method for testing hifi record-playing equipment and related setups. Only the best and most fine-tuned allowed the cannon shots to be played properly (an accompanying warning for users not to destroy their audio equipment was included with the record).

In 1989, the Swingle Singers recorded an a cappella version of the overture as part of an album whose title is &quot;1812&quot;.

In 1990, during a worldwide celebration of the 150th anniversary of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s birth, the &quot;Overture&quot; was recorded in the city of his youth by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra using 16 muzzleloading cannons fired live as written in the 1880 score. That recording was done within earshot of the composer&#x27;s grave. The festival was televised for the first time in the United States on 9 March 1991.

The Texan band &quot;The Invincible Czars&quot; released a rock version of &quot;1812 Overture&quot; for the bicentennial of the Battle of Borodino in September 2012. The band had already debuted their arrangement of the piece at the 20th annual OK Mozart classical music festival at Bartlesville, Oklahoma, with professional orchestra musicians, in June 2009, complete with fireworks at the finale.

<text>The University of Kentucky (UK, UKY, or U of K) is a public land-grant research university in Lexington, Kentucky, United States. Founded in 1865 by John Bryan Bowman as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky, the university is one of the state&#x27;s two land-grant universities (the other being Kentucky State University). It is the institution with the highest enrollment in the state, with 35,952 students in the fall of 2024.

The institution comprises 16 colleges, a graduate school, 93 undergraduate programs, 99 master programs, 66 doctoral programs, and 4 professional programs. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, Kentucky spent $476.5 million on research and development in 2022, ranking it 61st in the nation.

The University of Kentucky has seven libraries on campus. The largest is the William T. Young Library, a federal depository that hosts subjects related to social sciences, humanities, and life sciences collections. Since 1997, the university has focused expenditures increasingly on research, following a compact formed by the Kentucky General Assembly. The directive mandated that the university become a &quot;Top 20&quot; public research institution, in terms of an overall ranking to be determined by the university itself, by 2020. Two alumni from the university have won Nobel Prizes.

==History==

===University origins===
In the early commonwealth of Kentucky, higher education was limited to children from prominent families, disciplined apprentices, and young men seeking entry into clerical, legal, and medical professions. As the first university in the territory that would become Kentucky, Transylvania University was the primary center for education. After a merger it became &quot;Kentucky University&quot;.

John Bryan Bowman was appointed head of the new &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky&quot; (called &quot;A&amp;M&quot;), a department of Kentucky University. It received federal support through the Morrill Land-Grant Act in 1865. In 1866 it opened with 190 students and 10 professors, on the campus at Ashland, The Henry Clay Estate. In 1869 James Kennedy Patterson replaced Bowman and the first degree was awarded. In 1876, the university began to offer master&#x27;s degree programs. In 1878 A&amp;M separated from Kentucky University, which reverted to its original name Transylvania University. For the new school, Lexington donated a park and fair ground, which became the core of UK&#x27;s present campus. A&amp;M was initially a male-only institution, but began to admit women in 1880.

In 1892, the official colors of the university, royal blue and white, were adopted. An earlier color set, blue and light yellow, was adopted earlier at a Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1891. The particular hue of blue was determined from a necktie, which was used to demonstrate the color of royal blue.

On February 15, 1882, Administration Building was the first building of three to be completed on the present campus. Three years later, the college formed the Agricultural Experiment Station, which researches issues relating to agribusiness, food processing, nutrition, water and soil resources and the environment. This was followed up by the creation of the university&#x27;s &quot;Agricultural Extension Service&quot; in 1910, which was one of the first in the United States. The extension service became a model of the federally mandated programs that were required beginning in 1914.

===Coeducational school: modern period===
Patterson Hall, the school&#x27;s first women&#x27;s dormitory, was constructed in 1904. Residents had to cross a swampy depression, where the now demolished Student Center later stood, to reach central campus. Four years later, the school&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;State University, Lexington, Kentucky&quot; upon reaching university status, and then to the &quot;University of Kentucky&quot; in 1916. The university led to the creation of the College of Home Economics in 1916, and Mary E. Sweeney was promoted from chair of the Department of Home Economics to dean of the college. (Later renamed the College of Human Environmental Sciences, this educational unit was folded into the College of Agriculture in 2003 as the School of Human Environmental Sciences). The College of Commerce was established in 1925, known today as the Gatton College of Business and Economics.

In 1929, Memorial Hall was completed, dedicated to the 2,756 Kentuckians who died in World War I. This was followed up by the new King Library, which opened in 1931 and was named for a long-time library director, Margaret I. King.

On March 15, 1948, Lyman T. Johnson applied to the University of Kentucky Graduate School for a doctorate degree in the Philosophy of History. Johnson was subsequently denied admission, with the registrar citing the previously passed Day Law. Johnson, citing Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 filed suit against the university for wrongful discrimination and failure to maintain equal learning intuitions. On April 27, 1949, Hiram Church Ford presided over the court case. After one day of testimony, Ford determined that the Commonwealth had failed to establish a graduate school with equal opportunity and educational quality as the graduate students offered to whites. Citing the Fourteenth amendment, Ford ruled that all qualified individuals, regardless of race, be allowed to attend the university&#x27;s graduate program until an equally academically acceptable institution is established for the use of African Americans. The university&#x27;s graduate and professional programs became racially integrated in 1949 when Lyman T. Johnson, an African American, won a lawsuit to be admitted to the graduate program. Blacks were not allowed to attend as undergraduates until 1954, following the US Supreme Court&#x27;s Brown v. Board of Education decision.

In 1939, Governor Happy Chandler appointed the first woman trustee on the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, Georgia M. Blazer of Ashland. She served from 1939 to 1960. In 1962, Blazer Hall was opened as the Georgia M Blazer Hall for Women in tribute to her.

Ground was broken for the Albert B. Chandler Hospital in 1955, when Kentucky Governor Happy Chandler recommended that the Kentucky General Assembly appropriate $5 million for the creation of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine and a medical center at the university. This was completed after a series of studies were conducted that highlighted the health needs of the citizens, as well as the need to train more physicians. Five years later, the College of Medicine and College of Nursing opened, followed by the College of Dentistry in 1962.

Nine years after the founding of The Northern Extension Center in Covington, representing the Ashland Independent School Board of Education, Ashland attorney Henderson Dysard and Ashland Oil &amp; Refining Company founder and CEO Paul G. Blazer presented a proposal to President Dickey and the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees for the university to take over the day-to-day operations and curriculum of the Ashland [municipal] Junior College, creating the Ashland Center of the University of Kentucky in 1957. University of Kentucky Extension Centers in Fort Knox (1958), Cumberland (1960), and Henderson (1960) followed.

In 1959, the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce opened and began training professionals at the master&#x27;s and doctoral level for careers in international affairs.

Authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly and signed by Governor Bert Combs on March 6, 1962, a mandate was placed upon the University of Kentucky to form a community college system. Two years later, the board of trustees implemented the legislation and established the Community College System, creating centers in Covington, Ashland, Fort Knox, Cumberland, Henderson and Elizabethtown. In 1969, the Patterson Office Tower was completed, currently the tallest building on campus.

In May 1970, students at the university began protesting the shootings at Kent State University. In response, Governor Louie Nunn deferred to the National Guard in an attempt to disperse the protesters. A ROTC building was destroyed by fire. The Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries has 13 oral history interviews with participants in the protests, university officials as well as former governor Nunn. Nine years later, the Singletary Center for the Arts opened, named in honor of former university president Otis Singletary.

===Contemporary history===
In 1997, the Kentucky General Assembly reorganized the community college system, withdrawing the university&#x27;s jurisdiction from all but the Lexington Community College. The other colleges were merged with the Kentucky Technical College system and were placed under a separate board of control.

On April 3, 1998, work began on the William T. Young Library, which was the largest university project at the time of completion. The six-level William T. Young Library was constructed on south campus and the largest book endowment among all public university libraries in the country. William T. Young got his fortune from selling his peanut butter company to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1955. Nine years after the completion of the William T. Young Library, on April 13, 2007, an entire city block of neighborhood homes were demolished and ground was broken for the Biological Pharmaceutical Complex Building, the largest academic building in the state of Kentucky, and one of the largest in the United States.

The Biological Pharmaceutical Complex Building complements the adjacent Biomedical Biological Science Research Building, and is expected to be part of the new university research campus. Other recent announcements include the construction of the new $450 million Albert B. Chandler Hospital, which will was one of the largest projects in the state&#x27;s history in terms of size and economic impact.

In 1997, the Kentucky General Assembly formed a compact with the university. The Top 20 Plan mandates that the University of Kentucky becomes a Top 20 public research university by 2020. According to the compact, states with &quot;Top 20&quot; universities feature higher average household incomes, higher education attainments, healthier lives and more financial security. The plan would also spur technological advancements due to university-based research and increase the marketability of the state to investors.

The plan produced some results,
# Enrollment increased.
# The six-year graduation rate increased from 59.5 percent in 1998 to 61.2 percent in 2007.
# Research expenditures increased from $124.8 million in 1996 to $297.6 million in 2003. It dipped slightly to $274 million for 2005. It is currently ranked 28th among public universities in sponsored research.
# Endowment increased from $195.1 million in 1997 to $538.4 million in 2005.

In 2000, the university launched &quot;The Campaign for the University of Kentucky&quot;, a $600 million fundraising effort that was used to &quot;enhance facilities, academic programs, public service, and scholarships.&quot; It passed that goal and the effort was raised to $1 billion. In March 2007, $1.022 billion was raised, months before the fundraising effort was set to end.

As of 2019, The University of Kentucky has an endowment of 1.407 billion. Prior endowments were $831.8 in 2007, $538.4 million in 2005, and $195.1 million in 1997, the rapid increases partially attributed to the &quot;Top 20&quot; Plan. Currently, the William T. Young Library book endowment is the largest among public universities in the United States.

In 2018, the new Gatton Student Center was opened on North Campus. The 378,000-square-foot facility contains a cinema, several dining facilities, ballrooms, a bookstore, bank, offices, and more.

==Academics==
===Departments===

Students are divided into 16 colleges, a graduate school, 93 undergraduate programs, 99 master programs, 66 doctoral programs, and 4 professional programs. The University of Kentucky has fifteen libraries on campus. The largest is William T. Young Library, a federal depository, hosting subjects related to social sciences, humanities and life sciences collections. In recent years, the university has focused expenditures increasingly on research, following a compact formed by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1997. The directive mandated that the university become a &quot;Top 20&quot; public research institution, in terms of an overall ranking to be determined by the university itself, by 2020. The university is ranked tied for 132nd in National Universities and tied for 60th among public universities in the 2020 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings. According to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2023 ranking table, UK Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences is ranked 6th in the nation whereas the Graduate School of Medicine (Research) is ranked 64th (tie).

Students are divided into several colleges based on their interests and specializations:
* College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, founded 1908
* College of Arts and Sciences, founded 1908
* Gatton College of Business and Economics, founded 1925 (originally as the College of Commerce)
* College of Communication &amp; Information, founded 1976

Sweeney) now a School of Human Environmental Sciences located within the College of Agriculture.

===Lewis Honors College===
The Honors Program at the University of Kentucky began in 1958. It offers interdisciplinary, seminar-style classes of 15–20 students each as well as &quot;H-section&quot; classes that accelerate common course offerings such as chemistry, biology, and physics.

In October 2015, the University of Kentucky received the largest single gift in its history, $23.5 million from alumnus, longtime donor and successful entrepreneur Thomas W. Lewis and his wife Jan to create the Lewis Honors College.

The Lewis Honors College was transitioned from the Honors Program at UK in 2015. From 2017, the Honors Program became the Lewis Honors College. On July 10, 2017, Christian Brady was announced as the inaugural dean of the college. Its headquarters are in Lewis Hall, which also serves as one of several residence halls for Honors College students.

==Student life==

===Students===
The University of Kentucky strives for a diverse and international student population, with a selective admissions process.

In fall 2014, there were 30,000 students enrolled for the first time. This is due in part by the high number of out-of-state students. The percentage mix of students at this time were 62% in state and 38% out-of-state. During this time, the freshman class was recorded at 5,000 students.

===Student government===

The University of Kentucky Student Government Association (UKSGA) represents all undergraduate, graduate and professional students enrolled at the university in several critical ways. UKSGA exists to increase student influence over academic policy and to provide many helpful, creative and necessary student services. UKSGA also exists to protect and expand student substantive and procedural rights with the university and surrounding municipalities. Finally, UKSGA exists to better represent the student body in relations with faculty, administration, Board of Trustees and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

UKSGA includes an Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branch.
* Executive Branch: oversees day-to-day operations, manages budget, and facilitates major programs.
* Legislative Branch: includes the Student Senate. There are 46 legislators in this branch. Their goal is to allocate funds, approve presidential appointments, facilitate legislative changes, and represent the larger student voice.
* Judicial: composed of one chief justice and six Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of legislation, handles claims levied against SGA officials, hears any election rules violation complaints and validates election results.

Several of their current programs include:
* Kentucky Wildcab: a late night transportation service designed to enhance the safety efforts of the university and surrounding community in partnership with UK Transportation.
* Wildcat Wardrobe: provides UK students with free professional dress clothing for interviews and jobs
* Safe CATS: provides UK students with a safer way to travel around campus by having SafeCats team members escort students to their destinations on-foot or by golf cart
* Student Legal Services: free on-site consultation for any legal issue by a local attorney
* Childcare Grants: available for part-time and full-time UK students, both at the undergraduate and graduate level, who need financial assistance for day-care service for their children.
* Scholarships
* Student Organization Funding: General Funding Grants, Club Sports Grants, Service Grants, Academic/Professional Conferences, and Senate Special Projects

Several distinguished student body presidents include Governor Steve Beshear.

===Theater===
In the early twentieth century, a group called The Strollers consisted of performers either studying or employed at the university or nearby. They performed regularly at the Lexington Opera House. In 1910, their first production there was the 1839 historical play &quot;Richelieu&quot;. At the end of the spring semester in 1918, as World War I was nearing its end, they performed several skits about war life and then projected large photographic images &quot;showing actual battle scenes&quot; and the humanitarian work of the Red Cross. University girls dressed as nurses served as ushers.

The first theater on UK grounds was the Campus Theater. In 1922, the university bought the Consolidated Baptist Church, a historically black congregation. The church&#x27;s pastor had been Peter Vinegar. A group of performers and their benefactors, led by Carol M. Sax, raised more money to make the church into a theater, calling it Romany. They performed &quot;The Miracle of Sister Beatrice&quot; by Maurice Maeterlinck in 1927. In 1928, it was renamed Guignol Theater, after Théâtre du Grand Guignol in Paris, a theater on the Rue Chaptal from 1897 to 1962, housed in a former chapel and with seats for 293. After leaving Lexington, Sax staged Arthur Wilmurt&#x27;s &quot;The Guest Room&quot; on Broadway in 1931; it ran for a respectable 67 shows. Eleanor Roosevelt attended opening night of his production of I.J. Golden&#x27;s &quot;Re-Echo&quot; in New York in 1934; it ran for only 5 shows.

Frank C. Fowler was the second director of the Kentucky Guignol; he had received his master&#x27;s degree from Brown University in 1928 and was hired by UK that same year. He was followed by Wallace Briggs. The fire that gutted UK&#x27;s Guignol in 1947 is captured on film. In the 1930s and 1940s, one-act plays written by students were performed annually. A new Guignol Theater was opened in the Fine Arts Building in February, 1950 with a production of &quot;Medea&quot;. &quot;Two Blind Mice&quot;, a political satire by Samuel and Bella Spewack, followed after &quot;Medea&quot;.

During the 1950s, plays performed at the Guignol would often go on tour throughout Kentucky in the summer months.

===Student media===

The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department was the home of one of the earliest college amateur radio stations in the United States, beginning with W4JP that began continuous operation prior to World War I. In 1927, the station was relicensed as 9JL (later W9JL).

Students currently run two independent FM stations. The first, 91.3 FM WUKY, is a Triple-A station and was the first university-owned FM radio station in the United States and Kentucky&#x27;s first public radio station. The operations started on October 17, 1940, as WBKY out of Beattyville, although the station moved five years later to Lexington.

In 1971, WBKY was one of the first to carry NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and helped debut National Public Radio, changing its call letters to WUKY in 1989 to better reflect its affiliation with the university. In 2007, it became the first Lexington radio station to broadcast in high-definition digital radio. The second is 88.1 FM WRFL-&quot;Radio Free Lexington&quot; which has been in operation since 1988. WRFL is operated by students and broadcasts live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and features music that is spread across most genres.

The campus is also served by the Kentucky Kernel, a student-run, financially independent daily newspaper, with the first issue published in 1915. The official yearbook of the University of Kentucky is the &quot;Kentuckian&quot;, first published in 1906. The &quot;Kentuckian&quot; was preceded by at least one previous book, the &quot;Echo&quot;.

===Black Student Union===

The University of Kentucky Black Student Union (BSU) was established on February 17, 1968. They were the first organization on campus that was created to support and protect students of color. Their goal was to fight for change on campus for diverse students. They work closely with other organizations on campus such as the Student Activities Board, Student Government Association and various fraternities. Their main mission is to educate the campus community on Black American students and to assist incoming minority students.

Jim Embry, born in Richmond, Kentucky, was the founding member of the organization, as well as, the first elected president. 51 years later, Embry is still fighting for progress in the social injustices and systemic racism on campus.

===Greek life===

Nineteen sororities and twenty-three fraternities representing over 3,000 students. There are also non-Greek organizations on campus, like Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity and Tau Beta Sigma, a band fraternity. In 2007, the UK paper &quot;The Kentucky Kernel&quot; unleashed criticism and gained national attention for an editorial cartoon that depicted an African American pledge being auctioned; it was a comment on racial segregation in UK&#x27;s Greek system. FarmHouse&#x27;s chapter was suspended in 2021 for four years by the university, after a pledge died while attending a party in the fraternity&#x27;s house. In 2023, Phi Tau was suspended for misuse of alcohol and other violations of law.

===Athletics===

University of Kentucky student-athletes compete as the Wildcats under colors Kentucky blue and white.

Beginning in the 1890s, students at the A&amp;M scheduled football games with neighboring colleges. In 1902, the women&#x27;s basketball program began on campus, and the men&#x27;s team was added one year later. The &quot;Wildcats&quot; became associated with the university shortly after a football victory over Illinois on October 9, 1909. The then-chief of the military department, Commandant Carbuiser, stated that the team had &quot;fought like wildcats.&quot; The slogan was later adopted by the university, and a costumed mascot debuted in 1976.

In 1930, then-high school coach Adolph Rupp was hired as a basketball coach and worked in that capacity for 42 years, retiring 1972. During his tenure, he led the men&#x27;s basketball team to four NCAA championships in 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958. The Wildcats later won a fifth championship under Joe B. Hall in 1978, another in 1996 under Rick Pitino and the next under Orlando &quot;Tubby&quot; Smith in 1998. In 2007, the University of Kentucky named Billy Gillispie as the head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team and on March 30, 2009, the university named John Calipari as the head coach of the Wildcats. Calipari coached the team to its eighth national title in 2012.

The university boasts of numerous national championships, with its latest coming in 2012 when the men&#x27;s basketball team won its eighth national title. UK also boasts of a cross country national team championship (women&#x27;s, 1988), eight individual championships in gymnastics, an Olympic medalist in track and field, and 24 national championships in cheerleading. (Not an NCAA recognized championship) After defeating number-one ranked Oklahoma 13–7 in the Sugar Bowl under legendary coach Bear Bryant, Kentucky was also a co-national champion for the 1950 season.

The University of Kentucky Dance team was ranked fifth in the nation in Hip Hop and seventh in Pom in 2015.

Other athletic programs sponsored at the varsity level include baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country running, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s gymnastics, the coeducational sport of rifle, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field and women&#x27;s volleyball. The school also has a popular club-level men&#x27;s ice hockey team and a rugby program that competes at the Division 1 level.

The University of Kentucky football coach is Mark Stoops, named the successor to Joker Phillips, who was the first African American football coach in Kentucky&#x27;s history.

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation and athletic games is the University of Kentucky fight song: &quot;On, On, U of K&quot;. Additionally, the song &quot;Kentucky Fight&quot; is played before games.

In April 2024, a Title IX sexual violence lawsuit was filed against the University of Kentucky which alleged that there was a &quot;toxic, sexually hostile environment&quot; within the university swim program during the time Lars Jorgensen was swim coach between 2013 and 2023. The lawsuit further accused the university of &quot;complicity&quot; with Jorgensen and allowed him &quot;to prey on, sexually harass, and commit horrific sexual assaults and violent rapes against young female coaches and collegiate athletes who were reliant on him.&quot;

===Esports===
University of Kentucky partnered up with South Korean Esport Organization Gen.G Esports and International Studies Abroad (ISA) to launch an international esports exchange programme in Seoul, South Korea.

== Traditions ==
==Campus==

The University of Kentucky offers seven main dining facilities, 23 residence halls, and numerous recreation facilities spread between three distinct campuses: north, south, and central. It is also home to more than 250 student-run organizations.

The university campus is home to numerous notable structures, such as Main Building, a four-story administration building dating to 1882, which was gutted by fire on May 15, 2001. The Patterson Office Tower is the tallest building on campus.

The University of Kentucky once operated 14 community colleges with more than 100 extended sites, centers and campuses under the Kentucky Community and Technical College System, but relinquished control under the Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997. The network of community colleges is now known as the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS). Adjoining Lexington Community College, despite the reorganization of the community colleges, remained integrated with the university, but separated from the University of Kentucky in 2004 and became a part of KCTCS; it is now known as Bluegrass Community and Technical College.

The College of Engineering currently operates a satellite campus in Paducah, located on the campus of West Kentucky Community and Technical College.

<text>In physics, Babinet&#x27;s principle states that the diffraction pattern from an opaque body is identical to that from a hole of the same size and shape except for the overall forward beam intensity. It was formulated in the 1800s by French physicist Jacques Babinet.

A quantum version of Babinet&#x27;s principle has been derived in the context of quantum networks.

==Explanation==
Assume B is the original diffracting body, and B&#x27; is its complement, i.e., a body that is transparent. The sum of the radiation patterns caused by B and B&#x27; must be the same as the radiation pattern of the unobstructed beam. In places where the undisturbed beam would not have reached, this means that the radiation patterns caused by B and B&#x27; must be opposite in phase, but equal in amplitude.

Diffraction patterns from apertures or bodies of known size and shape are compared with the pattern from the object to be measured. For instance, the size of red blood cells can be found by comparing their diffraction pattern with an array of small holes. One consequence of Babinet&#x27;s principle is the extinction paradox, which states that in the diffraction limit, the radiation removed from the beam due to a particle is equal to twice the particle&#x27;s cross section times the flux. This is because the amount of radiation absorbed or reflected is equal to the flux through the particle&#x27;s cross-section, but by Babinet&#x27;s principle the light diffracted forward is the same as the light that would pass through a hole in the shape of a particle; so amount of the light diffracted forward also equals the flux through the particle&#x27;s cross section.

The principle is most often used in optics but it is also true for other forms of electromagnetic radiation and is, in fact, a general theorem of diffraction in wave mechanics. Babinet&#x27;s principle finds most use in its ability to detect &quot;equivalence&quot; in size and shape.

==Demonstration experiment==
The effect can be simply observed by using a laser. First place a thin (approx. 0.1 mm) wire into the laser beam and observe the diffraction pattern. Then observe the diffraction pattern when the laser is shone through a narrow slit. The slit can be made either by using a laser printer or photocopier to print onto clear plastic film or by using a pin to draw a line on a piece of glass that has been smoked over a candle flame.

==Babinet&#x27;s principle in radiofrequency structures==
Babinet&#x27;s principle can be used in antenna engineering to find complementary impedances. A consequence of the principle states that

: formula_1

where &quot;Z&quot;metal and &quot;Z&quot;slot are input impedances of the metal and slot radiating pieces, and formula_2 is the intrinsic impedance of the medium in which the structure is immersed. Note that (i) formula_3 can be an effective or equivalent (but always homogeneous) medium, in case the structure lies on the interface of two different dielectrics, and (ii) the above formula strictly applies to structures with rotational symmetry, e.g., square or circular shapes; in the more general case, &quot;Z&quot;metal and &quot;Z&quot;slot refer to complementary and formula_4-rotated variants.

In addition, &quot;Z&quot;slot is not only the impedance of the slot, but can be viewed as the complementary structure impedance (a dipole or loop in many cases). &quot;Z&quot;metal is often referred to as &quot;Z&quot;screen, where the screen comes from the optical definition. The thin sheet or screen does not have to be metal, but rather any material that supports a formula_5 (current density vector) leading to a magnetic potential formula_6. One issue with this equation is that the screen must be relatively thin to the given wavelength (or range thereof). If it is not, modes can begin to form, or fringing fields may no longer be negligible.

Note that Babinet&#x27;s principle does not account for polarization. In 1946, H. G. Booker published &quot;Slot Aerials and Their Relation to Complementary Wire Aerials&quot; to extend Babinet&#x27;s principle to account for polarization (otherwise known as Booker&#x27;s extension). This information is drawn from, as stated above, Balanis&#x27;s third edition &quot;Antenna Theory&quot; textbook.

<doc id="284371" wikidata="Q7300340" url="?curid=284371" title="Read-copy-update">
<text>In computer science, read-copy-update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism that avoids the use of lock primitives while multiple threads concurrently read and update elements that are linked through pointers and that belong to shared data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, hash tables).

Whenever a thread is inserting or deleting elements of data structures in shared memory, all readers are guaranteed to see and traverse either the older or the new structure, therefore avoiding inconsistencies (e.g., dereferencing null pointers).

It is used when performance of reads is crucial and is an example of space–time tradeoff, enabling fast operations at the cost of more space. This makes all readers proceed as if there were no synchronization involved, hence they will be fast, but also making updates more difficult.

==Name and overview==
The name comes from the way that RCU is used to update a linked structure in place. A thread wishing to do this uses the following steps:
* create a new structure,
* copy the data from the old structure into the new one, and save a pointer to the old structure,
* modify the new, copied, structure,
* update the global pointer to refer to the new structure,
* sleep until the operating system kernel determines that there are no readers left using the old structure, for example, in the Linux kernel, by using ,
* once awakened by the kernel, deallocate the old structure.

So the structure is &quot;read&quot; concurrently with a thread &quot;copying&quot; in order to do an &quot;update&quot;, hence the name &quot;read-copy update&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;RCU&quot; was one of many contributions by the Linux community. Other names for similar techniques include &quot;passive serialization&quot; and &quot;MP defer&quot; by VM/XA programmers and &quot;generations&quot; by K42 and Tornado programmers.

==Detailed description==
A key property of RCU is that readers can access a data structure even when it is in the process of being updated: RCU updaters cannot block readers or force them to retry their accesses. This overview starts by showing how data can be safely inserted into and deleted from linked structures despite concurrent readers. The first diagram on the right depicts a four-state insertion procedure, with time advancing from left to right.

The first state shows a global pointer named that is initially , colored red to indicate that it might be accessed by a reader at any time, thus requiring updaters to take care. Allocating memory for a new structure transitions to the second state. This structure has indeterminate state (indicated by the question marks) but is inaccessible to readers (indicated by the green color). Because the structure is inaccessible to readers, the updater may carry out any desired operation without fear of disrupting concurrent readers. Initializing this new structure transitions to the third state, which shows the initialized values of the structure&#x27;s fields. Assigning a reference to this new structure to transitions to the fourth and final state. In this state, the structure is accessible to readers, and is therefore colored red. The primitive is used to carry out this assignment and ensures that the assignment is atomic in the sense that concurrent readers will either see a pointer or a valid pointer to the new structure, but not some mash-up of the two values. Additional properties of are described later in this article.

This procedure demonstrates how new data may be inserted into a linked data structure even though readers are concurrently traversing the data structure before, during, and after the insertion. The second diagram on the right depicts a four-state deletion procedure, again with time advancing from left to right.

The first state shows a linked list containing elements , , and . All three elements are colored red to indicate that an RCU reader might reference any of them at any time. Using to remove element from this list transitions to the second state. Note that the link from element B to C is left intact in order to allow readers currently referencing element to traverse the remainder of the list. Readers accessing the link from element will either obtain a reference to element or element , but either way, each reader will see a valid and correctly formatted linked list. Element is now colored yellow to indicate that while pre-existing readers might still have a reference to element , new readers have no way to obtain a reference. A wait-for-readers operation transitions to the third state. Note that this wait-for-readers operation need only wait for pre-existing readers, but not new readers. Element is now colored green to indicate that readers can no longer be referencing it. Therefore, it is now safe for the updater to free element , thus transitioning to the fourth and final state.

It is important to reiterate that in the second state different readers can see two different versions of the list, either with or without element . In other words, RCU provides coordination in space (different versions of the list) as well as in time (different states in the deletion procedures). This is in stark contrast with more traditional synchronization primitives such as locking or transactions that coordinate in time, but not in space.

This procedure demonstrates how old data may be removed from a linked data structure even though readers are concurrently traversing the data structure before, during, and after the deletion. Given insertion and deletion, a wide variety of data structures can be implemented using RCU.

RCU&#x27;s readers execute within &quot;read-side critical sections&quot;, which are normally delimited by and . Any statement that is not within an RCU read-side critical section is said to be in a &quot;quiescent state&quot;, and such statements are not permitted to hold references to RCU-protected data structures, nor is the wait-for-readers operation required to wait for threads in quiescent states. Any time period during which each thread resides at least once in a quiescent state is called a &quot;grace period&quot;. By definition, any RCU read-side critical section in existence at the beginning of a given grace period must complete before the end of that grace period, which constitutes the fundamental guarantee provided by RCU. In addition, the wait-for-readers operation must wait for at least one grace period to elapse. It turns out that this guarantee can be provided with extremely small read-side overheads, in fact, in the limiting case that is actually realized by server-class Linux-kernel builds, the read-side overhead is exactly zero.

RCU&#x27;s fundamental guarantee may be used by splitting updates into &quot;removal&quot; and &quot;reclamation&quot; phases. The removal phase removes references to data items within a data structure (possibly by replacing them with references to new versions of these data items) and can run concurrently with RCU read-side critical sections. The reason that it is safe to run the removal phase concurrently with RCU readers is the semantics of modern CPUs guarantee that readers will see either the old or the new version of the data structure rather than a partially updated reference. Once a grace period has elapsed, there can no longer be any readers referencing the old version, so it is then safe for the reclamation phase to free (&quot;reclaim&quot;) the data items that made up that old version.

Splitting an update into removal and reclamation phases allows the updater to perform the removal phase immediately, and to defer the reclamation phase until all readers active during the removal phase have completed, in other words, until a grace period has elapsed.

So, the typical RCU update sequence goes something like the following:

# Ensure that all readers accessing RCU-protected data structures carry out their references from within an RCU read-side critical section.
# Remove pointers to a data structure, so that subsequent readers cannot gain a reference to it.
# Wait for a grace period to elapse, so that all previous readers (which might still have pointers to the data structure removed in the prior step) will have completed their RCU read-side critical sections.
# At this point, there cannot be any readers still holding references to the data structure, so it now may safely be reclaimed (e.g., freed).

In the above procedure (which matches the earlier diagram), the updater is performing both the removal and the reclamation step, but it is often helpful for an entirely different thread to do the reclamation. Reference counting can be used to let the reader perform removal so, even if the same thread performs both the update step (step (2) above) and the reclamation step (step (4) above), it is often helpful to think of them separately.

RCU is perhaps the most common non-blocking algorithm for a shared data structure. RCU is completely wait-free for any number of readers. Single-writer implementations RCU are also lock-free for the writer. Some multi-writer implementations of RCU are lock-free. Other multi-writer implementations of RCU serialize writers with a lock.

==Uses==
By early 2008, there were almost 2,000 uses of the RCU API within the Linux kernel including the networking protocol stacks and the memory-management system. , there were more than 9,000 uses. Since 2006, researchers have applied RCU and similar techniques to a number of problems, including management of metadata used in dynamic analysis, managing the lifetime of clustered objects, managing object lifetime in the K42 research operating system, and optimizing software transactional memory implementations. Dragonfly BSD uses a technique similar to RCU that most closely resembles Linux&#x27;s Sleepable RCU (SRCU) implementation.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The ability to wait until all readers are done allows RCU readers to use much lighter-weight synchronization—in some cases, absolutely no synchronization at all. In contrast, in more conventional lock-based schemes, readers must use heavy-weight synchronization in order to prevent an updater from deleting the data structure out from under them. The reason is that lock-based updaters typically update data in place and must therefore exclude readers. In contrast, RCU-based updaters typically take advantage of the fact that writes to single aligned pointers are atomic on modern CPUs, allowing atomic insertion, removal, and replacement of data in a linked structure without disrupting readers. Concurrent RCU readers can then continue accessing the old versions and can dispense with the atomic read-modify-write instructions, memory barriers, and cache misses that are so expensive on modern SMP computer systems, even in absence of lock contention. The lightweight nature of RCU&#x27;s read-side primitives provides additional advantages beyond excellent performance, scalability, and real-time response. For example, they provide immunity to most deadlock and livelock conditions.

Of course, RCU also has disadvantages. For example, RCU is a specialized technique that works best in situations with mostly reads and few updates but is often less applicable to update-only workloads. For another example, although the fact that RCU readers and updaters may execute concurrently is what enables the lightweight nature of RCU&#x27;s read-side primitives, some algorithms may not be amenable to read/update concurrency.

Despite well over a decade of experience with RCU, the exact extent of its applicability is still a research topic.

==Patents==
The technique is covered by U.S. software patent , issued August 15, 1995, and assigned to Sequent Computer Systems, as well as by (expired 2009-03-30), (expired 2010-04-05), (expired 2009-05-18), and (expired 2009-05-25). The now-expired US Patent covers a closely related technique. RCU is also the topic of one claim in the SCO v. IBM lawsuit.

==Sample RCU interface==
RCU is available in a number of operating systems and was added to the Linux kernel in October 2002. User-level implementations such as liburcu are also available.

The implementation of RCU in version 2.6 of the Linux kernel is among the better-known RCU implementations and will be used as an inspiration for the RCU API in the remainder of this article. The core API (Application Programming Interface) is quite small:

* rcu_read_lock(): Marks an RCU-protected data structure so that it won&#x27;t be reclaimed for the full duration of that critical section.
* rcu_read_unlock(): Used by a reader to inform the reclaimer that the reader is exiting an RCU read-side critical section. Note that RCU read-side critical sections may be nested and/or overlapping.
* synchronize_rcu(): Blocks until all pre-existing RCU read-side critical sections on all CPUs have completed. Note that codice_1 will &quot;not&quot; necessarily wait for any subsequent RCU read-side critical sections to complete. For example, consider the following sequence of events:
:Since codice_1 is the API that must figure out when readers are done, its implementation is key to RCU. For RCU to be useful in all but the most read-intensive situations, codice_1&#x27;s overhead must also be quite small.

:Alternatively, instead of blocking, synchronize_rcu may register a callback to be invoked after all ongoing RCU read-side critical sections have completed. This callback variant is called codice_4 in the Linux kernel.

* rcu_assign_pointer(): The updater uses this function to assign a new value to an RCU-protected pointer, in order to safely communicate the change in value from the updater to the reader. This function returns the new value, and also executes any memory barrier instructions required for a given CPU architecture. Perhaps more importantly, it serves to document which pointers are protected by RCU.
* rcu_dereference(): The reader uses codice_5 to fetch an RCU-protected pointer, which returns a value that may then be safely dereferenced. It also executes any directives required by the compiler or the CPU, for example, a volatile cast for gcc, a memory_order_consume load for C/C++11 or the memory-barrier instruction required by the old DEC Alpha CPU. The value returned by codice_5 is valid only within the enclosing RCU read-side critical section. As with codice_7, an important function of codice_5 is to document which pointers are protected by RCU.

The diagram on the right shows how each API communicates among the reader, updater, and reclaimer.

The RCU infrastructure observes the time sequence of codice_9, codice_10, codice_1, and codice_4 invocations in order to determine when (1) codice_1 invocations may return to their callers and (2) codice_4 callbacks may be invoked. Efficient implementations of the RCU infrastructure make heavy use of batching in order to amortize their overhead over many uses of the corresponding APIs.

==Simple implementation==
RCU has extremely simple &quot;toy&quot; implementations that can aid understanding of RCU. This section presents one such &quot;toy&quot; implementation that works in a non-preemptive environment.
void rcu_read_lock(void) { }

void rcu_read_unlock(void) { }

void call_rcu(void (*callback) (void *), void *arg)
 // add callback/arg pair to a list

void synchronize_rcu(void)
 int cpu, ncpus = 0;

 for each_cpu(cpu)
 schedule_current_task_to(cpu);

 for each entry in the call_rcu list
 entry-&gt;callback (entry-&gt;arg);


In the code sample, codice_7 and codice_5 can be ignored without missing much. However, they are needed in order to suppress harmful compiler optimization and to prevent CPUs from reordering accesses.
#define rcu_assign_pointer(p, v) ({ \
 smp_wmb(); /* Order previous writes. */ \
 ACCESS_ONCE(p) = (v); \

#define rcu_dereference(p) ({ \
 typeof(p) _value = ACCESS_ONCE(p); \
 smp_read_barrier_depends(); /* nop on most architectures */ \
 (_value); \


Note that codice_9 and codice_10 do nothing. This is the great strength of classic RCU in a non-preemptive kernel: read-side overhead is precisely zero, as codice_19 is an empty macro on all but DEC Alpha CPUs; such memory barriers are not needed on modern CPUs. The codice_20 macro is a volatile cast that generates no additional code in most cases. And there is no way that codice_9 can participate in a deadlock cycle, cause a realtime process to miss its scheduling deadline, precipitate priority inversion, or result in high lock contention. However, in this toy RCU implementation, blocking within an RCU read-side critical section is illegal, just as is blocking while holding a pure spinlock.

The implementation of codice_1 moves the caller of synchronize_cpu to each CPU, thus blocking until all CPUs have been able to perform the context switch. Recall that this is a non-preemptive environment and that blocking within an RCU read-side critical section is illegal, which imply that there can be no preemption points within an RCU read-side critical section. Therefore, if a given CPU executes a context switch (to schedule another process), we know that this CPU must have completed all preceding RCU read-side critical sections. Once all CPUs have executed a context switch, then all preceding RCU read-side critical sections will have completed.

==Analogy with reader–writer locking==
Although RCU can be used in many different ways, a very common use of RCU is analogous to reader–writer locking. The following side-by-side code display shows how closely related reader–writer locking and RCU can be.

 /* reader-writer locking */ /* RCU */

 1 struct el { 1 struct el {
 2 struct list_head lp; 2 struct list_head lp;
 3 long key; 3 long key;
 4 spinlock_t mutex; 4 spinlock_t mutex;
 5 int data; 5 int data;
 6 /* Other data fields */ 6 /* Other data fields */
 7 }; 7 };
 8 DEFINE_RWLOCK(listmutex); 8 DEFINE_SPINLOCK(listmutex);
 9 LIST_HEAD(head); 9 LIST_HEAD(head);

 1 int search(long key, int *result) 1 int search(long key, int *result)
 2 { 2 {
 3 struct el *p; 3 struct el *p;
 4 4
 5 read_lock(&amp;listmutex); 5 rcu_read_lock();
 6 list_for_each_entry(p, &amp;head, lp) { 6 list_for_each_entry_rcu(p, &amp;head, lp) {
 7 if (p-&gt;key == key) { 7 if (p-&gt;key == key) {
 8 *result = p-&gt;data; 8 *result = p-&gt;data;
 9 read_unlock(&amp;listmutex); 9 rcu_read_unlock();
10 return 1; 10 return 1;
11 } 11 }
12 } 12 }
13 read_unlock(&amp;listmutex); 13 rcu_read_unlock();
14 return 0; 14 return 0;
15 } 15 }

 1 int delete(long key) 1 int delete(long key)
 2 { 2 {
 3 struct el *p; 3 struct el *p;
 4 4
 5 write_lock(&amp;listmutex); 5 spin_lock(&amp;listmutex);
 6 list_for_each_entry(p, &amp;head, lp) { 6 list_for_each_entry(p, &amp;head, lp) {
 7 if (p-&gt;key == key) { 7 if (p-&gt;key == key) {
 8 list_del(&amp;p-&gt;lp); 8 list_del_rcu(&amp;p-&gt;lp);
 9 write_unlock(&amp;listmutex); 9 spin_unlock(&amp;listmutex);
 10 synchronize_rcu();
10 kfree(p); 11 kfree(p);
11 return 1; 12 return 1;
12 } 13 }
13 } 14 }
14 write_unlock(&amp;listmutex); 15 spin_unlock(&amp;listmutex);
15 return 0; 16 return 0;
16 } 17 }

The differences between the two approaches are quite small. Read-side locking moves to codice_9 and codice_10, update-side locking moves from a reader-writer lock to a simple spinlock, and a codice_1 precedes the codice_26.

However, there is one potential catch: the read-side and update-side critical sections can now run concurrently. In many cases, this will not be a problem, but it is necessary to check carefully regardless. For example, if multiple independent list updates must be seen as a single atomic update, converting to RCU will require special care.

Also, the presence of codice_1 means that the RCU version of codice_28 can now block. If this is a problem, codice_4 could be used like codice_30 in place of codice_1. This is especially useful in combination with reference counting.

==History==
Techniques and mechanisms resembling RCU have been independently invented multiple times:
# H. T. Kung and Q. Lehman described use of garbage collectors to implement RCU-like access to a binary search tree.
# Udi Manber and Richard Ladner extended Kung&#x27;s and Lehman&#x27;s work to non-garbage-collected environments by deferring reclamation until all threads running at removal time have terminated, which works in environments that do not have long-lived threads.
# Richard Rashid et al. described a lazy translation lookaside buffer (TLB) implementation that deferred reclaiming virtual-address space until all CPUs flushed their TLB, which is similar in spirit to some RCU implementations.
# James P. Hennessy, Damian L. Osisek, and Joseph W. Seigh, II were granted US Patent 4,809,168 in 1989 (since lapsed). This patent describes an RCU-like mechanism that was apparently used in VM/XA on IBM mainframes.
# William Pugh described an RCU-like mechanism that relied on explicit flag-setting by readers.
# Aju John proposed an RCU-like implementation where updaters simply wait for a fixed period of time, under the assumption that readers would all complete within that fixed time, as might be appropriate in a hard real-time system. Van Jacobson proposed a similar scheme in 1993 (verbal communication).
# J. Slingwine and P. E. McKenney received US Patent 5,442,758 in August 1995, which describes RCU as implemented in DYNIX/ptx and later in the Linux kernel.
# B. Gamsa, O. Krieger, J. Appavoo, and M. Stumm described an RCU-like mechanism used in the University of Toronto Tornado research operating system and the closely related IBM Research K42 research operating systems.
# Rusty Russell and Phil Rumpf described RCU-like techniques for handling unloading of Linux kernel modules.
# D. Sarma added RCU to version 2.5.43 of the Linux kernel in October 2002.
# Robert Colvin et al. formally verified a lazy concurrent list-based set algorithm that resembles RCU.
# M. Desnoyers et al. published a description of user-space RCU.
# A. Gotsman et al. derived formal semantics for RCU based on separation logic.
# Ilan Frenkel, Roman Geller, Yoram Ramberg, and Yoram Snir were granted US Patent 7,099,932 in 2006. This patent describes an RCU-like mechanism for retrieving and storing quality of service policy management information using a directory service in a manner that enforces read/write consistency and enables read/write concurrency.

<doc id="284376" wikidata="Q467711" url="?curid=284376" title="SWAPO">
<text>The South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO ; , SWAVO; , SWAVO), officially known as the SWAPO Party of Namibia, is a political party and former independence movement in Namibia (formerly South West Africa). Founded in 1960, it has been the governing party in Namibia since the country achieved independence in 1990. The party continues to be dominated in number and influence by the Ovambo ethnic group.

SWAPO held a two-thirds majority in parliament from 1994 to 2019. In the general election held in November 2019, the party won 65.5% of the popular vote and 63 out of the 104 seats in the National Assembly. It also holds 28 out of the 42 seats in the National Council. From November 2017 until his death in February 2024, Namibian President Hage Geingob remained the president of SWAPO after being elected to the position at the party&#x27;s electoral congress.

== History ==
=== Background and foundation ===
German South West Africa was established in 1884. After World War I, the League of Nations gave South West Africa, formerly a German colony, to the United Kingdom as a mandate under the administration of South Africa. When the National Party won the 1948 election in South Africa and subsequently introduced apartheid legislation, these laws were also applied to South West Africa which was considered the &quot;de facto&quot; fifth province of South Africa.

SWAPO was founded on 19 April 1960 as the successor of the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Organization. Leaders renamed the party to show that it represented all Namibians. But, the organisation had its base among the Ovambo people of northern Namibia, who constituted nearly half the total population.

=== Struggle for independence ===

During 1962, SWAPO had emerged as the dominant nationalist organisation for the Namibian people. It co-opted other groups such as the South West Africa National Union (SWANU), and later in 1976 the Namibia African People&#x27;s Democratic Organisation. SWAPO used guerrilla tactics to fight the South African Defence Force. On 26 August 1966, the first major clash of the conflict took place, when a unit of the South African Police, supported by the South African Air Force, exchanged fire with SWAPO forces. This date is generally regarded as the start of what became known in South Africa as the Border War.

One important factor in the fight for independence was the 1971-72 Namibian contract workers strike, which fought for the elimination of the contract labor system and independence from South Africa. An underlying goal was the promotion of independence under SWAPO leadership.

In 1973, the United Nations General Assembly recognised SWAPO as the &#x27;sole legitimate representative&#x27; of Namibia&#x27;s people. The Norwegian government began giving aid directly to SWAPO in 1974.

The country of Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975 following its war for independence. The leftist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union, came to power. In March 1976, the MPLA offered SWAPO bases in Angola for launching attacks against the South African military.

===Independent Namibia===
When Namibia gained its independence in 1990, SWAPO became the dominant political party. Though the organisation rejected the term &quot;South West Africa&quot; and preferred to use &quot;Namibia&quot;, the organisation&#x27;s original name—derived from the territory&#x27;s old name—was too deeply rooted in the independence movement to be changed. However, the original full name is no longer used; only the acronym remains. SWAPO, and with it much of Namibia&#x27;s government and administration, continues to be dominated by the Ovambo ethnic group, despite &quot;considerable efforts to counter [that] perception&quot;.

SWAPO president Sam Nujoma was declared Namibia&#x27;s first President after SWAPO won the inaugural election in 1989. A decade later, Nujoma had the constitution changed so he could run for a third term in 1999, as it limits the presidency to two terms.

In 2004, the SWAPO presidential candidate was Hifikepunye Pohamba, described as Nujoma&#x27;s hand-picked successor. In 2014, the SWAPO presidential candidate was Hage Geingob, who was the vice-president of SWAPO. In 2019 presidential election, president Geingob won his second five-year term as Namibian president.

==Ideology==
SWAPO was founded with the aim of attaining the independence of Namibia and therefore is part of the African nationalist movement. Pre-independence it had a socialist, Marxist–Leninist ideology, a thinking that was not immediately abandoned when independence was achieved in 1990 and SWAPO became the ruling party. Officially, however, it adopted a social democratic ideology, until the electoral congress in 2017 approved the official change to socialism with a &quot;Namibian character&quot;, although some Namibians have labeled the change as lacking a &quot;grass-roots&quot; nature.

Various commentators have characterised the politics of SWAPO in different ways. Gerhard Tötemeyer, himself a party member, considers its post-independence politics neoliberal and social democratic. Henny Seibeb, an opposition politician from the Landless People&#x27;s Movement, describes the current party ideology as liberal nationalism with traces of &quot;dogmatism, authoritarianism, and statism&quot;.

== Structure ==
The party president is the top position of SWAPO; in 2012 this was held by Namibia&#x27;s former president Pohamba. The vice-president was Namibia&#x27;s former president Hage Geingob, who was elected to that position in 2007 and reconfirmed at the SWAPO congress in December 2012, until his death on 4 February 2024. The third highest position in SWAPO is the secretary-general, a position held in December 2012 by Nangolo Mbumba. Number four is the deputy secretary-general, Omaheke governor Laura McLeod-Katjirua.

Like many socialist and communist parties, SWAPO is governed by a politburo and a central committee. The party leadership is advised by a youth league, a women&#x27;s council, and an elders&#x27; council.

=== Politburo ===
The politburo of SWAPO is a body that consists of 29 members for the period 2022-2027 (including party president, former party president, secretary general, deputy secretary general, members appointed by the party president and members elected by the SWAPO central committee for the period).

== Finances and business interests ==
Although SWAPO receives finances from government for its operations, the party also holds extensive business interests. Through Kalahari Holdings, it entered into joint ventures with several companies, most prominently the Namibian branch of MultiChoice, a private satellite TV provider, of which it owns 51%. Kalahari Holdings has further joint ventures with Radio Energy, Africa Online, and businesses in the tourism, farming, security services and health insurance sectors. It owns Namib Contract Haulage, Namprint, Kudu Investments and the Ndilimani Cultural Troupe.

&quot;Namibia Today&quot; was the mouthpiece of the SWAPO, and Asser Ntinda was its editor. The paper does not appear to have been active since 7 April 2011 and closed down in 2015.

== Human rights abuses ==
Various groups have claimed that SWAPO committed serious human rights abuses against suspected spies during the independence struggle. Since the early 21st century, they have pressed the government more strongly on this issue. Breaking the Wall of Silence (BWS) is one of the groups founded by people who were detained by SWAPO during the war and abused during interrogations. In 2004, BWS alleged that &quot;In exile, hundreds of SWAPO dependants and members were detained, tortured and killed without trial.&quot; SWAPO denies serious infractions and claims anything that did happen was in the name of liberation. Because of a series of successful South African raids, the SWAPO leadership believed that spies existed in the movement. Hundreds of SWAPO cadres were imprisoned, tortured and interrogated.

== Memberships ==
SWAPO is a full member of Socialist International. It was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement before the independence of Namibia in 1990.

<text>The Slovak people are an ethnic group predominantly residing in the modern-day nation of Slovakia and its surrounding areas. Slovaks have played an active role in European history, including politically, militarily, scientifically, culturally, and religiously. Ethnic Slovaks have inhabited Central Europe since the Middle Ages. Slovaks were minority citizens of Hungary, and subsequently Austria-Hungary, from the 7th Century until the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 by the Treaty of Versailles. After Slovak calls for greater autonomy dissolved the Czechoslovak parliament, the Slovak Republic was formed in 1993. The major language among Slovaks is Slovak.

The page lists people who are citizens of Slovakia, Czechoslovakia, or are of Slovak identity, ancestry or ethnicity.

<doc id="284379" wikidata="Q504715" url="?curid=284379" title="Cirque du Soleil">
<text>Cirque du Soleil (, ; ) is a Canadian entertainment company and the largest contemporary circus producer in the world. Located in the inner-city area of Saint-Michel, Montreal, it was founded in Baie-Saint-Paul on 16 June 1984 by former street performers Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix.

Originating as a performing troupe called &quot;Les Échassiers&quot; (; &quot;The Stilt Walkers&quot;), they toured Quebec in various forms between 1979 and 1983. Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to perform as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier&#x27;s voyage to Canada. Their first official production &quot;Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil&quot; was a success in 1984, and after securing a second year of funding, Laliberté hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a &quot;proper circus&quot;. Its theatrical, character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus (&quot;nouveau cirque&quot;) that it remains today.

After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot; was created—with the direction of Franco Dragone—which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows. It expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s, growing from one production to dozens of shows in over 300 cities on six continents. The company employed 4,900 people from 50 countries and generated an annual revenue of approximately US$1 billion in 2017. The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9,000 people a night, 5% of the city&#x27;s visitors, adding to the over 100 million people who have seen Cirque du Soleil productions worldwide.

In 2000, Laliberté bought out Daniel Gauthier&#x27;s stake in the company, and with 95% ownership continued to expand the brand. In 2008, Laliberté sold 20% of his share to the investment groups Istithmar World and Nakheel of Dubai, but later bought back their stake following the 2008 global financial crisis. In 2015, TPG Capital, Fosun Industrial Holdings, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec purchased 90% of Cirque du Soleil while Laliberté retained a 10% stake in the company. In February 2020, Laliberté sold his remaining 10% stake in the company to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for $75 million. Following a bankruptcy brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company was sold to a group of its creditors led by Catalyst Capital Group in November 2020.

The company&#x27;s creations have received numerous prizes and distinctions, including three Drama Desk Awards; seven Primetime Emmy Awards; multiple Gemini Awards; a Daytime Emmy Award; a Juno Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2000, Cirque du Soleil was awarded the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards, and in 2002 was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

== History ==
=== 1979–1983: Origins ===
In 1979, after having quit college and learned the art of fire breathing, Guy Laliberté organized a summer fair in Baie-Saint-Paul with the help of Daniel Gauthier and Gilles Ste-Croix. As part of a publicity stunt to convince the Quebec government to help fund this production, Ste-Croix walked the from Baie-Saint-Paul to Quebec City on stilts. This gave them funding for the stilt-walking troupe &quot;Les Échassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul&quot;, which then toured Quebec the following year in 1980.

Although well received by audiences and critics alike, &quot;Les Échassiers&quot; was a financial failure. Laliberté spent the following winter in Hawaii while Ste-Croix stayed in Quebec to set up a nonprofit holding company named &quot;The High-Heeled Club&quot; (&quot;Club des Talons Hauts&quot;) to mitigate the losses of the previous summer. This allowed &quot;Les Échassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul&quot; to break even by fall 1981. The following summer, Laliberté and Ste-Croix founded &quot;La Fête Foraine&quot;, a street performance festival that featured circus performances and workshops to teach the circus arts to the public. Laliberté managed and produced the fair for 2 more years, becoming a moderate financial success.

In 1983, the government of Quebec gave him a $1.6 million grant to host a production the following year as part of Quebec&#x27;s 450th anniversary celebration of the French explorer Jacques Cartier&#x27;s arrival in Turtle Island (North America). This became Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s first production &quot;Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil&quot;.

=== 1984–1989: Foundation and early productions ===
The company&#x27;s first production &quot;Le Grand Tour&quot; performed in Quebec for 13 weeks in summer 1984. Although several issues persisted during the first tour (including a collapsed tent and conflict between artists), it was a financial success. After securing funding from the Canadian government for a second year from the help of Quebec premier René Lévesque, Laliberté hired Guy Caron, head of the National Circus School, as Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s artistic director. Laliberté and Caron reworked the company&#x27;s performance style to emulate that of Moscow Circus by having the acts tell a story. Further influences from the Circus of China, Cirque Arlette Gruss, and Circus Roncalli led Cirque du Soleil to approach their shows in a more theatrical fashion with live music and no technical crew on stage. To assist in this shift towards a theatrical production, Laliberté and Caron hired Belgian director Franco Dragone to direct segments of their 1985 production, &quot;Cirque du Soleil&quot;.

The company&#x27;s first non-Quebec performances in Ontario in 1985 were unsuccessful, leading to a $750,000 deficit. To enable a 1986 tour, the Desjardins Group covered $200,000 of bad checks, financier Daniel Lamarre represented the company for free, and the Quebec government allotted it an additional year of funding. &quot;La Magie Continue&quot;, their 1986 production, proved more artistically successful with the direction of Franco Dragone. This extended to the creation of their 1987 show &quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot;.

In the summer of 1987, Cirque du Soleil was invited to present &quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot; at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Despite only having enough money to make a one-way trip, the company agreed to open for the festival in September of that year. &quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot;&#x27;s first American performances were an instant critical and financial hit, allowing them make a profit of over $1.5 million by the end of 1987. The show continued to tour Canada and the United States throughout 1988 and 1989, during which time plans for a second touring show named &quot;Éclipse&quot; started being developed. Due to artistic differences with these plans, Guy Caron, along with a number of artists, left the company causing the plans to be shelved. Gilles Ste-Croix, who had been away from the company since 1985, subsequently replaced Caron as artistic director.

=== 1990–1999: Expansion ===
By the end of 1989, the company once again faced deficit due to internal conflicts amongst the company&#x27;s leaders as well as from lukewarm reception to their revamped tour of &quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot; in the United States. In response to this, Cirque du Soleil took their plans for their previously shelved show &quot;Éclipse&quot; and developed it into &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;. Franco Dragone returned as director in addition to a creative team made up of Dominique Lemieux, Michel Crête, René Dupéré, Luc Lafortune, and Debra Brown. &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot; premiered on 8 May 1990 in Montreal to critical acclaim, touring North America through the end of 1991 and later residing in Las Vegas in 1992 and 1993. Their following touring shows — &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;, &quot;Alegría&quot;, &quot;Quidam&quot;, and &quot;Dralion&quot; — proved to be equally successful.

The success of &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;&#x27;s contract in Las Vegas led to a deal between Cirque du Soleil and the Mirage Casino-Hotel to create a permanent show, &quot;Mystère&quot;, residing in Treasure Island Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. It premiered in December 1993. Its success as the company&#x27;s first permanent production would later allow for the creation of two more permanent shows in 1998: &quot;O&quot; in Las Vegas and &quot;La Nouba&quot; at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. During this time of expansion the company also founded their International Headquarters in Montreal&#x27;s Saint-Michel neighbourhood and their multimedia division, Cirque du Soleil Images. In 1999 they premiered their film &quot;Alegría&quot;, also directed by Dragone.

Following the premiere of &quot;La Nouba&quot; in 1998, the creative team that had developed all of the company&#x27;s shows from 1990 to 1998 left. Starting with the creation of &quot;Dralion&quot; in 1999, Cirque du Soleil began producing shows with entirely new creative teams.

==== First international ventures ====
&quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot; marked the company&#x27;s first performances outside of North America when it performed in London and Paris in 1990. The show received a mixed reception and was not followed by another production until &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;&#x27;s 1995 European tour, which better solidified Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s presence in the European market.

Cirque du Soleil also toured Japan in the summer of 1992 at the behest of the Fuji Television Network. Combining acts from their previous shows &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot; and &quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot;, they created their first arena show &quot;Fascination&quot; which toured Japan from May to August of that year. &quot;Fascination&quot;&#x27;s positive reception allowed Cirque du Soleil to play &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; there in 1994, thereby establishing the company&#x27;s market in the Asia and Pacific region for their subsequent tours in the late 1990s and 2000s.

=== 2000–2009: Rapid growth ===
In 2000, the company produced their IMAX film &quot;Journey of Man&quot;. Shortly afterwards, at the beginning of 2001, Daniel Gauthier left the company and was bought out by Guy Laliberté, bringing his ownership stake in the company to 95%. Gilles Ste-Croix also soon left to found the horse-based touring show &quot;Cheval&quot;, leading Laliberté to hire Lyn Heward and Daniel Lamarre as Presidents and C.O.O.&#x27;s of the company&#x27;s Creative Content and New Ventures divisions, respectively.

In 2002, the company created the touring show &quot;Varekai&quot; and in 2003 premiered the resident show &quot;Zumanity&quot; in Las Vegas, their first &quot;X-rated&quot; show performed only for adults aged 18 years and older. The company also produced their first television shows that year: the documentary reality miniseries &quot;Fire Within&quot; and the variety series &quot;Solstrom&quot;. In 2004, Cirque du Soleil premiered the resident show &quot;Kà&quot; at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, directed by Robert Lepage. In September of that year, the company launched their record label, Cirque du Soleil Musique, after their agreement with BMG Canada expired.

In 2005, Lamarre took over as President of Cirque du Soleil from Laliberté while Heward took on the role of executive producer for special projects. In that same year the company premiered the touring show &quot;Corteo&quot;. The same year, the Cirque du Soleil switched ticketing companies to go with Outbox&#x27;s technology, a white label system, of which it also became a shareholder.

Cirque du Soleil premiered two shows in 2006: &quot;Delirium&quot;, their first significant touring arena show, in January of that year and &quot;The Beatles Love&quot;, their first collaboration with The Beatles, in June. Similarly, in 2007 they opened two more productions with the resident show &quot;Wintuk&quot; in New York City and the touring tent show &quot;Koozå&quot;. In July 2007 the company made their first effort to convert tent shows to arena settings by launching &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;&#x27;s arena tour in London, Ontario (this custom would be followed by other tent shows in later years).

The company opened three resident shows within the span of 3 months in 2008 — &quot;Zaia&quot; in Macau, China, &quot;Criss Angel Believe&quot; in Las Vegas, and &quot;Zed&quot; in Tokyo, Japan — which furthered their practice of producing multiple shows at the same time. That year Cirque du Soleil also announced that they sold a 20% stake in the company to Dubai investors Istithmar World and Nakheel in order to finance their goals, including plans for a resident show in Dubai directed by Guy Caron and Michael Curry (according to Laliberté, these plans were later &quot;put on ice&quot; due to the 2008 recession).

In 2009, they launched 3 more shows: the touring tent show &quot;Ovo&quot;, the touring theatre show &quot;Banana Shpeel&quot;, and the resident show &quot;Viva Elvis&quot; in Las Vegas. At this time Cirque du Soleil began being criticized for the quality of their productions. &quot;Banana Shpeel&quot; became labelled as one of the company&#x27;s first &quot;failures&quot; when it was panned by both critics and audiences; &quot;Criss Angel Believe&quot; and &quot;Viva Elvis&quot; also received negative reviews.

=== 2010–2014: Cutbacks and restructuring ===
The touring show &quot;Totem&quot; premiered in 2010 and was soon followed by three more shows in 2011: the resident show &quot;Iris&quot; in Los Angeles and the touring shows &quot;Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour&quot; and &quot;Zarkana.&quot; Although the company was still growing at this time, it continued to face several issues with its newer productions. &quot;Zarkana&quot; and &quot;Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour&quot; received poor reviews and the company had a string of closures. &quot;Banana Shpeel&quot; closed in Toronto in October 2010 after cancelling its previously-announced engagement in San Francisco. In July 2011, Cirque du Soleil announced the closure of &quot;Zed&quot; due to poor ticket sales as a direct result of the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In November 2011 MGM Grand asked the company to close and replace &quot;Viva Elvis&quot; by the end of 2012 due to poor ticket sales. In February 2012, the company announced the closure of &quot;Zaia&quot; due to disappointing ticket sales and in November 2012, despite critical praise, announced the closure of &quot;Iris,&quot; also due to low ticket sales. In December 2012, the company announced a new division — Cirque du Soleil Média — in conjunction with Bell Media, followed by the release of their second film &quot;Worlds Away&quot;. At this time Cirque du Soleil also announced 50 layoffs. The layoffs consisted mostly of 30 employee positions at their International Headquarters in Montreal, including three vice-presidents.

With the high output of shows between 2007 and 2011 in combination with its multiple closures, the company began slowing down its operations. In 2012 and 2013 it only opened two shows: the touring tent show &quot;Amaluna&quot; and the resident show &quot;Michael Jackson: One&quot; in Las Vegas. On 16 January 2013, Cirque du Soleil announced that it would be laying off 400 of its 5000 employees worldwide, most of which at their International Headquarters. The company noted that it had not been profitable in 2012 despite having garnered over $1 billion in revenue that year. Later that year, on 30 June 2013, the company faced headlines when acrobat Sarah &quot;Sasoun&quot; Guyard-Guillot died after falling during a performance of &quot;Kà&quot; in Las Vegas, its first on-stage death in its history.

In January 2014, Cirque du Soleil announced the creation of Cirque du Soleil Theatrical, a division aimed developing more traditional theatre productions in order to diversify their production output. The company subsequently announced numerous subsidiaries in addition to its Theatrical division, including the Sandbox Hospitality Group, 45 Degrees, 4U2C, and Outbox Enterprises. In April 2014, &quot;Kurios: Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, a touring tent show, premiered in Montreal to critical acclaim and was followed in November 2014 by &quot;Joyà&quot;, both the company&#x27;s first resident show in Mexico and their first dinner theatre production.

=== 2015–2020: Rebranding and diversification under TPG Capital, Fosun, and CDPQ ===
On 20 April 2015, Guy Laliberté announced that he had sold a 90% joint stake in the company to the investment groups TPG Capital, Fosun Capital Group, and La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) for approximately $1.5 billion, while retaining a 10% stake in the company himself. The sale received regulatory approval from the Government of Canada on 30 June 2015. Under the new ownership, the company began majorly restructuring its executive leadership in order to focus on increasing their profitability. Their finance director, chief operating officer, and numerous vice-presidents were all replaced within six months of the company&#x27;s sale. Notably, the position of Chief Operating Officer held by Charles Décarie was given to finance lawyer Jonathan Tétrault.

In November 2015 the company premiered the touring arena show &quot;Toruk — The First Flight&quot; based on James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; franchise. It was followed shortly after by the touring tent show &quot;Luzia&quot; and the company&#x27;s first Broadway musical &quot;Paramour&quot;, both opening in April 2016. By the end of 2016 the company had also launched the preschool television series &quot;Luna Petunia&quot; on Netflix. In 2017, it launched three more productions. &quot;Séptimo Día — No Descansaré&quot;, an arena show based on the music of Soda Stereo, premiered in March for a short year-long tour targeted largely at South and Central American audiences. In April 2017, it premiered the touring tent show &quot;Volta&quot; and in October, &quot;Crystal&quot;, the company&#x27;s first ice show.

Under the ownership of TPG Capital, Fosun Capital Group, and La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Cirque du Soleil took steps to diversify and rebrand the company. On 6 July 2017, Cirque du Soleil announced that it had acquired the Blue Man Group as a new subsidiary of the company for a reported cost of US$65.5 million. On 21 November 2017, the company announced the Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group as the name of the organization&#x27;s new umbrella company.

On 25 April 2018, the company announced that 45 Degrees, their special events subsidiary, had taken over the main company&#x27;s creation and production department. On 5 July 2018, they announced their acquisition of the children&#x27;s entertainment company VStar Entertainment Group and its subsidiary Cirque Dreams. Cirque du Soleil launched the children&#x27;s show &quot;Big Top Academy&quot; through TVO in October 2018. In November 2018, it premiered the touring tent show &quot;Bazzar&quot; in India, the company&#x27;s first production to tour in that region. In 2019, the company opened six shows: the touring tent show &quot;Alegría: In a New Light&quot;; the touring arena shows &quot;Axel&quot; and &quot;Messi10&quot;; the touring theatre show &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before&quot;; and two resident shows — &quot;X: The Land of Fantasy&quot; in Hangzhou, China and &quot;R.U.N&quot; in Las Vegas. During this time Cirque du Soleil also acquired The Works Entertainment company for $40 million to further diversify its subsidiaries.

In February 2020, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec announced that it had acquired Guy Laliberté&#x27;s remaining 10% stake in Cirque du Soleil, bringing its total ownership in the company from 10% to 20%.

=== 2020–2021: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ===
On 19 March 2020, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cirque du Soleil announced that all 44 active shows worldwide would be suspended, and that 4,679 employees, comprising 95 percent of their staff, would be temporarily laid off, effective immediately. These actions brought the company into a state of financial collapse with a debt of over $1 billion. Although it received financial support with a $50 million injection from its shareholders and a $200 million loan from the Quebec government, on 29 June 2020 the company announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection and was terminating 3,500 employees who had previously been laid off. CEO Daniel Lamarre stated the intention of the company was to rehire &quot;a substantial majority&quot; of terminated employees once coronavirus-related shutdowns were lifted and operations could resume, business conditions allowing.

In connection with the filing, Cirque du Soleil entered a stalking horse bid from its shareholders with the intention of drawing outside bidders to buy the company. In July 2020, the company&#x27;s shareholders offered a proposal that would allow its creditors to obtain a 45% stake in the company while the current shareholders would maintain a 55% shared stake. On 17 July 2020, a takeover proposal by the company&#x27;s creditors valued at US$1.2 billion was approved as a benchmark bid in the company by the Quebec Superior Court. On 17 August 2020, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec reported that it had to write off the US$75 million investment which it had made only four months prior, in February. On 24 November 2020, it was announced that the company emerged from bankruptcy and was sold to a group of its creditors led by Canadian investment company Catalyst Capital Group.

In January 2021, the company&#x27;s previously announced 2021 production &quot;Nysa&quot; was cancelled as a direct result of the pandemic.

=== 2021–present: Post-pandemic restructuring under Catalyst ===
With the exception of the resident shows &quot;Joyà&quot; and &quot;X: The Land of Fantasy&quot;, which reopened with limited capacities in the summer of 2020, Cirque du Soleil did not reopen its shows for over a year following its worldwide COVID-19 performance suspension in March 2020. In the summer of 2021, the company began gradually reopening several of its shows, beginning with all its Las Vegas-based resident shows (with the exception of &quot;Zumanity&quot;, which permanently shut down in November 2020) and some of its touring shows in late 2021 and 2022. However, some touring shows that had been temporarily suspended due to the pandemic were retroactively permanently closed at this time, including &quot;Totem&quot;, &quot;Volta&quot;, and &quot;Axel&quot;.

In November 2021, the resident show &quot;Drawn to Life&quot; premiered — the company&#x27;s first new production since the start of the pandemic. Later that month, Cirque du Soleil announced that Daniel Lamarre would be stepping down as president and CEO of the company and transitioning into the role of executive vice-chairman of the board, while former chief financial officer and chief operating officer Stéphane Lefebvre would take over as president and CEO, effective 1 December 2021.

In 2022, &quot;Mad Apple&quot; opened in the former &quot;Zumanity&quot; theatre at New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, followed by the touring show &quot;Echo&quot; in 2023. In July 2024, the touring theatre production &quot;Songblazers&quot; premiered, but was shortly cancelled in November of the same year due to &quot;logistical reasons.&quot; That same month, the company announced the closure of two performance venues in its Blue Man Group subsidiary as well as a round of layoffs at their Montreal and Las Vegas headquarters, including the complete closure of their Las Vegas costume and fabrication workshops.

== Shows ==

Each Cirque du Soleil production is a synthesis of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props.

The duration of each touring show is typically between 2 and 2 hours and 30 minutes, including an intermission. Permanent shows are usually between 70 and 90 minutes in length without an intermission. Typically touring shows as well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week. Touring shows usually have one &quot;dark day&quot; (with no performances) while resident shows have two.

=== Show list ===

=== Future productions ===

With the intent of diversifying its activities worldwide, the Cirque du Soleil has created subsidiaries, such as multimedia environments and ticket selling tools.

===Outbox Technology===
Outbox was built around the idea that event producers need a white label system to support them in selling tickets directly to customers. It allows all live entertainment venues to control their inventory, pricing, and consumer data without any third party involvement.

===4U2C===
4U2C creates multimedia visual environments that combine video, sound, lighting and special effects for a variety of projection surfaces.

===45 Degrees===

=== Cirque du Soleil Events + Experiences ===

From the 1990s until 2015, Cirque du Soleil produced a variety of public and private events and performances under its Special Events division. In April 2015, the company announced that its Special Events division formed a subsidiary company called 45 Degrees. Led by Yasmine Khalil, the new company continued to produce special events for Cirque du Soleil while expanding to offer creative content outside Cirque du Soleil as well. 45 Degrees later merged with the C-Lab (creative laboratory) division of the main company, continuing to produce special event performances while also designing shows with new concepts (such as the dinner-show concept in &quot;Joyà&quot; and the ice concept in &quot;Crystal&quot;). In April 2019, Cirque du Soleil announced that the 45 Degrees subsidiary had become a division named &quot;Cirque du Soleil Events + Experiences&quot; under which the company now develops its special events and projects.

=== Cruise ship performances ===

==== Collaboration with Celebrity Cruises ====
In March 2004, Celebrity Cruises announced its first collaboration with Cirque du Soleil. By the end of that year, the collaboration had launched &quot;The Bar at the Edge of the Earth&quot; on both the &quot;Constellation&quot; and &quot;Summit&quot; cruise ships, a bar and lounge inspired by Cirque du Soleil featuring live characters and projections. However, due to lukewarm reception, Celebrity Cruises announced in October 2005 that it would be removing the live characters and projections from the lounges and retooling its Cirque du Soleil offering so as to create a more standard circus performance. In December 2005, the collaboration premiered the 30-minute acrobatic show &quot;A Taste of Cirque du Soleil&quot; on both ships. It continued through 2006 and was eventually discontinued.

==== Cirque du Soleil at Sea ====
On 9 November 2015, Cirque du Soleil announced that it would be re-entering the cruise ship business in collaboration with MSC Cruises. The partnership plans included a $21 million investment by MSC to create special theatre spaces in four of their Meraviglia class ships while Cirque du Soleil would create eight new shows, two on each ship in alternating performances. The partnership was later branded as Cirque du Soleil at Sea.

In June 2017, it launched its first two productions on the MSC Meraviglia — &quot;Viaggio&quot; and &quot;Sonor&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Syma&quot; and &quot;Varélia&quot; on the MSC Bellissima in March 2019 and &quot;Cosmos&quot; and &quot;Exentricks&quot; on the MSC Grandiosa in November 2019. Two more shows were planned to launch on MSC Virtuosa in 2020 until the COVID-19 pandemic forced all Cirque du Soleil at Sea productions to close.

===Lounges and nightclubs===
Following the opening of &quot;The Beatles Love&quot; in Las Vegas in June 2006, Cirque du Soleil opened the Revolution lounge at The Mirage resort in 2007, its first venture into the Las Vegas nightlife business. The lounge was based on the work of The Beatles, in conjunction with the concept of &quot;The Beatles Love&quot;. In 2009, the company opened the Gold Lounge at the Aria Resort and Casino based on the life of Elvis Presley and their show &quot;Viva Elvis&quot;. In May 2013 the Light Group opened the Light nightclub in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in concurrence with the premiere of &quot;Michael Jackson One&quot;. It would later be host to the musical &quot;For the Record&quot;, the company&#x27;s first project out of its theatrical division.

In October 2015, Cirque du Soleil renounced its intention to be involved in Las Vegas nightclubs and has since dissociated itself from all its lounges and clubs. Both the Revolution and Gold Lounges closed in 2015 while the Light nightclub is no longer affiliated with the company.

===&quot;Luna Petunia&quot;===
In 2014 Cirque du Soleil Média and Saban Brands produced &quot;Luna Petunia&quot;, an animated series for preschool-aged children. It began airing on Netflix in September 2016. On 1 May 2018, Saban Brands sold &quot;Luna Petunia&quot; to Hasbro.

===&quot;The Wiz&quot;===
In a collaboration with Universal Television and Sony Pictures Television, the Cirque du Soleil Theatrical division co-produced the television broadcast of &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; (based on the musical of the same name) which aired in December 2015 on NBC. Tony Award-winning director Kenny Leon directed the show along with Broadway writer/actor Harvey Fierstein, who contributed new material to the original Broadway script. Queen Latifah, Mary J. Blige, Stephanie Mills, Ne-Yo, David Alan Grier, Common, Elijah Kelley, Amber Riley, and Uzo Aduba and Shanice Williams starred in the broadcast. It was speculated that a live version of the show would play on Broadway during the 2016–2017 season, however this plan fell through.

==Tours==

Touring Cirque du Soleil shows are customarily mounted under a &quot;grand chapiteau&quot; (i.e. big top) hauled from site to site along with a large entrance tent, artistic tent, kitchen, school, and other items necessary to support the cast and crew.

It typically takes eight days to set up and three to break down the site. About 100 local workers are hired as temporary staff, overseen by one of the company&#x27;s tent masters.

Before 2006, Cirque du Soleil performed exclusively in tents and permanent theatres, with the exception of the brief arena tours of &quot;Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Fascination&quot; in 1992. 2006&#x27;s &quot;Delirium&quot; was the company&#x27;s first significant touring show for the arena market. Its success led Cirque du Soleil to re-stage its Grand Chapiteau shows for arena tours, beginning with &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; in 2007 and subsequently with most of their major Grand Chapiteau productions.

The company&#x27;s tours contribute to venue cities&#x27; economies: renting lots for shows, parking spaces, selling and buying promotions, renting hotel rooms, purchasing food, and hiring local help. For example, during its 2009 stay in Santa Monica, California, &quot;Koozå&quot; brought an estimated to the city government and local businesses.

== Discography ==
== Filmography ==
The company&#x27;s multimedia division Cirque du Soleil Images creates original products for film, television, video, and DVD and distributes its productions worldwide. Its creations have garnered numerous awards, including a multiple Gemini Awards and seven Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;Fire Within, Corteo&quot;, &quot;Dralion&quot;, &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;, and &quot;Le Cirque Réinventé&quot;.
== Controversies and legal issues ==

===Firing of HIV-positive artist===
In November 2003, gymnast Matthew Cusick (represented by the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund) filed a discrimination complaint against Cirque du Soleil in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Cusick (a trainee performer who was scheduled to begin working at &quot;Mystère&quot;) alleged that in April 2002, Cirque du Soleil fired him because he tested HIV-positive, even though company doctors had already cleared him as healthy enough to perform. Cirque du Soleil alleged that due to the nature of Cusick&#x27;s disease coupled with his job&#x27;s high risk of injury, there was a significant risk of his infecting other performers, crew or audience members. Cirque du Soleil said that they had several HIV-positive employees, but in the case of Cusick, the risk of him spreading his infection while performing was too high to take the risk. A boycott ensued and &quot;Just Out&quot; ran a story on it with the headline &quot;Flipping off the Cirque&quot;. Cirque du Soleil settled with Cusick in April 2004. Under the settlement, the company began a company-wide anti-discrimination training program; changed its employment practices pertaining to HIV-positive applicants; paid Cusick $60,000 in lost wages, $200,000 in front pay, and $300,000 in compensatory damages; and paid $40,000 in attorney fees to Lambda Legal.

An additional complaint was filed on Cusick&#x27;s behalf by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. Their complaint stemmed from the City of San Francisco&#x27;s ban on city contracting with employers that discriminate based on HIV status; the circus leases property owned by the city-owned Port of San Francisco.

===Trademark and copyright disputes===
Cirque du Soleil opposed Neil Goldberg and his company Cirque Productions over its use of the word &quot;Cirque&quot; in the late 1990s. Goldberg&#x27;s company was awarded a trademark on its name &quot;Cirque Dreams&quot; in 2005.

In August 1999, Fremonster Theatrical filed an application for the trademark Cirque de Flambé. This application was opposed by the owners of the Cirque du Soleil trademark in August 2002, on the grounds that it would cause confusion and &quot;[dilute] the distinctive quality&quot; of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s trademarks. A judge dismissed the opposition and the Cirque de Flambé trademark application was approved in 2005.

In April 2016, Cirque du Soleil filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Sony Music Entertainment in federal court in New York, alleging that Timberlake&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Hold the Wall&quot; (co-written with Timbaland) from his third studio album &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot; (2013) infringed the copyright of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s song &quot;Steel Dream&quot; from its 1997 album &quot;Quidam&quot;. The two parties settled out of court.

===H.B. 2 law in North Carolina===
In 2016 the company cancelled of all touring shows to North Carolina, including &quot;Ovo&quot; in both Greensboro and Charlotte, and &quot;Toruk&quot; in Raleigh, following signature of the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act (commonly known as &quot;HB2&quot;) by North Carolina governor Pat McCrory. Cirque du Soleil was criticized for this decision and accused of taking a double standard, for cancelling the shows in North Carolina while many times they have performed their shows in countries like the United Arab Emirates which violates a number of fundamental human rights.

==Fatalities==
On 16 October 2009, 24-year-old performer Oleksandr &quot;Sacha&quot; Zhurov, of Ukraine, died at a hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from head injuries he had sustained during a training session. He had been with the company only a few months at the time of the accident. An initial report of the incident said Zhurov had fallen off a trampoline but, in 2010, it was reported he had fallen while doing training exercises on a Russian swing. An investigation by Quebec&#x27;s occupational-safety board decided that while Zhurov made the error that ultimately resulted in his death, the company should be fined $1,915 for failing to adequately determine the risks associated with equipment.

On 29 June 2013, 31-year-old performer Sarah &quot;Sasoun&quot; Guyard-Guillot, of France, died in an ambulance en route to hospital as the result of blunt force trauma she had sustained from a fall during a performance of &quot;Kà&quot; in Las Vegas, Nevada. She&#x27;d been with the company since 2006. It was originally thought that Guyard-Guillot&#x27;s safety harness had failed her and that was what resulted in her fall but, in actuality, a cable responsible for keeping her in the air had been cut after accidentally being knocked loose by movement during the performance. Reports as to how far Guyard-Guillot fell differ from source to source, with some saying she fell as little as 50 feet and others as much as 94 feet. The show resumed 17 days after the death without the final aerial battle scene. The company was fined as a result.

On 29 November 2016, 42-year-old set technician Olivier Rochette, of Canada, died in San Francisco, California, from head injuries he had sustained after accidentally being hit in the head by an aerial lift while preparing for a production of &quot;Luzia&quot;. Rochette was the son of Cirque du Soleil co-founder Gilles Ste-Croix.

On 17 March 2018, 38-year-old aerial straps performer Yann Arnaud, of France, died at a hospital in Tampa, Florida, after falling during a performance of &quot;Volta&quot;. He had been with the company for 15 years.

<doc id="284384" wikidata="Q1225991" url="?curid=284384" title="National anthem of Russia">
<text>The &quot;State Anthem of the Russian Federation&quot; is the national anthem of Russia. It uses the same melody as the &quot;State Anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot;, composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who had collaborated with Gabriel El-Registan on the original anthem. From 1944, that earliest version replaced &quot;The Internationale&quot; as a new, more Soviet-centric and Russia-centric Soviet anthem. The same melody, but without any lyrics, was used after 1956. A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism, and without mentioning Joseph Stalin by name.

The Russian SFSR was the only constituent republic of the Soviet Union without its own regional anthem, instead using the national anthem of the Soviet Union. The lyric-free &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot;, composed by Mikhail Glinka, was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia, and confirmed in 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, by the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. This anthem proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions. The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem, but none of the entries were adopted.

Glinka&#x27;s anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin&#x27;s successor, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the national anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and it became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics, eventually settling upon a new composition by Mikhalkov; according to the government, the lyrics were selected to evoke and eulogize the history and traditions of Russia. Yeltsin criticized Putin for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem even though opinion polls showed that many Russians favored this decision.

Public perception of the anthem is positive among Russians. A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the national anthem, and that 25% liked it.

==Historical anthems==
Before &quot;The Prayer of the Russians&quot; () was chosen as the national anthem of Imperial Russia in 1816, various church hymns and military marches were used to honor the country and the Tsars. Songs used include &quot;Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!&quot; () and &quot;How Glorious is our Lord&quot; (). &quot;The Prayer of the Russians&quot; was adopted around 1816, and used lyrics by Vasily Zhukovsky set to the music of the British anthem, &quot;God Save the King&quot;. Russia&#x27;s anthem was also influenced by the anthems of France and the Netherlands, and by the British patriotic song &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;.

In 1833, Zhukovsky was asked to set lyrics to a musical composition by Prince Alexei Lvov called &quot;The Russian People&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, known more commonly as &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; (). It was well received by Nicholas I, who chose the song to be the next anthem of Imperial Russia. The song resembled a hymn, and its musical style was similar to that of other anthems used by European monarchs. &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; was performed for the first time on 8 December 1833, at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. It was later played at the Winter Palace on Christmas Day, by order of Nicholas I. Public singing of the anthem began at opera houses in 1834, but it was not widely known across the Russian Empire until 1837.

&quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; was used until the February Revolution, when the Russian monarchy was overthrown. Upon the overthrow, in March 1917, the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Marseillaise&quot; (), Pyotr Lavrov&#x27;s modification of the French anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, was used as an unofficial anthem by the Russian Provisional Government. The modifications Lavrov made to &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; included a change in meter from 2/2 to 4/4 and music harmonization to make it sound more Russian. It was used at governmental meetings, welcoming ceremonies for diplomats and state funerals.

After the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government in the 1917 October Revolution, the anthem of international revolutionary socialism, &quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot; (usually known as &quot;The Internationale&quot; in English), was adopted as the new anthem. The lyrics had been written by Eugène Pottier, and Pierre Degeyter had composed the music in 1871 to honor the creation of the Second Socialist International organization; in 1902, Arkadij Jakovlevich Kots translated Pottier&#x27;s lyrics into Russian. Kots also changed the grammatical tense of the song, to make it more decisive in nature. The first major use of the song was at the funeral of victims of the February Revolution in Petrograd. Lenin also wanted &quot;The Internationale&quot; to be played more often because it was more socialist, and could not be confused with the French anthem; other persons in the new Soviet government believed &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; to be too bourgeois. &quot;The Internationale&quot; was used as the state anthem of Soviet Russia from 1918, adopted by the newly created Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922, and was used until 1944.

==Post-1944 Soviet anthem==
===Music===

The music of the national anthem, created by Alexander Alexandrov, had previously been incorporated in several hymns and compositions. The music was first used in the Hymn of the Bolshevik Party, created in 1939. When the Comintern was dissolved in 1943, the government argued that &quot;The Internationale&quot;, which was historically associated with the Comintern, should be replaced as the National Anthem of the Soviet Union. Alexandrov&#x27;s music was chosen as the new anthem by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin after a contest in 1943. Stalin praised the song for fulfilling what a national anthem should be, though he criticized the song&#x27;s orchestration.

In response, Alexandrov blamed the problems on Viktor Knushevitsky, who was responsible for orchestrating the entries for the final contest rounds. When writing the Bolshevik party anthem, Alexandrov incorporated pieces from the song &quot;Life Has Become Better&quot; (), a musical comedy that he composed. This comedy was based on a slogan Stalin first used in 1935. Over 200 entries were submitted for the anthem contest, including some by famous Soviet composers Dmitri Shostakovich, Aram Khachaturian and Iona Tuskiya. Later, the rejected joint entry by Khachaturian and Shostakovich became &quot;Song of the Red Army&quot;, and Khachaturian went on to compose the Anthem of the Armenian SSR. There was also an entry from Boris Alexandrov, the son of Alexander. His rejected entry, &quot;Long Live our State&quot; (), became a popular patriotic song and was adopted as the anthem of Transnistria.

During the 2000 debate on the anthem, Boris Gryzlov, the leader of the Unity faction in the Duma, noted that the music which Alexandrov wrote for the Soviet anthem was similar to Vasily Kalinnikov&#x27;s 1892 overture, &quot;Bylina&quot;. Supporters of the Soviet anthem mentioned this in the various debates held in the Duma on the change of anthem, but there is no evidence that Alexandrov consciously used parts of &quot;Bylina&quot; in his composition.

===Lyrics===
After selecting the music by Alexandrov for the national anthem, Stalin needed new lyrics. He thought that the song was short and, because of the Great Patriotic War, that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of Germany by the Red Army. The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan were called to Moscow by one of Stalin&#x27;s staffers, and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov&#x27;s music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but to find a way to change the refrains which described &quot;a Country of Soviets&quot;. Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight. After a few minor changes to emphasize the Soviet Fatherland, Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943, including a line about Stalin &quot;inspir[ing] us to keep the faith with the people&quot;. The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January 1, 1944 and became official on March 15, 1944.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, the Soviet government examined his legacy. The government began the de-Stalinization process, which included downplaying the role of Stalin and moving his corpse from Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. In addition, the anthem lyrics composed by Mikhalkov and El-Registan were officially scrapped by the Soviet government in 1956. The anthem was still used by the Soviet government, but without any official lyrics. In private, this anthem became known the &quot;Song Without Words&quot;. Mikhalkov wrote a new set of lyrics in 1970, but they were not submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet until May 27, 1977. The new lyrics, which eliminated any mention of Stalin, were approved on 1 September, and were made official with the printing of the new Soviet Constitution in October 1977. In the credits for the 1977 lyrics, Mikhalkov was mentioned, but references to El-Registan, who died in 1945, were dropped for unknown reasons.

==&quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot;==

With the impending collapse of the Soviet Union in early 1990, a new national anthem was needed to help define the reorganized nation and to reject the Soviet past. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, Boris Yeltsin, was advised to revive &quot;God Save The Tsar&quot; with modifications to the lyrics. However, he instead selected a piece composed by Mikhail Glinka. The piece, known as &quot;Patriotícheskaya Pésnya&quot; (), was a wordless piano composition discovered after Glinka&#x27;s death. &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot; was performed in front of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR on November 23, 1990. The song was decreed by the Supreme Soviet to be the new Russian anthem that same day. This anthem was intended to be permanent, which can be seen from the parliamentary draft of the Constitution, approved and drafted by Supreme Soviet, Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and its Constitutional Commission (with latter formally headed by President of Russia). The draft, among other things, reads that:
The National Anthem of the Russian Federation is the Patriotic Song composed by Mikhail Glinka. The text of the National Anthem of the Russian Federation shall be endorsed by the federal law.

However, conflict between President and Congress made passage of that draft less likely: the Congress shifted onto more and more rewriting of the 1978 Russian Constitution, while President pushed forward with new draft Constitution, which does not define state symbols. After 1993 Russian constitutional crisis and just one day before the constitutional referendum (i.e. on December 11, 1993) Yeltsin, then President of the Russian Federation, issued a presidential decree on December 11, 1993, retaining &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot; the official anthem for Russia, but this decree was provisional, since the draft Constitution (which was passed a day later) explicitly referred this matter to legislation, enacted by parliament. According to Article 70 of the Constitution, state symbols (which are an anthem, flag and coat of arms) required further definition by future legislation. As it was a constitutional matter, it had to be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Duma.

Between 1994 and 1999, many votes were called for in the State Duma to retain &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot; as the official anthem of Russia. However, it faced stiff opposition from members of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who wanted the Soviet anthem restored. Because any anthem had to be approved by a two-thirds supermajority, this disagreement between Duma factions for nearly a decade prevented passage of an anthem.

===Call for lyrics===
When &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot; was used as the national anthem, it had official lyrics but was not accepted. The anthem struck a positive chord for some people because it did not contain elements from the Soviet past, and because the public considered Glinka to be a patriot and a true Russian. However, the lack of lyrics doomed &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot;. Various attempts were made to compose lyrics for the anthem, including a contest that allowed any Russian citizen to participate. A committee set up by the government looked at over 6000 entries, and 20 were recorded by an orchestra for a final vote.

The eventual winner was Viktor Radugin&#x27;s &quot;Be glorious, Russia!&quot; (). However, none of the lyrics were officially adopted by Yeltsin or the Russian government. One of the reasons that partially explained the lack of lyrics was the original use of Glinka&#x27;s composition: the praise of the Tsar and of the Russian Orthodox Church. Other complaints raised about the song were that it was hard to remember, uninspiring, and musically complicated. It was one of the few national anthems that lacked official lyrics during this period. The only other wordless national anthems in the period from 1990 to 2000 were &quot;My Belarusy&quot; of Belarus (until 2002), &quot;Marcha Real&quot; of Spain, and &quot;Intermeco&quot; of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Modern adoption==
The anthem debate intensified in October 2000 when Yeltsin&#x27;s successor, Vladimir Putin, commented that Russian athletes had no words to sing for the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. Putin brought public attention to the issue and put it before the State Council. CNN also reported that members of the Spartak Moscow football club complained that the wordless anthem &quot;affected their morale and performance&quot;. Two years earlier, during the 1998 World Cup, members of the Russian team commented that the wordless anthem failed to inspire &quot;great patriotic effort&quot;.

In a November session of the Federation Council, Putin stated that establishing the national symbols (anthem, flag and coat of arms) should be a top priority for the country. Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem, but strongly suggested that new lyrics be written. He did not say how much of the old Soviet lyrics should be retained for the new anthem. Putin submitted the bill &quot;On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation&quot; to the Duma for their consideration on 4 December. The Duma voted 381–51–1 in favor of adopting Alexandrov&#x27;s music as the national anthem on 8 December 2000. Following the vote, a committee was formed and tasked with exploring lyrics for the national anthem. After receiving over 6,000 manuscripts from all sectors of Russian society, the committee selected lyrics by Mikhalkov for the anthem.

Before the official adoption of the lyrics, the Kremlin released a section of the anthem, which made a reference to the flag and coat of arms:

The above lines were omitted from the final version of the lyrics. After the bill was approved by the Federation Council on 20 December, &quot;On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation&quot; was signed into law by President Putin on 25 December, officially making Alexandrov&#x27;s music the national anthem of Russia. The law was published two days later in the official government gazette &quot;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&quot;. The new anthem was first performed on 30 December, during a ceremony at the Great Kremlin Palace in Moscow at which Mikhalkov&#x27;s lyrics were officially made part of the national anthem.

Not everyone agreed with the adoption of the new anthem. Yeltsin argued that Putin should not have changed the anthem merely to &quot;follow blindly the mood of the people&quot;. Yeltsin also felt that the restoration of the Soviet anthem was part of a move to reject post-communist reforms that had taken place since Russian independence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This was one of Yeltsin&#x27;s few public criticisms of Putin.

The liberal political party Yabloko stated that the re-adoption of the Soviet anthem &quot;deepened the schism in Russian society,&quot; and led a failed movement to adopt Farewell of Slavianka instead. The Soviet anthem was supported by the Communist Party and by Putin himself. The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990, the white-blue-red flag and the double-headed eagle coat of arms, were also given legal approval by Putin in December, thus ending the debate over the national symbols. After all of the symbols were adopted, Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia&#x27;s past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia&#x27;s history. He also stated that, while Russia&#x27;s march towards democracy would not be stopped, the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the lives of their mothers and fathers bereft of meaning. It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem&#x27;s lyrics; athletes were only able to hum along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

==Public perception==
The Russian anthem is set to the melody of the State Anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As a result, there have been several controversies related to its use. Some such as cellist Mstislav Rostropovich vowed not to stand during the anthem. Russian cultural figures and government officials were also troubled by Putin&#x27;s restoration of the Soviet anthem, even with different lyrics. A former adviser to both Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last President of the Soviet Union, stated that, when &quot;Stalin&#x27;s hymn&quot; was used as the national anthem of the Soviet Union, horrific crimes took place.

At the 2007 funeral of Yeltsin, the Russian state anthem was played as his coffin was laid to rest at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. While it was common to hear the state anthem during state funerals for Soviet civil and military officials, honored citizens of the nation, and Soviet leaders, as was the case for Alexei Kosygin, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, Boris Berezovsky, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, felt that playing the anthem at Yeltsin&#x27;s funeral &quot;abused the man who brought freedom&quot; to the Russian people. The Russian government states that the &quot;solemn music and poetic work&quot; of the anthem, despite its history, is a symbol of unity for the Russian people. Mikhalkov&#x27;s words evoke &quot;feelings of patriotism, respect for the history of the country and its system of government.&quot;

In a 2009 poll conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia&#x27;s flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall the words of the first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem&#x27;s first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.
In the previous year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center found out that 56% of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew the first words of the anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words.

In September 2009, a line from the lyrics used during Stalin&#x27;s rule reappeared at the Moscow Metro station Kurskaya-Koltsevaya: &quot;We were raised by Stalin to be true to the people, inspiring us to feats of labour and heroism.&quot; While groups have threatened legal action to reverse the re-addition of this phrase on a stone banner at the vestibule&#x27;s rotunda, it was part of the original design of Kurskaya station and had been removed during de-Stalinization. Most of the commentary surrounding this event focused on the Kremlin&#x27;s attempt to &quot;rehabilitate the image&quot; of Stalin by using symbolism sympathetic to or created by him.

The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) strongly supported the restoration of Alexandrov&#x27;s melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a KPRF member of the Duma, advocated for the removal of any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin&#x27;s suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000 rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.

==Regulations==
Regulations for the performance of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000. While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. During official performances of the national anthem, everyone present listens to it standing, and men remove their hats. If the national anthem is played whilst the flag of the Russian Federation is being raised, the audience will face the flag.

Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures. When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades, Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square, only an orchestra would be used because voices would be swallowed by the echo.

The anthem is mandatory at the swearing-in of the President of Russia, for opening and closing sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio at the beginning and end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours, or slightly earlier at 0458 hours. The anthem is also played on New Year&#x27;s Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played &quot;officially&quot;, everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.

The anthem is performed in 4/4 (common time) or in 2/4 in the key of C major, and has a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Using either time signature, the anthem must be played in a solemn and singing manner (Russian: &quot;Торжественно&quot; and &quot;Распевно&quot;). The government has released arrangements for orchestras, brass bands and wind bands.

According to Russian , state symbols and signs are not protected by copyright. As such, the anthem&#x27;s music and lyrics may be used and modified freely. Although the law calls for the anthem to be performed respectfully and for performers to avoid causing offence, it does not define what constitutes offensive acts or penalties. Standing for the anthem is required by law but the law does not specify a penalty for refusing to stand.

<text>Zhang Chongren (27 September 1907 – 8 October 1998), also known as Chang Chong-jen, was a Chinese sculptor best remembered in Europe as a friend of Hergé, the Belgian cartoonist and creator of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The two met when Zhang was an art student in Brussels. Zhang served as the inspiration for Chang Chong-Chen, a recurring character in the Tintin stories.

==Early life==

Zhang was born the son of a gardener in 1907 in Xujiahui (&quot;Ziccawei&quot;), then a suburb of Shanghai, China. The young Zhang lost both his parents at an early age and grew up in the French Jesuit orphanage of &quot;Tou-Se-we&quot; (now Tushanwan) where he entered at the age of seven, and where he learned French. He then entered the Art School of the orphanage, where he learned to draw, and was systematically educated in Western art. After finishing school in 1928, Zhang worked with design for the film industry and at a local newspaper. In 1931, he left China for the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, Belgium.

==Influence on Hergé==
Hergé&#x27;s early albums of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; were highly dependent on stereotypes for comedic effect. These included evil Russian Bolsheviks, lazy and ignorant Africans, and an America of gangsters, cowboys and Indians.

At the close of the newspaper run of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, Hergé had mentioned that Tintin&#x27;s next adventure (&quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;) would bring him to China. Father Gosset, the chaplain to the Chinese students at the University of Leuven, wrote to Hergé urging him to be sensitive about what he wrote about China. Hergé agreed, and in the spring of 1934 Gosset introduced him to Zhang Chongren. The two young artists quickly became close friends, and Zhang introduced Hergé to Chinese history and culture, and the techniques of Chinese art. Of similar age, they also shared many interests and beliefs. Hergé even promised to give authorship credits to Zhang in the book, but Zhang declined the offer. As a result of this experience, Hergé would strive, in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; and subsequent Tintin adventures, to be meticulously accurate in depicting the places Tintin visited.

As a token of appreciation, Hergé added the character &quot;Chang Chong-Chen&quot; (Tchang in original French-language version) to &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;.

As another result of his friendship with Zhang, Hergé became increasingly aware of the problems of colonialism, in particular the Empire of Japan&#x27;s advances into China, and the corrupt, exploitative International Settlement of Shanghai. &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; carries a bold anti-imperialist message, contrary to the prevailing view in Europe, which was sympathetic to Japan and the colonial enterprise. As a result, it drew sharp criticism from various parties, including a protest by Japanese diplomats to the Belgian Foreign Ministry.

== Return to China ==

At the end of his studies in Brussels in 1935, Zhang made a tour of France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Italy before returning home to China. Upon his arrival back in Shanghai in 1936, Zhang held a number of shows exhibiting his drawings and sculptures. He also established the Chongren Studio to further his art and to teach.

Hergé lost contact with him during the invasion of China by Japan (which is usually regarded as the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War) and the subsequent Chinese Civil War. More than four decades would pass before the two friends would meet again. In an instance of life mirroring art, Hergé managed to resume contact with his old friend Zhang, years after Tintin rescued the fictional Chang in the closing pages of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. Zhang had been a street sweeper during the Cultural Revolution, before becoming the head of the Fine Arts Academy in Shanghai during the 1970s.

After the economic liberalization of China in 1979, Zhang received widespread acknowledgment in the Chinese art community. A collection of his oil paintings and sculptures were published and in his later years, Zhang worked as an editor and translator of several books on art. Among the portraits he painted are those of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and French President François Mitterrand.

Zhang returned to Europe for a reunion with Hergé in 1981 on the invitation of the French government. In 1989 he received French citizenship and settled down to teach in the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne, where he died in 1998. Shortly after his death, a memorial museum dedicated to him was established in Qibao, Shanghai. A number of his paintings and sculptures are held in the China Museum of Fine Art in Beijing and the China Museum of Revolutionary Warfare.

<text>, often known simply as Tomita, was a Japanese composer, regarded as one of the pioneers of electronic music and space music, and as one of the most famous producers of analog synthesizer arrangements. In addition to creating note-by-note realizations, Tomita made extensive use of the sound-design capabilities of his instrument, using synthesizers to create new sounds to accompany and enhance his electronic realizations of acoustic instruments. He also made effective use of analog music sequencers and the Mellotron, and featured futuristic science-fiction themes, while laying the foundations for synth-pop music and trance-like rhythms. Many of his albums are electronic versions and adaptations of familiar classical music pieces. He received four Grammy Award nominations for his 1974 album based on music by Claude Debussy, &quot;Snowflakes Are Dancing&quot;.

==Biography==

===1932–1968: Early life and composing career===
Tomita was born in Tokyo and spent his early childhood with his father in China. After returning to Japan, he took private lessons in orchestration and composition while an art history student at Keio University, Tokyo. He graduated in 1955 and became a full-time composer for television, film and theatre. He composed the theme music for the Japanese Olympic gymnastics team for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.

In 1965, Tomita wrote music for Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, but the American-English version had a different theme by Bernie Baum, Bill Giant and Florence Kaye. In the same year he scored the original Japanese version of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels Beyond the Moon&quot;, but the film was re-scored by Milton DeLugg when it was dubbed into English.

In 1966, he wrote a tone poem based on the &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, and an original video animation synchronized to this tone poem was released in 1991. With Kunio Miyauchi, he created the music for the tokusatsu science fiction/espionage/action television series &quot;Mighty Jack&quot;, which aired in 1968. The same year, he co-founded Group TAC.

===1969-1979: Electronic music===
In the late 1960s, Tomita turned to electronic music with the impetus of Wendy Carlos and Robert Moog&#x27;s work with synthesizers. He acquired a Moog III synthesizer and began building his home studio. He eventually realized that synthesizers could be used to create entirely new sounds in addition to mimicking other instruments. His first electronic album was &quot;Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock&quot;, released in Japan in 1972 and in the United States in 1974. The album featured electronic renditions of contemporary rock and pop songs, while utilizing speech synthesis in place of a human voice.

Tomita then started arranging Claude Debussy&#x27;s impressionist pieces for synthesizer and, in 1974, released the album &quot;Snowflakes Are Dancing&quot;; it became a worldwide success and was responsible for popularizing several aspects of synthesizer programming. It was the top-selling classical music album for that year. The album&#x27;s contents included ambience, realistic string simulations, an early attempt to synthesize the sound of a symphony orchestra, whistles, and abstract bell-like sounds, as well as a number of processing effects including reverberation, phase shifting, flanging, and ring modulation. Quadraphonic versions of the album provided a spatial audio effect using four speakers. A particularly significant achievement was its polyphonic sound, created prior to the era of polyphonic synthesizers. Tomita created the album&#x27;s polyphony as Carlos had done before him, with the use of multitrack recording, recording each voice of a piece one at a time, on a separate tape track, and then mixing the result to stereo or quad. It took 14 months to produce the album.

In his early albums, Tomita also made effective use of analog music sequencers, which he used for pitch, filter or effects changes and processed Mellotron sounds - especially 8 Voice Choir, creating quite stunning ethereal effects. Tomita&#x27;s modular human whistle sounds would also be copied in the presets of later electronic instruments. His version of &quot;Arabesque No. 1&quot; was later used as the theme to the astronomy television series &quot;Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer&quot; (originally titled &quot;Star Hustler&quot;) seen on most PBS stations in the United States; in Japan, parts of his version of &quot;Rêverie&quot; were used for the opening and closing of Fuji Television&#x27;s transmissions; in Catalonia, &quot;Arabesque No. 1&quot; was also used for the intro and the outro for the children TV 1983 program &quot;Planeta Imaginari&quot; (imaginary planet).

Following the success of &quot;Snowflakes Are Dancing&quot; (1974), Tomita released a number of &quot;classically&quot; themed albums, including arrangements of: Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot; (1976), Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (1976), and Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; (1976). &quot;Holst: The Planets&quot; introduced a science fiction &quot;space theme&quot;. This album sparked controversy on its release, as Imogen Holst, daughter of Gustav Holst, refused permission for her father&#x27;s work to be interpreted in this way.

1978&#x27;s &quot;Kosmos&quot; featured his renditions of Arthur Honegger&#x27;s &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, Charles Ives&#x27;s &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot; and the Star Wars theme.

While working on his classical synthesizer albums, Tomita also composed numerous scores for Japanese television and films, including the &quot;Zatoichi&quot; television series, two &quot;Zatoichi&quot; feature films, the &quot;Oshi Samurai&quot; (Mute Samurai) television series and the Toho science fiction disaster film, &quot;Catastrophe 1999, The Prophesies of Nostradamus&quot; (U.S. title: &quot;Last Days of Planet Earth&quot;) in 1974. The latter blends synthesizer performances with pop-rock and orchestral instruments. It and a few other partial and complete scores of the period have been released on LP and later CD over the years in Japan. While not bootlegs, at least some of these releases were issued by film and television production companies without Tomita&#x27;s artistic approval.

===1980-2000: SoundCloud concerts===
In 1984, Tomita released &quot;Canon of the Three Stars&quot;, which featured classical pieces renamed for astronomical objects. For example, the title piece is his version of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon in D Major. He credits himself with &quot;The Plasma Symphony Orchestra&quot;, which was a computer synthesizer process using the wave forms of electromagnetic emanations from various stars and constellations for the sonic textures of this album.

Tomita performed a number of outdoor &quot;SoundCloud&quot; concerts, with speakers surrounding the audience in a &quot;cloud of sound&quot;. He gave a big concert in 1984 at the annual contemporary music Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria called &quot;Mind of the Universe&quot;, mixing tracks live in a glass pyramid suspended over an audience of 80,000 people. He also performed another two special concerts in 1986 to celebrate the Statue of Liberty centennial (&quot;Back to the Earth&quot;) as well another one in Sydney on 1 January 1988 produced to celebrate Australia&#x27;s bicentenary as unifield country. The Australian performance was part of a A$7 million gift from Japan to the country, which included the largest fireworks display up to that time: six fixed sound and lighting systems — one of those on a moored barge in the centre of the Sydney Harbour, another one was flown by Chinook helicopter during the relevant parts of the show. A fleet of barges with Japanese cultural performances,including a boat parade in which a kabuki theater performance was staged.passed by at various times. His last SoundCloud event was in Nagoya, Japan in 1997, featuring guest performances by The Manhattan Transfer, Ray Charles, Dionne Warwick, and Rick Wakeman.

In the late 1990s, he composed a symphonic fantasy for orchestra and synthesizer titled &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, inspired by the eponymous 11th-century Japanese story. It was performed by symphony orchestras in Tokyo, Los Angeles, and London. A live concert CD version was released in 1999 followed by a studio version in 2000.

===2001–2016: Later years===
In 2001, Tomita collaborated with The Walt Disney Company to compose the background atmosphere music for the AquaSphere entrance at the Tokyo DisneySea theme park outside Tokyo. Tomita followed this with a synthesizer score featuring acoustic soloists for the 2002 film , which won the 2003 Japanese Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music.

The advent of the DVD-Audio format allowed Tomita to further pursue his interests in multichannel audio with reworked releases of &quot;The Tale of Genji Symphonic Fantasy&quot; and &quot;The Tomita Planets 2003&quot;. He also performed a version of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Clair de lune&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 13&quot; in 2007.

In 2012 Tomita performed &quot;Symphony Ihatov&quot; in Tokyo, directing the Japan Philharmonic, an accompanying choir, and featuring cyber-celebrity/diva, Hatsune Miku, a digital avatar created by the Japanese company Crypton Future Media.

In 2015, a number of tracks from &quot;Snowflakes are Dancing&quot; were featured on the soundtrack to &quot;Heaven Knows What&quot;, an American film directed by the Safdie brothers. The same year, in recognition of his long career and global influence on electronic music, Tomita won the Japan Foundation Award, an award launched &quot;to honor individuals or organizations who have made a significant contribution to promoting understanding and friendship between Japan and the rest of the world through academic, artistic and other cultural pursuits&quot;.

===Death===
After having heart disease for many years, Tomita died of heart failure in Tokyo on 5 May 2016.

== Legacy ==
Tomita is considered to be a pioneer in electronic music, but his influence spread beyond the genre both in Japan and overseas.
In 1984, Stevie Wonder cited Tomita as one of the artists he respected most and a major influence exploring classical composers like Mussorgsky and Debussy. In 1987, Michael Jackson toured Tomita&#x27;s home studio.

Tomita&#x27;s music was featured during the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. &quot;Rise of the Planet 9&quot; from Dr. Copellius composed by Tomita was played during the cauldron lighting in the Opening Ceremony, while the Debussy piece &quot;Moonlight&quot; arranged by Tomita was played during the extinguishing of the torch in the closing ceremony.

<text>Olympia Brown (January 5, 1835 – October 23, 1926) was an American minister and suffragist. She was the first woman to be ordained as clergy with the consent of her denomination. Brown was also an articulate advocate for women&#x27;s rights and one of the few first generation suffragists who were able to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.

==Early life and education==
Olympia Brown was born on January 5, 1835, in Prairie Ronde Township, Michigan. Brown was the oldest of four children. Her parents, Lephia and Asa Brown, were farmers in what was then considered frontier land. They were the great-great-aunt and -uncle, respectively, of U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. Lephia raised her children in a household that regarded religion and education as very important. This is evident from the building of a schoolhouse on the Brown territory.

The drive for education instilled by Brown&#x27;s mother had compelled her to finish high school and advance to the university level. Brown and her younger sister Oella decided to attend Mount Holyoke Female Seminary. Mount Holyoke and a college education were what Brown had hoped for. Her excitement was tempered by the restrictions placed on women at Mount Holyoke. These restrictions included a list of forty rules, the abolition of a literacy society founded by the Browns, and religious restrictions. Perhaps the best example of the school&#x27;s thinking was the words of a Chemistry professor, &quot;You are not expected to remember all of this, but only enough to make you intelligent in conversation.&quot; Brown, who already knew she could meet the challenges of a higher education, looked elsewhere.

Putting aside her experiences at Mount Holyoke, Brown enrolled at Antioch College. Once Brown began her education at Antioch, she realized she had to catch up to higher standards. Brown also learned that despite the progressive nature at Antioch, there were still forms of discrimination. For example, in Brown&#x27;s English class, women were not required to have speeches memorized. In a defiant act, Brown delivered her speeches from memory, just as the men had. Perhaps the crowning achievement of Brown’s time at Antioch was her ability to persuade her hero, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, to speak at Antioch.

Once Brown finished her schooling at Antioch, she decided her calling was to be a minister. After countless rejections, she was accepted to the Theological School of St. Lawrence University, although the school&#x27;s president, Ebenezer Fisher, made it clear he did not believe women should be ministers. She arrived on campus in 1861 and graduated in 1863, becoming the first woman to graduate from an established theological school. Once again, Brown faced opposition from many sides. This included fellow students and the wives of the faculty. Brown took it all as a challenge. After her first year, Brown had gained acceptance and finished her schooling.

==Career==
===Ordination and parish ministry===
Despite finishing her schooling, and gaining a year of preaching experience with Congregations in Marshfield and Montpelier, Vermont, Brown still met opposition to her ordination. The St. Lawrence faculty refused to ordain her. Brown decided to appeal to the Universalist Council, and traveled to nearby Malone, New York, to present her case to the Northern Universalist Association. Brown&#x27;s appeal was a simple plea for equality. One member of the Council had heard Brown&#x27;s sermon the week prior, and left his support. To the surprise of many, the council voted to ordain her. Thus on June 25, 1863, Olympia Brown became the first woman to be ordained as a minister in the Universalist Church. Historians have debated the place she holds in the history of women&#x27;s ordination. Some consider her ordination, approved by her regional Association, to be of greater significance than that of Antoinette Brown Blackwell, ordained in 1853 by the Congregational Church in South Butler, NY. Brown Blackwell did not have formal support in her denomination beyond the local congregation. Olympia Brown was the first woman to be ordained with official approval from a national denomination.

After her ordination, Brown went to Vermont, preaching in various churches. She also spent some time at home with her family in Michigan, before beginning her first pastorate in Weymouth Landing, Massachusetts. She was formally installed in July 1864, and ministered to the congregation for several years. She went on to pastor a church in Bridgeport, Connecticut, being hired by the congregation despite initial reluctance by many parishioners who did not wish to have a woman pastor. In 1878, she accepted a call to a church in Racine, Wisconsin, where she would serve as minister until 1887. In all her ministerial settings she was well respected as a preacher. She was described by a reporter for the Superior Daily Leader as &quot;the female Beecher of the rostrum.&quot; This was intended as a high compliment, as Henry Ward Beecher was widely considered to be the best preacher in the United States at the time.

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===

From Brown&#x27;s childhood and the abolition movement to Brown&#x27;s own experiences with discrimination, Brown had always been aware of the quest for equal rights. Due to Brown&#x27;s strong speaking skills and beliefs, Susan B. Anthony continually sought the involvement of Brown. With the encouragement of Lucy Stone and her husband, Henry Blackwell, Brown decided to travel to Kansas in order to speak on women&#x27;s rights. Over the course of the summer, Brown delivered more than 300 speeches despite facing many hardships. Even though this was a great experience, Brown decided to return to ministry, until a change of heart in 1887.

Now that Brown had dedicated her life to the movement, she looked to do all she could. This included forming the New England Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association, leading the Wisconsin Suffrage Association and becoming the president of the Federal Suffrage Association from 1903 to 1920.

Despite all this action, Brown saw few changes take place. Brown believed that the second generation of suffragists suffered from poor leadership and erroneously focused their efforts at the state level. It was not until 1913 when Brown was invited to join the newly formed Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, which would later be called the National Woman&#x27;s Party, by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns. This group looked to pass an amendment at the federal level and also vowed to use a more radical approach.

These new tactics led to the women&#x27;s right to vote amendment being presented to Congress and marches in front of the White House. President Wilson met the two marches in front of the White House with displeasure. As a result, these women were to be jailed. The mistreatment of these women coupled with the massive press exposure led to more support for the movement.

Eventually, Congress passed the bill. However, with ratification still needed, Brown along with others hit the campaign trail one last time. Olympia Brown&#x27;s last march was at the 1920 Republican National Convention. The 19th Amendment would finally be ratified on August 25, 1920, marking the first time that Olympia Brown along with countless other women were able to vote.

==Personal life==
Brown was married to John Henry Willis in 1873; she chose to keep her maiden name. They reared two children: Henry and Gwendolyn. Both of their children became teachers.

Brown spent her last years with her family in Racine, Wisconsin. She continued to support women&#x27;s rights and the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom.

==Death and legacy==
She died in Baltimore on October 23, 1926.

In 1963 to honor the centennial of Brown&#x27;s ordination, the Theological School of St. Lawrence University mounted a plaque at the church she pastored at in Racine, Wisconsin. The inscription concludes, &quot;The flame of her spirit still burns today.&quot; In 1989 the church was renamed the Olympia Brown Unitarian Universalist Church.

In the 1970s the Olympia Brown League was founded by Susan Hester and Fran Kaplan to help women&#x27;s name rights in Milwaukee, in response to a court decision against women seeking to keep their maiden names upon marriage; Brown had kept hers upon her marriage. Specifically, the case with that court decision was &quot;Kruzel v. Podell&quot; (1975), in which the Supreme Court of Wisconsin decided that a woman upon marriage adopts the last name of her husband by customarily using that name after marriage, but also stated that no law required her to.

An elementary school in Racine was named in Brown&#x27;s honor in 1975.

In 1999 she was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Olympia Brown&#x27;s own papers and documents relating to her work are held at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, and in the papers of the National Woman&#x27;s Party at the Library of Congress.

The Olympia Brown mystery series of books is named after her.

<text>Patrick Lane (March 26, 1939 – March 7, 2019) was a Canadian poet. He had written in several other genres, including essays, short stories, and was the author of the novel &quot;Red Dog, Red Dog&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Nelson, British Columbia, he attended high school in Vernon and had no further formal education. He first began writing poetry seriously in 1960. During his twenties, he held a series of jobs in the logging industry in the northern part of the province, working as a choker, truck driver, Industrial First Aid man, sawmill worker, and salesman, among others. In 1965, he moved to Vancouver and began to connect with other poets of his generation.

Lane, Bill Bissett and Seymour Mayne founded the small-press publisher Very Stone House in 1966.

In 1968, Lane&#x27;s first marriage ended and he moved to South America to dedicate himself completely to writing. When he returned, he remarried and established a home in the Okanagan Valley in 1972. In 1974, he and his wife moved to the Sunshine Coast.

After a second divorce in 1978, he became Writer-in-Residence at University of Manitoba, where he met fellow poet Lorna Crozier. That same year, Lane won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for his collection &quot;Poems, New and Selected&quot;.

Lane lived for many years with Crozier in Saanichton, British Columbia, where he tended a garden of which was featured on the television program &quot;Recreating Eden&quot;, and which he wrote about in the memoir &quot;There is a Season&quot;.

He participated in Dial-A-Poem Montreal from 1985 to 1987.

From 1986 to 1990, Lane taught creative writing and Canadian literature courses at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and later taught at the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia from 1991 to 2004. When he retired from formal teaching, he was still an adjunct professor at UVic and frequently led retreats and workshops for writers. In 2007, he was awarded the fourth annual Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for Literary Excellence for his lifetime contribution to literature in British Columbia. His novel &quot;Red Dog, Red Dog&quot; was published in 2008.

A recovering alcoholic and cocaine user, Lane wrote about his struggles with dependency in &quot;Addicted: Notes From the Belly of the Beast&quot;, which he co-edited with Crozier, and in &quot;There is a Season&quot;.

On November 21, 2014, Governor General David Johnston presented Patrick Lane with the Order of Canada, recognizing his more than 50 years of contribution to Canadian poetry and literature. His final collection of poems, &quot;Washita&quot;, was nominated for the 2015 Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for poetry.

He had five children, three from his first marriage and two from his second. He was the brother of poet Red Lane. He lived the latter part of his life in the Victoria, BC area and died on March 7, 2019, aged 79 .

<doc id="284398" wikidata="Q76210" url="?curid=284398" title="The Blue Lotus">
<text>The Blue Lotus () is the fifth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialised weekly from August 1934 to October 1935 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1936. Continuing where the plot of the previous story, &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, left off, the story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are invited to China in the middle of the 1931 Japanese invasion, where Tintin reveals the machinations of Japanese spies and uncovers a drug-smuggling ring.

In creating &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, Hergé exhibited a newfound emphasis on accuracy and documentation in his portrayal of foreign societies. He was heavily influenced by his close friend Zhang Chongren, a Chinese student studying in Belgium, and the work both satirises common European misconceptions about China as well as criticising the actions of the Japanese invaders. &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was a commercial success in Belgium and was soon serialised in France and Switzerland, while news of the book led to the Chinese political leader Chiang Kai-shek inviting Hergé to visit China itself. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was partially re-drawn and coloured by the cartoonist and his team of assistants; during this process a number of minor plot elements were changed. The adventure introduces the recurring characters J.M. Dawson and Chang Chong-Chen. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Critical analysis of the story has been positive, with various commentators considering it to be one of Hergé&#x27;s finest works.

==Synopsis==
:&quot;The synopsis continues a plot begun in &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;.&quot;

Staying at the palace of the Maharaja of Gaipajama in India, Tintin is approached by a visitor from Shanghai in China. The visitor supplies him with the name of Mitsuhirato, a Japanese businessman based in Shanghai while on secondment, but before finishing his message is hit by a dart dipped in Rajaijah, the &quot;poison of madness&quot;. Tintin and his fox terrier Snowy travel to Shanghai to meet Mitsuhirato, who warns them that the Maharajah is in danger and that they should return to India. Surviving several attempts on his life by mysterious assailants, Tintin attempts to leave for India by boat, but is kidnapped and brought back to China. His abductors reveal themselves as members of a secret society known as the Sons of the Dragon, who, like the Maharaja, are devoted to combating the opium trade. Their leader, Wang Chen-Yee, explains to Tintin that Mitsuhirato is both a Japanese spy and an opium smuggler, and enlists Tintin in their fight to stop him. Tintin agrees, and spies on Mitsuhirato at the Blue Lotus opium den. Following him, Tintin witnesses Mitsuhirato blowing up a Chinese railway (an action loosely based on the Mukden Incident). The Japanese government uses this as an excuse to invade Northern China, taking Shanghai under its control.

Tintin is captured by Mitsuhirato, who plans to poison him with Rajaijah. However, one of Wang&#x27;s agents swaps out the poison for coloured water, so when Tintin is &quot;poisoned&quot;, he is able to feign madness long enough to be untied and let go so he is able to escape from Mitsuhirato. Mitsuhirato later discovers the deception and convinces the Japanese military forces to put a warrant out for Tintin&#x27;s arrest. Meanwhile, Tintin enters the Shanghai International Settlement in search for Professor Fang Hsi-ying, an expert on poisons who he hopes can develop a cure for Rajaijah, but discovers that he has been kidnapped. J.M. Dawson, the Settlement&#x27;s corrupt Chief of Police, arrests Tintin and hands him over to the Japanese, who sentence him to death before he is rescued by Wang.

Travelling to Hukow to search for Fang, Tintin comes across a flood that has caused extensive damage, and rescues a young Chinese orphan Chang Chong-Chen from drowning. Chang accompanies Tintin to Hukow, where one of Mitsuhirato&#x27;s spies tries to kill Tintin but fails; they realise that it was a trap and that Fang was not there. Meanwhile, the detectives Thomson and Thompson are employed by Dawson to arrest Tintin, but fail on multiple occasions. Returning to Shanghai, Tintin intends to confront Mitsuhirato, and allows himself to be captured by him. Being held prisoner at The Blue Lotus, he discovers that Mitsuhirato is in league with the film director Rastapopoulos, who reveals that he is the leader of the international opium smuggling gang that Tintin has been pursuing in Egypt, Arabia, India, and now China. Rastapopoulos was also the man assumed to have fallen to his death during the foiled kidnapping of the Maharaja&#x27;s son. However, in accordance with Tintin&#x27;s plan, Chang and the Sons of the Dragon rescue Tintin and Fang; Rastapopoulos is arrested while Mitsuhirato commits seppuku. Tintin&#x27;s report on Mitsuhirato&#x27;s activities leads to accusations against Japan, which withdraws from the League of Nations in protest. Fang develops a cure for Rajaijah, while Wang adopts Chang as his son. Tintin and Snowy return home to Europe.

==History==

===Background===

Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was employed as editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels which was run by the &quot;Abbé&quot; Norbert Wallez. In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip for , about the exploits of fictional young Belgian reporter Tintin. Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union to act as anti-socialist propaganda for children (&quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;), to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (&quot;Tintin in America&quot;). On 24 November 1932, &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; published a fictional interview with Tintin in which the reporter announced that he would travel to China via Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, and Indochina. This plotline resulted in &quot;Tintin in the Orient&quot;, the first part of which was an &quot;Adventure&quot; set in Egypt, Arabia, and India that Hergé later titled &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;. &quot;Cigars&quot; ceased publication in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; in February 1934, and Hergé next provided the standalone story &quot;Popol out West&quot; for the newspaper. &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was the second half of the &quot;Tintin in the Orient&quot; story that Hergé had begun with &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;.

However, Hergé knew as little about China as he did about the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo. At the time most Belgians held to a negative stereotype of China, viewing it as &quot;a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, overpopulated, and inscrutable&quot;, and Hergé had long believed this view. He had included Chinese characters in two previous &quot;Adventures&quot;, in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clichés. In &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in &quot;Tintin in America&quot; he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy. Hergé learned a bit about the country from Albert Londres&#x27; book &quot;China Madness&quot;, based on Londres&#x27; experiences in the country. He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film &quot;Flüchtlinge&quot; (&quot;At the End of the World&quot;).
Learning of Hergé&#x27;s intention to set the next &quot;Adventure&quot; in China, Abbot Léon Gosset, a Roman Catholic chaplain to the Chinese students at the Catholic University of Leuven, contacted Hergé and asked him to be cautious in his depiction of the country. His students read &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; and he thought it would be counterproductive if Hergé continued to propagate negative stereotypes about the Chinese people. Hergé was sensitive to Gosset&#x27;s ideas, and Gosset proceeded to put him in touch with two of his Chinese students, Arnold Chiao Ch&#x27;eng-Chih and his wife Susan Lin. He also gave him the address of a Chinese student a year Hergé&#x27;s junior, Zhang Chongren. The pair first met on 1 May 1934, soon becoming close friends and spending every Sunday afternoon with each other for over a year. Zhang later commented that he and Hergé became akin to &quot;two brothers&quot;. A student of painting and sculpture at Brussels&#x27; Royal Museums of Fine Arts, Zhang taught Hergé about Chinese artistic styles, giving him a set of traditional Chinese brushes and explaining to him the art of painting a tree and Chinese calligraphy, alongside explaining the tenets of Taoist philosophy. Both his artistic and philosophical training under Zhang would have a profound effect on Hergé.

Hergé had also established contact with Father Édouard Neut, hosteller at the St. Andrew&#x27;s Abbey near Bruges. Neut had a special interest in China, and was excited by Hergé&#x27;s latest venture, commenting that it could contribute to &quot;a work of inter-racial understanding and true friendship between Orientals and whites&quot;. He sent him two books, Father Thadée&#x27;s &quot;Aux origines du conflict mandchou&quot; (&quot;On the Origins of the Manchu Conflict&quot;) and Zheng Zheng&#x27;s &quot;Ma Mère&quot; (&quot;My Mother&quot;), a first-hand account of Chinese family life. He also sent Hergé a 1932 article discussing the differences between Chinese and Japanese cultures. At the time, Neut was working as the assistant of Lu Zhengxiang, a former prime minister of China who had become a monk at St. Andrew&#x27;s Abbey. Mainstream Western press was broadly sympathetic to the Japanese cause, viewing them as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, a view that Hergé was to eschew.

===Original publication, 1934–35===
The comic strip began serialisation in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; on 9 August 1934 as &quot;Les Aventures De Tintin Reporter En Extrême-Orient&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter in the Far East&quot;). It began serialisation in France in &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; from 29 December 1935, and later in the Swiss magazine &quot;L&#x27;Écho Illustré&quot;. Alongside protagonists Tintin and Snowy, Hergé also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story. He also alluded to the movie that Tintin and Snowy had interrupted the filming of in &quot;Cigars&quot;, Rastapopoulos&#x27; &quot;The Sheik&#x27;s House&quot;, by having the characters watch the film during a cinema screening.
Hergé actively satirised typical European opinions of China in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. He had Thomson and Thompson dress in what they perceived as traditional Chinese costume, as Mandarins, only to stand out in stark contrast to the actual clothing worn in China. He also had Gibbons, one of the story&#x27;s antagonists, express racist attitudes toward the Chinese, and made Tintin give a speech to Chang explaining western misunderstandings of the Chinese. He took &quot;a radical view&quot; by expressing a criticism of Western activity in China&#x27;s International Settlement, depicting it as extremely corrupt and only interested in its own commercial interests. He gained much of his information on such issues from Zhang, who informed him of the political events occurring in China from a Chinese perspective. Building on this information, Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the Japanese invasion was largely accurate, although it served as an outright attack on Japanese imperialism. Hergé depicted fictionalised versions of both the real-life Mukden Incident, although he shifted its location nearer to Shanghai, and Japan&#x27;s walking out of the League of Nations. However, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; contained no mention of one of the central historical events of the period, the Long March of communist Mao Zedong.

Further devoting himself to greater accuracy, Hergé also made increasing use of photographs to draw from, such as of Chinese clothing, street scenes, and landscape. Hergé&#x27;s newfound emphasis on accuracy and documentation imbued the rest of the &quot;Adventures&quot;. While Hergé relied on nonsensical Arabic for the backgrounds in &quot;Cigars&quot;, for &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; Zhang drew many of the ideograms that appeared as street signs and advertisements throughout the story. (The accuracy of the characters varies considerably.) Among these ideograms were those of a political nature, proclaiming slogans such as &quot;Down with Imperialism&quot;, &quot;Abolish unfair treaties&quot;, and &quot;Down with Japanese merchandise&quot;. Zhang also sketched out a number of images for Hergé, such as the outline of Wang&#x27;s house. Zhang&#x27;s signature was also included twice throughout the comic, reflecting his artistic contribution; Hergé wanted to include Zhang&#x27;s name as co-author before Zhang declined, which did not happen previously and subsequently in the other books. In gratitude, Hergé created the character of Chang in honour of his friend Zhang.

Upon realising the anti-Japanese tone of the story, Japan&#x27;s diplomats stationed in Belgium issued an official complaint, conveyed to Hergé by Lieutenant-General Raoul Pontus, president of the Sino-Belgian Friendship Association. The diplomats threatened to take their complaint to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. In learning of this, Zhang congratulated Hergé, stating that it would only further expose the actions of Japan in China to further international scrutiny and would make Hergé &quot;world-famous&quot;. Hergé&#x27;s strip also came under criticism from a Belgian general, who commented: &quot;This is not a story for children ... It&#x27;s just a problem for Asia!&quot; The story was nevertheless a commercial success, and &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; organised a celebration to commemorate the return of Tintin from the Far East, sponsored by the L&#x27;Innovation and Bon Marché department stores. Taking place at the Cirque Royal, it was attended by 3000 fans of the series, many of whom were Scouts, and involved an actor portraying Tintin who accompanied Hergé, the newspaper&#x27;s staff, a contortionist and a clown.

In September 1935, Zhang returned to China at his family&#x27;s request. Hergé meanwhile set about preparing the strip for publication in book form through Casterman. Proud of this &quot;Adventure&quot;, he encouraged them to increase the level of marketing and advertising for the work. At their advice, he renamed the story from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East&quot; to &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, commenting of this new title: &quot;It is short, it sounds Chinese and it is mysterious&quot;. At Casterman&#x27;s prompting, he also inserted a number of coloured plates throughout the work, and devised a new design for the front cover. The book was finally published in October 1936. Hergé was pleased with the product, commenting: &quot;I was just bowled over! It is the height of luxury and my first thought was &#x27;It&#x27;s much too good for children!&#x27; ... I was far from expecting that&quot;. He sent a copy to Zhang, who replied to thank him. After news of its publication reached China, in 1939 political leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, asked his wife Soong Mei-ling to invite Hergé to visit them there, although he was unable to do so due to the impending Second World War. He finally took up her offer in 1973, visiting her on the island of Taiwan.

===Second version, 1946===
In the 1940s and 1950s, when Hergé&#x27;s popularity had increased, he and his team at Studios Hergé redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures in colour using the (&quot;clear line&quot;) drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. The Studios reformatted and coloured &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; in 1946. Little was actually changed for the 1946 edition, although many of the backgrounds were embellished. Minor alterations included replacing three highland Scotsmen who briefly featured in the story with three Sikhs. The map that appears on the opening page was made smaller, while a reference to Sir Malcolm Campbell was removed. The European Palace Hotel was renamed The Continental, while Gibbons&#x27; company was also renamed from the Americano-Anglo Chinese Company Limited to American and Chinese Steel Incorporated, and the drug smuggling ship known as the S.S. &quot;City of Doodlecastle&quot; was renamed the S.S. &quot;Harika Maru&quot;.

===Later publications===
Both Rastapopoulos and Dawson reappeared in the series 20 years later in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;. Casterman republished the original black-and-white version in 1979 in a French-language collected volume with &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, the second part of the collection. In 1985, Casterman published a facsimile version of the original. Meanwhile, Methuen, the British publisher of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, felt that the story was dated, and only published &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; in 1983, the year of Hergé&#x27;s death. The translation into English was undertaken by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, although it lost the English accent of the British troops which was conveyed in the original French. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; also became popular in Japan, something Michael Farr thought indicated that the Japanese had not taken offence to Hergé&#x27;s portrayal of them in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. After Hergé&#x27;s death, the original illustrated manuscript of &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was discovered at Studio Hergé, and was subsequently exhibited as the centrepiece of an exhibit commemorating the 60th anniversary of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

==== Auction of draft cover ====
The first draft of the cover to &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was given by Hergé in 1936 to Jean-Paul Casterman, the son of Louis Casterman, Hergé’s editor. Jean-Paul Casterman folded the drawing and put in a drawer. It stayed in the drawer until 1981, when Jean-Paul Casterman retrieved it and asked Hergé to sign it. It was auctioned on January 14, 2021, and proceeds were &quot;more than three million euros&quot;.

==Critical analysis==
&quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; is widely regarded as one of the best Tintin adventures. Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier commented that &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was &quot;unarguably Hergé&#x27;s first masterpiece&quot;. They felt that for the first time in the series, &quot;one senses that the story has become important&quot; as Tintin first expresses &quot;a purpose, a mission&quot; to his adventure. Commenting on the character Chang, they thought that he was an &quot;endearing personality&quot; despite having little relevance to the plot, also believing that Dawson and Gibbons were the most loathsome characters in the &quot;Adventure&quot;. They compared the scene in which the Japanese invaded China with that in &quot;Tintin in America&quot; where the U.S. army force Native Americans off their land, and praised the linear illustrations of the story, although also opined that the original black-and-white version was better than its colour counterpart. Overall, they awarded &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; four stars out of five.

Harry Thompson noted that some people believed that Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the Japanese as buck-toothed and inherently violent in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was racist. He nevertheless thought that these accusations &quot;stupidly&quot; missed &quot;the point of the story&quot;, which was to counter widespread racist attitudes toward East Asians among Belgians. Due to the inclusion of actual historical events, he thought that the comic lacked the &quot;timelessness&quot; of other &quot;Adventures&quot; but that for 1934 it was &quot;a marvelous piece of comic strip art&quot;. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline thought that the book combined &quot;social realism&quot; with the spirit present in the work of Charles Dickens and Alexandre Dumas.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters thought that there was an obvious difference in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; before and after &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, and that it represented &quot;an essential turning point both graphically and ideologically&quot; as Hergé shifted from his former &quot;classically right-wing&quot; ideas. Also feeling that the work was &quot;exceptionally moving,&quot; he noted that &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was far from &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; in its attitude to non-Europeans, while other Belgian comic strips like &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; and &quot;Buck Danny&quot; would continue to perpetuate negative stereotypes of East Asians for decades. Elsewhere, he stated that it was the first &quot;Adventure&quot; where Hergé &quot;really took control&quot; of the story, also opining that it was the &quot;most politically involved&quot; entity in the series.

Michael Farr stated that there was a &quot;general agreement&quot; that &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was Hergé&#x27;s first masterpiece, being &quot;better planned&quot; than its predecessors and for the first time having &quot;a carefully devised structure&quot;. At the same time he thought that it retained the best qualities of the earlier works. Thinking it &quot;much more serious&quot; than Tintin&#x27;s prior &quot;Adventures&quot;, he nevertheless thought it &quot;no less enjoyable&quot;, being the first story to bring &quot;emotion and tragedy&quot; to the series. Farr thought that Hergé&#x27;s &quot;total absorption&quot; in his subject resulted in him gaining an &quot;extraordinary feel&quot; for it and allowed him to foresee future political events in China much like a &quot;finely tuned&quot; political commentator. He singled out the depiction of the Mukden Incident for particular praise, thinking it &quot;a marvellous example of political satire&quot;. Philippe Goddin thought that this depiction of the build-up to invasion was &quot;brilliantly&quot; done, also comparing it to the scene of ethnic cleansing in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy thought that &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; showed evidence of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;left-wing counter-tendency&quot; that rejected his earlier right-wing worldview. He believed that this was partly due to the influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Hergé&#x27;s &quot;European absolutism&quot;, and overall thought of it as &quot;the most visually rich of all the Tintin books&quot;. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi – who was poisoned with Raijaijah – inverted &quot;the model of justice ruling the world of the Good&quot;. He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have &quot;feline suppleness, a devotion to good causes, and the patience of an animal stalking its prey&quot;. He furthermore argued that Didi&#x27;s desire to behead people when under the poison&#x27;s influence expressed his Oedipus complex and was a substitute for castration.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was adapted into a 1991 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin. In March 2013, Steven Spielberg said that &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; might be the basis for the third Tintin film in his film series that began with &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011).

<text>Freising is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. Following a recent ranking of the German magazine &quot;Focus-Money&quot; comparing all German districts it is number one concerning economic growth abilities. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Kelheim, Landshut, Erding, Munich, Dachau and Pfaffenhofen.
The district is located north of the Munich metropolitan area. The Isar and Amper rivers run in parallel from southwest to northeast. North of the rivers there is the Hallertau, a hilly region mainly used for growing hop.

==History==
In the Holy Roman Empire, Freising was a clerical state ruled by the bishops. In 1803, when the clerical states of Germany were dissolved, the region was annexed by Bavaria.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria
* the rose from the arms of the medieval county of Moosburg
* The &quot;Freising Moor&#x27;s head&quot;

===The Freising Moor&#x27;s head===
This is a controversial charge in the coat of arms, which could represent one of many different persons:

* One of the three Magi (one of them is shown as a moor)
* Saints who were, or probably were, moors
** St. Mauritius
** St. Zeno
** St. Sigismund (mixed up with St. Mauritius)
Or just that a black Moor king.
* St. Corbinian, who was not a moor, but whose pictures might have become darker over time.
* Other person or meaning lost in time

There is a crown on the moor&#x27;s head, which probably indicated that the territory of the Bishop of Freising was autonomous.

<text>Evelyn Lau (; born July 2, 1971) is a Canadian novelist, poet, and short story writer.

== Biography ==
Evelyn Lau was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, on July 2, 1971, to Chinese-Canadian parents from Hong Kong. Lau attended Templeton Secondary School in Vancouver.

Evelyn Lau began publishing poetry at the age of 12. At the age of 13 she won a essay writing contest hosted by the Vancouver Sun, she was awarded a meeting with Pope John Paul II. In March 1986, at age 14, Lau left home due to parental objection to her pursuit of poetry. She spent the next two years living itinerantly in Vancouver as a homeless person living in group homes, friends&#x27; houses, and apartments. She also became involved with drug abuse during this time and supported herself through prostitution. She also attempted suicide twice.

A diary she kept from March 22nd, 1986 to January 20th, 1988 was published in 1989 as &quot;Runaway: Diary of a Street Kid&quot; The book was a critical and commercial success; Lau received praise for frankly chronicling her relationships with manipulative older men, the life and habits of a group of anarchists with whom she stayed immediately after leaving home, her experiences with a couple from Boston who smuggled her into the United States, her abuse of various drugs, and her relationship with British Columbia&#x27;s child support services. The diary was adapted as a film &quot;The Diary of Evelyn Lau&quot; (1993), starring Canadian actress Sandra Oh.

Lau had a well-publicized romantic relationship with W. P. Kinsella, a University of Victoria creative writing professor and poet more than 30 years her senior. After she published a personal essay in 1997 about the relationship, Kinsella sued her for libel. (&quot;Me and W.P.&quot; won a Western Magazine Award for Human Experience, and was shortlisted for the Gold Award for Best Article).

Her work in magazines has won four Western Magazine Awards and a National Magazine Award; she also received the Air Canada Award, the Vantage Women of Originality Award, the ACWW Community Builders Award, and the Mayor&#x27;s Arts Award for Literary Arts. Her poems were selected for inclusion in Best American Poetry (1992) and Best Canadian Poetry (2009, 2010, 2011, 2016). Lau has also worked as writer-in-residence at the University of British Columbia, Kwantlen University, and Vancouver Community College, and was Distinguished Visiting Writer at the University of Calgary.

Lau lives in Vancouver, where she is a manuscript consultant in Simon Fraser University&#x27;s Writing and Publishing Program. On Oct. 14, 2011, Lau was named the poet laureate for the city of Vancouver. She is the third poet to hold this honorary position; her plan is to offer &#x27;poet-in-residence consultations with aspiring poets&#x27;. As of fall 2023, Lau is the writer in residence at Langara College in Vancouver, BC.

<doc id="284410" wikidata="Q3339833" url="?curid=284410" title="Nickelodeon Universe">
<text>Nickelodeon Universe is the name of two indoor amusement parks located at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota and American Dream in East Rutherford, New Jersey, with a third location under construction at the Mall of China in Chongqing, China. The parks consist of attractions and rides based on Nickelodeon’s popular franchises. The amusement parks are owned and operated by the Triple Five Group with licensing rights from Paramount Global, which owns Nickelodeon.

==Mall of America==
===History===
====Camp Snoopy====
The park was originally known as Knott&#x27;s Camp Snoopy, and later, simply Camp Snoopy, and was themed around the Charles M. Schulz &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip characters. Camp Snoopy themed areas are still located at Cedar Fair Amusement Company&#x27;s parks. Camp Snoopy was never aggressively themed; the park had a very outdoors and woodsy feel with more subtle references to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise. Much of the original theming in the Camp Snoopy fountain and all around the park was already toned down by the time the rights to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters were lost. Theming that was removed from the park prematurely and was never replaced includes various kites near the ceiling, Charlie Brown and Lucy playing baseball above the Sports Grill restaurant (although their baseball remained suspended in the air afterwards), theming in Snoopy fountain, the retheming of Snoopy Boutique, Snoopy Bouncer, the Snoopy Shop and much smaller theming. On April 7, 1998, New Horizon Kids Quest, Inc. opened a Kids Quest hourly child care facility in Knott&#x27;s Camp Snoopy. It incorporated and served children ages six weeks to twelve years until its removal in 2007. It is now the &quot;Dutchman’s Deck Adventure Course&quot; ropes course, slides and zip line.

In 2005, there were plans to revitalize the Camp Snoopy image and a new logo was introduced in October, called the &quot;roller coaster logo&quot; to replace the &quot;canoe logo&quot;. However, this did not last long, as there were even bigger and unexpected changes coming within the next few months.

====The Park at Mall of America====
On January 9, 2006, Mall of America management announced that talks between MOA and Cedar Fair (which owns the national rights to amusement-park branding of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; license) had broken down, primarily over the mall&#x27;s rights to effectively market its park within and outside the United States, and effective January 19, the park&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; branding would end, the park being temporarily renamed The Park at MOA while new branding was being applied. All traces of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; branding was removed, some very sloppily, although the gift shops were allowed to continue selling &quot;Peanuts&quot; merchandise without the Camp Snoopy label. The inflatable Snoopy character was removed and it took several months before it was finally replaced by a generic tree house inflatable. The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera was the final film played in the Mystery Mine Ride, with the Mystery Mine Ride closing permanently in 2007. Many other landmarks in the park were either replaced by generic landmarks or not replaced at all.

====Nickelodeon Universe====

On November 8, 2005, Viacom filed a trademark for Nickelodeon Universe.
The park&#x27;s new licensing deal and name, &quot;Nickelodeon Universe&quot;, was announced on July 25, 2007. Construction began on August 27, 2007, work was completed in sections so 80 percent to 90 percent of the park remained accessible at all times. Nickelodeon Universe was completed on March 15, 2008. New rides include SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter 410 roller coaster themed after the Nickelodeon show &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, the Splat-O-Sphere, a Moser&#x27;s Rides drop tower in the center of the park, the Avatar Airbender, a surf-rider attraction located in the center of the park as well and BrainSurge which is on the side of the park. The shooting gallery beneath the Ripsaw and Pepsi Orange Streak roller coaster was gutted and was replaced by Rugrats Reptarmobiles. The Mystery Mine Ride was completely demolished to make way for SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge. This site also included an Old Time Photography studio and restrooms. Old Time Photography relocated into the mall (but not within the park) and restrooms did not return in this section of the park. Levy Restaurants partnered with Nickelodeon Universe to include a themed restaurant at the park. The restaurant was called EATS and was located in the former Park at MOA food court. When the partnership ended, the EATS area closed and was replaced with a butterfly display. In 2014, a Hard Rock Cafe opened on the site where EATS once stood.

On March 12, 2008, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; reported that the price of ride points, daily wristbands and, in particular, annual passes, would take a significant price hike once the park transitioned to Nickelodeon Universe. The price for an annual pass, which had remained $99 per year since the park opened in 1992, would increase to $250, and daily wristbands would be raised from $24.95 to $29.95. They eventually rose to $32.99 in 2014. In 2017, prices rose to where they currently stand, at $35.99 for a daily wristband. In April 2015, the price for the annual pass dropped to $139. In November 2021, Nickelodeon Universe announced the new annual pass program which has 3 different annual passes: Level 1 is Explorer which costs $175 but only valid on the weekdays, which is Monday through Thursday, Level 2 is Adventurer costs $250 but only works on any day of the week &amp; Level 3 is Thrill Seeker costs $350 and it has all access all the time. Some denounced the price increases as being unjustifiably high when compared to other parks, such as local park Valleyfair at $79.95–$99.95. Others defended the pricing as necessary to accommodate the millions of dollars of investment needed to rebrand the park as Nickelodeon Universe.

On March 17, 2020, Nickelodeon Universe closed along with the rest of Mall of America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the mall re-opened in June, Nickelodeon Universe didn&#x27;t re-open until August. As a result of restrictions put in place by the Minnesota state government, Nickelodeon Universe was only permitted to re-open to a capacity of 250. Thus, the previous ticketing model—where entry to the park was free and patrons could either pay for rides individually, or unlimited–ride tickets that valid for the entire day—was temporarily suspended. Patrons then had only the option of a ticket that was valid for two hours from when it was first scanned at a ride; persons not riding were required to have a paid ticket to enter the park, albeit at a reduced cost. Capacity restrictions eventually loosened into the spring, resulting in the return of all-day unlimited-ride wristbands and point passes. The park reopened to full capacity on May 28, 2021.

===Accidents===

* On August 1, 1998, a 12-year-old boy, David Craig of Cable, Wisconsin, was killed after he fell off the Log Chute. When the boat neared the top of the chute, he began to panic and reached outside of the log to grab a railing. The ride stopped, but the log had already begun its descent down the major drop. Losing his grip, Craig fell off the chute, falling onto the landscaping rocks. He then died as a result of his injuries. Hopkins Rides, the manufacturer of the ride, inspected it and found it was in proper working order. It was Camp Snoopy&#x27;s first fatal accident.
* On Saturday, August 15, 1998, an 8-year-old girl died of a heart attack after she rode the &quot;Screaming Yellow Eagle&quot; (later known as &quot;Danny Phantom Ghost Zone&quot;), a rotating platform ride from Chance Rides. Her parents said she died from a heart attack because she had a history of heart problems for five years before her death. The ride was operating properly.

== American Dream ==
===History===
In September 2016, the Triple Five Group announced that a second Nickelodeon Universe amusement park would fill the 8-acre indoor amusement park space at American Dream, which will feature two world record-holding roller coasters. TMNT Shellraiser, a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter, would hold the record for the steepest roller coaster drop at 121.5 degrees, and is based on a model seen in Japan. The second coaster, a spinning coaster called the Shredder, consists of four-passenger cars that spin on a vertical axis as it progresses down the coaster&#x27;s track, and is the world&#x27;s tallest and longest free spinning coaster, at 1,600 feet.

On March 13, 2020, Triple Five announced that the mall would be closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the opening of retail shops and DreamWorks Water Park would be delayed.

On April 6, 2020, American Dream changed from a mix of 55% entertainment-related tenants and 45% retailers to roughly 70% entertainment and 30% retail. As of April 10, 2020, no retailers had backed out of American Dream. American Dream said it will add eight more rides to the Nickelodeon Universe theme park, building on its early success.

On September 3, 2020, Triple Five announced that on October 1, American Dream would reopen its amusement park, water park, ice rink, and mini-golf arcade, each of which would limit patrons to 25% of capacity.

===Upcoming Chongqing, China location===
A third Nickelodeon Universe theme park is currently under construction for the Mall of China in Chongqing, China. Concept artwork that was released during the theme park&#x27;s announcement on July 26, 2018 showcases rides that are at the American Dream location, as well as several new attractions. Construction was briefly paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the theme park was originally slated for a December 2020 opening, its construction status and a new opening timeframe are unknown.

===Cancelled New Orleans location===
On August 18, 2009, Nickelodeon and Southern Star Amusement announced that a Nickelodeon Universe location would be built in New Orleans, Louisiana to replace the former Six Flags New Orleans that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and would open by around the end of 2010. It was set to be the first outdoor Nickelodeon Universe theme park, but on November 9, 2009, Nickelodeon announced that it had ended the licensing agreement with Southern Star Amusements.

==2020 temporary closures==
The two Nickelodeon Universe theme parks in Minnesota and New Jersey were temporarily closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nickelodeon Universe reopened at Mall of America on August 10, 2020, while its park at American Dream reopened on October 1, 2020.

<text>Cadzow Castle, now in ruins, was constructed between 1500 and 1550 at a site one mile south-east of the centre of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. The earlier medieval settlement of Hamilton was formerly known as &quot;Cadzow&quot; or &quot;Cadyou&quot; (Middle Scots: ), until it was renamed in 1455 in honour of James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton. The castle sits above a gorge overlooking the Avon Water in what is now Chatelherault Country Park, but was previously the hunting and pleasure grounds of the duke of Hamilton&#x27;s estate of Hamilton Palace - this area being known as Hamilton High Parks. The ruin is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==History==

===The early castle===
The ancient kings of Strathclyde are believed to have had a hunting lodge at Cadzow, prior to that kingdom&#x27;s assimilation into Scotland in the 12th century. The original Cadzow Castle is believed to have been built in the 12th century on an earlier high status site, as an occasional royal residence for King David I (1124–1153). Royal charters of David&#x27;s reign were issued from here as early as 1139. His successors Alexander II, Alexander III and others down to Robert the Bruce also used the castle, it is believed primarily as a hunting lodge due to the close proximity of the forested parkland, itself part of the once more extensive royal forest of the Clyde Valley. Archaeologists favour the site of Hamilton Motte adjacent to the original settlement and religious foundation, and known latterly as Hamilton Motte. It is possible that the earlier Cadzow Castle was on an alternative site at , now known as Castlehill, although the area is now a housing estate, and the site is some distance from the settlement of Cadzow, and of dubious topographical prospects for such a fortification.

The estate of Cadzow was divided in 1222, with Cadzow Castle passing to the Comyns. Following the forfeiture of their lands for supporting John Balliol, the estate was granted by Robert the Bruce to Walter FitzGilbert de Hambeldon in the early 14th century. FitzGilbert was ennobled as the first Baron of Cadzow, and is the ancestor of the dukes of Hamilton. He constructed another fortification, which may represent the motte near the town (), which remains, adjacent to the M74 motorway.

===The 16th-century castle===
The present castle was built around 1530 by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, who also constructed nearby Craignethan Castle. James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran was confined here in April 1566 after four years in Edinburgh Castle, for an alleged plot against Mary, Queen of Scots.

Following her escape from Lochleven Castle in 1568, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed here. As a result it was destroyed by forces of the Earl of Mar, regent for James VI, in the late 16th century, as retaliation against the Hamiltons for their support of Mary. It was partially rebuilt in the 18th century, to serve as a folly within the duke&#x27;s park.

==The castle today==
The site is now owned and managed by Historic Environment Scotland. There is no public access to the ruins, as the structure is unstable, and largely supported by scaffolding. Footpaths within the country park allow visitors to view the ruin. The Duke&#x27;s Bridge, built high across the Avon Gorge, offers the most dramatic view of the ruins above the wooded gorge. A series of excavations, sponsored by Historic Scotland, took place at the castle between 2000 and 2003 and demonstrated that no evidence was found to support an early medieval fortification at the site, nor any large settlement to compete with the traditional medieval settlement of Cadzow now adjacent to the M74 motorway, and in later centuries called the Netherton to distinguish it from the &#x27;Hitoun&#x27; of Cadzow.

<doc id="284434" wikidata="Q2303559" url="?curid=284434" title="Sorry! (game)">
<text>Sorry! is a board game that is based, like the older game Ludo, on the ancient Indian cross and circle game &quot;Pachisi&quot;. Players move their three or four pieces around the board, attempting to get all of their pieces &quot;home&quot; before any other player. Originally manufactured by W.H. Storey &amp; Co in England and now by Hasbro, &quot;Sorry!&quot; is marketed for two to four players, ages 6 and up. The game title comes from the many ways in which a player can negate the progress of another, while issuing an apologetic &quot;Sorry!&quot;

== Objective ==
The objective is to be the first player to get all three (four for the modern version) of their colored pawns from their start space, around the board to their &quot;home&quot; space. The pawns are normally moved in a clockwise direction but can be moved backward if directed. Movement of pawns is directed by the drawing of a card.

The board game is laid out in a square with 16 spaces per side, with each player assigned their own coloured Start location and Home locations offset towards the centre, one per side. Four five-square paths, one per colour, lead from the common outer path towards a player&#x27;s Home and are designated their &quot;Safety Zone&quot;. On each side are two &quot;Slides&quot;, grouping four or five spaces each.

Older versions of &quot;Sorry!&quot; contain a coloured &quot;diamond space&quot; directly one space back from each start square; a pawn of the diamond&#x27;s colour may not move forward over this square. Instead, a pawn of that colour must diverge from the outer space square towards their &quot;Home&quot;. The diamond space and corresponding rule were removed from subsequent editions.

== History ==

William Henry Storey of Southend-on-Sea filed for a patent for the game in England, where it was registered as a trade mark on 21 May 1929 (UK number 502898). It was subsequently sold in the United Kingdom by Waddingtons, the British games manufacturer who sold it from 1934.

In the United States, was filed for &quot;Sorry!&quot; on 4 Aug 1930 by William Henry Storey. A Canadian patent followed in 1932. The US patent was issued on 11 April 1933. &quot;Sorry!&quot; was adopted by Parker Brothers in 1934. Hasbro now continuously publishes it.

== Classic rules ==
Each player chooses four pawns of one color and places them in their Start. One player is selected to play first.

Each player, in turn, draws one card from the deck and follows its instructions. To begin the game, all of a player&#x27;s four pawns are in Start and a player can only move them out onto the rest of the board if they draw a 1, 2 or &quot;Sorry!&quot; card. A 1 or a 2 places a pawn on the space directly outside of Start (a 2 does not entitle the pawn to move a second space). One must move a pawn if possible; if multiple options are available, they may choose which one to take. If there are no available movements, their turn is forfeited.

A pawn can jump over any other pawn during its move, counting it as one space. However, if a pawn that lands on a square occupied by another player&#x27;s pawn, the pawn already occupying that square is &quot;bumped&quot; back to its own Start. Players can not bump their own pawns back to Start; if the only way to complete a move would result in a player bumping their own pawn, the player&#x27;s pawns remain in place and the player loses their turn.

If a pawn lands at the start of a slide (except those of its own color), either by direct movement or as the result of a switch from an 11 card or a Sorry card, it immediately &quot;slides&quot; to the last square of the slide. (In the 2013 version, each slide contains three colors which are different from the color of that board side, so one may slide at the start of a slide with their color.) All pawns on all spaces of the slide (including those belonging to the sliding player) are sent back to their respective Starts.

The last five squares before each player&#x27;s Home are &quot;Safety Zones&quot;, and are specially colored corresponding to the colors of the Homes they lead to. Access is limited to pawns of the same color. Pawns inside the Safety Zones are immune to being bumped by opponents&#x27; pawns or being switched with opponents&#x27; pawns via 11 or Sorry! cards. However, if a pawn is forced via a 10 or 4 card to move backward out of the Safety Zone, it is no longer considered &quot;safe&quot; and may be bumped by or switched with opponents&#x27; pawns as usual until it re-enters the Safety Zone.

A pawn may only move to its Home space by exact count; that is, only cards with the correct number of required spaces can bring the pawn Home. Any pawn that is in its Home space stays there for the rest of the game. The first player to get all of their pawns in their Home space wins.

=== Classic cards and function ===
The modern deck contains 45 cards: there are five 1 cards as well as four each of the other cards (&quot;Sorry!&quot;, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12). The 6s or 9s are omitted to avoid confusion with each other. The first edition of the game had 44 cards (four of each) and the extra 1 card was soon introduced as an option for quicker play. A 1996 board from Waddingtons had five of each card.

Cards are annotated with the following actions:
== Strategy ==
The 7 can be split; it is often possible to do so such that one of the pieces ends up on a slide, thus increasing the value of this card. It also provides an additional opportunity for pawns to get Home, so long as there&#x27;s another pawn on the board to use up the remaining spaces.

All other things being equal, moves that cause a pawn to end up in front of an opponent&#x27;s start square are poor choices, due to the high number of cards that allow that opponent to enter. Some feel that leaving a pawn on one&#x27;s own square just outside &quot;Start&quot; (also known as the &quot;Dot&quot;) is a poor position to be in since new pawns are blocked from entering play.

There are numerous strategies and tactics employed by skilled players. One such strategy is to leave the last pawn in the &quot;Start&quot; square and move the other pawns around the board while waiting for a &quot;Sorry!&quot; card.

Due to the 11 (switching places), 4 (moving backwards, as noted above), and &quot;Sorry!&quot; (allowing the player to send virtually any pawn back to its start) cards, the lead in the game can change dramatically in a short amount of time; players are very rarely so far behind as to be completely out of the game. This should be considered when playing a &quot;Sorry!&quot; or an 11.

Leaving one of your pawns near your start space will allow you to move backwards and make it into your safety zone or close enough without having to go all around the board.

Slowing the game down is a risky yet effective move when given the opportunity. Essentially, when a player has the chance to switch with or hit the apparent leader, even though the move will not be to the player&#x27;s immediate advancement around the board, the move should be made to keep the leader out of &quot;Safety&quot; and more importantly, out of &quot;Home&quot;.

== Official variants ==
=== Point-Scoring Sorry! ===
The 1939 edition of the game includes &quot;Point-Scoring Sorry!&quot;, a variant where the game is scored at the end. The game also gives players a hand of cards, each player being dealt five at the start of the game. On a player&#x27;s turn, they play one card from their hand to determine their move, and then draw a replacement card from the remaining deck. If a player cannot play any of their cards, they may discard a card and draw a replacement.

At the end of the game, each player scores a point for every man they got home. The winner also scores one point for every man their opponents had got home, and a bonus of either 24 (if no opponent has a man home), 16 (if no opponent has more than one man home) or 8 (if no opponent has more than two men home).

=== Teams ===
Players can elect to play the game in two teams of two. The team pairings are always colours on opposite sides of the board (i.e. Red and Yellow vs. Blue and Green). The game is then played as if two players had eight pawns each: for example, the yellow player may move a red pawn for any legal move. A 7 card could be split between a yellow pawn and a red one but can still be split between no more than two pieces. However, a partner&#x27;s pawns are not immune to bumps: if yellow were to draw a &quot;Sorry!&quot; card with only red pawns on the board, or land on a red pawn&#x27;s occupied space, yellow would have to bump its teammate.

Once one of the partners has played all of their pieces into home, they continue to draw and play cards on their turn, if possible, for their partner. The first partnership to play all eight pieces in its home wins.

=== Sorry! with Fire and Ice Power-Ups ===
In the 2013 edition, several rules were changed. Two additional items known as Fire and Ice were added, and depending on which card is drawn, can be placed on certain pawns on the board, modifying the playing rules for those pawns. In short, fire gives a pawn the ability to move ahead quickly before the player&#x27;s turn, and ice stops a pawn from being moved (or removed from play) at all.

Furthermore, each player only has three pawns. A pawn can be moved out from Start upon any positive number card. A &quot;Sorry!&quot; card gives the alternative option of moving forward 4 spaces. The 2 card no longer allows one to pull another card.

== Video games ==
An electronic gaming version of &quot;Sorry!&quot; was released in 1998 as a &quot;Sorry!&quot; computer game. Also, a handheld version was released in 1996.

In the &quot;Hoyle Table Games&quot; collection of computer games, the game &quot;Bump &#x27;Em&quot; is similar to &quot;Sorry!&quot; Pawns are represented as bumper cars, and the board follows a path akin to a freeway cloverleaf instead of a regular square. There are no partnerships allowed.

== &quot;Sorry! Express&quot; ==

Parker Brothers has released a travel version called &quot;Sorry! Express&quot;. The game consists of three dice, four home bases, a start base, and sixteen pawns, four in each color. Up to four players can play this game. To play, each player takes a home base and sets it on a different color and all of the pawns are put on the start base no matter how many people are playing. The first person rolls all three dice and gets one of four possibilities for each die:

# Color pawn – The player takes the corresponding color pawn from the start base and, if it matches up with the color of their home base, puts it in their home section. If not, it is put in their waiting area. When there are no more pawns of a particular color in the Start base and a player rolls that same color, he can take that color pawn from another player&#x27;s waiting area, &quot;not&quot; their Home section.
# Sorry! – Take a pawn from the home section of one player&#x27;s home base and keep it.
# Wild Pawn – The player may take any color pawn from the Start base or waiting areas (not the Home section of another player) and keep it.
# Slide – Change either one&#x27;s own Home section or someone else&#x27;s Home section to a different color.

The first person to get four pawns of the same color in their home section wins.

In 2021, Hasbro re-released the game under the name &quot;Sorry! Diced!&quot;.

== &quot;Sorry! Not Sorry!&quot; ==
&quot;Sorry! Not Sorry!&quot; is an adult-themed edition of &quot;Sorry!&quot; which consisted of the classic game, but added several cards each containing a &quot;Have you ever...?&quot; question. Upon drawing, the player must ask an opponent the fill-in-the-blank question printed on the card. If the opponent answered yes, both the player and opponent move six spaces; if the answer is no, then they can only move three spaces.

This game was part of Hasbro&#x27;s collection of parody versions of their classic games, which included &quot;The Game of Life&quot;, &quot;Operation&quot;, and &quot;Clue&quot;, which were respectively retitled &quot;The Game of Life: Quarter Life Crisis&quot;, &quot;Botched Operation&quot;, and &quot;Clue: What Happened Last Night? Lost in Vegas&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Sorry!&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, praising it as an &quot;old classic in the pachisi mold&quot; that was &quot;Especially recommended for family play&quot; even though &quot;The title gives us cause for regret&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Sorry!&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, praising it as an &quot;exciting race game, ideal for family play&quot; that is &quot;not as mindless as it may appear&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Sorry!&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, noting that many of the movement cards &quot;give interesting options&quot; and that &quot;The game is never dull, and is never decided until the last play.&quot;

<text>&quot;High We Exalt Thee, Realm of the Free&quot; is the national anthem of Sierra Leone. Written by Clifford Nelson Fyle and composed by John Akar in a nationwide competition, it was adopted in 1961 when the country became independent from the United Kingdom, replacing &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;. The Constitution of Sierra Leone, 1991, makes it the responsibility of every citizen of Sierra Leone to &quot;respect its ideals and its institutions&quot;, including the national anthem.

==Lyrics==
The anthem consists of three verses, each ending with the phrase &quot;Land that we love, our Sierra Leone.&quot;

<text>Irving Peter Layton, OC (March 12, 1912 – January 4, 2006) was a Romanian-born Canadian poet. He was known for his &quot;tell it like it is&quot; style which won him a wide following but also made him enemies. As T. Jacobs notes in his biography (2001), Layton fought Puritanism throughout his life:
==Life==

===Early life===
Irving Layton was born on March 12, 1912, as Israel Pincu Lazarovitch in Târgu Neamţ to Romanian Jewish parents, Moses and Klara (née Moscovitch) Lazarovitch. He migrated with his family to Montreal, Quebec in 1913, where they lived in the impoverished St. Urbain Street neighbourhood, later made famous by the novels of Mordecai Richler. There, Layton and his family (his father died when Irving was 13) faced daily struggles with, among others, Montreal&#x27;s French Canadians, who were uncomfortable with the growing numbers of Jewish newcomers. Layton, however, identified himself not as an observant Jew but rather as a freethinker.

Layton graduated from Alexandra Elementary School and attended Baron Byng High School, where his life was changed when he was introduced to such poets as Tennyson, Walter Scott, Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley; the novelists Jane Austen and George Eliot; the essayists Francis Bacon, Oliver Goldsmith, Samuel Johnson, and Jonathan Swift; and also Shakespeare and Darwin. He was befriended by David Lewis and became very interested in politics and social theory. He joined the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League or YPSL (commonly pronounced &quot;Yipsel&quot;), which Lewis led. He began reading Karl Marx and Nietzsche. His activities in YPSL were deemed a threat to the high school administration, and he was asked to leave before graduating in 1930. It was Lewis who introduced Layton to A. M. Klein. Lewis asked Klein to be Layton&#x27;s Latin tutor so he could pass the junior matriculation exams. Lewis gave him $10 to pay the fee for the exam and he passed. It was also during his time with Klein that he became interested in the sound of poetry.
Klein and I met once weekly at Fletcher&#x27;s Field just across from the YHMA on Mt.Royal Avenue, and I vividly recall the first lesson: Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Book II:I
 ...hearing Klein roll off the Virgilian hexameters in a beautiful orotund voice that rose above the traffic, I think it was then that I realized how lovely and very moving the sound of poetry could be. I must confess my Latin wasn&#x27;t sufficient to appreciate the sense that Virgil was making with his marvelous hexameters, but Klein&#x27;s zeal and enthusiasm, his forceful delivery, his very genuine love of language, of poetry, all came through to me at that time. And I think that was most fortunate for me. ...
Klein published Layton&#x27;s first poem in &quot;The McGilliad&quot;, the underground campus journal he was editing at McGill University.

===Emerging poet: the 1930s and 1940s===
Despite Layton&#x27;s limited educational opportunities, his lack of a high school diploma, and his limited finances, he enrolled in Macdonald College (McGill) in 1934 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture.

While in college, he was well-known in artistic circles for his anti-bourgeois attitudes and his criticism of politics. He quickly found that his true interest was poetry, so he pursued a career as a poet, and soon became friends with the emerging young poets of his day, including fellow Canadian poets John Sutherland, Raymond Souster, and Louis Dudek. In the 1940s, Layton and his fellow Canadian poets rejected the older generation of poets, as well as critics Northrop Frye; their efforts helped define the tone of the post-war generation of poets in Canada. Essentially, they argued that English Canadian poets should set their own style, independent of British styles and influences, and should reflect the social realities of the day.

In 1936 Layton met Faye Lynch, whom he married in 1938. When Layton graduated from Macdonald College in 1939, he moved with Faye to Halifax, where he worked odd jobs, including a stint as a Fuller Brush salesman. Soon disenchanted with his life, Layton decided to return to Montreal. He began teaching English to recent immigrants to make ends meet and continued doing so for many years.

Indecisive about his future and enraged by Hitler&#x27;s violence toward Jews and destruction of European culture, Layton enlisted in the Canadian army in 1942. While training at Petawawa, Layton met Betty Sutherland, an accomplished painter (and later poet), and a half-sister to actor Donald Sutherland. Layton soon divorced Faye and married Betty. They had two children together: Max Reuben (1946) and Naomi Parker (1950). In 1943 Layton was given an honourable discharge from the army and returned to Montreal, where he became involved with several literary magazines including the seminal &quot;Northern Review&quot;, which he co-edited with John Sutherland.

Layton&#x27;s involvement with David Lewis and the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League developed into activism with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Lewis was the National Secretary at the time). Because of his YPSL activities Layton was blacklisted in the 1930s and banned from entering the United States for the next two decades. While for a time he still considered himself a Marxist, he became anti-Communist at the lectures Lewis gave at YPSL and broke with many on the left with his support of the Vietnam War.

===1950s: International &quot;stardom&quot;===
&quot;Of the poets who emerged in Montréal during this period,&quot; of the early 1950s, &quot;Layton was the most outspoken and flamboyant. His satire was generally directed against bourgeois dullness, and his famous love poems were erotically explicit.&quot;

By the mid-1950s, Layton&#x27;s activism and poetry had made him a staple on the CBC televised debating program &quot;Fighting Words&quot;, where he earned a reputation as a formidable debater. The publication of &quot;A Red Carpet for the Sun&quot; in 1959 secured Layton&#x27;s national reputation while the many books of poetry that followed eventually gave him an international reputation, never as high however, in the United States and Britain as it was in some countries where Layton was read in translation.

In 1946 Layton received an M.A. in economics and political science from McGill, with a thesis on Harold Laski. Three years later he began teaching English, history, and political science at the Jewish parochial high school Herzliah (a branch of the United Talmud Torahs of Montreal). He was an influential teacher, and some of his students became writers and artists. Among his students was television magnate Moses Znaimer. Layton continued to teach for the greater part of his life: as a teacher of modern English and American poetry at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) and as a tenured professor at Toronto&#x27;s York University from 1969 to 1978. At York one of his first students was Joseph Pivato who became a writer, critic and academic. Layton delivering many lectures and readings throughout Canada. Layton pursued his PhD in 1948, but he abandoned it due to the demands of his already hectic professional life. In 1976, he received an honorary doctorate from Concordia University.

In the late 1950s, friends introduced Layton to Aviva Cantor, who had emigrated to Montreal from her native Australia in 1955. After several years of painful indecision, Layton and Betty separated, and Layton moved in with Aviva. The two had a son, David, in 1964. Though Layton remained legally married to Betty, his relationship with Aviva lasted more than twenty years, ending only in the late 1970s when Aviva left.

Layton also met Leonard Cohen, with whom he remained friends for life and who dedicated his 2007 book &quot;The Book of Longing&quot; to Layton. Cohen also dedicated his song &quot;Go No More A-Roving&quot; on his 2004 album Dear Heather to Layton. The song was basen upon a poem by Lord Byron.

Layton was also admired by such diverse artists and writers as Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, among other poets.

===Later years===
In 1974 Irving met Harriet Bernstein, who was enrolled in his Poetry Workshop at York University. Although he was still living with Aviva, Irving and Harriet began an affair that continued for four years, culminating in their legal marriage in November 1978. In order to marry Harriet, Irving finally took the required legal action to divorce Betty, which he had neglected to do until this time. In 1981 a daughter, Samantha Clara, was born to Harriet and Irving. The marriage ended in a bitterly contested divorce. Layton then met Anna (Annette) Pottier and invited her to be his housekeeper, although it soon became apparent that she would play a far greater role in his life. Although 48 years his junior she became his fifth and last wife. They lived briefly in Niagara-on-the-Lake in the fall of 1982 and then spent nearly a year in Oakville, Ontario, before moving to the Montreal district of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce at the end of 1983. It was here that Layton wrote his memoir &quot;Waiting For the Messiah&quot; and with Pottier&#x27;s support saw to the publication of his final books and translations. The couple eventually agreed that Pottier needed to begin a life of her own, and she moved out on March 1, 1995. Friends took care of Layton after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died at the Maimonides Geriatric Centre in Côte Saint-Luc at the age of 93 on January 4, 2006.

In 2015 Pottier published her memoir, &quot;Good As Gone: My Life With Irving Layton&quot; (Dundurn Press, March 14, 2015).

==Recognition==

Throughout the 1950s and on into the early 1990s Layton travelled widely abroad and became especially popular in South Korea and Italy. In 1981 these two nations nominated him for the Nobel Prize for Literature. (The prize that year was instead awarded to Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez.) Among his many awards during his career was the Governor-General&#x27;s Award for &quot;A Red Carpet for the Sun&quot; in 1959. In 1976 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was the first non-Italian to be awarded the Petrarch Award for Poetry.

In his lifetime Layton attracted some criticism for his abrasiveness, egotism, and acrimonious feuds, including one with biographer Elspeth Cameron. He is remembered by many as one of the first Canadian rebels of poetry, politics, and philosophy. At Layton&#x27;s funeral, Leonard Cohen, Moses Znaimer, and David Solway were among those who gave eulogies.

A street in Montreal has been named Irving Layton Avenue. It is located behind St.Richards Church and close to the corner of Guelph Road and Parkhaven Avenue.

An online scholarly journal, &quot;The Bull Calf&quot; (founded by Kait Pinder and J.A. Weingarten), is named in honour of Layton&#x27;s famous poem of the same name.

He is considered Leonard Cohen&#x27;s literary mentor. Leonard Cohen once said of Layton, &quot;I taught him how to dress, he taught me how to live forever.&quot;

He is depicted in the upcoming drama television series &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, in which he will be portrayed by Peter Stormare.

<text>The School for Scandal is a comedy of manners written by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. It was first performed in London at Drury Lane Theatre on 8 May 1777.

== Plot ==

=== Act I ===
Scene I: Lady Sneerwell, a wealthy young widow, and her hireling Snake discuss her various scandal-spreading plots. Snake asks why she is so involved in the affairs of Sir Peter Teazle, his ward Maria, and Charles and Joseph Surface, two young men under Sir Peter&#x27;s informal guardianship, and why she has not yielded to the attentions of Joseph, who is highly respectable. Lady Sneerwell confides that Joseph desires Maria, who is an heiress, and that Maria desires Charles. Thus she and Joseph are plotting to alienate Maria from Charles by putting out rumours of an affair between Charles and Sir Peter&#x27;s new young wife, Lady Teazle. Joseph arrives to confer with Lady Sneerwell. Maria herself then enters, fleeing the attentions of Sir Benjamin Backbite and his uncle, Crabtree. Mrs. Candour enters and ironically talks about how &quot;tale-bearers are as bad as the tale-makers.&quot; Soon after that, Sir Benjamin and Crabtree also enter, bringing a good deal of gossip with them. One item is the imminent return of the Surface brothers&#x27; rich uncle Sir Oliver from the East Indies, where he has been for sixteen years; another is Charles&#x27; dire financial situation.

Scene II: Sir Peter complains of Lady Teazle&#x27;s spendthrift ways. Rowley, the former steward of the Surfaces&#x27; late father, arrives, and Sir Peter gives him an earful on the subject. He also complains that Maria has refused Joseph, whom he calls &quot;a model for the young men of the age,&quot; and seems attached to Charles, whom he denounces as a profligate. Rowley defends Charles, and then announces that Sir Oliver has just arrived from the East Indies. Oliver has instructed them not to tell his nephews of his arrival so that he may &quot;make some trial of their dispositions&quot;.

=== Act II ===

Scene I: Sir Peter argues with his wife, Lady Teazle, refusing to be &quot;ruined by [her] extravagance.&quot; He reminds her of her recent and far humbler country origins. Lady Teazle excuses herself by appealing to &quot;the fashion&quot;, and departs to visit Lady Sneerwell. Despite their quarrel, Sir Peter still finds himself charmed by his wife even when she is arguing with him.

Scene II: At Lady Sneerwell&#x27;s, the scandal-mongers have great fun at the expense of friends not present. Lady Teazle and Maria arrive; Lady Teazle joins in, but Maria is disgusted. So is Sir Peter, when he arrives, and rather breaks up the party with his comments. He departs, the others retire to the next room, and Joseph seizes the opportunity to court Maria, who rejects him again. Lady Teazle returns and dismisses Maria, and it is revealed that Lady Teazle is seriously flirting with Joseph – who doesn&#x27;t want her, but cannot afford to alienate her.

Scene III: Sir Oliver calls on his old friend Sir Peter. He is amused by Sir Peter&#x27;s marriage to a young wife. Their talk turns to the Surface brothers. Sir Peter praises Joseph&#x27;s high morals but Sir Oliver suspects that he might be a hypocrite.

=== Act III ===

Scene I: Rowley describes his plan for Sir Oliver to visit each of the brothers &quot;incognito&quot; to test their characters. Sir Oliver will disguise himself as their needy relative Mr. Stanley, and ask each for his help. Rowley also brings in the &quot;friendly Jew&quot; Moses, a moneylender who has tried to help Charles, to explain Charles&#x27; position. Moses mentions that he is to introduce Charles to yet another moneylender (&quot;Mr. Premium&quot;) that very evening. Sir Oliver decides (at Sir Peter&#x27;s suggestion) that with Moses&#x27; assistance, he will pose as Premium when visiting Charles while still intending to visit Joseph as Stanley.

Sir Peter is left alone and when Maria enters, he tries to convince her to marry Joseph expressing him as a worthier match than Charles, whom she favours. When she is not persuaded, he threatens her with &quot;the authority of a guardian&quot;. She goes, and Lady Teazle enters asking her husband for two hundred pounds. Sir Peter and Lady Teazle argue again, and conclude that they should separate.

Scene II: Sir Oliver (as Mr. Premium) arrives with Moses at Charles&#x27; house. While they are waiting in the hall, Trip, the servant, tries to negotiate a loan on his own account from Moses. Sir Oliver concludes that &quot;this is the temple of dissipation indeed!&quot;

Scene III: Charles and his raucous guests drink heavily and sing merry songs, as they prepare for a night of gambling. Charles raises a toast to Maria. Moses and &quot;Premium&quot; enter, and Sir Oliver is dismayed at the scene. Charles does not recognise his long-lost uncle. Charles frankly asks &quot;Premium&quot; for credit, noting that Sir Oliver (whom he believes is in India) will soon leave him a fortune. &quot;Premium&quot; discounts this possibility, noting that Sir Oliver could live many years, or disinherit his nephew. He asks if Charles has any valuables of his own to sell for immediate cash. Charles admits that he has sold the family silver and his late father&#x27;s library, and offers to sell &quot;Premium&quot; the family portrait collection. &quot;Premium&quot; accepts, but Sir Oliver is silently outraged.

=== Act IV ===

Scene I: Charles goes on to sell all of the family portraits to &quot;Premium&quot;, using the rolled-up family tree as a gavel. However, he refuses to sell the last portrait, which is of Sir Oliver, out of respect for his benefactor; Charles will not sell it even when &quot;Premium&quot; offers as much for it as for all the rest. Moved, Sir Oliver inwardly forgives Charles. Sir Oliver and Moses leave with Rowley entering shortly after, and Charles sends a hundred pounds of the proceeds for the relief of &quot;Mr. Stanley&quot;, despite Rowley&#x27;s objection.

Scene II: Sir Oliver, reflecting on Charles&#x27;s character with Moses, is met by Rowley, who has brought him the hundred pounds sent to &quot;Stanley.&quot; Declaring &quot;I’ll pay his debts, and his benevolence too&quot;, Sir Oliver plans to go meet his other nephew in the person of Stanley.

Scene III: Joseph, anxiously awaiting a visit from Lady Teazle, is told by a servant that she has just left &quot;her chair at the milliner&#x27;s next door&quot; and so has the servant draw a screen across the window (his reason: &quot;my opposite neighbour is a maiden lady of so curious a temper&quot;). On her entrance, Joseph forswears any interest in Maria, and flirts in earnest with Lady Teazle, perversely suggesting that she should make a &quot;faux pas&quot; for the benefit of her reputation. The servant returns to announce Sir Peter, and Lady Teazle hides in panic behind the screen. Sir Peter enters and tells Joseph that he suspects an affair between Charles and Lady Teazle (due to the rumours spread by Joseph and Lady Sneerwell). Joseph hypocritically professes confidence in Charles&#x27; and Lady Teazle&#x27;s honour. Sir Peter confides his intention to give his wife a generous separate maintenance during his life and the bulk of his fortune on his demise. He also urges Joseph to pursue his suit with Maria (much to Joseph&#x27;s annoyance, as Lady Teazle is listening behind the screen).

Charles&#x27;s arrival is announced. Sir Peter decides to hide, and have Joseph sound Charles out about his relationship with Lady Teazle. He starts behind the screen, but sees the corner of Lady Teazle&#x27;s petticoat there already. Joseph &quot;confesses&quot; that he is not as virtuous as he seems: &quot;a little French milliner, a silly rogue that plagues me&quot; is hiding there to preserve her own reputation. Sir Peter then hides in the closet.

Charles now enters and Joseph questions him about Lady Teazle. Charles disclaims any designs on her, noting that Joseph and the lady seem to be intimate. To stop Charles, Joseph whispers to him that Sir Peter is hiding in the closet, and Charles hauls him forth. Sir Peter tells Charles he now regrets his suspicions about him. Charles passes off his comments about Joseph and Lady Teazle as a joke.

When Lady Sneerwell is announced, Joseph rushes out to stop her from coming up. Meanwhile, Sir Peter tells Charles about the &quot;French milliner&quot;. Charles insists on having a look at her and flings down the screen as Joseph returns, discovering Lady Teazle. Charles, very amused, leaves the other three dumbstruck individuals. Joseph concocts an explanation for Sir Peter of why he and Lady Teazle are together. But she refuses to endorse it and admits that she came to pursue an affair with Joseph; however, having learned of Sir Peter&#x27;s generosity, she has repented. She denounces Joseph and exits, and the enraged Sir Peter follows as Joseph continues trying to pretend innocence.

=== Act V ===

Scene I: Sir Oliver (as Mr. Stanley) now visits Joseph. Joseph, like Charles, does not recognise his long-lost uncle. He greets &quot;Stanley&quot; with effusive professions of goodwill, but refuses to give &quot;Stanley&quot; any financial assistance, saying he has donated all his money to support Charles. &quot;Stanley&quot; suggests that Sir Oliver would help him if he was here, and that Joseph might pass on some of what Sir Oliver has given him. But Joseph tells &quot;Stanley&quot; that Sir Oliver is in fact very stingy, and has given him nothing except trinkets such as tea, shawls, birds and &quot;Indian crackers&quot;. Furthermore, Joseph has lent a great deal to his brother, so that he has nothing left for &quot;Stanley&quot;. Sir Oliver is enraged, as he knows both statements are flat lies – he sent Joseph 12,000 pounds from India. He stifles his anger, and departs amid further effusions. Rowley arrives with a letter for Joseph announcing that Sir Oliver has arrived in town.

Scene II: At Sir Peter&#x27;s house, Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Candour, Sir Benjamin, and Crabtree exchange confused rumours about the Teazle affair. Sir Benjamin says Sir Peter was wounded in a swordfight with Joseph Surface, while Crabtree insists it was a pistol duel with Charles. When Sir Oliver enters, they take him for a doctor and demand news of the wounded man. At that moment Sir Peter arrives to prove the report wrong, and orders the scandalmongers out of his house, with Rowley entering shortly after at hearing Sir Peter&#x27;s raised voice. Sir Oliver says he has met both of his nephews and agrees with Sir Peter&#x27;s (former) estimate of Joseph&#x27;s high character, but then acknowledges with laughter that he knows the story of what happened at Joseph&#x27;s with the closet and screen. When he leaves, Rowley tells Sir Peter that Lady Teazle is in tears in the next room, and Sir Peter goes to reconcile with her.

Scene III: Lady Sneerwell complains to Joseph that Sir Peter, now that he knows the truth about Joseph, will allow Charles to marry Maria. They plot to use Snake as a witness to a supposed relationship between Charles and Lady Sneerwell, and she withdraws.

Sir Oliver arrives. Joseph takes him for &quot;Stanley&quot; and orders him out. Charles arrives and recognises &quot;Premium&quot;. Despite the identity confusion, both brothers want the man out before Sir Oliver comes. As Charles and Joseph try to eject their incognito uncle, Sir Peter and Lady Teazle arrive with Maria and Rowley, ending Sir Oliver&#x27;s pretence. Sir Oliver, Sir Peter, and Lady Teazle together condemn Joseph, but Sir Oliver forgives Charles because of his refusal to sell Sir Oliver&#x27;s picture and his generous aid to his uncle &quot;Stanley&quot;. Maria, however, declines to give Charles her hand, citing his supposed involvement with Lady Sneerwell. Joseph now reveals Lady Sneerwell. Charles is baffled, and Rowley then summons Snake. Snake, however, has been bribed to turn against Sneerwell, so her lie is exposed. After Lady Teazle tells her that she (Lady Teazle) is withdrawing from the School for Scandal, Lady Sneerwell leaves in a rage, and Joseph follows, supposedly to keep her from further malicious attacks. Charles and Maria are reconciled. Charles makes no promises about reforming, but indicates that Maria&#x27;s influence will keep him on a &quot;virtuous path&quot;. The concluding line assures the audience that &quot;even Scandal dies, if you approve.&quot;

=== Epilogue ===

The humorous epilogue, written by George Colman the Elder, is to be &quot;Spoken by Lady Teazle.&quot; It portrays her as somewhat regretful of leaving country domesticity for London society, and includes an elaborate parody of a famous speech in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello.&quot;

== Revisions and variant versions ==
Various editions of the play exhibit several relatively minor textual differences. One reason is that Sheridan revised his text repeatedly, not only prior to its first production, but afterwards.

In its earliest stages, as detailed by Thomas Moore, Sheridan developed two separate play sketches, one initially entitled &quot;The Slanderers&quot; that began with Lady Sneerwell and Spatter (equivalent to Snake in the final version), and the other involving the Teazles. He eventually combined these and with repeated revisions and restructuring arrived at substantially the play that we have today.

The play did not appear in an authorised edition during Sheridan&#x27;s lifetime, though it was printed in Dublin in 1788 from a copy that the author had sent to his sister.

Because, as one recent editor has put it, &quot;&quot;The School for Scandal&quot; is the most intractable problem Sheridan set his editors&quot;, editions of this play can vary considerably. For example, the Penguin Classics edition gives a text based on the 1821 edition of &quot;The Works of the Late Right Honourable Richard Brinsley Sheridan&quot; published by Murray, Ridgeway, and Wilkie, but states that it has &quot;been emended from earlier manuscripts&quot; and gives a detailed listing of these emendations.

The prefatory material to the Project Gutenberg text of the play acknowledges that &quot;Current texts may usually be traced, directly or indirectly&quot;, to the 1821 edition, but presents a far different text based on a manuscript in the author&#x27;s hand.

In the Project Gutenberg text&#x27;s version of I.1, Lady Sneerwell&#x27;s accomplice is her cousin Miss Verjuice, not the socially inferior Snake (who appears only in V.3). Here is the opening of the play as given in that text (in which the editor has retained the original spelling and punctuation of Sheridan&#x27;s manuscript found at Frampton Court):

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;&quot;LADY SNEERWELL at her dressing table with LAPPET; MISS VERJUICE drinking chocolate&quot;
LADY SNEERWELL. The Paragraphs you say were all inserted:
VERJUICE. They were Madam—and as I copied them myself in a feigned Hand there can be no suspicion whence they came.
LADY SNEERWELL. Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittle&#x27;s Intrigue with Captain Boastall?
VERJUICE. Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the Town—and I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.
LADY SNEERWELL. What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain Baronet&#x27;s Lady and a certain Cook.
VERJUICE. That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish. I told the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it directly to my Hairdresser. He I am informed has a Brother who courts a Milliners&#x27; Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose sister is Feme [Femme] de Chambre to Mrs. Clackit—so that in the common course of Things it must reach Mrs. Clackit&#x27;s Ears within four-and-twenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done.&lt;/poem&gt;

Sheridan later deleted Verjuice and gave Snake most of her lines, as reflected in the 1821 edition and those editions that follow it. Here is the opening in that text:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;&quot;Lady SNEERWELL&#x27;S House.&quot;
&quot;Discovered Lady SNEERWELL at the dressing-table; SNAKE drinking chocolate.&quot;
&quot;Lady Sneer.&quot; The paragraphs, you say, Mr. Snake, were all inserted?
&quot;Snake.&quot; They were, madam; and as I copied them myself in a feigned hand, there can be no suspicion whence they came.
&quot;Lady Sneer.&quot; Did you circulate the report of Lady Brittle&#x27;s intrigue with Captain Boastall?
&quot;Snake.&quot; That&#x27;s in as fine a train as your ladyship could wish. In the common course of things, I think it must reach Mrs. Clackitt&#x27;s ears within four and twenty hours; and then, you know, the business is as good as done.&lt;/poem&gt;

This is a significant difference, and some editors and performers have preferred the manuscript version that includes Miss Verjuice. However, the cast list of the first production of the play in 1777 has no &quot;Miss Verjuice&quot; listed, showing that the change Sheridan made to combine her part with Snake&#x27;s predates the premiere.

Another example of strictly verbal differences between the two texts can be found in II.1, where the Project Gutenberg text has Lady Teazle rather more pointed in suggesting that Sir Peter can oblige her by making her his &quot;widow&quot; (only implied by her in the 1821 text, leaving him to fill in &quot;My widow, I suppose?&quot; and her to add &quot;Hem! hem!&quot;). Also, in Crabtree&#x27;s recitation of the imaginary duel between Sir Peter and Charles Surface (V.2), the shot of Sir Peter bounces off a &quot;little bronze Pliny&quot; in the older version, but the bust is changed to one of &quot;Shakspeare (sic)&quot; in the 1821 text. Many other slight differences of a few words here and there can be found throughout the play (though these do not impact the plot the way that the deletion of Miss Verjuice does).

==Reception==

&quot;The School for Scandal&quot; has been widely admired. The English critic William Hazlitt was particularly effusive in his praise of Sheridan&#x27;s comedies in general (&quot;everything in them &quot;tells&quot;; there is no labour in vain&quot;) and of this play in particular:

Edmund Gosse called the play &quot;perhaps the best existing English comedy of intrigue&quot;, while Charles Lamb wrote that &quot;This comedy grew out of Congreve and Wycherley&quot;, but criticised &quot;sentimental incompatibilities&quot; even while admitting that &quot;the gaiety upon the whole is buoyant.&quot;

Samuel Barber composed his first full orchestral work as an overture programmed for the play.

On the other hand, the play has also been criticised for some hints of anti-Semitism, specifically &quot;the disparaging remarks made about moneylenders, who were often Jewish.&quot; It is true that the moneylender Moses is portrayed in a comparatively positive light, but the way he is described (as a &quot;friendly Jew&quot; and an &quot;honest Israelite&quot; by Rowley in III.1) suggest that he is in some way to be considered an exception to Jews in general; also, his own usurious business practices as stated to Sir Peter are clearly less than exemplary (e.g., his statement &quot;If he appears not very anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per cent; but if you find him in great distress, and want the moneys very bad, you may ask double&quot; [III.1]). It may be significant that in Johann Zoffany&#x27;s portrait of Robert Baddeley as Moses, we find that &quot;Under his arm Moses holds a rolled parchment of the Surface family tree that is used as an auction hammer, and he seems to be ticking off pictures in the catalogue&quot;, although in the play Careless is the auctioneer in the relevant scene (IV.1) and Moses has a relatively minor role.

It is notable that at least one 21st-century production (Los Angeles, 2004) has &quot;sanitized most of what could be deemed as anti-Semitic content&quot; by changing references to &quot;Jews&quot; and &quot;Jewry&quot; to &quot;moneylenders&quot;—a practice that a reviewer termed &quot;PC-ification&quot; of the play. Another production, by the Seattle Shakespeare Company in 2007, reportedly did not tamper with this aspect of the text and was commended by a reviewer for &quot;the courage to face the script&#x27;s unsavory side.&quot;

Another criticism that has been made of the play involves the characterisation. A writer in the 19th century periodical &quot;Appletons&#x27; Journal&quot; states that

The style of the play has also made it at times a problematic work to make effective in today&#x27;s theatre. In appraising a 1999 staging of Sheridan&#x27;s comedy at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, one critic found the &quot;staunchly orthodox production&quot; to be lacking, commenting that

Another reviewer in &quot;Variety&quot; noted of a 1995 production starring Tony Randall as Sir Peter Teazle that Sheridan&#x27;s play was &quot;such a superbly crafted laugh machine, and so timeless in delivering delectable comeuppance to a viper&#x27;s nest of idle-rich gossipmongers, that you&#x27;d practically have to club it to death to stifle its amazing pleasures&quot; – before claiming that this is &quot;precisely&quot; what the production being reviewed had done.

But in the hands of a talented director and cast, the play still offers considerable pleasure. A New York production of 2001 prompted praise in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for being &quot;just the classy antidote one needs in a celebrity-crazed world where the invasion of privacy is out of control, but the art of gossip is nonexistent.&quot;

==Film and television adaptations==
The play has been adapted to film numerous times.

In 1923, the silent British film &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; was produced and directed by Bertram Phillips. It starred Basil Rathbone, Frank Stanmore and Queenie Thomas.

The 1930 film &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; was the first sound adaptation of the play. The film is presumed to be lost.

The first television adaptation aired over the BBC 19 May 1937. Greer Garson starred. BBC-TV again produced the play in 1959.

In 1975, WNET/13 New York, in association with KTCA St. Paul-Minneapolis, broadcast a production by the Guthrie Theater Company adapted by Michael Bawtree.

<text>&quot;The Leopard Man&#x27;s Story&quot; is a short mystery story by Jack London. It was first published in the August 1903 issue of &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and, in 1906, included in &quot;Moon-Face and Other Stories&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The &quot;Leopard Man&quot;, a saddened leopard trainer who bore visible scars on his arms and whose personality diametrically opposed his daring profession, tells a tale of a &quot;lion-tamer who was hated by another man&quot; to the narrator. The unnamed man, who hated the lion-tamer, attended every performance in hopes of watching the lion crunch down on his tamer during his &quot;big play&quot;, sticking his head in the lion&#x27;s mouth. Finally, one day he witnessed it.

After pointing out the patience of such a task, the Leopard Man jumped to a story about De Ville, a small &quot;sword-swallowing and juggling Frenchman&quot; known for his quick temper. De Ville struck fear in all but one, &#x27;King&#x27; Wallace, a lion-tamer known for sticking his head in the lion&#x27;s mouth. One day, De Ville caught Wallace looking at Madame de Ville, his wife. Despite warnings about De Ville&#x27;s temperament, Wallace, while feeling belligerent one day, pushed De Ville&#x27;s head into a paste bucket. Calm, De Ville cleaned himself off and nothing transpired between the two for several months.

At a San Francisco show, the Leopard Man, looking for his pocket-knife, oversaw Wallace and the rest of the tent occupiers, except for De Ville who glared with hatred at Wallace, watching a quarrel between some trapeze artists. Still watching the events, the Leopard Man noticed De Ville, with his handkerchief drawn, walk past Wallace and feign wiping sweat off his face.

During his performance, Wallace cracked his whip and put his head inside the mouth of Augustus, his preferred lion. With Wallace&#x27;s head in his mouth, Augustus&#x27; jaws clamped together. After the event, the Leopard Man went over to smell Wallace&#x27;s head and sneezed. De Ville had placed snuff in his hair; Augustus had sneezed.

<doc id="284477" wikidata="Q856396" url="?curid=284477" title="Bibliomania">
<text>Bibliomania is the excessive collecting or even hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged, particularly as a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder.

Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia, which is the (psychologically healthy) love of books, and as such is not considered a clinical psychological disorder.

==Description==
One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in its DSM-IV.

Bibliomaniacs are characterized as those who are obsessed with books so much so that they will go to extreme measures to obtain the books they want. Often bibliomaniacs will have multiple copies of the same book in different editions and varying conditions. Bibliomaniacs affect the buying and selling of books with their obsessive nature and have greatly increased the price of buying rare books.

== History ==
The term was coined by John Ferriar (1761–1815), a physician at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Ferriar coined the term in 1809 in a poem he dedicated to his bibliomanic friend, Richard Heber (1773–1833). In the early nineteenth century, &quot;bibliomania&quot; was used in popular discourse (such as in periodical essays and poems) to describe obsessive book collectors.

In 1809, the Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin published &quot;Bibliomania; or Book Madness&quot;, a work described by literary critic Philip Connell as &quot;a series of bizarre rambling dialogues which together comprised a kind of dramatized mock pathology, lavishly illustrated and, in the second edition, embellished with extensive footnotes on bibliography and the history of book collecting.&quot; The &quot;symptoms&quot; displayed by the bibliomaniacs in Dibdin&#x27;s work include &quot;an obsession with uncut copies, fine paper or vellum pages, unique copies, first editions, blackletter books, illustrated copies, association copies, and condemned or suppressed works&quot;.

In the late nineteenth century, book collections and collectors of note were given regular coverage as curiosities.

Holbrook Jackson was to follow the work of Ferriar and Dibdin later in the work &quot;The Anatomy of Bibliomania&quot;.

Bibliomania became quite popular during the Regency era as the desire for first edition copies of books drove prices to unobtainable levels. Because of this, bibliomaniacs made a significant impact on the sales of rare or older books in such a way that it has never truly recovered.

==People with bibliomania==
* Stephen Blumberg, who was convicted of stealing $5.3 million worth of books.
* Sir Thomas Phillipps, 1st Baronet (1792–1872) suffered from severe bibliomania. His collection, which at his death contained over 160,000 books and manuscripts, was still being auctioned off over 100 years after his death.
* Rev. W.F. Whitcher was a 19th-century Methodist pastor who, after having stolen and rebound rare books, would assert they were rare &quot;finds&quot; from local booksellers.
* Lord Charles Spencer (1740–1820), a book collector who drove the bidding for a first edition copy of &quot;The Decameron&quot; to £2,260 at the auction of the family library of Roxburghe.

==Depictions in fiction==
* Peter Kien, the protagonist in &quot;Auto-da-Fé&quot; by Elias Canetti. Kien&#x27;s obsession with his personal library leads to the destruction of his marriage, his happiness, and ultimately the library itself.
* Yomiko Readman, the protagonist in &quot;Read or Die&quot;, is an introverted bibliomaniac, often preferring the company of books over people.
* Don Vincente, a fictional Spanish monk who was suspected of stealing books from his monastery, and later murdered nine people so he could steal their books.
* Leisel Meminger, the protagonist in &quot;The Book Thief&quot;, is a nine-year-old who steals a grave digger&#x27;s handbook, beginning her obsession with books.
* The 2016 Psychological Horror manga &quot;Bibliomania&quot;, written by Orval (Oobaru) and illustrated by Macchiro, is about a young girl&#x27;s obsession with books. She is trapped in a magical book and must traverse it in order to escape.

<text>Boldness is the opposite of shyness. To be bold implies a willingness to get things done despite risks.

For example, in the context of sociability, a bold person may be willing to risk shame or rejection in social situations, or to bend rules of etiquette or politeness. An excessively bold person could aggressively ask for money, or persistently push someone to fulfill a request.

The word &quot;bold&quot; may also be used as a synonym of &quot;&quot;; for example, a child may be punished for being &quot;bold&quot; by acting disrespectfully toward an adult or by misbehaving.

Boldness as a philosophical virtue was admired by the ancient Greeks.

Boldness may be contrasted with courage in that the latter implies having fear but confronting it.

== Description ==
In behavioral ecology, the shy⟷bold continuum is studied as it exists in humans and certain other species. Shyness and boldness represent &quot;a propensity to take risks&quot;. Bold individuals tend to become dominant, revealing a correlation between boldness and social dominance.

<text>Joseph Patrick Lockhart (born July 13, 1959) is a spokesman and communications consultant, best known for being the 21st White House Press Secretary during the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton. Previously, he had worked as press secretary for several Democratic politicians, including Walter Mondale, Paul Simon, and Michael Dukakis. Following his work as press secretary in the Clinton administration, he was an advisor to John Kerry during his 2004 presidential campaign. He subsequently founded and became managing director of the communications consulting firm The Glover Park Group, worked for Facebook from 2011 to 2012, and was executive vice president of communications and public affairs for the NFL from 2016 to 2018.

==Early life and career==
Born in The Bronx, Lockhart is the son of Ann Teahan and Raymond Lockhart, a longtime NBC producer associated with &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; and special-events coverage. He grew up in Suffern, New York. In 1978, he moved to Washington D.C. to attend Georgetown University, where he received a BA in History. In 1980, he worked on Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidential reelection campaign.

He was press secretary for the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, then worked for Paul Simon in the Senate. Stints with ABC and CNN followed, then the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis in 1988. He moved to Robinson, Lake, Lerer &amp; Montgomery with Mike McCurry, then back to ABC when they hired his (former) wife and colleague from the Mondale campaign, Laura Logan.

Another stint with NBC covering the Romanian Revolution in 1989 preceded his first on-air job with Sky News, reporting on the Gulf War and then business. Private practice with Robinson, Lake followed, where he handled publicity for the Al Nahayan family during parts of the BCCI scandal.

==Clinton presidential campaign and the White House==
At a time when Lockhart was considering working for AOL, Mike McCurry recruited Lockhart back into politics, and he joined the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign. He served as the campaign spokesman and, following President Clinton&#x27;s successful reelection, as Deputy Press Secretary to McCurry. After standing in for him on occasion to brief the press, Lockhart eventually succeeded McCurry and delivered his first briefing as Press Secretary in October 1998.

Lockhart handled press relations during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment and the 2000 Camp David Summit. Lockhart calls the pre-impeachment period in December 1998 the &quot;most harrowing&quot; weeks of his career.

==After the White House==
Lockhart was brought on to the John Kerry presidential campaign as a senior advisor in September 2004.

On September 8, 2004, CBS News aired a controversial report on presidential candidate George W. Bush&#x27;s military record. The authenticity of the Killian documents used in that report remain under scrutiny. Over the next few days, it was discovered that Joseph Lockhart, then senior advisor to presidential candidate John Kerry, had made a phone call to Texas National Guard officer, Bill Burkett on September 4, 2004. Lockhart stated later that an unnamed female CBS producer asked him to contact Burkett. Lockhart has denied that the call with Burkett had anything to do with the National Guard issue.

Lockhart co-founded the consulting firm The Glover Park Group, becoming its Managing Director. In June 2011, he joined Facebook as the head of the company&#x27;s corporate, policy, and international communications team. Not wanting to relocate to the company&#x27;s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, he left the company in October 2012.

On February 15, 2016, Lockhart was introduced as the new executive vice president of communications and top public relations official for the National Football League; he left the job after the 2018 Super Bowl to spend time with his family.

==Personal life==
Lockhart was previously married to Laura Logan, Deputy Press Secretary for John Glenn&#x27;s 1984 presidential run and a longtime ABC News producer. In 2013, Lockhart married Giovanna Gray. They divorced in 2022. 

In 2016, it was announced that President Obama and his family planned to rent Lockhart&#x27;s Kalorama home after he left office. It was later revealed that the Obamas purchased the house from Lockhart in May 2017, saying that it made sense to own the property since they would remain in Washington D.C. for at least two more years.

<text>The power forward (PF), also known as the four, is one of the five traditional positions in a regulation basketball game. Traditionally, power forwards have played a role similar to centers and are typically the tallest or second tallest player on the court. When on offense, they typically play with their backs towards the basket. When on defense, they typically position themselves under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, including rebounding, screen setting, rim protecting, and scoring. 

Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from . Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to include three-point field goals.

In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6&#x27; 9&quot; (2.06 m) to 6&#x27; 11&quot; (2.11 m) while in the WNBA, power forwards are usually between 6&#x27; 0″ (1.83 m) and 6′ 3″ (1.91 m). Despite the averages, a variety of players fit &quot;tweener&quot; roles which finds them in the small forward or center position depending on matchups and coaching decisions. Some power forwards, such as Draymond Green and even 6&#x27; 5&quot; (1.96 m) P. J. Tucker, have played at the center position, possessing the skills, but lacking the height that is usually associated with the position.

Power forwards who have been inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Karl Malone, Lauren Jackson, Vern Mikkelsen, Tina Thompson, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett, Dolph Schayes, Kevin McHale, Charles Barkley, Dennis Rodman, Elvin Hayes, Bob Pettit, Jerry Lucas, Dave Debusschere, and Tim Duncan.

<doc id="284483" wikidata="Q6847909" url="?curid=284483" title="Mike McCurry (press secretary)">
<text>Michael Demaree McCurry (born October 27, 1954) is best known for having served in Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration as the nation&#x27;s 20th White House Press Secretary. 

He is a Washington-based communications consultant and is associated with the firm Public Strategies Washington, Inc. He is also active within the administration of the United Methodist Church, serving as a lay delegate to the Church General Conference and on various denominational boards. From 2009 to 2017, he co-chaired the Commission on Presidential Debates. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, he was educated at Princeton University and Georgetown University.

==Education and early career==
McCurry was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended San Carlos High School on the San Francisco Peninsula from 1969 to 1971 and then transferred to Ravenswood High School in East Palo Alto, where he graduated in 1972. During his senior year in high school, McCurry served as Governor of the California Junior State, a student-run mock government that today is better known as the Junior State of America.

McCurry earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University in 1976 and a Master of Arts degree from Georgetown University in 1985. He began his political career as press secretary to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, as well as press secretary to Senator Harrison A. Williams from 1976 to 1981. Between 1981 and 1983, he served as press secretary to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

From 1988 to 1990, McCurry served as director of communications for the Democratic National Committee, and served as press secretary for the presidential campaigns of John Glenn (1984), Bruce Babbitt (1988), and Bob Kerrey, (1992), as well as the 1988 vice-presidential campaign for Lloyd Bentsen.

Prior to serving in the White House as press secretary to Clinton, McCurry served as spokesman for the Department of State from 1993 to 1995, as well as chief spokesman for Warren Christopher.

==Post-Clinton career==
McCurry serves on numerous boards or advisory councils for organizations including Share Our Strength, the Junior State of America Foundation, Children&#x27;s Scholarship Fund, the Wesley Theological Seminary, United Methodist Communications and the White House Historical Association. He is co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates.

He once responded to the Taco Liberty Bell incident by saying that the federal government was also &quot;selling the Lincoln Memorial to Ford Motor Co. and renaming it the Lincoln-Mercury Memorial&quot;. He was well respected by the press corps during his tenure, but his honesty and competency were not always appreciated by his colleagues. In 1998 he expressed doubts about Bill Clinton&#x27;s fitness to remain in office.

Starting May 2005, McCurry was a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;; as of November 2008, however his most recent contribution was dated May 2006. In December 2008, McCurry wrote &quot;How my party found God&quot; for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. In the biographical blurb with the column, it was reported that he was a graduate student at Wesley Theological Seminary.

McCurry is a partner at the influential Washington, D.C.–based government relations firm Public Strategies Washington, Inc. In 2006, in his position as co-chairman of Hands Off the Internet, he lobbied against Internet regulations in the controversial network neutrality debate.

On April 15, 2009, it was announced that McCurry and George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer would both work as temporary media aides to Conservative Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper. The two aides were enlisted by the PMO to elevate Harper&#x27;s and Canada&#x27;s profiles with American news outlets.

In a later round of the network neutrality fight, in 2011, McCurry came out in favor of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)/Protect IP Act, representing them as a way to combat online theft. In an opinion piece in &quot;Politico&quot; on the subject, which drew a favorable comment from the MPAA, McCurry said the new proposals addressed concerns of past critics.

On June 15, 2011, McCurry and Arts + Labs co-chair Mark McKinnon sponsored the &quot;CREATE—A Forum on Creativity, Commerce, Copyright, Counterfeiting and Policy&quot; conference with members of Congress, artists and information-business executives.

<doc id="284489" wikidata="Q434317" url="?curid=284489" title="Dee Dee Myers">
<text>Margaret Jane &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Myers (born September 1, 1961) is an American political analyst who served as the 19th White House Press Secretary during the first two years of the Clinton administration. She was the first woman and, at the time, the second-youngest person to hold that position. Myers later co-hosted the news program &quot;Equal Time&quot; on CNBC, and was a consultant on &quot;The West Wing.&quot; She was the inspiration for fictional White House Press Secretary C. J. Cregg. She is also the author of the 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book, &quot;Why Women Should Rule the World&quot;. In 2020, she joined the Gavin Newsom administration as Senior Advisor to the Governor and Director of the Governor&#x27;s Office of Business and Economic Development.

==Personal life==
Margaret Jane Myers was born in 1961 at Quonset Point in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, to Stephen and Judy Myers. Her nickname, &quot;Dee Dee&quot;, originated when her sister could not pronounce &quot;baby.&quot;

Myers spent most of her formative years in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California. Her father was a Navy aviator who completed two tours of duty in the Vietnam War, and her mother worked as a real estate agent.

Myers is a graduate of William S. Hart High School and Santa Clara University (1983).

Myers met her husband, Todd Purdum, the national editor for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, former White House correspondent, and Los Angeles bureau chief for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, during the 1992 presidential campaign. The couple, who married in 1997, have two children, Kate and Stephen, and live in Los Angeles, California.

==Political career==
Myers&#x27; career in political communications began shortly after graduating from college, taking a full-time role on the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale. She later served as a field representative for California State Senator Art Torres, and as assistant press secretary in the office of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and on his 1986 campaign for California governor. She was also a spokesperson for Michael Dukakis&#x27; 1988 presidential bid and Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s 1990 California gubernatorial campaign, and served as campaign manager for Frank Jordan&#x27;s 1991 run for San Francisco mayor.

===Clinton years===
Myers joined Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign team in 1991 and, following the 1992 presidential election, was named Clinton&#x27;s first White House Press Secretary, a role she held from January 20, 1993, to December 22, 1994. She was the first woman to serve in that position and was the second-youngest, behind Ron Ziegler, when she took the job at the age of 31. Myers is now the third-oldest, as Karoline Leavitt, Donald Trump&#x27;s press secretary, was 27 when she assumed the role in January 2025.

According to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, Myers earned a reputation for her &quot;humor and patience&quot; in handling the White House press corps, often delivering &quot;quick one-liners&quot; while issuing daily press briefings. Until September 1994, when she was given the title of Assistant to the President, she held the lesser title of &quot;deputy assistant&quot; and had a lower salary than previous White House Press Secretaries. She also lacked consistent access to Clinton&#x27;s inner circle. This was frequently noted in news coverage about Myers throughout her term, and is addressed in her 2008 book, &quot;Why Women Should Rule The World&quot;.

==Post-White House career==
After the Clinton administration, she became a political analyst and commentator, appearing on television and speaking at events on politics and the media.

===Television and popular culture===
In May 1995, Myers became the co-host of political talk show &quot;Equal Time&quot; on CNBC. She initially hosted the show opposite Mary Matalin, and later opposite Bay Buchanan. In 1997, she was the winning contestant on an episode of Celebrity &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, beating Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr. Myers has also appeared as a guest on other television programs, including &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;. She also appeared as herself in the 1997 Robert Zemeckis film, &quot;Contact&quot;.

Writer Aaron Sorkin recruited Myers to serve as a consultant and script advisor on the Emmy Award-winning TV series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, beginning in 1999. The character of C. J. Cregg (played by Allison Janney), the White House Press Secretary on the series, was partially inspired by Myers. News articles have also reported that she may have served as the basis for the character of Daisy Green in the novel and film &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, played by Maura Tierney.

===Commentator===
Myers has contributed to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; since July 1995, originally as a Washington editor, and since 1997 as a contributing editor. She is the author of the 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book &quot;Why Women Should Rule The World&quot;, about women taking on positions of leadership and her own experiences in the White House. Her writings have also appeared in a number of other publications, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Politico&quot;, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. Since leaving the White House, Myers has also been invited to speak at numerous events, usually on the topics of women&#x27;s issues, the media and politics. In 2011, she became a brand ambassador for Jones New York&#x27;s Empower your Confidence campaign, and appeared as a model in advertisements for the brand.

===Public affairs consulting===
Myers joined The Glover Park Group in September 2010, as a managing director of public affairs. Her role at the firm involves consulting with clients on communications strategy, marketing and reputation management. In January 2013 she was the spokeswoman for Paula Broadwell during the Petraeus scandal.

===Corporate communications===
In September 2014, Myers became the head of corporate communications at Warner Bros. She departed from this position in February 2020.

===State government===
In December 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Myers as Senior Advisor and Director of the Governor&#x27;s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz).

<text>USS &quot;Juneau&quot; (CL-52) was a United States Navy light cruiser torpedoed and sunk at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. In total, 687 officers and sailors, including the five Sullivan brothers, were killed in action as a result of her sinking. Only 10 survivors were rescued after eight days in the water. To honor the five Sullivan brothers and &quot;Juneau&quot;, the U.S. Navy has since commissioned two ships named and two ships named . On 17 March 2018, Paul Allen&#x27;s research crew on board located the wreck of &quot;Juneau&quot; at a depth of about off the Solomon Islands.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Juneau&quot; was laid down by Federal Shipbuilding Company at Kearny, New Jersey, on 27 May 1940. She was launched on 25 October 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Harry I. Lucas, wife of the mayor of the city of Juneau, Alaska, and commissioned on 14 February 1942, with Captain Lyman K. Swenson in command.

==Service history==
After a hurried shakedown cruise along the Atlantic coast in the spring of 1942, &quot;Juneau&quot; assumed blockade patrol in early May off the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to prevent the escape of Vichy French naval units. She returned to New York to complete alterations and operated in the North Atlantic and Caribbean from 1 June to 12 August on patrol and escort duties. The cruiser departed for the Pacific theater on 22 August.

===Pacific theater===
After stopping briefly at the Tonga Islands and New Caledonia, she rendezvoused on 10 September with Task Force 18 (TF 18) under the command of Rear Admiral Leigh Noyes, flying his flag on . The following day, TF 17, which included , combined with Admiral Noyes&#x27; unit to form TF 61, whose mission was to ferry fighter aircraft to Guadalcanal. On 15 September, &quot;Wasp&quot; took three torpedo hits from the Japanese submarine , and, with fires raging out of control, was sunk at 21:00 by . &quot;Juneau&quot; and screen destroyers rescued 1,910 survivors of &quot;Wasp&quot; and returned them to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, on 16 September. The next day, the fast cruiser rejoined TF 17. Operating with the &quot;Hornet&quot; group, she supported three actions that repelled enemy thrusts at Guadalcanal: the Buin-Faisi-Tonolai Raid; the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands; and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (Third Savo).

===Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands===
The ship&#x27;s first major action was the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October. On 24 October, &#x27;s task force had combined with &#x27;s group to reform TF 61 under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid. This force positioned itself north of the Santa Cruz Islands to intercept enemy units that might attempt to close Guadalcanal. Meanwhile, on Guadalcanal, the Japanese achieved a breakthrough during the Battle for Henderson Field on the night of 25 October. That success evidently was a signal for Japanese ships to approach the island.

Early on the morning of 26 October, U.S. carrier planes spotted the Japanese force and immediately attacked it, damaging two carriers (CVL and CV ), one heavy cruiser (CA ) and two destroyers, but while American aircraft were locating and engaging the enemy, American ships were also under fire. Shortly after 10:00, some 27 enemy aircraft attacked &quot;Hornet&quot;. Though &quot;Juneau&quot; and other screen ships threw up an effective anti-aircraft (AA) barrage which shot down about 20 of the attackers, &quot;Hornet&quot; was badly damaged and sank the next day. Just before noon, &quot;Juneau&quot; left &quot;Hornet&quot;″s escort for the beleaguered &quot;Enterprise&quot; group several miles away. &quot;Juneau&quot; helped repel four Japanese attacks that lost 18 planes.

That evening, the American forces retired to the southeast. Although the battle had been costly, it had, combined with the Marine victory on Guadalcanal, turned back the attempted Japanese parry in the Solomons. Furthermore, the damaging of two Japanese carriers sharply reduced their air power in the subsequent battle of Guadalcanal.

===Naval Battle of Guadalcanal===
On 8 November, &quot;Juneau&quot; departed Nouméa, New Caledonia, as a unit of TF 67 under the command of Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner to escort reinforcements to Guadalcanal. The force arrived there early morning on 12 November, and &quot;Juneau&quot; took up her station in the protective screen around the transports and cargo vessels. Unloading proceeded unmolested until 14:05, when 30 Japanese planes attacked the alerted United States group. The AA fire was effective, and &quot;Juneau&quot; alone accounted for six enemy torpedo bombers shot down. The few remaining Japanese planes were, in turn, attacked by American fighters; only one bomber escaped. Later in the day, an American attack group of cruisers and destroyers cleared Guadalcanal on reports that a large enemy surface force was headed for the island. At 01:48 on 13 November, Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan&#x27;s relatively small landing support group engaged the enemy. The Japanese force consisted of two battleships, one light cruiser, and nine destroyers.


Because of bad weather and confused communications, the battle occurred in near-pitch darkness and at almost point-blank range, as the ships of the two sides became intermingled. During the melee, &quot;Juneau&quot; was struck on the port side by a torpedo launched by , causing a severe list, and necessitating withdrawal. Before noon on 13 November, &quot;Juneau&quot;, along with two other cruisers damaged in the battle— and —headed toward Espiritu Santo for repairs. &quot;Juneau&quot; was steaming on one screw, keeping station 800 yd (730 m) off the starboard quarter of the likewise severely damaged &quot;San Francisco&quot;. She was down by the bow, but able to maintain 13 kn (15 mph, 24 km/h).

A few minutes after 11:00, two torpedoes were launched from . These were intended for &quot;San Francisco&quot;, but both passed ahead of her. One struck &quot;Juneau&quot; in the same place that had been hit during the battle. There was a great explosion; &quot;Juneau&quot; broke in two and disappeared in just 20 seconds. Fearing more attacks from &quot;I-26&quot;, and wrongly assuming from the massive explosion that there were no survivors, &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot; departed without attempting to rescue any survivors. In fact, more than 100 sailors had survived the sinking of &quot;Juneau&quot;. They were left to fend for themselves in the open ocean for eight days before rescue aircraft belatedly arrived. While awaiting rescue, all but 10 died from the elements and shark attacks. Among those lost were the five Sullivan brothers. Two of the brothers apparently survived the sinking only to die in the water; two presumably went down with the ship. Some reports indicate the fifth brother also survived the sinking, but disappeared during the first night when he left a raft and got into the water. On 20 November 1942, recovered two of the ten survivors. Five more in a raft were rescued by a PBY Seaplane away. Three others, including a badly wounded officer, made it to San Cristobal (now Makira) Island, about away from the sinking. One of the survivors recovered by &quot;Ballard&quot; said he had been with one of the Sullivan brothers for several days after the sinking.

==Wreck==
The wreck of &quot;Juneau&quot; was located on 17 March 2018 by Paul Allen&#x27;s research crew on board RV &quot;Petrel&quot;. The cruiser rests below the surface off the Solomon Islands in several large pieces.

==Awards==
&quot;Juneau&quot; received four battle stars for her service in World War II.

==Legacy==
In November 2013, Building 77 at the former federal shipyard in Kearny, New Jersey was renamed the USS &quot;Juneau&quot; Memorial Center, and now houses Hudson County&#x27;s Office of Emergency Management.

<doc id="284498" wikidata="Q958399" url="?curid=284498" title="Vance Hartke">
<text>Rupert Vance Hartke (May 31, 1919July 27, 2003) was an American politician who served as a Democratic United States Senator from Indiana from 1959 until 1977. Hartke was elected to the Senate after serving as the mayor of Evansville, Indiana. In the Senate, he supported the Great Society and became a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War. Hartke ran for president in the 1972 Democratic primaries but withdrew after the first set of primaries. He left the Senate after losing his 1976 reelection campaign to Richard Lugar.

==Early life, education, military service==
Hartke was born on May 31, 1919, in Stendal, Indiana, the son of Ida Mary (Egbert), an organist, and Hugo Leonard Hartke, a teacher. His paternal grandparents were German, as were all of his maternal great-grandparents. He attended public schools in Stendal. He graduated from Evansville College (now the University of Evansville) in 1940, and served in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard from 1942 to 1946, rising from seaman to lieutenant. Hartke graduated from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law in 1948.

==Legal and political career==
After joining the Indiana State Bar in 1948, Hartke began practicing law in Evansville. He also worked as deputy prosecuting attorney of Vanderburgh County (1950–1951) and mayor of Evansville (1956–1958), integrating the city swimming pools, before being elected to the United States Senate in 1958 and reelected in 1964 and 1970.

==Senate service and later life==

In the Senate, Hartke was best known for his opposition to the Vietnam War and his chairmanship of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. He fell out with President Lyndon Johnson when he became one of the Vietnam War&#x27;s first opponents.

Hartke was elected to the Senate in 1958 at age 39, defeating Republican Governor Harold Handley. He became known as a hard-working, liberal Democrat with a strong relationship with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. In his first term, Hartke was a member of the Finance and Commerce committees, lobbied for programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Hartke was reelected over state Senator Russell Bontrager in 1964, becoming only the third Indiana Democrat, after Benjamin Franklin Shively in 1914 and Frederick Van Nuys in 1938, to be popularly elected to a second Senate term. He helped create student loan programs and new veterans&#x27; benefits during his second term. He helped to establish Amtrak as chair of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation.

After his sister, Ruth E. Hartke, was killed in a head-on crash in Ohio in 1964 while working his campaign, Hartke used his chairmanship of Commerce Transportation Subcommittee to require that automakers equip cars with seat belts and other safety equipment. He also was instrumental in creating the International Executive Service Corps, an organization modeled after the Peace Corps that sent retired U.S. businessmen to poor countries to help turn small businesses into larger ones.

Hartke was credited with important roles in passing measures that created or supported student loan programs, veterans&#x27; benefits, and the Head Start Program. He introduced a bill to create the George Washington Peace Academy and a Department of Peace. The concept became known as the first cornerstone for the campaign that led to the creation of the U.S. Institute of Peace.

Hartke was praised for winning passage of a measure making kidney dialysis more widely available. A statement entered into the Congressional Record in honor of his 80th birthday credited the measure with saving 500,000 lives.

His opposition to the Vietnam War was not popular in Indiana. In 1970, after a very bitter and tight race against Republican Congressman Richard L. Roudebush and a ballot recount, Hartke won a third term by 4,283 votes. In 1972, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination against Senators Edmund Muskie and George McGovern. In 1976, after narrowly surviving a primary challenge by freshman Eighth District Congressman Philip Hayes, Hartke lost the general Senate election to Indianapolis Mayor Richard Lugar in a landslide. Until Joe Donnelly was elected in 2012, Hartke was the most recent Indiana Democrat, aside from a member of the Bayh family, to be elected to and serve in the Senate.

In 1994, Hartke pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor election fraud charge in southeastern Indiana&#x27;s Dearborn County. During the previous November&#x27;s general election, a Kentucky-based casino firm had employed him as a consultant to support it during a casino-legalization referendum.

Hartke wrote three books—&quot;The American Crisis in Vietnam&quot;, &quot;You and Your Senator&quot;, and &quot;Inside the New Frontier&quot;, the last co-authored with John M. Redding.

==Personal life and death==
Hartke and his wife, Martha, had seven children. Their daughter Anita Hartke was the 2008 Democratic nominee for the United States House of Representatives from the 7th congressional district of Virginia. She lost to the Republican incumbent, Eric Cantor.

<text>Gotland (; ; &quot;Gutland&quot; in Gutnish), also historically spelled Gottland or Gothland (), is Sweden&#x27;s largest island. It is also a province/county (Swedish län), municipality, and diocese. The province includes the islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the Karlsö Islands (Lilla and Stora) to the west. The population is 61,023 (2024) of which about 23,600 live in Visby, the main town. Outside Visby, there are minor settlements and a mainly rural population. The island of Gotland and the other areas of the province of Gotland make up less than one percent of Sweden&#x27;s total land area. The county formed by the archipelago is the second smallest by area and is the least populated in Sweden. In spite of the small size due to its narrow width, the driving distance between the furthermost points of the populated islands is about .

Gotland is a fully integrated part of Sweden with no particular autonomy, unlike several other offshore island groups in Europe. Historically, there was a linguistic difference between the archipelago and the mainland with Gutnish being the native language. In recent centuries, Swedish took over almost entirely and the island is virtually monolingually Swedish in modern times. The archipelago is a very popular domestic tourist destination for mainland Swedes, with the population rising to very high numbers during summers. Some of the reasons are the sunny climate and the extensive shoreline bordering mild waters. During summer, Visby hosts the political event Almedalen Week, followed by the Medieval Week, further boosting visitor numbers. In winter, Gotland usually remains surrounded by ice-free water and has mild weather.

Gotland has been inhabited since approximately 7200 BCE. The island&#x27;s main sources of income are agriculture, food processing, tourism, information technology services, design, and some heavy industry such as concrete production from locally mined limestone. From a military standpoint, it occupies a strategic location at the center of the Baltic Sea and is home to the Gotland Regiment which was re-established in 2018.

==Etymology==

The name of Gotland is closely related to that of the Geats and Goths.

== History ==
=== Prehistoric time to Viking Age ===
The island was the home of the Gutes, and sites such as the Ajvide Settlement show that it has been occupied since prehistory. A DNA study conducted on the 5,000-year-old skeletal remains of three Middle Neolithic seal hunters from Gotland showed that they were related to modern-day Finns, while a farmer from Gökhem parish in Västergötland on the mainland was found to be more closely related to modern-day Mediterraneans. This is consistent with the spread of agricultural peoples from the Middle East at about that time.
Gutasaga contains legends of how the island was settled by Þieluar and populated by his descendants. It also tells that a third of the population had to emigrate and settle in southern Europe, a tradition associated with the migration of the Goths, whose name has the same origin as &quot;Gutes&quot;, the native name of the people of the island. It later tells that the Gutes voluntarily submitted to the king of Sweden and asserts that the submission was based on mutual agreement, and notes the duties and obligations of the Swedish King and Bishop in relationship to Gotland. According to some historians, it is therefore an effort not only to write down the history of Gotland, but also to assert Gotland&#x27;s independence from Sweden.

It gives Awair Strabain as the name of the man who arranged the mutually beneficial agreement with the king of Sweden; the event would have taken place before the end of the ninth century, when Wulfstan of Hedeby reported that the island was subject to the Swedes:

The number of Arab dirhams discovered on the island of Gotland alone is astoundingly high. In the various hoards located around the island, there are more of these silver coins than at any other site in Western Eurasia. The total sum is almost as great as the number that has been unearthed in the entire Muslim world. These coins moved north through trade between Rus merchants and the Abbasid Caliphate, along the Silver-Fur Road, and the money made by Scandinavian merchants would help northern Europe, especially Viking Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire, as major commercial centers for the next several centuries.

The Berezan&#x27; Runestone, discovered in 1905 in Ukraine, was made by a Varangian (Viking) trader named Grani in memory of his business partner Karl. It is assumed that they were from Gotland.

==== Notable archaeological findings ====
The Mästermyr chest, an important artefact from the Viking Age, was found in Gotland.

On 16July 1999, the world&#x27;s largest Viking silver treasure, the Spillings Hoard, was found in a field at Spillings farm northwest of Slite. The silver treasure was divided into two parts weighing a total of ( and ) and consisted mostly of coins, about 14,000, from foreign countries, mostly Islamic. It also contained about of bronze objects along with numerous everyday objects such as nails, glass beads, parts of tools, pottery, iron bands and clasps. The treasure was found by using a metal detector, and the finders fee, given to the farmer who owned the land, was over 2 million kronor (about US$308,000). The treasure was found almost by accident while filming a news report for TV4 about illegal treasure hunting on Gotland.

=== Middle Ages ===

Early on, Gotland became a commercial center, with the town of Visby the most important Hanseatic city in the Baltic Sea. In late medieval times, the island had twenty district courts (tings), each represented by its elected judge at the island-ting, called &quot;landsting&quot;. New laws were decided at the landsting, which also took other decisions regarding the island as a whole. The earliest recorded law for the island is Gutalagen, which was written around 1220 CE and remained in use until 1645 when Sweden regained control of the island from Denmark.

The city of Visby and rest of the island were governed separately, and a civil war caused by conflicts between the German merchants in Visby and the peasants they traded with in the countryside had to be put down by King Magnus III of Sweden in 1288. In 1361, Valdemar Atterdag of Denmark invaded the island. About 1,500 Gotlandic farmers were killed by the Danish invaders after massing for the Battle of Mästerby. The Victual Brothers occupied the island in 1394 to set up a stronghold as a headquarters of their own in Visby. At last, Gotland became a fief of the Teutonic Knights, awarded to them on the condition that they expel the piratical Victual Brothers from their fortified sanctuary. An invading army of Teutonic Knights conquered the island in 1398, destroying Visby and driving the Victual Brothers from Gotland. In 1409, Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen of the Teutonic Knights guaranteed peace with the Kalmar Union of Scandinavia by selling the island of Gotland to Queen Margaret of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

The authority of the landsting was successively eroded after the island was occupied by the Teutonic Order, then sold to Eric of Pomerania and after 1449 ruled by Danish governors. In late medieval times, the ting consisted of twelve representatives for the farmers, free-holders or tenants.

=== Early modern period ===

Since the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, the island has remained under Swedish rule.

On 19 September 1806, Gustav IV Adolf offered the sovereignty of Gotland to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, who had been expelled from Malta in 1798, but the Order rejected the offer since it would have meant renouncing their claim to Malta. The Order never regained its territory, and eventually it reestablished itself in Rome as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

On 22 April 1808, during the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, a Russian army landed on the southeastern shores of Gotland near Grötlingbo. Under command of Nikolai Andreevich Bodisko 1,800 Russians took the city of Visby without any combat or engagement, and occupied the island. A Swedish naval force rescue expedition was sent from Karlskrona under the command of admiral Rudolf Cederström with 2,000 men; the island was liberated and the Russians capitulated. Russian forces left the island on 18 May 1808.

== Administration ==
The traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes today, but are historical and cultural entities. In the case of Gotland, however, due to its insular position, the administrative county (&quot;län&quot;), Gotland County, and the municipality (&quot;kommun&quot;), Region Gotland, both cover the same territory as the province. Furthermore, the diocese of Visby is also congruent with the province. Gotland is traditionally divided into 92 sockens. On 1January 2016, they were all reconstituted into Districts, administrative areas with the same borders as the former sockens.

== Heraldry ==

Gotland was granted its arms in about 1560. The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: &quot;Azure a ram statant Argent armed Or holding on a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third.&quot; The county was granted the same coat of arms in 1936. The municipality, created in 1971, uses the same picture, but with other tinctures.

== Geography ==

Gotland is Sweden&#x27;s largest island, and it is the largest island fully encompassed by the Baltic Sea (with Denmark&#x27;s Zealand at the Baltic&#x27;s edge). With its total area of the island of Gotland and the other areas of the province of Gotland make up 0.8% of Sweden&#x27;s total land area. The province includes the small islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the Karlsö Islands, (Lilla and Stora) to the west, which are even smaller. The island of Gotland has an area of , whereas the province has [ of land excluding the lakes and rivers]. The population is 61,001 as of December 2021. As of 2016, approximately 23,600 people (about 40% of residents) lived in Visby, which is the seat of the municipality and the capital of the county.

Gotland is located about east of the Swedish mainland and about from the Baltic states, Latvia being the nearest. Gotland is the name of the main island, but the adjacent islands are generally considered part of Gotland and the Gotlandic culture:
* Furillen
* Fårö
* Gotska Sandön, a National park of Sweden
* The Karlsö Islands (Stora Karlsö and Lilla Karlsö)
* Laus holmar
* Ytterholmen
* Östergarnsholm

There are several shallow lakes located near the shores of the island. The biggest is Lake Bästeträsk, located near Fleringe in the northern part of Gotland. The Hoburg Shoal bird reserve is situated on the southern tip of the island. The highest point of the island is Lojsta Hed which stands above sea level. The average height of the island is 29 meters.

Settlements besides Visby include:

* Burgsvik
* Fårösund
* Hemse
* Klintehamn
* Roma
* Slite
* Tofta
* Vibble

Of these, Hemse is the largest settlement in southern Gotland and along with Roma the two largest inland villages. Burgsvik is the southernmost locality and Fårösund the northernmost. The island of Fårö is permanently settled, but with only a few hundred year-round residents and lacks a permanent fixed link to the main island. Residents are depending on an around the clock, free of charge, car ferry for transportation over a strait roughly wide, taking about eight minutes. Fårö may get connected to the main island with a bridge in the future, but the project has had plenty of delays related to funding. At the closest point, the two islands are separated by less than , although that is at a distance from road connections.

Slite is the largest settlement on Gotland&#x27;s sparsely populated east coast. The eastern coast of Gotland, including the adjacent marine waters and islets, has been designated an 150,000 ha Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a suite of waterfowl, waders and terns.

=== Climate ===

Gotland has a semi-continental variety of a marine climate (Cfb). This results in larger seasonal differences than typical of marine climates in spite of it being surrounded by the Baltic Sea for large distances in all directions. This is due to strong continental winds travelling over the sea from surrounding great landmasses.
Seasonal temperature variation is smaller in more isolated places on the island such as Hoburgen or Östergarnsholm, having warmer autumn and winter, but are cooler during spring and summer days. 
Seasonal lag being exceptionally strong in the weather station Östergarnsholm. As an example, December is warmer than March with temperature lows being similar to April. August is typically the warmest month, an unusual occurrence in Swedish sites. In capital Visby, July and August temperatures tend to be quite even.

Since winters usually remain just above freezing and brackish water remaining liquid longer than freshwater, the sea remains ice-free all year round, except during rare extreme cold waves. The last time the whole passage from the mainland to Gotland froze was in 1987 when icebreakers were used to maintain passenger and goods traffic to the island.



=== Geology ===

Gotland is made up of a sequence of sedimentary rocks of a Silurian age, dipping to the south-east.
The main Silurian succession of limestones and shales comprises thirteen units spanning of stratigraphic thickness, being thickest in the south, and overlies a thick Ordovician sequence.

It was deposited in a shallow, hot, and salty sea on the edge of an equatorial continent. The water depth never exceeded , and became shallower over time as bioherm detritus and terrestrial sediments filled the basin. Reef growth started in the Llandovery Epoch, when the sea was , and reefs continued to dominate the sedimentary record. Some sandstones are present in the youngest rocks towards the south of the island, which represent sand bars deposited very close to the shoreline.

The lime rocks have been weathered into characteristic karstic rock formations known as rauks. Fossils, mainly of crinoids, rugose corals and brachiopods, are abundant throughout the island; palæo-sea-stacks are preserved in places.

== Economy ==

The island&#x27;s main sources of income are agriculture along with food processing, tourism, IT solutions, design and some heavy industry such as concrete production from locally mined limestone. Most of Gotland&#x27;s economy is based on small scale production.
In 2012, there were over 7,500 registered companies on Gotland. 1,500 of these had more than one employee. Gotland has the world&#x27;s northernmost established vineyard and winery, located in Hablingbo.

== Military ==
Gotland occupies a strategic location in the Baltic sea from a defence viewpoint. In March 2015, the Swedish government decided to begin reestablishing a permanent military presence on Gotland, starting with an initial 150 troop garrison, consisting primarily of elements from the Swedish Army. It has been reported that the bulk of this initial garrison will make up a new motorised rifle battalion, alternatively referred to in other reports as a &quot;modular-structured rapid response Army battalion&quot;. A later report claimed that plans were at an advanced stage for a support helicopter squadron and an Air Force &quot;fast response Gripen jet squadron&quot; to also be based on the island to support the new garrison and further reinforce the defences. Prior to the disbandment of the original garrison, there had been a continuous Swedish military presence on Gotland in one form or another, for nearly 200 years.

After the standing down of the original garrison, a battalion of the Swedish Home Guard is based on Gotland for emergencies as part of the Eastern Military Region (&quot;MR E&quot;). The unit, &quot;32:a Gotlandsbataljonen&quot; (the 32nd Gotland battalion), acts as a reserve component of the Swedish Amphibious Corps. Among the residual war reserve stocks reported to be still in storage on Gotland in March 2015, were 14 tanks (Stridsvagn 122s) at the &quot;Tofta skjutfält&quot; (the Tofta firing range), but without any crews or dedicated maintenance personnel assigned to them.
Gotland currently has no local air defence capability. Despite its importance as a naval base in the past, , there are no naval units based on Gotland. The Tofta firing range itself (also known as the Tofta Tank firing range), is a military training ground which is located south of Visby. Another less common name for the range is the Toftasjön firing range. Tracing its origins back to 1898, the range extended over . It was a major training and storage facility for the Gotland garrison during its existence, and was still occasionally used for training by various elements of the Armed Forces since the garrison was shut down in 2005. However, from the second half of 2014 onwards, there has been a marked increase in the use of the range, especially by armored units (mostly company sized), as tensions in Northeastern Europe have escalated. At least one of the buildings on the range, the former tank repair shop, is currently owned by a private company (Peab), with the military renting back the top floor for its own use.
When not used by the military, a number of cultural and sports events have been held at the range, one of the most notable being the , the world&#x27;s largest enduro race, from 1984 to 2023. 

During the late 2010s and early 2020s, Gotland has seen an increased focus on its strategic importance and an increase in military spending. The Gotland Regiment was re-established in 2018, the first time since World War II that a new regiment has been established in Sweden. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and Sweden&#x27;s accession to NATO, military readiness on Gotland increased, with the Swedish government spending 150 million euros to expand military infrastructure on the island.

== Tourism ==

The first modern day tourists came to Gotland during the 19th century and were known as &quot;bathers&quot;. Gotland became very popular with socialites at the time through Princess Eugenie who lived in Västerhejde, in the west part of the island from the 1860s.

When a new law ensuring two weeks vacation for all employees in Sweden was passed in 1938, camping became a popular pastime among the Swedes, and in 1955, Gotland was visited by 80,000 people. In the 1970s mostly young people were attracted to Gotland. Since 2010 the island has become a more versatile vacation spot visited by people from all over the world, in all manner of ways.

In 2001, it was the fifth largest tourist destination in Sweden based on the total number of guest nights. Gotland is usually the part of Sweden which receives the most hours of sunlight during a year with Visby statistically the location with the most sunshine in Sweden. In 2007 approximately 750,000 people visited Gotland.

In 1996, for the first time, ferries between Gotland and mainland Sweden carried more than 1 million passengers in a year. In 2007, the number of passengers exceeded 1.5 million. In 2012, the ferries had 1,590,271 passengers and the airlines 327,255 passengers. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic tourism did not change much as Swedes chose to visit the island instead of travelling abroad.
=== Cruise ships and new pier ===

The main port of call on Gotland is Visby. The city is visited by a number of cruise ships every year. About 40 cruise lines frequent the Baltic sea with Visby as one of their destinations. In 2005, 147 ships docked at Visby, in 2010 the number was 69. In 2014, 62 ships are scheduled to visit Visby. The decrease in visiting ships is due to the fact that the modern cruise ships are too large to enter Visby harbor. Ships must anchor a fair distance from shore whereupon passengers are shuttled to shore in small boats, which is not possible during bad weather. In 2007, the first proposition for building a new pier at Visby harbor, large enough to serve the modern cruise ships, was made. In 2011, the matter of the new pier was discussed in the Riksdag and in 2012 research and planning for the pier began. In January 2014, a letter of intent for building a new cruise pier in Visby harbor was signed by Region Gotland and Copenhagen Malmö Port (CMP). The pier was finished in 2018. The estimated cost is 250 million crowns (about US$38.52 million).

== Culture ==
A number of stones with grooves exist on Gotland. Archaeologists interpret these grooves as traces of an unknown industrial process in the High Middle Ages. There are approximately 3,700 grinding grooves, of which about 750 occur in the solid limestone outcrop and the rest in other rock formations. The latter often consist of hard rocks such as granite or gneiss, but also soft rocks such as sandstone occur. Grinding grooves are also found in Skåne, in southern Sweden and in Finland. Astronomer Göran Henriksson dates a number of these grinding grooves to the Stone Age, from to , based on astronomical alignments, although his methodology has been heavily criticized.

The Medieval town of Visby has been entered as a site of the UNESCO World heritage programme. An impressive feature of Visby is the fortress wall that surrounds the old city, dating from the 13th century.

Many of the residents still speak Gutnish (Gutamål), the autochthonous language on the islands. But most of them now speak Gotlandic (), a Gutnish-influenced Swedish dialect. In the 13th century, a work containing the laws of the island, called &quot;the Gotlandic law&quot; (Gutalagen), was published in Old Gutnish, as well as the Gutasaga.

Gotland is noted for its 94 Medieval churches, most of which are restored and in active use. These churches exhibit two major styles of architecture: Romanesque and Gothic. The older churches were constructed in the Romanesque style from 1150 to 1250. The newer churches were constructed in the Gothic architectural style that prevailed from about 1250–1400. The oldest painting inside one of the churches on Gotland stretches as far back in time as the 12th century.

Traditional games of skill like Kubb, Pärk, and Varpa are played on Gotland. They are part of what has become called &quot;Gutniska Lekar&quot;, and are performed preferably on the Midsummer&#x27;s Eve celebration on the island, but also throughout the summer months. The games have widespread renown; some of them are played by people as far away as in the United States.

The knotwork design subsequently named the &quot;Valknut&quot; has the most attested historic instances on picture stones in Gotland, which include being on both the Stora Hammars I and the Tängelgårda stones.
Gotland also has a rich heritage of folklore, including myths about the bysen, &quot;Di sma undar jordi&quot;, Hoburgsgubben and the Martebo lights.

Gotland gives its name to the traditional farmhouse ale Gotlandsdricka, a turbid beer with much in common with Finnish sahti, and related beers from the Baltic states.

== Notable people ==

There are a number of notable people born or living on Gotland, or in other major ways associated with the island.

== Sport ==
=== Events ===
* Gotland competes in the biennial Island Games, which it hosted in 1999 and 2017.
* Round Gotland Race-sailing event (&quot;ÅF Offshore Race&quot;) starting at Stockholm, around the island of Gotland and back.
* (GGN) is an annual enduro race on Gotland. GGN is a part of the Swedish &quot;enduroklassikern&quot; (enduro classics, Ränneslättsloppet, Stångebroslaget and Gotland Grand National). GNN is the world&#x27;s largest enduro race.
* Stånga Games are annual games for Gotlandic sports. The games are held during five days each summer in Stånga. The games are unofficially called &quot;the Gotland Olympic Games&quot;. Some of the sports at the Stånga Games are pärk, varpa and caber toss.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Long Ships&quot;, or &quot;Red Orm&quot; (original title: &quot;Röde Orm&quot;), a best-selling Swedish novel written by Frans G. Bengtsson, contains a vivid description of Gotland in the Viking Age. A section of the book is devoted to a Viking ship setting out to Russia, stopping on its way at Gotland and engaging a pilot from the island who plays an important part in their voyage. Gotlanders of the Viking era are depicted as city people, more sophisticated and cosmopolitan than other Scandinavians of their time, and proud of their knowledge and skills.

Naomi Mitchison, in her autobiographic book &quot;You may well ask&quot;, relates an experience during a walking tour in Sweden: &quot;Over in Gotland I walked again, further than I would have if I had realized that the milestones were in old Swedish miles, so that my disappointing three-mile walk along the cold sea edge under the strange ancient fortifications was really fifteen English miles [24 km]&quot;.

The crime novels of Mari Jungstedt, featuring Detective Superintendent Anders Knutas, are set on Gotland.

In the &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; video game modification &quot;Invasion Gotland&quot;, the Soviet Union invades Gotland in 1977.

For the 1989 Studio Ghibli film, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, by Hayao Miyazaki, he and other illustrators spent time in Gotland in preparation for animation.

== Astronomy ==
A number of asteroids in the main-belt are named after places on Gotland or Gotlanders, such as 10795 Babben, 3250 Martebo and 7545 Smaklösa. Most of them have been named by Swedish astronomer Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist, a summer resident on Gotland. All the Gotlandic names are vividly described in NASA&#x27;s JPL Small-Body Database in connection to each asteroid.
