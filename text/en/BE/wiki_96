<text>In mathematics, a cube root of a number is a number that has the given number as its third power; that is formula_1 The number of cube roots of a number depends on the number system that is considered.

Every nonzero real number has exactly one real cube root that is denoted formula_2 and called the &quot;real cube root&quot; of or simply &quot;the cube root&quot; of in contexts where complex numbers are not considered. For example, the real cube roots of and are respectively and . The real cube root of an integer or of a rational number is generally not a rational number, neither a constructible number.

Every nonzero real or complex number has exactly three cube roots that are complex numbers. If the number is real, one of the cube roots is real and the two other are nonreal complex conjugate numbers. Otherwise, the three cube roots are all nonreal. For example, the real cube root of is and the other cube roots of are formula_3 and formula_4. The three cube roots of are 
formula_5 and formula_6 The number zero has a unique cube root, which is zero itself.

The cube root is a multivalued function. The &quot;principal cube root&quot; is its principal value, that is a unique cube root that has been chosen once for all. The principal cube root is the cube root with the largest real part. In the case of negative real numbers, the largest real part is shared by the two nonreal cube roots, and the principal cube root is the one with positive imaginary part. So, for negative real numbers, &quot;the real cube root is not the principal cube root&quot;. For positive real numbers, the principal cube root is the real cube root.

If is any cube root of the complex number , the other cube roots are formula_7 and formula_8

In an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from three, every nonzero element has exactly three cube roots, which can be obtained from any of them by multiplying it by either root of the polynomial formula_9 In an algebraically closed field of characteristic three, every element has exactly one cube root.

In other number systems or other algebraic structures, a number or element may have more than three cube roots. For example, in the quaternions, a real number has infinitely many cube roots.

==Definition==
The cube roots of a number are the numbers which satisfy the equation formula_10

==Properties==

===Real numbers===
For any real number , there is exactly one real number such that formula_11. Indeed, the cube function is increasing, so it does not give the same result for two different inputs, and covers all real numbers. In other words, it is a bijection or one-to-one correspondence. 

That is, one can define &quot;the&quot; cube root of a real number as its unique cube root that is also real. With this definition, the cube root of a negative number is a negative number. 

However this definition may be confusing when real numbers are considered as specific complex numbers, since, in this case &quot;the&quot; cube root is generally defined as the principal cube root, and the principal cube root of a negative real number is not real. 
If and are allowed to be complex, then there are three solutions (if is non-zero) and so has three cube roots. A real number has one real cube root and two further cube roots which form a complex conjugate pair. For instance, the cube roots of 1 are:

:formula_12

The last two of these roots lead to a relationship between all roots of any real or complex number. If a number is one cube root of a particular real or complex number, the other two cube roots can be found by multiplying that cube root by one or the other of the two complex cube roots of 1.

===Complex numbers===

For complex numbers, the principal cube root is usually defined as the cube root that has the greatest real part, or, equivalently, the cube root whose argument has the least absolute value. It is related to the principal value of the natural logarithm by the formula

:formula_13

If we write as

:formula_14

where is a non-negative real number and formula_15 lies in the range

:formula_16,

then the principal complex cube root is

:formula_17

This means that in polar coordinates, we are taking the cube root of the radius and dividing the polar angle by three in order to define a cube root. With this definition, the principal cube root of a negative number is a complex number, and for instance formula_18 will not be −2, but rather formula_19

This difficulty can also be solved by considering the cube root as a multivalued function: if we write the original complex number in three equivalent forms, namely

:formula_20
The principal complex cube roots of these three forms are then respectively

:formula_21

Unless , these three complex numbers are distinct, even though the three representations of &quot;x&quot; were equivalent. For example, formula_18 may then be calculated to be −2, formula_23, or formula_24.

This is related with the concept of monodromy: if one follows by continuity the function &quot;cube root&quot; along a closed path around zero, after a turn the value of the cube root is multiplied (or divided) by formula_25

==Impossibility of compass-and-straightedge construction==

Cube roots arise in the problem of finding an angle whose measure is one third that of a given angle (angle trisection) and in the problem of finding the edge of a cube whose volume is twice that of a cube with a given edge (doubling the cube). In 1837 Pierre Wantzel proved that neither of these can be done with a compass-and-straightedge construction.

==Numerical methods==
Newton&#x27;s method is an iterative method that can be used to calculate the cube root. For real floating-point numbers this method reduces to the following iterative algorithm to produce successively better approximations of the cube root of :

:formula_26

The method is simply averaging three factors chosen such that
:formula_27
at each iteration.

Halley&#x27;s method improves upon this with an algorithm that converges more quickly with each iteration, albeit with more work per iteration:

:formula_28

This converges cubically, so two iterations do as much work as three iterations of Newton&#x27;s method. Each iteration of Newton&#x27;s method costs two multiplications, one addition and one division, assuming that is precomputed, so three iterations plus the precomputation require seven multiplications, three additions, and three divisions.

Each iteration of Halley&#x27;s method requires three multiplications, three additions, and one division, so two iterations cost six multiplications, six additions, and two divisions. Thus, Halley&#x27;s method has the potential to be faster if one division is more expensive than three additions.

With either method a poor initial approximation of can give very poor algorithm performance, and coming up with a good initial approximation is somewhat of a black art. Some implementations manipulate the exponent bits of the floating-point number; i.e. they arrive at an initial approximation by dividing the exponent by 3.

Also useful is this generalized continued fraction, based on the nth root method:

If is a good first approximation to the cube root of and formula_29, then:

:formula_30
:formula_31

The second equation combines each pair of fractions from the first into a single fraction, thus doubling the speed of convergence.

==Appearance in solutions of third and fourth degree equations==

Cubic equations, which are polynomial equations of the third degree (meaning the highest power of the unknown is 3) can always be solved for their three solutions in terms of cube roots and square roots (although simpler expressions only in terms of square roots exist for all three solutions, if at least one of them is a rational number). If two of the solutions are complex numbers, then all three solution expressions involve the real cube root of a real number, while if all three solutions are real numbers then they may be expressed in terms of the complex cube root of a complex number.

Quartic equations can also be solved in terms of cube roots and square roots.

==History==

The calculation of cube roots can be traced back to Babylonian mathematicians from as early as 1800 BCE. In the fourth century BCE Plato posed the problem of doubling the cube, which required a compass-and-straightedge construction of the edge of a cube with twice the volume of a given cube; this required the construction, now known to be impossible, of the length formula_32.

A method for extracting cube roots appears in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, a Chinese mathematical text compiled around the second century BCE and commented on by Liu Hui in the third century CE. The Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria devised a method for calculating cube roots in the first century CE. His formula is again mentioned by Eutokios in a commentary on Archimedes. In 499 CE Aryabhata, a mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, gave a method for finding the cube root of numbers having many digits in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; (section 2.5).

<doc id="292511" wikidata="Q233966" url="?curid=292511" title="Princess Caroline of Monaco">
<text>Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco (born 23 January 1957) is Princess of Hanover by marriage to Prince Ernst August. As the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and Grace Kelly, she is the elder sister of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Princess Stéphanie.

She was Hereditary Princess of Monaco and heir presumptive to the Monegasque throne from her birth in 1957 until her brother Albert was born the following year, and again from Albert&#x27;s accession in 2005 until the birth of his twins, her niece Gabriella and nephew Jacques, in 2014.

==Family and early life==

Caroline was born on 23 January 1957 in the Prince&#x27;s Palace, Monaco. She is the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his wife, former American actress Grace Kelly. Christened Caroline Louise Marguerite, she belongs to the House of Grimaldi. She was the heiress presumptive from her birth to 14 March 1958, when her brother Prince Albert was born. On 1 February 1965, her younger sister Princess Stéphanie was born. Caroline is a legitimate patrilineal descendant of the Dukes of Polignac, and as such belongs to the historical French nobility. Through her mother, she is of Irish and German descent.

In an interview for &quot;People&quot; in April 1982, shortly before her death, Grace described Caroline and Stéphanie as &quot;warm, bright, amusing, intelligent and capable girls. They&#x27;re very much in tune with their era. Besides being good students, they are good athletes – excellent skiers and swimmers. Both can cook and sew and play the piano and ride a horse. But, above all, my children are good sports, conscious of their position and considerate of others. They are sympathetic to the problems and concerns in the world today.&quot;

As a child, Caroline spent time at the home of her maternal grandparents, John B. Kelly, Sr. and Margaret Kelly (née, Majer), in Philadelphia. In addition to visiting her mother&#x27;s family in the United States, she spent the summer of 1971 at Camp Oneka in the Poconos at the age of 14. While there, unbeknownst to her parents, Caroline was protected by the United States Secret Service.

Princess Grace died on 14 September 1982, the day after suffering a stroke while driving herself and Princess Stéphanie home to Monaco from a visit to France, resulting in an accident in which both were injured.

===Education===
The princess received her French baccalauréat in 1974 with honours. She was also educated at St Mary&#x27;s School Ascot. After a semester at Sciences Po, Caroline continued her studies at the Sorbonne University, where she received a diploma in philosophy and minors in psychology and biology. She is fluent in French, English, Spanish, German and Italian.

==Activities==
In 1979, Princess Caroline was appointed by her parents as the president of the Monégasque Committee for the International Year of the Child. Two years later, in 1981, Caroline founded &quot;Jeune J&#x27;écoute&quot; association. The association set up a &#x27;youth hotline&#x27; where young people can talk about their problems on the telephone with qualified people trained in dealing problems young people faced. Other philanthropic organizations Caroline has been involved with include the World Association of Children&#x27;s Friends (AMADE Mondiale), the Princess Grace Foundation, the Prince Pierre Foundation, and UNICEF.

Caroline is the Patron of Peter Le Marchant Trust, an organization that operates canal boat trips for ill and disabled people. Her other patronages include the International School of Paris, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, which she also founded, the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Association des Guides et Scouts de Monaco, the Monte Carlo Garden Club and The Spring Arts Festival. In 1992, she was appointed the president of the International Contemporary Art Prize.

Following her mother&#x27;s death in 1982, Caroline served as de facto first lady of Monaco until her brother married Charlene Wittstock in 2011. She regularly attends important social events in Monaco related to the Monégasque Princely Family, such as the National Day celebrations, the annual Rose Ball, the Red Cross Ball and the Formula One competition Monaco Grand Prix.
Due to her commitment to philanthropy and arts, Caroline was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador on 2 December 2003. The UNICEF honoured her with Children&#x27;s Champion Award on 20 May 2006. The next year, she travelled to the Republic of South Africa to meet its former president Nelson Mandela. In December 2011, the World Association of Children&#x27;s Friends honoured her for &quot;tireless endeavours in continuing the organisation&#x27;s legacy&quot;. Her personal friend and the Chanel head designer Karl Lagerfeld presented her the award. Caroline had also previously been given the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Charles, and had been appointed as the Commander of the Order of Cultural Merit.

==Personal and media life==

Caroline&#x27;s personal interests include riding, swimming and skiing. Since her youth, she has been considered an international fashion icon and one of the best dressed women in the world. In November 2011, an exhibition honouring Princess Caroline was opened at the National Museum of Monaco.

Caroline was romantically linked to many famous men, including Guillermo Vilas; Henri Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, the son of former President of France Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing; French singer Philippe Lavil; and Bobby Shriver, nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Following her divorce from Philippe Junot, she was briefly engaged to Robertino Rossellini, the son of Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman. Between her second and third marriages, Caroline had a relationship with French actor Vincent Lindon.

===First marriage===
Princess Caroline&#x27;s first husband was Philippe Junot (born 19 April 1940), a Parisian banker. They were married civilly in Monaco on 28 June 1978, and religiously on 29 June 1978. Their lavish wedding ceremony was attended by some 650 guests, including Hollywood stars Ava Gardner, Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra.

The couple divorced, childless, on 9 October 1980. In 1992, the Catholic Church granted the princess an annulment.

===Second marriage===
Her second husband was Stefano Casiraghi (8 September 1960 – 3 October 1990), the sportsman heir to an Italian industrial fortune. They were married civilly in Monaco on 29 December 1983, and had three children:

* Andrea Albert Pierre Casiraghi (born on 8 June 1984 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco). He married Tatiana Santo Domingo in a civil ceremony on 31 August 2013, at the Prince&#x27;s Palace in Monaco-Ville. The couple have three children:
** Alexandre &quot;Sasha&quot; Andrea Stefano Casiraghi (born on 21 March 2013 at Portland Hospital in London; entered the line of succession to the Monegasque throne when his parents married).
** India Casiraghi (born on 12 April 2015 in London).
** Maximilian Rainier Casiraghi (born on 19 April 2018 in Monaco).
* Charlotte Marie Pomeline Casiraghi (born on 3 August 1986 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre). Has a son with her former partner, the French actor and comedian Gad Elmaleh, and a second son with her husband, the French producer Dimitri Rassam:
** Raphaël Elmaleh (born on 17 December 2013 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).
** Balthazar Rassam (born on 23 October 2018 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).
* Pierre Rainier Stefano Casiraghi (born on 5 September 1987 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre). He married Beatrice Borromeo in a civil ceremony on 25 July 2015, in the gardens of the Prince&#x27;s Palace in Monaco-Ville. They have two children:
** Stefano Ercole Carlo Casiraghi (born on 28 February 2017 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).
** Francesco Carlo Albert Casiraghi (born on 21 May 2018 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).

The two younger children are named for their maternal great-grandparents, Princess Charlotte and Prince Pierre, while Andrea was named for a childhood friend of his father&#x27;s. Stefano Casiraghi was killed in a speed-boating accident in 1990, aged 30 years.

Even though their parents had not married in the Church, as required under canon law, their marriage was convalidated by Pope John Paul II in February 1993, eight months after their mother&#x27;s marriage to Junot had been annulled in June 1992.

Lagerfeld photographed Caroline and Casiraghi and their three children at the Villa La Vigie, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin for their fifth wedding anniversary in 1989.

===Third marriage===

Caroline&#x27;s third and current husband is Prince Ernst August of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick, head of the House of Hanover, which lost the throne of the Kingdom of Hanover in 1866. From 1913 to 1918, his family ruled the sovereign Duchy of Brunswick (until the abolition of the monarchy).

The couple married in Monaco on 23 January 1999. Ernst August had previously divorced his first wife Chantal Hochuli, with whom he had sons Prince Ernst August and Prince Christian, and who had been Caroline&#x27;s friend.

The couple have one daughter together:
* Princess Alexandra Charlotte Ulrike Maryam Virginia of Hanover (born 20 July 1999 in Vöcklabruck, Austria)

Her husband&#x27;s title as Duke of Brunswick is honorific since the ruling family of that state was removed by the Weimar Republic in 1918, along with all royal and noble German ruling families, which were still allowed to retain their titles. Neither she nor her husband has royal rank in Germany, but Monaco recognizes the Hanoverians&#x27; former German royal titles, attributing to the couple the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. On 11 January 1999, shortly before Caroline and Ernst&#x27;s wedding, his third cousin once removed (Queen Victoria was their common ancestor), Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, issued this Order in Council, &quot;My Lords, I do hereby declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Albert of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg and Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco...&quot;. As a legitimate male-line descendant of George II, Ernst August was subject to the Royal Marriages Act 1772 (repealed in 2015). Prior to the repeal of the Act, the revised form of which limits those who must gain permission to the first six people in the line of British succession, marrying without the Queen&#x27;s Royal Assent would have meant their marriage would be void in Britain, where Ernst August&#x27;s family owned substantial property and he holds (dual) citizenship.

Likewise, the Monégasque court officially notified France of Caroline&#x27;s contemplated marriage to Prince Ernst August and received assurance that there was no objection, in compliance with Article 2 of the 1918 Franco-Monégasque Treaty. Despite obtaining the official approval of the governments of France, Monaco and the United Kingdom, upon Caroline&#x27;s marriage to Ernst August he forfeited his own place in Britain&#x27;s order of succession. He is also subject to the Act of Settlement 1701, which imposes that consequence upon British dynasts who marry Roman Catholics. The Succession to the Crown Act of 2013 however removed that consequence of marrying a Roman Catholic, and would place him back in the order of succession.

In 2009, it was reported that Caroline had separated from Ernst August and returned to live in Monaco.

=== Privacy cases ===
Caroline has had a bad relationship with media and paparazzi since her youth, when she complained she &quot;could not live the life of a normal student&quot;. On 24 June 2004, the Princess obtained a judgement from the European Court of Human Rights condemning Germany for non-respect of her right to private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Caroline invoked the judgment in combination with articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the Basic Law (human dignity and personal freedom, respectively) as well as § 22 of the German Art and Photography Copyright Act or &quot;KunstUrhG&quot; (no publication of personal images without permission) in a new domestic case, attempting to get the courts to prohibit publication of certain images of her in a private setting. The Supreme Court accepted her claim with regard to two images, but did not prohibit publication of a third, stating that the image accompanied an article about a subject of public interest, which allows publication without permission per § 23 of the &quot;KunstUrhG&quot;. Caroline appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court, which affirmed the Supreme Court&#x27;s judgement. Unsatisfied with this result, Caroline filed a new complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. This time, the court found that the domestic courts had properly weighed the competing interests of Caroline&#x27;s privacy and the press&#x27; right to freedom of expression, and thus found that there had been no violation of Article 8.

===Writings===
In April 1981, the Princess penned an essay, entitled &quot;Home&quot; and published in the International Herald Tribune&#x27;s supplement. The byline was &quot;Caroline de Grimaldi.&quot; In the essay, she wrote: &quot;I long for the Mediterranean ... I feel in my bones that I belong in Monaco.&quot; The article was titled, &quot;A Compulsive Need for Blue.&quot;

==Succession issues==
Princess Caroline was heiress presumptive to the crown of Monaco until the birth of her brother&#x27;s legitimate children.

There is precedent for a Monégasque prince to adopt his own illegitimate child and thereby place that child at the head of the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, as was done for Caroline&#x27;s grandmother, Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. However, because of changes to the constitution of Monaco in 2002, this was no longer an option.

Albert&#x27;s lack of legitimate children until the 2010s prompted Prince Rainier III to change the constitution so as to ensure there would be a successor to the throne, which strengthened the places of Caroline and her descendants in the line of succession. On 2 April 2002, Monaco passed Princely Law 1.249, which provides that if the Sovereign Prince assumes the throne and then dies without a legitimate direct heir, the throne will pass to his dynastic siblings and their descendants according to the rule of male-preference cognatic primogeniture. The law was then ratified by France, as required by a 1918 Franco-Monégasque Treaty, on 4 October 2005. Before this change, the crown of Monaco could pass only to a descendant of the last reigning prince, excluding such collateral relations as siblings, nephews, and nieces.

<text>Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici (11 August 1667 – 18 February 1743) was an Italian noblewoman who was the last lineal descendant of the main branch of the House of Medici. A patron of the arts, she bequeathed the Medicis&#x27; large art collection, including the contents of the Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti and the Medici villas, which she inherited upon her brother Gian Gastone&#x27;s death in 1737, and her Palatine treasures to the Tuscan state, on the condition that no part of it could be removed from &quot;the Capital of the grand ducal State...[and from] the succession of His Serene Grand Duke.&quot;

Anna Maria Luisa was the only daughter of Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans, a niece of Louis XIII of France. On her marriage to Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, she became Electress of the Palatinate, and, by patronising musicians, she earned for the contemporary Palatine court the reputation of an important music centre. As Johann Wilhelm had syphilis the union produced no offspring, which, combined with her siblings&#x27; barrenness, meant that the Medici were on the verge of extinction.

In 1713 Cosimo III altered the Tuscan laws of succession to allow the accession of his daughter, and spent his final years canvassing the European powers to agree to recognise this statute. However, in 1735, as part of a territorial arrangement, the European powers appointed Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine as heir, and he duly ascended the Tuscan throne in her stead. After the death of Johann Wilhelm, Anna Maria Luisa returned to Florence, where she enjoyed the rank of first lady until the accession of her brother Gian Gastone, who banished her to the Villa La Quiete. When Gian Gastone died in 1737, Francis Stephen&#x27;s envoy offered Anna Maria Luisa the position of nominal regent of Tuscany, but she declined. Her death, in 1743, brought the grand ducal House of Medici to an end. Her remains were interred in the Medicean necropolis, Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, which she helped complete.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Despite her mother&#x27;s efforts to induce a miscarriage by means of riding, Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici, the only daughter and second child of Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and his consort, Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans, was born in Florence on 11 August 1667. She was named after her maternal aunt Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier.

Her parents&#x27; relationship was quarrelsome; Marguerite Louise took every chance to humiliate Cosimo. On one documented occasion, she branded him &quot;a poor groom&quot; in the presence of the Papal nuncio. The enmity between them continued until 26 December 1674; after all attempts at conciliation failed, a stressed Cosimo consented to his wife&#x27;s departure for the Convent of Montmartre, France. The contract created that day revoked her privileges as a &quot;petite fille de France&quot;, and declared that upon her death all her assets were to be inherited by her children. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation. She abandoned Tuscany in June 1675; Anna Maria Luisa, who was less than eight years old at that time, never saw her again. Although Cosimo doted on his daughter, she was raised by her paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.

===Electress of the Palatinate===
In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was considered as a potential bride to Louis, &quot;le Grand Dauphin&quot;, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III did not like the idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter&#x27;s ministers declined, fearing that Anna Maria Luisa might have inherited her mother&#x27;s temperament, and may seek to dominate Peter II while being herself intractable to reason. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.

Following refusals from Portugal, France, Spain and Savoy, James II of England put forward his brother-in-law, Francesco II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena, but the Princess deemed a duke too lowly in terms of protocol for the daughter of a &quot;grand&quot; duke. Finally, it was Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor who suggested Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. The Elector Palatine obtained the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; from the Holy Roman Emperor for Cosimo III in February 1691. (Cosimo had hitherto been outranked by the Duke of Savoy — much to his anger—who derived &quot;royal&quot; status from his successful pretendership to the abolished Cypriot throne). Consequently, Johann Wilhelm was ultimately chosen. He and Anna Maria Luisa were married by proxy on 29 April 1691. At the accompanying festivities, a contemporary describes the Electress&#x27;s physical attributes: &quot;In her person, she is tall, her complexion was fair, her eyes large and expressive, both those and her hair were black; her mouth was small, with a fullness of the lips; her teeth were as white as ivory...&quot;
She departed for Düsseldorf, her husband’s capital, on 6 May 1691, accompanied by her younger brother, Gian Gastone. Johann Wilhelm surprised her at Innsbruck, where they officially married. The Palatinate Anna Maria Luisa arrived in was ravaged by the ongoing Nine Years&#x27; War, in which Louis XIV assaulted the Palatinate on behalf of his brother, Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans, occupying the city of Philippsburg in the process.

The Electress became pregnant in 1692; however, she miscarried. It is thought incorrectly by some historians that soon after arrival she contracted syphilis from the Elector, which they think explains why Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm failed to produce any children. Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm, notwithstanding, shared a harmonious marriage. The Electress spent her time enjoying balls, musical performances and other festivities. He commissioned a theatre for her where the comedies of French playwright Molière were performed. Because Anna Maria Luisa patronised many musicians, the contemporary Palatine court enjoyed regard as an international centre of music. She invited Fortunato Chelleri to court and appointed him &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; (&quot;music teacher&quot;). Agostino Steffani, a polymath, was sponsored by the Electress from his arrival in Düsseldorf, in 1703, until her return to Tuscany; the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini library in Florence houses two editions of his chamber duets.

Anna Maria Luisa arranged a marriage for her younger brother at the instigation of their father: On 2 July 1697 Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici married Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, heiress of the eponymous duchy, in Düsseldorf. Gian Gastone&#x27;s wife repulsed him, and for that reason, they separated in 1708.

The same year as Gian Gastone&#x27;s marriage, the Peace of Ryswick ended the Nine Years&#x27; War: French troops withdrew from the Electoral Palatinate and Johann Wilhelm received the County of Megen. Following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, a document which had hitherto given rights to Calvinists, in 1685, 2,000 French Huguenots emigrated to the Electoral Palatinate. Johann Wilhelm, under criticism for his treatment of the Palatine Protestants from the Elector of Brandenburg introduced a &quot;Religionsdeklaration&quot; in 1705, which sanctioned religious freedom.

===Tuscan succession===

Cosimo III wished to alter the male-only Tuscan line of succession so as to allow the accession of his daughter, Anna Maria Luisa, in the event of a male-line succession failure. But his plan was met with fierce opposition from the European powers. Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, Tuscany&#x27;s nominal feudal over-lord, subscribed, but only if he should succeed her. Cosimo and she were at odds with the proposal. Without a concord in sight, the &quot;Tuscan question&quot; became dormant.

Some years later, as the question of the succession became more urgent, Cardinal Francesco Maria de&#x27; Medici, Cosimo III&#x27;s brother, was released from his vows and coerced into marrying Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Guastalla&#x27;s elder daughter, Eleanor, in 1709. The Electress urged him to care for his health and &quot;give us the consolation of a little prince.&quot; However, two years later, he died without issue, taking with him any hope of an heir.

Following the death of his heir apparent, Ferdinando, in 1713, Cosimo deposited a bill in the Senate, Tuscany&#x27;s titular legislature, promulgating that if Cosimo and his new heir apparent, Gian Gastone, were to predecease the Electress, she would ascend the throne. Charles VI was furious; he replied that the grand duchy was an imperial fief and therefore he alone possessed the prerogative to alter the laws of succession. To complicate things further, Elisabeth Farnese, heiress of the Duchy of Parma, the second wife of Philip V of Spain, as a great-granddaughter of Margherita de&#x27; Medici, exercised a claim to Tuscany. In May 1716, Charles VI, who constantly changed his stance on the issue, told Florence that the Electress&#x27;s succession was unquestioned, but added that Austria and Tuscany must soon reach an agreement regarding which royal house was to follow the Medici.

In June 1717, Cosimo declared his wish that the House of Este should succeed the Electress. Charles VI had previously offered the Grand Duke territorial compensation—in the form of the State of Presidi—if he chose quickly, but reneged. In 1718, Charles VI repudiated Cosimo&#x27;s decision, declaring a union of Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. Hereafter, a stalemate existed between them.

===Return to Florence===

The Elector Palatine died in June 1716. His widow, Anna Maria Luisa, returned to Florence in October 1717. Dowager Grand Princess Violante Beatrice, her brother Ferdinando&#x27;s widow, and Anna Maria Luisa did not enjoy an amiable relationship. Upon hearing of Anna Maria Luisa&#x27;s intention to return, Violante Beatrice prepared to depart for Munich, her brother&#x27;s capital, but Gian Gastone wished her to stay, so she did. To keep the two ladies from quarrelling over precedence, Cosimo III defined Violante Beatrice&#x27;s status just before the Electress&#x27;s arrival by appointing her Governess of Siena.

On 4 April 1718 Great Britain, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) selected Infante Charles of Spain, the elder child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir (with no mention of Anna Maria Luisa). By 1722, the Electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo was reduced to a spectator at the conferences for Tuscany&#x27;s future. In the midst of this, Marguerite Louise, Anna Maria Luisa&#x27;s mother, died. Instead of willing her valuables to her children, as prescribed by the 1674 agreement, they went to the Princess of Epinoy, a distant relative.

On 25 October 1723, six days before his death, Cosimo III distributed a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed uninhibited after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves the right to choose his successor. Unfortunately for Cosimo, Europe completely ignored it. Gian Gastone, now the Grand Duke, and Anna Maria Luisa were not on good terms. He despised the Electress for engineering his unhappy marriage with Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, while she detested his liberal policies: he repealed all of his father&#x27;s anti-Semitic statutes and revelled in upsetting her. Consequently, the Electress was compelled to abandon her apartment in the left wing of the Palazzo Pitti, for the Villa La Quiete. She refurbished La Quiete&#x27;s house and gardens with the assistance of Sebastiano Rapi, the gardener of the Boboli Gardens, and the architects Giovanni Battista Foggini and Paolo Giovanozzi. In the period 1722–1725, the Electress embellished the villa further by commissioning twelve statues of various religious figures.
In spite of their mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice attempted to improve Gian Gastone&#x27;s poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; it was a rarity for the public to see him. To dispel the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The &quot;Ruspanti&quot;, Gian Gastone&#x27;s morally corrupt entourage, hated the Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance scrambling for their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice&#x27;s death in 1731.

In 1736, during the War of the Polish Succession, Infante Charles was banished from Tuscany as part of a territorial swap, and Francis III of Lorraine was made heir in his stead. In January 1737, the Spanish troops, who had occupied Tuscany since 1731, withdrew; 6,000 Austrian soldiers took their place.

Gian Gastone died from &quot;an accumulation of diseases&quot; on 9 July 1737, surrounded by prelates and his sister. Anna Maria Luisa was offered a nominal regency by the Prince de Craon, the Grand Duke&#x27;s envoy, until Francis III could arrive in Florence, but declined. At Gian Gastone&#x27;s demise, all the House of Medici&#x27;s allodial possessions, including £2,000,000 liquid cash, a vast art collection, robes of state and lands in the former Duchy of Urbino, were conferred on Anna Maria Luisa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young502/8&quot;&gt;Young, p 502; p 508&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to this, her most notable act was the &quot;Patto di Famiglia&quot; (&quot;Family Pact&quot;), signed on 31 October 1737. In collaboration with the Holy Roman Emperor and Francis of Lorraine, she willed all the personal property of the Medici&#x27;s to the Tuscan state, provided that nothing was ever removed from Florence.

===Death and legacy===
The &quot;Lorrainers,&quot; as the occupying forces were dubbed, were popularly loathed. The Viceroy, the Prince de Craon, whom the Electress disliked for his &quot;vulgar&quot; court, allowed the Electress to live undisturbed in her own wing of the Palazzo Pitti, living in virtual seclusion, only on occasion receiving a select-number of guests under a black dais in her silver-clad audience room. She occupied herself financing and overseeing the construction of the Cappella dei Principi, started in 1604 by Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany—to the tune of 1,000 crowns per week, and she donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 per annum. This is equivalent to £ in present-day terms. On 18 February 1743, Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici, Dowager Electress Palatine, died of an &quot;oppression on the breast&quot;. Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, a British resident in Florence, recalled in a letter that &quot;The common people are convinced she went off in a hurricane of wind; a most violent one began this morning and lasted for about two hours, and now the sun shines as bright as ever...&quot; The royal line of the House of Medici became extinct with her death. Her will, having been completed just months before, according to Sir Horace Mann, left £500,000 worth of jewellery to the Grand Duke Francis and her lands in the former Duchy of Urbino to the Marquis Rinuccini, her main executor and a minister under her father, Cosimo III. She was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete in San Lorenzo; although not entirely finished at the time of her death, her testament stipulated that part of the revenue of her estate should &quot;be used to continue, finish and perfect...the said famous chapel San Lorenzo&quot;.

Anna Maria Luisa&#x27;s single most enduring act was the &quot;Family Pact&quot;. It ensured that all the Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany&#x27;s future economy through tourism. Sixteen years after her death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo &quot;the Great&quot;, the founder of the grand duchy, was made open to public viewing.

In 2012 after concern caused by the 1966 Flood of the Arno River, her bones were exhumed. A scientific examination found no traces of syphilis, which she had long been thought to have died from.

<text>The microscopic scale () is the scale of objects and events smaller than those that can easily be seen by the naked eye, requiring a lens or microscope to see them clearly. In physics, the microscopic scale is sometimes regarded as the scale between the macroscopic scale and the quantum scale. Microscopic units and measurements are used to classify and describe very small objects. One common microscopic length scale unit is the micrometre (also called a &quot;micron&quot;) (symbol: μm), which is one millionth of a metre.

== History ==
Whilst compound microscopes were first developed in the 1590s, the significance of the microscopic scale was only truly established in the 1600s when Marcello Malphigi and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek microscopically observed frog lungs and microorganisms. As microbiology was established, the significance of making scientific observations at a microscopic level increased.

Published in 1665, Robert Hooke&#x27;s book Micrographia details his microscopic observations including fossils insects, sponges, and plants, which was possible through his development of the compound microscope. During his studies of cork, he discovered plant cells and coined the term &#x27;cell&#x27;.

Prior to the use of the micro- prefix, other terms were originally incorporated into the International metric system in 1795, such as centi- which represented a factor of 10^-2, and milli-, which represented a factor of 10^-3.

Over time the importance of measurements made at the microscopic scale grew, and an instrument named the Millionometre was developed by watch-making company owner Antoine LeCoultre in 1844. This instrument had the ability to precisely measure objects to the nearest micrometre.

The British Association for the Advancement of Science committee incorporated the micro- prefix into the newly established CGS system in 1873.

The micro- prefix was finally added to the official SI system in 1960, acknowledging measurements that were made at an even smaller level, denoting a factor of 10^-6.

==Biology==
By convention, the microscopic scale also includes classes of objects that are most commonly too small to see but of which some members are large enough to be observed with the eye. Such groups include the &quot;Cladocera&quot;, planktonic green algae of which &quot;Volvox&quot; is readily observable, and the protozoa of which &quot;stentor&quot; can be easily seen without aid.
The submicroscopic scale similarly includes objects that are too small to see with an optical microscope.

==Thermodynamics==
In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, the microscopic scale is the scale at which we do not measure or directly observe the precise state of a thermodynamic system – such detailed states of a system are called microstates. We instead measure thermodynamic variables at a macroscopic scale, i.e. the &quot;macrostate&quot;.

== Levels of Microscopic Scale ==

As the microscopic scale covers any object that cannot be seen by the naked eye, yet is visible under a microscope, the range of objects that fall under this scale can be as small as an atom, visible underneath a transmission electron microscope. Microscope types are often distinguished by their mechanism and application, and can be divided into two general categories.
=== Light microscopes ===

Amongst light microscopes, the utilised objective lens dictates how small of an object can be seen. These varying objective lenses can change the resolving power of the microscope, which determines the shortest distance that somebody is able to distinguish two separate objects through that microscope lens. It is important to note that the resolution between two objects varies from individual to individual, but the strength of the objective lenses can be quantified.

In the 1660s, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek devised a simple microscope utilising a single spherical lens mounted between two thin brass plates. Depending on the quality of the lens, magnifications of between 70x and 250x were possible. The specimen to be examined was mounted on a point on a finely threaded rod. 

Compound light microscopes have a short focal length objective lens which produces a real image which is examined using a longer focal length eyepiece. The ratio of the focal length of the objective and the eyepiece, when mounted in a standard tube length, gives an approximate magnification of the system. Due to their design, compound microscopes have improved resolving power and contrast in comparison to simple microscopes, and can be used to view the structure, shape and motility of a cell and its organisms, which can be as small as 0.1 micrometres.

=== Electron microscopes ===
While electron microscopes are still a form of compound microscope, their use of electron beams to illuminate objects varies in mechanism significantly from compound light microscopes, allowing them to have a much higher resolving power, and magnification approximately 10,000 times more than light microscopes. These can be used to view objects such as atoms, which are as small as 0.001 micrometres.

== Uses ==
=== Forensics ===
During forensic investigations, trace evidence from crime scenes such as blood, fingerprints and fibres can be closely examined under microscopes, even to the extent of determining the age of a trace. Along with other specimens, biological traces can be used to accurately identify individuals present at a location, down to cells found in their blood.

=== Gemology ===
When the monetary value of gems is determined, various professions in gemology require systematic observation of the microscopic physical and optical properties of gemstones. This can involve the use of stereo microscopes to evaluate these qualities, to eventually determine the value of each individual jewel or gemstone. This can be done similarly in evaluations of gold and other metals.

=== Infrastructure ===

When assessing road materials, the microscopic composition of the infrastructure is vital in determining the longevity and safety of the road, and the different requirements of varying locations. As chemical properties such as water permeability, structural stability and heat resistance affect the performance of different materials used in pavement mixes, they are taken into consideration when building for roads according to the traffic, weather, supply and budget in that area.

=== Medicine ===

In medicine, diagnoses can be made with the assistance of microscopic observation of patient biopsies, such as cancer cells. Pathology and cytology reports include a microscopic description, which consists of analyses performed using microscopes, histochemical stains or flow cytometry. These methods can determine the structure of the diseased tissue and the severity of the disease, and early detection is possible through identification of microscopic indications of illness.

== Microscopic scale in the laboratory ==
Whilst use of the microscopic scale has many roles and purposes in the scientific field, there are many biochemical patterns observed microscopically that have contributed significantly to the understanding of how human life relies on microscopic structures to function and live.

=== Founding experiments ===
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was not only a contributor to the invention of the microscope, he is also referred to as the &quot;father of Microbiology&quot;. This is due to his significant contributions in the initial observation and documentation of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and spermatozoa, and microscopic human tissue such as muscle fibres and capillaries.

=== Biochemistry ===

==== Human cells ====
Genetic manipulation of energy-regulating mitochondria under microscopic principles has also been found to extend organism lifespan, tackling age-associated issues in humans such as Parkinson&#x27;s, Alzheimer&#x27;s and multiple sclerosis. By increasing the amount of energy products made by mitochondria, the lifespan of its cell, and thus organism, increases.

==== DNA ====
Microscopic analysis of the spatial distribution of points within DNA heterochromatin centromeres emphasise the role of the centromeric regions of chromosomes in nuclei undergoing the interphase part of cell mitosis. Such microscopic observations suggest nonrandom distribution and precise structure of centromeres during mitosis is a vital contributor to successful cell function and growth, even in cancer cells.

=== Chemistry and physics ===

The entropy and disorder of the universe can be observed at a microscopic scale, with reference to the second and third law of thermodynamics. In some cases, this can involve calculating the entropy change within a container of expanding gas molecules and relating it to the entropy change of its environment and the universe.

=== Ecology ===
Ecologists monitor the state of an ecosystem over time by identifying microscopic features within the environment. This includes the temperature and tolerance of microorganisms such as ciliates, and their interactions with othrt Protozoa. Additionally, microscopic factors such as movement and motility can be observed in water samples of that ecosystem.

=== Geology ===
Branches of geology involve the study of the Earth&#x27;s structure at a microscopic level. Physical characteristics of rocks are recorded, and in petrography there is a specific focus on the examination of microscopic details of rocks. Similar to scanning electron microscopes, electron microprobes can be used in petrology to observe the condition that allows rocks to form, which can inform the origin of these samples. In structural geology, petrographic microscopes allow the study of rock microstructures, to determine how geologic features such as tectonic plates affect the likelihood of earthquakes and groundwater movement.

==Current research==

There have been both advances in microscopic technology, and discoveries in other areas of knowledge as a result of microscopic technology.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
In conjunction with fluorescent tagging, molecular details in singular amyloid proteins can be studied through new light microscopy techniques, and their relation to Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Atomic force microscopy ===
Other improvements in light microscopy include the ability to view sub-wavelength, nanosized objects. Nanoscale imaging via atomic force microscopy has also been improved to allow a more precise observation of small amounts of complex objects, such as cell membranes.
=== Renewable energy ===
Coherent microscopic patterns discovered in chemical systems support ideas of the resilience of certain substances against entropic environments. This research is being utilised to inform the productions of solar fuels, and the improvement of renewable energy.

=== Microscopic musical instrument - Micronium ===
A microscopic musical instrument called the Micronium has also been developed through micromechanics, consisting of springs the thickness of human hair being plucked by microscopic comb drives. This is a very minimal movement that produces an audible noise to the human ear, which was not previously done by past attempts with microscopic instruments.

<text>Ratchaburi province (, ) or Rat Buri () is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) lies in Western Thailand. Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram and Phetchaburi. In the west it borders the Tanintharyi Region of Myanmar.

Ratchaburi is west of Bangkok and borders Myanmar to the west with the Tenasserim Hills as a natural border. The Mae Klong flows through the centre of Ratchaburi town.

==Geography==
Ratchaburi province is a medium-sized province with an area of about . The eastern part of the province contains the flat river plains of the Mae Klong, crisscrossed by many khlongs. The most famous tourist spot in this area is the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market. The west of the province is more mountainous, and includes the Tenasserim Hills. As the mountains are made mostly of limestone, there are several caves containing stalactites. Some caves are inhabited by large colonies of bats, and it is an impressive sight when they swarm out in the evening to feed. Other caves like the Khao Bin are accessible for visitors.

The main river of the western part is the Phachi River. On the left bank of the Phachi is the Chaloem Phrakiat Thai Prachan National Park, , along with eight other national parks, make up region 3 (Ban Pong) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. There is one wildlife sanctuary, along with two other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 3 (Ban Pong) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. Mae Nam Phachi Wildlife Sanctuary, . 

The area of Ratchaburi province is divided into three parts. First, the border in the west which is shared with Myanmar and is about long. The second contains the Tenasserim mountains and forests with an elevation of about 200–300 meters. The central area of the province is rich in wetlands due to river flow. Ratchaburi has important natural resources in its forest of which it covers an area of or 33 percent of provincial area. Moreover, it has minerals such as tin, tantalum, feldspar, quartz, limestone, and marlstone.

==History==
The history of the city of Ratchaburi dates back to the Dvaravati period, when it was an important city of the Mon Kingdom. Of the city of Khu Bua nearby only ruins remains. According to legend it dates back to the mythical Suvannabhumi Kingdom predating Dvaravati.

&quot;Ratchaburi&quot; means &#x27;the land of the king&#x27;. Ratchaburi dates back to ancient times and was important during the Dvaravati period. The city of Ratchburi is on the banks of the Mae Klong River and was a town of the Suvarnabhumi Kingdom.

From the evidence of archaeological sites and many antiquities, believed that people have settled in this area since the Middle Stone Age, as well as discovering an ancient city in the Dvaravati period at Mueang Ratchaburi district. King Rama I used to take a position of Royal Yokkrabat of Ratchaburi in the late Ayutthaya period.

<text>The Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (German: &quot;Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart des SWR&quot;) was a German radio orchestra based in Stuttgart in Germany.

==History==
The ensemble was founded in 1945 by American occupation authorities as the orchestra for Radio Stuttgart, under the name &quot;Sinfonieorchester von Radio Stuttgart&quot; (Symphony Orchestra of Radio Stuttgart). The radio network later became the Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR, South German Radio), and the orchestra changed its name in 1949 to the &quot;Sinfonieorchester des Süddeutschen Rundfunks&quot; (South German Radio Symphony Orchestra). In 1959, the orchestra took on the name &quot;Südfunk-Sinfonieorchester&quot;. The orchestra acquired its final name in 1975.

Like many broadcast orchestras in Germany, the orchestra had a reputation for performing contemporary music. Past principal conductors included Sir Neville Marriner (1983–1989), who later held the title of principal guest conductor. Georges Prêtre, who became the orchestra&#x27;s artistic director in 1996, later held the title of &quot;Ehrendirigent&quot; (honorary conductor) with the orchestra. From 1998 to 2011, Roger Norrington was principal conductor, and incorporated his ideas of historically informed performance, including minimal use of vibrato, into the orchestra&#x27;s style of playing. Following his tenure with the orchestra, Norrington shared the title of &quot;Ehrendirigent&quot; with Georges Prêtre. In March 2010, the orchestra announced the appointment of Stéphane Denève as its next principal conductor, starting with the 2011-2012 season. His initial contract was for 3 years. In June 2013, the orchestra announced the extension of Denève&#x27;s contract through the 2015-2016 season. Denève concluded his tenure as chief conductor at the close of the 2015-2016 season, and was the final conductor to hold the title of chief conductor of the orchestra.

In June 2012, the SWR Broadcasting Council voted to approve a measure proposed by SWR &quot;Intendant&quot; Peter Boudgoust to merge the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra with the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra, for ostensible reasons of budgetary limitations for two separate orchestras affiliated with the SWR. The SWR Broadcasting Council formally passed the measure in September 2012, with the merger of the two orchestras scheduled to occur in 2016. International protests at the proposal emerged. The orchestra gave its final concert on 28 July 2016 under the direction of Norrington, at the Royal Albert Hall as part of The Proms. The replacement orchestra is the SWR Symphonieorchester.

The orchestra recorded for several labels, including Hänssler and ECM New Series.

<doc id="292543" wikidata="Q1050089" url="?curid=292543" title="Longshot (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Longshot is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Art Adams, he first appeared in &quot;Longshot&quot; #1 (September 1985), the first issue of a six-issue miniseries that represents the first major work of both Nocenti and Adams. The &quot;Longshot&quot; series established Longshot as an amnesiac fugitive from another dimension who discovers that he has a &quot;good luck&quot; power that protects him from harm when his motives are pure. He also discovers that he was a slave who led a rebellion on his dystopian world against his former master and enemy, Mojo.

The character subsequently becomes a recurring fixture in the various X-Men related books, which see him as a member of the X-Men from 1986 to 1989, a member of Tony Bedard and Chris Claremont&#x27;s Exiles teams, and a member of the third incarnation of &quot;X-Factor&quot; from 2008–2013, as well as in his own solo adventures. Later stories establish he is a paradoxical genetically engineered clone of his future son, Shatterstar. Versions of the character have also appeared in the Ultimate Marvel line of books, and television and video games.

==Publication history==
Ann Nocenti wrote the story for the &quot;Longshot&quot; limited series. After most of Marvel&#x27;s artists had declined to take on the project, it was offered to aspiring artist Arthur Adams, whose samples had been given to editor Carl Potts and Nocenti, his assistant editor, by editor Al Milgrom.

Explaining the concept of the character, which Nocenti borrowed from existentialist writers, she states, &quot;Longshot is the idea of stripping someone of everything that they are. I never read comics, so the idea of a hero to me was different. I couldn&#x27;t think of it in terms of a &#x27;super hero&#x27; hero. I thought of it more as a conceptual hero. Not having a comic book background, I tend to come up with the metaphysics before I come up with the characters. I knew that I wanted to deal with the metaphysics of luck. It was a concept that interested me...what luck is, what probability is, how you could shift probabilities towards yourself. What are the repercussions of that? So, I did a character centered around that idea.&quot; Nocenti describes Longshot&#x27;s state at the beginning of the miniseries by referring to him as &quot;a clean slate. He has no memories, no past, no name, no nothing...In a sense, what I was trying to do was strip someone down to where he had none of the crutches that we normally have. Memory, in a way, is a crutch, or your name, or what you believe you are. So, Longshot&#x27;s odyssey begins with some very basic questions: Who is he? Why is he here? Ultimately, he goes on a quest for his past and finds it in search of him.&quot;

A design for the character of Longshot was put forward by Carl Potts, who outfitted the character in a jumpsuit that Adams thought to be reminiscent of the Starfleet uniforms from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. Nocenti suggested that Longshot look distinct from other superheroes. She prescribed that he be an alien, have only four fingers on each hand, and has an unusual spine, though this last trait was not mentioned in the comics. Adams created his own design, and wanting to distinguish the character visually, based his mullet haircut on that of musician Limahl, as no other major Marvel character had such a haircut. Adams, who disliked the practice of having characters produce weapons and other devices from their boots or secret pockets that had never before been established, decided to include some pouches on the character&#x27;s belt, a practice that influenced the artwork of the founders of Image Comics. Nocenti came up with the idea of having Longshot&#x27;s left eye glow when he uses his power for noble causes: &quot;I was living in a loft on 26th and Sixth and we had a one-eyed cat. I&#x27;d go out at night and I&#x27;d see this one eye [glowing in the dark].&quot;

Longshot debuted in a six-issue, eponymous 1985–1986 mini-series. The series established the &quot;Mojoverse&quot;, an alien dimension whose residents are addicted to televised gladiator-like entertainment and ruled by the tyrannical network head Mojo. Longshot possesses probability-altering or &quot;luck&quot; powers, and is an action star who escapes enslavement by Mojo. With no memory of who he is, he embarks on a series of adventures with the people he encounters, among them Ricochet Rita, who Adams modeled after Nocenti. A &quot;Longshot&quot; ongoing series with Nocenti and Adams as the creative team was announced in 1988. According to Nocenti, &quot;every issue is going to throw him into a completely different universe. So one issue, he&#x27;s going to enter the world of the dead, and one issue he&#x27;s going to go into a future world where he meets ageing heroes...&quot; However, the series never materialized. Mephisto was to be the central villain; shortly after the series was cancelled, Nocenti began using Mephisto as a major villain in &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

After the miniseries, Longshot joined the X-Men in &quot;Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #10 in 1986, and remained with them until &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #248 (September 1989). He subsequently made occasional appearances in various Marvel books, such as &quot;Exiles&quot;, the 1997 one-shot &quot;Fools&quot;, and &quot;X-Factor&quot; (vol 3), a book whose cast he joined in issue #35 (November 2008). He remained a part of that cast until that book&#x27;s cancellation in 2013.

In November 2013 Marvel premiered &quot;Longshot Saves the Marvel Universe&quot;, a four-issue miniseries written by Christopher Hastings and illustrated by Jacopo Camagni.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Longshot is an artificially created humanoid life-form, with the ability to defy probability. He is from an alternate dimension known as &quot;Mojoworld&quot; or the &quot;Mojoverse&quot;. He is one of many slaves created by genetic engineers in the employ of Mojoworld&#x27;s masters, the grossly obese, virtually immobile Spineless Ones, who are ruled by the media-obsessed delusional maniac named Mojo. The head geneticist, Arize, gave Longshot and his other creations (such as the ram-headed Quark) free will and a conscience, hoping that one day they would rise up against their masters.

Longshot and many of his fellow slaves rebel against the slave-masters. They undergo a mystical ritual that gives them the power to create good luck for themselves. Despite this power, their masters win the war due to their superior weaponry and the limits of the slaves&#x27; luck. Longshot is rendered amnesiac by the Spineless Ones, but he manages to flee from Mojoworld to Earth. A number of Mojo&#x27;s servants, led by the hound-like Gog and Magog, pursue him, but get stuck between Longshot&#x27;s world and Earth. Unable to remember his real name, Longshot becomes an adventurer and takes the name &quot;Longshot&quot; after several humans call him that due to his incredible good luck. While recovering, Longshot befriends the human stunt-woman named Ricochet Rita and works as a movie stuntman himself. He also adopts the docile Magog, who he renames &quot;Pup&quot;. Finally, Mojo and his assistant, the six-armed sword-wielding assassin named Spiral, follow Longshot to Earth. Longshot battles Spiral, and defeats Mojo with the aid of Ricochet Rita, Quark, and Doctor Strange, who then send Mojo and his minions back to the Mojoverse. Longshot, Quark and Rita return to the Mojoverse to free the other slaves.

===Member of the X-Men===
After an unsuccessful rebellion, a once-again amnesiac Longshot is sent back to Earth by Mojo, where he joins the X-Men. With the X-Men, he battles the Juggernaut and the Marauders. Longshot dies with the rest of the X-Men while defeating the Adversary, but is then restored to life by Roma. Longshot and the X-Men fight the Reavers in Australia for the first time. He battles the Brood. With the X-Men, he rescues his captured teammates from the island nation of Genosha, which uses mutants as a slave caste. He soon becomes Dazzler&#x27;s lover. However, he suffers a severe identity crisis, and eventually leaves the X-Men.

Before long, Longshot is reunited with Dazzler, and is teleported with her to Mojoworld. For a short time, they live in Mojoworld, until they are captured by Mojo. They, with the X-Men and Mojo&#x27;s temporary successor, &quot;Mojo II: The Sequel&quot;, lead a revolt against Mojo. Longshot and Dazzler also learn that Dazzler is pregnant with their child, who was hinted to be Shatterstar, the member of X-Force. The pair also care for the X-Babies, a group of Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men. One of the many X-Babies created is a young version of Longshot himself. Dazzler&#x27;s pregnancy was initially suggested to have resulted in a miscarriage. The outcome of Dazzler&#x27;s pregnancy was resolved many years later, in the storyline &quot;The End of X-Factor&quot;. Dazzler returned to Earth separately from Longshot suffering from memory loss, believing that Longshot, the X-Babies and everyone in the rebellion had been killed by Mojo and his followers.

===&quot;Longshot: Fools&quot;===
After being &quot;killed&quot; by the Thingy and denied entrance into Heaven, Longshot realizes he has lost his innocence, the main source of his luck power. Ejected from Heaven and Mojoverse, Longshot finds himself stranded between Baum and Barrie, Kansas, pursued by the vengeful Thingy. When a child who has befriended the broken hero is damaged by the monster, Longshot, helped by a group of mental patients, rediscovers his faith in himself and his own purity despite the suffering of his wife to restore her to health. In the end, the unlikely group sets out for the big city, searching for adventure, secure in their luck and their innocence.

===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
Again suffering from memory loss, Longshot is recruited for the Exiles by Heather Hudson to help against Proteus. Mojo claims that he and all the other inhabitants of Mojoworld are &quot;unique&quot; in that there is no parallel counterpart to his realm. This would extend to Longshot, though what impact this will have on his membership in the Exiles is unknown. Morph reveals that Longshot&#x27;s abilities cancel Proteus&#x27; reality warping powers, making him a perfect candidate for the team. He is brought aboard to replace the dead Mimic. Longshot saves Blink from Proteus in 2099, and saves Blink, Morph, Sabretooth, Star Brand, Lenore Fenzl, and Nightmask from Proteus in the &quot;New Universe Approximation&quot;. When the Exiles visit the future, Longshot tries to stop Maestro&#x27;s rampage and stop Proteus from taking over Maestro&#x27;s body. The Exiles finally corner Proteus at the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; world, and trap Proteus in Morph&#x27;s body. With the hunt for Proteus at an end, Longshot remains an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. During their last mission, Longshot is seemingly brainwashed into attacking Blink by Madame Hydra and the Hand. Afterwards, Longshot leaves the Exiles during a mission on Earth-616 where he is re-introduced to Dazzler, whom he has no memory of their time together in Mojoworld.

===&quot;X-Factor&quot;===
After failing to rekindle his relationship with Dazzler due to the loss of his memories, Longshot shows up in Detroit after reading an article about his supposed appearance there during the events of Secret Invasion, thanks to a Skrull impostor. After a small fight with Guido, he helps X-Factor find out what happened to Darwin and his father, leading them to the Karma Project. During that time, he is seen commenting that women are too friendly towards him, and reveals that his memory losses are so severe that he doesn&#x27;t even understand his powers anymore.

In &quot;X-Factor&quot; #47 it is once more hinted that Longshot and Shatterstar are related. It is not until a one-shot issue during the final &quot;X-Factor&quot; story arc, &quot;The End of X-Factor&quot;, that their connection is explained. After Rictor and Shatterstar are transported into Mojoworld&#x27;s past, they and the audience learn that Shatterstar is the only Mojoworld rebel who was not created by Arize the Creator, as he in fact mysteriously appeared from the sky one day. Arize then used Shatterstar&#x27;s genetic material to create Longshot, making Shatterstar the father of Longshot genetically. Mojo later attacks Arize&#x27;s sanctuary, so Shatterstar time-teleports himself and Rictor to a time in Mojoworld&#x27;s history when Dazzler and Longshot are married and fighting a war against Mojo. Dazzler, pregnant with Longshot&#x27;s child, goes into labor, and gives birth to a young Shatterstar, who Shatterstar explains to Rictor he will deliver to the future of Mojoworld to be raised by the people that raised him, but not before he erases Dazzler and Longshot&#x27;s memories of their having a child.

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Longshot was created through genetic engineering by Arize. Longshot has hollow bones, and each of his hands has three fingers with an opposable thumb. His skin is like leather, and he has two hearts. He is acrobatic at a superhuman level (including his speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes/reactions, coordination, and balance), being able to evade blows by Spider-Man. He also has advanced healing abilities. In &quot;Longshot&quot; #3, these abilities automatically healed him following several hits with high-powered laser beams and falling out of the sky and impacting a barn when his jetpack malfunctioned.

Ann Nocenti, who co-created Longshot, says of his primary superhuman trait, &quot;Longshot has access to probabilities and luck. He&#x27;s &quot;lucky&quot;, he&#x27;s miraculous in a way...he was born with this talent to have access to being lucky, and the problem is that he finds out that there&#x27;s a flip side to luck. There are repercussions. If you pull probabilities towards yourself, you&#x27;re probably taking them away from other people, so it&#x27;s actually something that he shouldn&#x27;t even be doing.&quot; His genetic engineering was augmented using magic to give him superhuman abilities including the ability to alter probability fields using psionic means to bolster his activities with &quot;good luck&quot;, meaning extremely unlikely events happen in his favor. This power operates even without Longshot consciously willing it, and is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should lose hope, his powers will fail to function or even backfire, giving him bad luck. Echoing Nocenti&#x27;s words on the adverse side effects of his powers, Longshot&#x27;s luck is fickle ny nature, and can backfire when he overuses it, causing an equal and opposite effect of &quot;bad luck&quot; which can affect himself or others. His left eye glows brightly whenever Longshot uses these superhuman powers.

Longshot is able to read &quot;psychic imprints&quot; when people leave them on objects they handle, allowing him to read the thoughts that individual experienced while in contact with the object, which is a phenomenon called psychometry. He is also able to read a person&#x27;s future in this manner. Longshot is also able to telepathically &quot;read&quot; recent memories of people through physical contact with them. Nocenti elaborates on the psychometry thus: &quot;If you picked up a hammer and used it to bang nails every day and Longshot went to read it, he may not read much of it, but if it was used to kill somebody, that would leave a bigger psychic imprint, even if somebody held an object and cried over it, he would feel that too. If someone&#x27;s emotional or intense enough around an object, they&#x27;ll imprint it stronger, so he can read that.&quot;

A recurring aspect of stories he appeared in was the strong, spontaneous attraction that women exhibited to him, a trait with which he was genetically engineered.

Longshot carries several small, cleaver-like blades that he stores in a bandolier, which he can throw with superhuman accuracy or just using his luck powers in some cases. He is highly skilled in using other types of weaponry that are bladed. During his X-Men years, Longshot also carried a folding grappling hook and rope either carried looped around one shoulder or stored in his shoulder bag, and a set of throwing spikes which produced net-like wires between them to restrain a target.

Longshot is proficient in the use of jetpacks for flight, the use of handheld directed-energy weapons, and hang gliders.

Longshot is an extraordinary acrobat, and has superhuman agility due to having hollow bones but musculature like a human&#x27;s.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Longshot 31st in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Shattershot&quot;===
In the alternate reality future seen at the end of the 1992 &quot;Shattershot&quot; storyline (which ran through the 1992 annuals of the X-Men-related titles), a mysterious hooded figure appears in the background when the former slaves and the Spineless Ones finally make peace, and observes the events of the story. At the end of the story, this individual removes his hood, revealing himself to be an aged Longshot. He makes a philosophical pronouncement, then says &quot;Gotcha!&quot; as he did while he was with the X-Men.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Ultimate Longshot first appeared in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #54, written by Brian K. Vaughan. In the Ultimate Universe, Longshot is not an alien but an ordinary mutant named Arthur Centino. His name is a tribute to creators Art Adams and Ann Nocenti.

Centino is accused of murdering Lord Joseph Scheele, a Genoshan politician; as punishment, he is sentenced to forced participation in a reality show on Krakoa Island where he will be hunted for sport. The show is run by Mojo Adams, and Longshot&#x27;s latest opponent is Arcade.

The X-Men journey to the island Longshot is on, assuming he is innocent and was framed and thus offer to help him. During the course of their time together, Longshot spends time charming Colossus. It is later discovered that he &quot;is&quot; guilty; he had stumbled upon his girlfriend Spiral with the politician and killed him in a fit of rage. Later, Longshot is in the Savage Land foraging for food when he runs into the Ultimates&#x27; Scarlet Witch, who captures him and has him imprisoned in their Triskelion base. Longshot later successfully escapes from the Triskelion. During the escape, he seemingly kills Lady Deathstrike, saving the lives of two of the X-Men who had freed him before. One of the others who escaped is Magneto, who admits that he had tipped the authorities onto Longshot&#x27;s location in the first place, as part of Magneto&#x27;s own escape plan; Magneto wanted Longshot and his luck power present as an &quot;edge&quot; to guarantee success.

When Longshot is last seen, the death of Charles Xavier is announced, the news reaches &quot;Somewhere Else,&quot; apparently Magneto&#x27;s latest stronghold. Longshot is seen, still bearded from his time on the run, seated on his own low stool at Magneto&#x27;s right hand side, suggesting that the sociopathic young mutant holds special favor with the Master of Magnetism. This story by Robert Kirkman is entitled &quot;Aftermath: Part 1&quot;.

It is later revealed that Longshot was somehow tortured and killed in the Savage Land under orders from Magneto.

<doc id="292570" wikidata="Q706412" url="?curid=292570" title="Jonathan Tweet">
<text>Jonathan Tweet (born 1965) is an American game designer who has been involved in the development of the role-playing games &quot;Ars Magica&quot;, &quot;Everway&quot;, &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, &quot;Talislanta&quot;, the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;13th Age&quot;, and the collectible miniatures game &quot;Dreamblade&quot;. In 2015 Tweet released &quot;Grandmother Fish&quot;, a full-color, full-sized book about evolution aimed at preschoolers. In 2018 Tweet released &quot;Clades&quot; and &quot;Clades Prehistoric&quot;, two card games for children and adults which demonstrate the concept of a clade.

== Early life ==

Native to Rock Island, Illinois, Tweet is the son of Roald Tweet, an Augustana College professor emeritus and local historian, and Margaret Tweet. Jonathan Tweet started playing &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in the 1970s, when his father gave him his first &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. He then formed his own gaming group by recruiting classmates. Tweet graduated from Rock Island High School class valedictorian in 1983. He majored in psychology and sociology at his parents&#x27; alma mater, St. Olaf College in Minnesota.

== Career ==
Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein-Hagen founded Lion Rampant in 1987 while they were attending St. Olaf College. There, they also met Lisa Stevens who later joined the company. His article &quot;Egyptian Magic for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;&quot; appeared in &quot;Different Worlds&quot; #47 (Fall 1987), the magazine&#x27;s final issue. In 1987, Tweet and Rein-Hagen designed the game &quot;Ars Magica&quot;, a game centered around wizards in the Middle Ages. Tweet left Lion Rampant and briefly left the RPG industry in 1989 to begin a new career. Tweet wrote &quot;Festival of the Damned&quot; (1991), an adventure published by Atlas Games for &quot;Ars Magica&quot;. Tweet continued to run a game he created called &quot;Al Amarja&quot; for a group in Rock Island, Illinois, and wrote about the game in articles published in &quot;Alarums and Excursions&quot;; when John Nephew read these articles he wanted to publish the game, and the result was &quot;Over the Edge&quot; (1992), the first original game from Atlas Games. His design on &quot;Over the Edge&quot; notably involved free-form rules and a subjective approach. Lisa Stevens recommended to Wizards of the Coast to have Tweet work freelance to revise the &quot;Talislanta&quot; rules for Wizards to publish, and also write the first new adventure for their version of the game; Tweet also wrote a revised version of the &quot;Talislanta Guidebook&quot; (1992), and the adventure &quot;The Scent of the Beast&quot; (1992). Tweet wrote the adventure &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (1993) for the &quot;Role Aids&quot; line by Mayfair Games. Nephew and Tweet also designed &quot;On the Edge&quot; (1994), a collectible card game based on &quot;Over the Edge&quot;. Tweet joined Wizards of the Coast as a full-time employee in June 1994, and brought about new product lines for the company beginning with &quot;Ars Magica&quot;, which Tweet recommended Wizards to acquire. Tweet designed &quot;Everway&quot;, which was first published by Wizards of the Coast in 1995. After Wizards of the Coast moved away from role-playing games, Tweet worked on Portal, a set designed to help new players learn the game.

Tweet was lead designer on the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Tweet oversaw the &quot;Chainmail Miniatures Game&quot; design team, and Skaff Elias was responsible for the main design work and Chris Pramas created the game world. Tweet became the head of the miniatures group, and the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures Game&quot; (2003) was the result of the work by Tweet, Rob Heinsoo, and Skaff Elias. On December 2, 2008, Tweet was laid off from Wizards of the Coast.

&quot;13th Age&quot; a d20 System RPG, designed by Heinsoo and Tweet was published by Pelgrane Press on August 3, 2013. The pre-release version was a nominee for the RPG Geek RPG of the Year 2013.

In 2015 Tweet published &quot;Grandmother Fish&quot;, a Kickstarter-funded book described as &quot;the first book to teach evolution to preschoolers&quot;. While criticized by creationist organizations, it has been praised by science educators.

In 2018 Tweet, along with children&#x27;s science illustrator Karen Lewis, released two card games, &quot;Clades&quot; and &quot;Clades Prehistoric&quot;. These animal matching games are intended to be used as tools to teach about evolution. Clades Solo, an app version that includes both prehistoric and modern animals, was released in 2019

The third edition of &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, with a new setting and new rules, was released June 1, 2019.

== Religious views ==

An atheist since grade school, Tweet has devoted much of his personal website to his views on religion, in particular on the historical Jesus. He also blogs about religion on the Secular Sunday School blog.

== Personal life ==
Tweet and his wife Tracy moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1994. Tracy died from multiple sclerosis in 2008. He continues to live in the Seattle area with his daughter.

<doc id="292590" wikidata="Q237008" url="?curid=292590" title="D'arcy Wretzky">
<text>D&#x27;arcy Elizabeth Wretzky (born May 1, 1968) is an American musician. She was the original bassist of the alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins and is credited on their first six studio albums. She left the band in 1999. She has also been a member of Catherine and performed with Filter.

== Early life ==
Wretzky was born and grew up in South Haven, Michigan where her mother, Vikke Anderson, a working musician, encouraged D&#x27;arcy and her sisters to perform music. D&#x27;Arcy played violin for 9 or 10 years, played oboe, and performed in choirs while growing up. She also was in gymnastics. D&#x27;Arcy intended to have a musical career from the time she was 10 years old. 

She later referred to her father, Jerry Wretzky, a pipefitter with a love of horseback riding, as &quot;a very strange man&quot;. D&#x27;Arcy was a self-described &quot;tomboy&quot; and had a contentious relationship with her sister.
D&#x27;Arcy suffered from severe stage fright during her childhood. She attended South Haven&#x27;s L.C. Mohr High School, where she grew interested in post-punk and played in cover bands. After high school, she moved to France to join a band, but the band had already disbanded upon her arrival, prompting her to return to the United States. She moved to Chicago and later joined the Smashing Pumpkins.
Wretzky said that she is a self-taught bass player.

Wretzky was married to musician Kerry Brown from 1993 to 1999. Wretzky said that she had a miscarriage in 1999.

== 1988–1999: Smashing Pumpkins ==
After a concert at a local rock club, Wretzky overheard Billy Corgan criticizing the band that had performed. An argument and discussion followed and Corgan recruited her to be in his band, the nascent Smashing Pumpkins, which at the time, was merely Corgan and James Iha using a drum machine. Wretzky accepted, and Jimmy Chamberlin completed the lineup a few months later, after Joe Shanahan encouraged Corgan to add a live drummer.

Wretzky is the credited bassist on the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; first five studio albums: &quot;Gish&quot;, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, &quot;Adore&quot;, and &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;. It was confirmed by both her and Corgan, however, that Corgan played the bass tracks on &quot;Gish&quot; and &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. Wretzky often contributed backing vocals on some songs on studio albums and in concert. She contributes vocally in Smashing Pumpkins songs such as &quot;Daydream&quot; from &quot;Gish&quot;, many songs on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Cupid De Locke&quot;, &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;; &quot;Where Boys Fear to Tread&quot; from &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;, and &quot;Dreaming&quot; and &quot;The Bells&quot; from &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot;. Wretzky also co-wrote the Smashing Pumpkins song &quot;Daughter&quot;.

In 1995, Wretzky and Iha started an independent record label called Scratchie Records, featuring artists such as The Frogs.

== 1999: Final tour, recording sessions and leaving the band ==
Wretzky&#x27;s time in the band was marked with alternating periods of happiness and discomfort. Corgan considered her the &quot;moral authority&quot; and &quot;moral conscience&quot; of the band. In the aftermath of the success of 1995&#x27;s &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, Corgan said that she began an &quot;apparent slow descent into insanity and/or drugs (take your pick).&quot; After the short, nine-date &quot;The Arising!&quot; tour in April 1999 with all four original members performing together for the first time since 1996, Wretzky decided to leave the band and intended to pursue an acting career. The band was recording &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot; and &quot;Machina II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music&quot; at the time and as a result she performed very few bass parts on the album. 

Most of the bass parts were handled by Corgan himself. Shortly after leaving the group, she was arrested for possession of crack cocaine. Corgan later commented she was &quot;fired for being a mean-spirited drug addict who refused to get help.&quot; She was replaced on 2000&#x27;s &quot;Machina&quot; tours by former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur.

== 1999–present: Life after the Smashing Pumpkins ==
Wretzky did not participate in the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; reunion. In 2008, she and her former boyfriend and bandmate James Iha filed a lawsuit against Virgin Records for selling ringtones of Smashing Pumpkins songs without their consent.

After many years out of the spotlight, Wretzky resurfaced in July 2009 by calling in unexpectedly on Chicago&#x27;s Q101 FM with Ryan Manno. During the interview, she expressed that she was not healthy enough to be a musician, and repeatedly professed her admiration for Monkees frontman Davy Jones, who was known to be an early romantic crush of hers. She also discussed her appreciation for the band Silversun Pickups, who have a sound influenced by the early &quot;Gish&quot; era of the Smashing Pumpkins. She mentioned that she lived on a farm in Michigan, that she had briefly lived in Austin, Texas sometime during the previous decade, and that her former fiancé Wendell Green had died.

Wretzky was jailed on February 1, 2011, for missing four court dates related to a ticket she received for failing to control her wild horses, allowing them to freely roam the streets at night causing interference to local traffic and farmers, as well as trespassing on public property and stealing vegetables from the local farmer&#x27;s market storage. She spent six days in jail. On February 7, 2011, the day after she was released from jail, she was arrested again, this time on a misdemeanor drunken-driving road rage charge in South Haven, Michigan. She was sent back to jail.

In 2013, Wretzky&#x27;s relationship with Corgan remained tense, with both parties saying that they were not speaking. In September 2014, she tried to re-establish contact with him, but Corgan had changed his phone number. In August 2016, Corgan posted a video to Facebook which said that he and Wretzky had recently reestablished communication saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in communication with D&#x27;arcy for the first time in 16 or 17 years, it&#x27;s awesome to have my friend back.&quot; Corgan emphasized that this did not necessarily mean the band was getting back together, instead insisting &quot;my primary interest in the old band was us having good relationships again.&quot;

On February 14, 2018, Wretzky gave her first interview in nearly 20 years. In it, she was highly critical of Corgan and their past.

Wretzky said that she had been offered a contract to rejoin the band on the Shiny and Oh So Bright Tour, but that Corgan rescinded the offer soon after. Corgan released a statement denying the claims, writing that &quot;Ms. Wretzky has repeatedly been invited out to play with the group, participate in demo sessions, or at the very least, meet face-to-face, and in each and every instance she always deferred.&quot; Wretzky later provided screenshots of a text message conversation with Corgan.

== Other musical work ==
In 1996, Wretzky joined the band Catherine as a second vocalist for their final album, &quot;Hot Saki &amp; Bedtime Stories.&quot; She also appeared in the video for &quot;Four Leaf Clover.&quot; At the time, Wretzky was married to Catherine drummer Kerry Brown. She contributed vocals to the track &quot;One and Two&quot; on James Iha&#x27;s 1998 solo album, &quot;Let It Come Down.&quot;

In 1999, she worked with cellist Eric Remschneider, whom she had worked with when he had recorded with the Smashing Pumpkins. That year, she also contributed additional vocals on the Filter song &quot;Cancer&quot; from &quot;Title of Record.&quot; In a 2016 interview with &quot;Loudwire,&quot; Filter lead singer Richard Patrick spoke of a romantic relationship which he had with Wretzky, saying that she was the subject of a song he wrote called &quot;Miss Blue&quot;, also on &quot;Title of Record.&quot;

While making no indication that she will record with or make any meaningful contribution to the group, Michigan doom-sludge metal band Grave Next Door said on Twitter that they were jamming with Wretzky at her home, with one band member posting a pic of himself with a prop from the video for &quot;Tonight Tonight&quot;.

<text>Benicio Monserrate Rafael del Toro Sánchez (born February 19, 1967) is a Puerto Rican-Spanish actor. He has garnered critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe, and a Silver Bear for his portrayal of the jaded but morally upright police officer Javier Rodriguez in the film &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000). Del Toro&#x27;s performance as despairing ex-con turned zealot Jack Jordan, in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003), earned him a second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

He is also known for his breakout role as the eccentric, unintelligible crook Fred Fenster in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995); Benny Dalmau in &quot;Basquiat&quot; (1996), winning two consecutive Independent Spirit Awards for both films; Dr. Gonzo in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998); gambling addict Franky Four Fingers in &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000); the predatory, unhinged antagonist Jackie Boy in &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005); revolutionary Che Guevara in &quot;Che&quot; (2008), a performance that earned him the Best Actor award both at the Cannes Film Festival and at the Goya Awards; and as Alejandro, a mysterious, ruthless agent out to bring down a drug cartel in &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015), for which del Toro was nominated for several awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

His other roles include portrayals of the Collector in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; drug lord Pablo Escobar in &quot;&quot; (2014); Lawrence Talbot in the 2010 remake of &quot;The Wolfman&quot;; and the codebreaker in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017). In 2018, he starred as Richard Matt in the Showtime miniseries &quot;Escape at Dannemora&quot;, for which he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.

==Early life==
Del Toro was born on February 19, 1967, in San Germán, Puerto Rico, to Gustavo Adolfo del Toro Bermúdez and Fausta Genoveva Sánchez Rivera (daughter of Benicio Sánchez Castaño and Lirio Belén Rivera), who were both lawyers. He has an older brother, Gustavo, who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, New York. He had a Catalan paternal great-grandfather and a Basque maternal great-grandmother. Del Toro&#x27;s great-grandfather was Rafael Rivera Esbrí, one of the heroes of the El Polvorin fire in Ponce, and who would also later become mayor of that city (1915–1917).

He spent most of his infancy in Santurce, a barrio within San Juan. Del Toro, whose childhood nicknames were &quot;Skinny Benny&quot; and &quot;Beno&quot;, was raised a Roman Catholic and attended Academia del Perpetuo Socorro (The Academy of Our Lady of Perpetual Help), a Roman Catholic school in Miramar, Puerto Rico. When del Toro was nine years old, his mother died of hepatitis. At age 15, he moved with his father and brother to Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, where he was enrolled at the Mercersburg Academy. He spent his adolescence and attended high school there. After graduation, del Toro followed the advice of his father and pursued a business degree at the University of California, San Diego. Success in an elective drama course encouraged him to drop out of college and study with noted acting teachers Stella Adler and Arthur Mendoza, in Los Angeles, as well as at the Circle in the Square Theatre School in New York City.

==Career==
Del Toro surfaced in small television roles during the late 1980s, playing mostly thugs and drug dealers on programs such as &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and the NBC miniseries &quot;Drug Wars: The Camarena Story&quot;. He appeared in the 1987 music video for Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; as a background character sitting on a car hood. Film roles followed, beginning with his debut in &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988) and as Dario in the James Bond film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989). Del Toro continued to appear in film including &quot;The Indian Runner&quot; (1991), &quot;China Moon&quot; (1994), &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot; (1992), &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (1993), &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993) and &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; (1994).

His career gained momentum in 1995 with his breakout performance in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, where he played the mumbling, wisecracking Fred Fenster. The role won him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male and established him as a character actor. This led to stronger roles in independent and major studio films, including playing Gaspare in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;The Funeral&quot; (1996) and winning a second consecutive Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his work as Benny Dalmau in &quot;Basquiat&quot; (1996), directed by his friend, film-maker and painter Julian Schnabel. Del Toro also shared the screen with Robert De Niro in the big-budget thriller &quot;The Fan&quot; (1996), in which he played Juan Primo, a charismatic Puerto Rican baseball star. He subsequently starred opposite Alicia Silverstone in &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; (1997), which Silverstone produced.
For &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, the 1998 film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s famous book, he gained more than 40 lbs. (about 18 kg) to play Dr. Gonzo (a.k.a. Oscar Zeta Acosta), Thompson&#x27;s lawyer and drug-fiend cohort. The surrealistic film, directed by Terry Gilliam, has earned a cult following over the years.

Del Toro&#x27;s performances in four films in 2000 gained him a mainstream audience. First, the crime yarn &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot; reunited him with &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. A few months later, he stood out among a first-rate ensemble cast in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Traffic&quot;, a complex dissection of the North American drug wars. As Javier Rodriguez—a Mexican border policeman struggling to remain honest amid the corruption and deception of illegal drug trafficking—del Toro, who spoke most of his lines in Spanish, gave a performance that dominated the film. His performance swept all of the major critics&#x27; awards in 2001. Del Toro won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, becoming the fourth living Oscar winner whose winning role was a character who speaks predominantly in a non-English language. Del Toro is also the third Puerto Rican actor to win an Oscar, after Jose Ferrer and Rita Moreno. The year he won his Oscar marked the first time that two actors born in Puerto Rico were nominated in the same category (the other actor was Joaquin Phoenix). In his acceptance speech, del Toro thanked the people of both Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora and dedicated his award to them. In addition to the Oscar, he also won the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actor. &quot;Traffic&quot; was also a success at the box office. This was soon followed by a small role as the diamond thief Franky Four Fingers in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s hip caper comedy &quot;Snatch&quot; and a role as a mentally challenged Native American man in &quot;The Pledge&quot;, directed by his old friend Sean Penn.

In 2003, del Toro appeared in two films: &quot;The Hunted&quot;, co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and the drama &quot;21 Grams&quot;, co-starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. He went on to earn another Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance in the latter. He then appeared in the film adaptation of Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Sin City&quot;, directed by Robert Rodriguez, and &quot;Things We Lost in the Fire&quot;, the English-language debut of celebrated Danish director Susanne Bier.
In 2008, del Toro was awarded the Prix d&#x27;interpretation masculine (or Best Actor Award) at the Cannes Film Festival for his portrayal of Che Guevara in the biographical films &quot;The Argentine&quot; and &quot;Guerrilla&quot; (together known as &quot;Che&quot;). During his acceptance speech, del Toro dedicated his award &quot;to the man himself, Che Guevara&quot; along with director Steven Soderbergh. Del Toro was also awarded the 2009 Goya Award as the Best Actor for his portrayal of Guevara. Sean Penn, who won the 2009 Best Actor Oscar for his performance in &quot;Milk&quot;, remarked that he was surprised and disappointed that &quot;Che&quot; and del Toro were not also up for any Academy Award nominations. During his acceptance speech for the Best Actor award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Penn expressed his dismay stating, &quot;The fact that there aren&#x27;t crowns on Soderbergh&#x27;s and del Toro&#x27;s heads right now, I don&#x27;t understand... that is such a sensational movie, &quot;Che&quot;.&quot; For the final portions of the film (shown here), del Toro shed 35 pounds to show how ill Guevara had become near the end of his life in the jungles of Bolivia.

In 2010, del Toro starred in and produced the remake of Lon Chaney Jr.&#x27;s classic cult film &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941). He was chosen to be the face of the 2011 Campari calendar, becoming the first male model to be featured in the Italian liquor company&#x27;s calendar. Del Toro played The Collector in a mid-credits scene of Marvel Studios&#x27; superhero film &quot;&quot; (2013) and later reprised his role in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2018).

In September 2015, del Toro played Alejandro Gillick in the critically acclaimed &quot;Sicario&quot;, about a Mexican ex-prosecutor seeking revenge for the slaying of his wife and daughter working with a CIA special ops team to bring down the leader of a powerful and brutal Mexican drug cartel. Film critics widely praised his performance. Del Toro reprised his role in the sequel &quot;&quot; (2018). In 2016, del Toro appeared in a Heineken television advertisement in its &quot;More Behind the Star&quot; series. The gag in the spot is that fans frequently mistake him for fellow actor Antonio Banderas, much to del Toro&#x27;s chagrin. In 2017, he played DJ (an abbreviation for &quot;Don&#x27;t Join&quot;, as DJ viewed the Resistance and the First Order as equally corrupt), a supporting antagonist in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, who betrayed Rose and Finn to save himself when they were apprehended on the First Order&#x27;s flagship.

In 2021, del Toro starred in the Wes Anderson film &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; as Moses Rosenthaler, a mentally disturbed artist.

==Personal life==

On April 11, 2011, del Toro&#x27;s publicist announced that del Toro and Kimberly Stewart, daughter of British singer Rod Stewart, were expecting a child, although they were not in a relationship. Stewart gave birth to a daughter on August 21, 2011. They had their daughter baptized in Puerto Rico.

On November 4, 2011, he acquired Spanish citizenship, along with fellow Puerto Rican Ricky Martin. The request was granted by the Spanish government in recognition of his artistic talents and for his Spanish ancestry (he has family in Barcelona).

In March 2012, he was granted an honorary degree by the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico for his influence on the cinema enterprise, during the celebration of the institution&#x27;s centenary.

In 2003, del Toro became the spokesman of the educational campaign Yo Limpio a Puerto Rico, an environmental organization founded in 1997 by Ignacio Barsottelli, whose mission is to educate and mobilize Puerto Ricans in favor of recycling and the protection of the environment.

Del Toro narrated the public service announcement entitled &quot;Coral Reef&quot;, joining the Artists to the Rescue of the Environment campaign.

<text>Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici (born Giovanni Battista Gastone; 25 May 1671 – 9 July 1737) was the seventh and last Medicean grand duke of Tuscany.

He was the second son of Grand Duke Cosimo III and Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans. His sister, Electress Palatine Anna Maria Luisa, arranged his marriage to the wealthy and widowed Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg in 1697. The couple despised each other and had no children. As Grand Prince Ferdinando, Gian Gastone&#x27;s elder brother, predeceased Cosimo III, Gian Gastone succeeded his father in 1723.

His reign was marked by the reversal of his predecessor&#x27;s conservative policy; he abolished taxes for poorer people, repealed penal laws which restricted Jews and discontinued public executions. The Medici were wanting in male heirs; his father, Cosimo III, wanted the Electress Palatine to succeed Gian Gastone. However, Spain, Great Britain, Austria and the Dutch Republic disregarded Cosimo&#x27;s plan and appointed Charles of Spain—whose mother, Elisabeth Farnese, was a great-granddaughter of Margherita de&#x27; Medici—Gian Gastone&#x27;s heir. Charles later transferred his claim to Francis Stephen of Lorraine pursuant to a preliminary peace that was finalized in 1738. Francis Stephen duly succeeded at Gian Gastone&#x27;s demise, on 9 July 1737, ending almost 300 years of Medici rule over Florence. For the latter part of his reign, Gian Gastone chose to remain confined in his bed, tended by his entourage, the &quot;Ruspanti&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early years (1671–1697) ===
On 24 May 1671, the first anniversary of his grandfather Ferdinando II&#x27;s death, Giovanni Battista Gastone de&#x27; Medici was born in Florence to Grand Duke Cosimo III and Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans. He derived his baptismal name, Giovanni Battista Gastone, from his maternal grandfather, Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Cosimo and Marguerite Louise frequently quarreled. As a result, four years after his birth, Marguerite Louise returned home to France. Gian Gastone and his siblings were left in the care of their grandmother Vittoria della Rovere.

Gian Gastone was tutored by Cardinal Henry Noris, whose company the prince hardly left. The Tuscan prince was an avid intellectual, being an antiquarian, a botanist and an amateur scientist. In addition, he could speak English, among other languages. However, it was these traits that earned Gian Gastone the disdain of his father and of his elder brother, Grand Prince Ferdinando; Gian Gastone was thus granted a scant allowance by his father and therefore could not enjoy the &quot;dissipations&quot; of court.

Cosimo III considered compelling Gian Gastone to become a cardinal. In order to rally Gian Gastone to its cause, Spain, concerned that another Medicean cardinal—Gian Gastone&#x27;s uncle, Francesco Maria de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro, already enjoyed that dignity—would tip the scales in favour of France at a Papal conclave, offered to create him &quot;General of the Spanish Seas&quot;. Peter II of Portugal, however, had other things in mind for him: he wanted Gian Gastone to marry his only daughter, Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira. To marry her, Gian Gastone would have to convince his father to allot him an allowance of &quot;adequate stature&quot;. However, the Grand Duke refused and neither the cardinalate nor the Portuguese marriage ever materialised.

Out of sympathy, Gian Gastone befriended his unhappy sister-in-law, Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria. Her husband, Grand Prince Ferdinando, thought her too ugly and too dull for him. At the same time, Gian Gastone sank into a state of melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées had no effect and Gian Gastone continued to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.

=== Marriage and Bohemia (1697–1708) ===
By 1697, Violante Beatrice and Ferdinando had been married for eight years and still lacked issue, as did Gian Gastone&#x27;s sister, the Electress Palatine. Concerned for the future of the dynasty, Cosimo urged the Electress to find Gian Gastone—currently the only one of his children unmarried—a suitable bride. She put forward Anna Maria Franziska, her brother-in-law&#x27;s widow and potential heiress of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. The bride-to-be was described as &quot;more like a Bohemian peasant than a princess&quot; by a contemporary. They were married in Düsseldorf, the capital of the Electoral Palatinate, by the Bishop of Osnabrück on 2 July 1697. As she did not like cities or courts, Anna Maria Franziska demanded they establish themselves in her Bohemian residences, Ploskovice Castle and Reichstadt, post-haste.

Gian Gastone found life in the little village intolerable. Anna Maria Franziska was unpredictable and prone to outbursts of rage, she held &quot;conversations in the stables [i.e. with the horses]&quot; and would rather have remained a widow than have been married again. The lack of intellectual society there and his wife&#x27;s hostility towards him drove Gian Gastone to increased drinking. Gian Gastone, unable to rein in his disgust, abandoned Anna Maria Franziska for Paris after one year in Reichstadt. When he arrived there, an enraged Cosimo, who had explicitly told his son not to leave Anna Maria Franziksa without his prior consent, ordered him back to Reichstadt. Anna Maria Franziska made an effort to welcome him back; however, her mood turned sour when Gian Gastone brought up the prospect of wintering in Prague. Thus, he went to Prague alone but for his suite and favourite attendant, Giuliano Dami.

Gian Gastone&#x27;s once acclaimed complexion and weight were ruined by the course of dissipation he pursued in Prague, becoming blotchy and bloated respectively. Dami acted as a pimp for the Prince, soliciting countless young men for his master&#x27;s enjoyment. The Prince frequently gambled, racking up exorbitant debts, losing on one occasion 150,000 crowns. His ruinous behaviour was relayed to Florence by the Electress Palatine. Gian Gastone replied to Cosimo&#x27;s ensuing admonishments with an account of his married life, blaming Anna Maria Franziska&#x27;s &quot;capriciousness, peevish faces and sharp words&quot; for his desperate conduct. Considering summoning him to Florence, Cosimo sent the Marquis Rinuccini to scrutinise his younger son&#x27;s debts. Rinnucci was horrified to learn that the Archbishop of Prague was among his creditors. Anna Maria Franziska greeted Rinuccini warmly, and implied that Gian Gastone pawned some of her jewels to ameliorate his gambling debts. The Marquis concluded that nothing— not even the Holy Roman Empress&#x27;s reproaches— could compel Anna Maria Franziska to Florence, where Gian Gastone longed to be. Forced once again to quell his enmity towards his wife, Gian Gastone returned to Reichstadt as per the Holy Roman Emperor and Holy Roman Empress&#x27;s advice. Nevertheless, their reconciliation was brief, and Gian Gastone left for Hamburg in October 1703, only to return to Prague the next February.

The Grand Duke tired of the Princess of Saxe-Lauenburg&#x27;s stubborn ways. He requisitioned the help of Pope Clement XI, who sent the Archbishop of Prague to tell her she must go to Florence with Gian Gastone. The Princess was incensed, replying that there was no point going with him because he was &quot;absolutely impotent.&quot; Cosimo III conceded defeat and recalled Gian Gastone to Florence in 1708; he never saw his wife again.

=== Return to Florence (1708–1723) ===

As Prince Gian Gastone disliked his father&#x27;s hyper-pious character, he elected to stay away from him and the royal court. The closed court that Gian Gastone did keep was dominated by his favourite, Dami. Meanwhile, Grand Prince Ferdinando was slowly dying from syphilis, making Gian Gastone&#x27;s immediate succession more likely. Ferdinando, nonetheless, was not alone in his suffering: Guyot de Merville, a French adventurer, took note of Gian Gastone&#x27;s mental decline: &quot;He carries [apathy] so far that it is said he never opens a letter, to avoid having to answer.&quot; Additionally, Gian Gastone&#x27;s fragile temperament required long periods of isolation; he spent several hours alone each night, drinking and staring up at the moon.

The Grand Prince finally succumbed to syphilis on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis. Cosimo III deposited a bill in the Tuscan senate, the nominal legislature, provisioning for a male line succession failure by making the Electress Palatine Gian Gastone&#x27;s heiress. It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused to sanction it, fearing that Tuscany would fall into the hands of the House of Bourbon. However, France and England did.

The Electress returned to Florence in October 1717, following the death of her husband the previous summer. Violante Beatrice of Bavaria, to whom Gian Gastone had become quite attached, disliked the Electress and therefore left the grand ducal court for the position of governor of the town of Siena. The Electress, now the First Lady of Tuscany, and Gian Gastone were not on good terms: he scorned her for marrying him to Anna Maria Franziska, who, for eleven years, made his life unbearable.

On 4 April 1718, England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) selected Charles of Spain, the elder child of Elisabeth Farnese (a great-granddaughter of Margherita de&#x27; Medici) and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir, the Electress&#x27;s rights to the throne being completely disregarded in the process. All his ambitions in regards to the succession being thwarted, Cosimo III distributed one final proclamation shortly before his death, on 31 October 1723, decreeing that the Electress should succeed Gian Gastone. Unfortunately for Cosimo, his declaration was completely ignored.

=== Reign (1723–1737) ===
The Tuscany Gian Gastone inherited was in a pitiful state: the army numbered less than 3,000, the royal coffers were empty and Florence was full of beggars. The ramshackle condition of the capital was noted by philosopher Montesquieu five years into Gian Gastone&#x27;s reign: &quot;There is no town where men live in less luxury than Florence&quot;. Despite these hindrances, Gian Gastone, aged 52, commenced his reign with a burst of ebullience, releasing prisoners, abolishing exorbitant taxes, &quot;Pensions on the Creed&quot; (monies paid to converts to Christianity) and public executions.

Gian Gastone recalled Violante Beatrice to the royal court and banished his sister, the Dowager Electress, to the Villa La Quiete. The Governor reigned supreme over Tuscan society, and Gian Gastone delegated most of his public duties to her, and chose to spend most of his time in bed. Here, Gian Gastone was entertained by the &quot;Ruspanti&quot;, a team of poor, handsome young men assembled by Dami, who performed sexual acts for and with the Grand Duke. Loathing the aristocracy, Gian Gastone called the foremost &quot;Ruspanti&quot; by the names of prominent Tuscan nobles. A contemporary dubbed the head of the &quot;Ruspanti&quot;, Giuliano Dami, &quot;the despot of Gian Gastone&#x27;s court&quot;; he exploited his influence with the Grand Duke by offering anybody who was willing to bribe him an audience with their monarch.

During the period 1723–1731, the powers-that-be busied themselves hammering out a solution to the &quot;Tuscan question&quot;. Spain zealously endorsed its candidate, Charles of Spain, who had been made heir by the powers in 1718 but did not enjoy universal recognition; Austria would not accept another Bourbon monarch in Italy. Gian Gastone, knowing the Dowager Electress probably would never succeed, went about ensuring his sister&#x27;s inheritance of all the House of Medici&#x27;s private property. Thus, he separated Medici possessions from those of the state; hitherto, there had been no distinction between the two.

Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, following the former&#x27;s sojourn in Rome, in spite of their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone&#x27;s decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the &quot;Ruspanti&quot;. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist&#x27;s day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.

The &quot;Tuscan question&quot; finally seemed resolved by the Treaty of Vienna (1731): in exchange for Spain and its allies&#x27; recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, Austria confirmed Infante Charles as Gian Gastone&#x27;s heir—the Grand Duke wasn&#x27;t consulted. He was, however, appointed joint-guardian of the Infante with Dorothea Sophie of the Palatinate-Neuburg, Dowager Duchess of Parma and the Electress Palatine&#x27;s sister-in-law. Thirty thousand Spanish troops occupied the Grand Duchy of Tuscany on Charles&#x27;s behalf in October 1731. Charles, known as Duke of Parma since January, arrived in Florence the next March. Gian Gastone was taken with the Infante-Duke, showering him with gifts. He even went so far as to have the Duke created Grand Prince of Tuscany, the title borne by the Tuscan heir-apparent, against the wishes of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI; however, the latter soon had the grant revoked.

After the War of the Polish Succession broke out in 1733, Charles marched a Spanish army south and defeated the Austrians holding the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily. Pursuant to preliminary peace terms negotiated in 1735 (but not finalized until after Gian Gastone&#x27;s death with the 1738 Treaty of Vienna), Charles surrendered Parma and the claim to the Tuscan throne to Francis III of Lorraine in exchange for being crowned king of Naples and Sicily. (Francis was forced to surrender the Duchy of Lorraine to Stanisław Leszczyński, the losing claimant to the Polish throne.) Neither the Grand Duke nor Francis III were consulted. The latter was reluctant to cede his homeland to France, but the Holy Roman Emperor (soon to be his father-in-law) compelled him. Gian Gastone was angry; he had become quite attached to the Infante-Duke, and didn&#x27;t like the prospect of a foreigner ruling Tuscany. Spain accordingly withdrew its troops from Tuscany in January 1737; 6,000 Austrians took their place on Francis&#x27;s behalf.

=== Death and legacy ===

By the time of the Spanish withdrawal, the Grand Duke was dying from &quot;an accumulation of diseases&quot;. One of his final acts was to order the erection of a statue of Galileo Galilei, who had been patronised by his great-grandfather Cosimo II and his grandfather Grand Duke Ferdinando II, in the Basilica of Santa Croce. Anna Maria Luisa, the Dowager Electress Palatine, rushed to his bedside when it became apparent he would not recover. Gian Gastone could not eat anything, and his condition steadily worsened; Anna Maria Luisa subsequently had him moved to a clean bed. Worried for her brother&#x27;s soul, the Dowager Electress had the irreligious Gian Gastone repent for his sins. On 9 July 1737, in the fourteenth year of his reign, the last Medicean Grand Duke died. The Electress Anna Maria Luisa inherited all of the House of Medici&#x27;s allodial possessions, but in accordance with the wishes of the great powers, Francis of Lorraine inherited the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany.

Gian Gastone gave his all in reforming his realm, purging corrupt churchmen from government, reversing Cosimo III&#x27;s ban of teaching &quot;new ideas&quot;, i.e. the philosophy of Galileo et al., in the University of Pisa and abolishing the burdensome income taxes. As a result, he was sincerely mourned by his people. Charles de Brosses, a French politician and writer, wrote, in 1739, &quot;The Tuscans would give two-thirds of their property to have the Medici back, and the other third to get rid of the Lorrainers.&quot; This sentiment did not diminish much in 62 years, when, in 1799, during the French occupation of Tuscany, the people called for the long-dead Gian Gastone to ascend the throne. His remains were interred in the Medicean necropolis, the Basilica of San Lorenzo. His corpse was dressed in &quot;black velvet&quot;, according to &quot;Official Report on the Examination of the Tombs in the Medici Mausoleum&quot; of 1857, &quot;with, over this, the great cloak of Grand Master of the Order of Saint Stephen. On the head was the Grand Ducal crown, worn over a cap; and by his side the sceptre. But the crown and sceptre were corroded by the acids which had been used in embalming the body.&quot; The one group who may have taken exception to such adulation is the Freemasons whom, in his final year, under harsh penalty he forbade to meet.

As of August 2015, access to see his white rectangular marble tomb slab is denied. His remains are not under the white slab; they are under a grey circular stone near his slab. Under this grey stone is a red brick staircase which leads to an underground burial chamber that was studied for the first time ever in 2004. In the chamber are many family members. Gian Gastone had a lead coffin in a wooden frame. It was replaced with a modern coffin. Near him are the remains of many de&#x27; Medici children who were buried in unmarked graves. Some of them still have their garments.

Gian Gastone was descended from both Cosimo the Elder and Lorenzo the Elder through the marriage between Maria Salviati, grandchild of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo the Elder. This becomes clearer when one understands their common ancestor: Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici, father to both Lorenzo the Elder and Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. Thus the kings of France from Louis XIII and on, are descended from the &#x27;cadet&#x27; branch, continuing the House of Medici in the female line.

<doc id="292598" wikidata="Q2673740" url="?curid=292598" title="Appalachia">
<text>Appalachia (, ) is a geographic region located in the central and southern sections of the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. In the north, its boundaries stretch from the western Catskill Mountains of New York, continuing south through the Blue Ridge Mountains and Great Smoky Mountains into northern Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, with West Virginia near the center, being the only state entirely within the boundaries of Appalachia. In 2021, the region was home to an estimated 26.3 million people.

Since its recognition as a cultural region in the late 19th century, Appalachia has been a source of enduring myths and distortions regarding the isolation, temperament, and behavior of its inhabitants. Early 20th-century writers often engaged in yellow journalism focused on sensationalistic aspects of the region&#x27;s culture, such as moonshining and clan feuding, portraying the region&#x27;s inhabitants as uneducated and unrefined; although these stereotypes still exist to a lesser extent today, sociological studies have since begun to dispel them.

While endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled economically and has been associated with poverty. In the early 20th century, large-scale logging and coal mining firms brought jobs and modern amenities to Appalachia, but by the 1960s the region had failed to capitalize on any long-term benefits from these two industries. Beginning in the 1930s, the federal government sought to alleviate poverty in the Appalachian region with a series of New Deal initiatives, specifically the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA was responsible for the construction of hydroelectric dams that provide a vast amount of electricity and that support programs for better farming practices, regional planning, and economic development.

In 1965, the Appalachian Regional Commission was created to further alleviate poverty in the region, mainly by diversifying the region&#x27;s economy and helping to provide better health care and educational opportunities to the region&#x27;s inhabitants. By 1990, Appalachia had largely joined the economic mainstream but still lagged behind the rest of the nation in most economic indicators.

==Definitions==

Since Appalachia lacks definite physiographical or topographical boundaries, there has been some disagreement over what the region encompasses. The most commonly used modern definition of Appalachia is the one initially defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) in 1965 and expanded over subsequent decades. The region defined by the commission currently includes 420 counties and eight independent cities in 13 states, including all 55 counties in West Virginia, 14 counties in New York, 52 in Pennsylvania, 32 in Ohio, 3 in Maryland, 54 in Kentucky, 25 counties and 8 cities in Virginia, 29 in North Carolina, 52 in Tennessee, 6 in South Carolina, 37 in Georgia, 37 in Alabama, and 24 in Mississippi. When the commission was established, counties were added based on economic need, however, rather than any cultural parameters.

The first major attempt to map Appalachia as a distinctive cultural region came in the 1890s with the efforts of Berea College president William Goodell Frost, whose &quot;Appalachian America&quot; included 194 counties in 8 states. In 1921, John C. Campbell published &quot;The Southern Highlander and His Homeland,&quot; in which he modified Frost&#x27;s map to include 254 counties in 9 states. A landmark survey of the region in the following decade by the United States Department of Agriculture defined the region as consisting of 206 counties in 6 states. In 1984, Karl Raitz and Richard Ulack expanded the ARC&#x27;s definition to include 445 counties in 13 states, although they removed all counties in Mississippi and added two in New Jersey. Historian John Alexander Williams, in his 2002 book &quot;Appalachia: A History&quot;, distinguished between a &quot;core&quot; Appalachian region consisting of 164 counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, and a greater region defined by the ARC.

In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Appalachia&quot; (2006), Appalachian State University historian Howard Dorgan suggests the term &quot;Old Appalachia&quot; for the region&#x27;s cultural boundaries, noting an academic tendency to ignore the southwestern and northeastern extremes of the ARC&#x27;s pragmatic definition. The term &quot;Greater Appalachia&quot; was introduced by American journalist Colin Woodard in his 2011 book, &quot;American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America&quot;. Sean Trende, senior elections analyst at &quot;RealClearPolitics&quot;, defines &quot;Greater Appalachia&quot; in his 2012 book, &quot;The Lost Majority,&quot; as including both the Appalachian Mountains region and the Upland South, following Protestant Scotch-Irish migrations to the southern and Midwestern United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Upland South region includes the Ozark Plateau in Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, an area which is not included in the ARC definition.

===Toponymy and pronunciation===
While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the Narváez expedition, including Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, found a village of indigenous peoples near present-day Tallahassee, Florida, whose name they transcribed as &quot;Apalchen&quot; or &quot;Apalachen&quot; (). The name was altered by the Spanish to &quot;Apalache&quot; (Apalachee) and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. Pánfilo de Narváez&#x27;s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled &quot;Appalachian,&quot; it is the fourth oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S. After the de Soto expedition in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the Appalachian Mountain range. The first cartographic appearance of &quot;Apalchen&quot; is on Diego Gutiérrez&#x27;s 1562 map; the first use for the mountain range is the 1565 map by Jacques le Moyne de Morgues. Le Moyne was also the first European to apply &quot;Apalachen&quot; specifically to a mountain range as opposed to a village, native tribe, or a southeastern region of North America.

The name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing, and often more popular, name was the &quot;Allegheny Mountains&quot;, &quot;Alleghenies&quot;, and even &quot;Alleghania&quot;.

In southern U.S. dialects, the mountains are called the , and the cultural region of Appalachia is pronounced , both with a third syllable like the &quot;la&quot; in &quot;latch&quot;. This pronunciation is favored in the &quot;core&quot; region in the central and southern parts of the Appalachian range. In northern U.S. dialects, the mountains are pronounced or . The cultural region of Appalachia is pronounced , also , all with a third syllable like &quot;lay&quot;. The use of northern pronunciations is controversial to some in the southern region. Despite not being in Appalachia, Appalachian Trail organizations in New England popularized the occasional use of the &quot;sh&quot; sound for the &quot;ch&quot; in northern dialects in the early 20th century.

==History==

===Early history===
Native American hunter-gatherers first arrived in what is now Appalachia over 16,000 years ago. The earliest discovered site is the Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Washington County, Pennsylvania, which some scientists claim is pre-Clovis culture. Several other Archaic period (8000–1000 BC) archaeological sites have been identified in the region, such as the St. Albans site in West Virginia and the Icehouse Bottom site in Tennessee. The presence of Africans in the Appalachian Mountains dates back to the 16th century with the arrival of European colonists. Enslaved Africans were first brought to America during the 16th-century Spanish expeditions to the mountainous regions of the South. In 1526 enslaved Africans were brought to the Pee Dee River region of western North Carolina by Spanish explorer Lucas Vazquez de Ayllõn. Enslaved Africans also accompanied the expeditions of Fernando de Soto in 1540 and Juan Pardo in 1566, who both traveled through Appalachia.

The de Soto and Pardo expeditions explored the mountains of South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and encountered complex agrarian societies consisting of Muskogean-speaking inhabitants. De Soto indicated that much of the region west of the mountains was part of the domain of Coosa, a paramount chiefdom centered around a village complex in northern Georgia. By the time English explorers arrived in Appalachia in the late 17th century, the central part of the region was controlled by Algonquian tribes (namely the Shawnee), and the southern part of the region was controlled by the Cherokee. The French based in modern-day Quebec also made inroads into the northern areas of the region in modern-day New York state and Pennsylvania. By the mid-18th century the French had outposts such as Fort Duquesne and Fort Le Boeuf controlling the access points of the Allegheny River and upper Ohio River valleys after exploration by Celeron de Bienville.

European migration into Appalachia began in the 18th century. As lands in eastern Pennsylvania, the Tidewater region of Virginia and the Carolinas filled up, immigrants began pushing further and further westward into the Appalachian Mountains. A relatively large proportion of the early backcountry immigrants were Ulster Scots—later known as &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot;, a group mostly originating from southern Scotland and northern England, many of whom had settled in Ulster Ireland prior to migrating to America—who were seeking cheaper land and freedom from prejudice as the Scotch-Irish were looked down upon by other more powerful elements in society. Others included Germans from the Palatinate region and English settlers from the Anglo-Scottish border country. Between 1730 and 1763, immigrants trickled into western Pennsylvania, the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and western Maryland. Thomas Walker&#x27;s discovery of the Cumberland Gap in 1750 and the end of the French and Indian War in 1763 lured settlers deeper into the mountains, namely to upper east Tennessee, northwestern North Carolina, upstate South Carolina, and central Kentucky.

During the 18th century, enslaved Africans were brought to Appalachia by European settlers of trans-Appalachia Kentucky and the upper Blue Ridge Valley. According to the first census of 1790, more than 3,000 enslaved Africans were transported across the mountains into East Tennessee and more than 12,000 into the Kentucky mountains. Between 1790 and 1840, a series of treaties with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes opened up lands in north Georgia, north Alabama, the Tennessee Valley, the Cumberland Plateau, and the Great Smoky Mountains. The last of these treaties culminated in the removal of the bulk of the Cherokee population (as well as Choctaw, Chickasaw and others) from the region via the Trail of Tears in the 1830s.

===Appalachian frontier===
Appalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a coonskin cap and buckskin clothing, and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped powder horn. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than Daniel Boone, a long hunter and surveyor instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from &quot;civilization&quot; by high mountain ridges and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century.

As early as the 18th century, Appalachia (then known simply as the &quot;backcountry&quot;) began to distinguish itself from its wealthier lowland and coastal neighbors to the east. Frontiersmen often argued with lowland and tidewater elites over taxes, sometimes to the point of armed revolts such as the Regulator Movement (1767–1771) in North Carolina. In 1778, at the height of the American Revolution, backwoodsmen from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and what is now Kentucky took part in George Rogers Clark&#x27;s Illinois campaign. Two years later, a group of Appalachian frontiersmen known as the Overmountain Men routed British forces at the Battle of Kings Mountain after rejecting a call by the British to disarm. After the war, residents throughout the Appalachian backcountry—especially the Monongahela region in western Pennsylvania and antebellum northwestern Virginia (now the north-central part of West Virginia)—refused to pay a tax placed on whiskey by the new American government, leading to what became known as the Whiskey Rebellion. The resulting tighter federal controls in the Monongahela valley resulted in many whiskey/bourbon makers migrating via the Ohio River to Kentucky and Tennessee where the industry could flourish.

===Early 19th century===
In the early 19th century, the rift between the yeoman farmers of Appalachia and their wealthier lowland counterparts continued to grow, especially as the latter dominated most state legislatures. People in Appalachia began to feel slighted over what they considered unfair taxation methods and lack of state funding for improvements (especially for roads). In the northern half of the region, the lowland elites consisted largely of industrial and business interests, whereas in the parts of the region south of the Mason–Dixon line, the lowland elites consisted of large-scale land-owning planters. The Whig Party, formed in the 1830s, drew widespread support from disaffected Appalachians.

Tensions between the mountain counties and state governments sometimes reached the point of mountain counties threatening to break off and form separate states. In 1832, bickering between western Virginia and eastern Virginia over the state&#x27;s constitution led to calls on both sides for the state&#x27;s separation into two states. In 1841, Tennessee state senator (and later U.S. president) Andrew Johnson introduced legislation in the Tennessee Senate calling for the creation of a separate state in East Tennessee. The proposed state would have been known as &quot;Frankland&quot; and would have invited like-minded mountain counties in Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama to join it.

====Proposal to rename the United States====

In 1839 Washington Irving proposed to rename the United States &quot;Alleghania&quot; or &quot;Appalachia&quot; in place of &quot;America&quot;, since the latter name belonged to Latin America too. Edgar Allan Poe later took up the idea and considered Appalachia a much better name than America or Alleghania; he thought it better defined the United States as a distinct geographical entity, separate from the rest of the Americas, and he also thought it did honor to both Irving and the natives after whom the Appalachian Mountains had been named. At the time, however, the United States had already reached far beyond the greater Appalachian region, but the &quot;magnificence&quot; of Appalachia Poe considered enough to rechristen the nation with a name that would be unique to its character. However, Poe&#x27;s popular influence only grew decades after his death, and so the name was never seriously considered.

===U.S. Civil War===

By 1860, the Whig Party had disintegrated. Sentiments in northern Appalachia had shifted to the pro-abolitionist Republican Party. In southern Appalachia, abolitionists still constituted a radical minority, although several smaller opposition parties (most of which were both pro-Union and pro-slavery) were formed to oppose the planter-dominated Southern Democrats. As states in the southern United States moved toward secession, a majority of southern Appalachians still supported the Union. Though with opposition by Southern Unionist, middle and southern Appalachia became components of the Confederacy. In 1861, a Minnesota newspaper identified 161 counties in southern Appalachia—which the paper called &quot;Alleghenia&quot;—where Union support remained strong, and which might provide crucial support for the defeat of the Confederacy. However, many of these Unionists—especially in the mountain areas of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama—were &quot;conditional&quot; Unionists in that they opposed secession but also opposed violence to prevent secession, and thus when their respective state legislatures voted to secede, some would either shift their support to the Confederacy, or flee the state. Kentucky sought to remain neutral at the outset of the conflict, opting not to supply troops to either side. After Virginia voted to secede, several mountain counties in northwestern Virginia rejected the ordinance and with the help of the Union Army established a separate state, admitted to the Union as West Virginia in 1863. However, half the counties included in the new state, comprising two-thirds of its territory, were secessionist and pro-Confederate.

This caused great difficulty for the Unionist state government in Wheeling, both during and after the war. A similar effort occurred in East Tennessee. Still, the initiative failed after Tennessee&#x27;s governor ordered the Confederate Army to occupy the region, forcing East Tennessee&#x27;s Unionists to flee to the north or go into hiding. The one exception was the so-called Free and Independent State of Scott, though it was never recognized by either the Union or the Confederacy and thus would later be invaded by Confederates.

Both central and southern Appalachia suffered tremendous violence and turmoil during the Civil War. While there were two major theaters of operation in the region—namely the Shenandoah Valley and the Chattanooga area—much of the violence was caused by bushwhackers and guerrilla warfare. The northernmost battles of the war were fought in Appalachia with the Battle of Buffington Island and the Battle of Salineville resulting from Morgan&#x27;s Raid. Large numbers of livestock were killed (grazing was an important part of Appalachia&#x27;s economy), and numerous farms were destroyed, pillaged, or neglected. The actions of both Union and Confederate armies left many inhabitants in the region resentful of government authority and suspicious of outsiders for decades after the war.

===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===

====Economic boom====
After the Civil War, northern Appalachia experienced an economic boom. At the same time, economies in the southern region stagnated, especially as Southern Democrats regained control of their respective state legislatures at the end of Reconstruction. Pittsburgh as well as Knoxville grew into major industrial centers, especially regarding iron and steel production. By 1900, the Chattanooga area of north Georgia and northern Alabama had experienced similar changes with manufacturing booms in Atlanta and Birmingham at the edge of the Appalachian region. Railroad construction gave the greater nation access to the vast coalfields in central Appalachia, making its economy greatly dependent on coal mining. As the nationwide demand for lumber skyrocketed, lumber firms turned to the virgin forests of southern Appalachia, using sawmill and logging railroad innovations to reach remote timber stands. The Tri-Cities area of Tennessee and Virginia and the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia became major petrochemical production centers.

====Stereotypes====

The late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the development of various regional stereotypes. Attempts by President Rutherford B. Hayes to enforce the whiskey tax in the late 1870s led to an explosion in violence between Appalachian &quot;moonshiners&quot; and federal &quot;revenuers&quot; that lasted through the Prohibition period in the 1920s. The breakdown of authority and law enforcement during the Civil War may have contributed to an increase in clan feuding, which by the 1880s was reported to be a problem across most of Kentucky&#x27;s Cumberland region as well as Carter County, Tennessee; Carroll County, Virginia; and Mingo and Logan counties in West Virginia. Regional writers from this period such as Mary Noailles Murfree and Horace Kephart liked to focus on such sensational aspects of mountain culture, leading readers outside the region to believe they were more widespread than in reality. In an 1899 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Berea College president William G. Frost attempted to redefine the inhabitants of Appalachia as &quot;noble mountaineers&quot;—relics of the nation&#x27;s pioneer period whose isolation had left them unaffected by modern times.

Entering the 21st century, residents of Appalachia are viewed by many Americans as uneducated and unrefined, resulting in culture-based stereotyping and discrimination in many areas, including employment and housing. Such discrimination has prompted some to seek redress under prevailing federal and state civil rights laws.

====Feuds====

Appalachia, and especially Kentucky, became nationally known for its violent feuds in the remote mountain districts. They pitted the men in extended clans against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with ambushes, gunfights, and pre-arranged shootouts. The infamous Hatfield-McCoy Feud was the best-known of these family feuds. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes. Journalists often wrote about the violence, using stereotypes that &quot;city folks&quot; had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the natural products of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps even inbreeding. In reality, the leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who, like the Northeast and Chicago political machines, fought for their power over local and regional politics.

===Modern Appalachia===
Logging firms&#x27; rapid devastation of the forests of the Appalachians sparked a movement among conservationists to preserve what remained and allow the land to &quot;heal&quot;. In 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act, giving the federal government authority to create national forests east of the Mississippi River and control timber harvesting. Regional writers and business interests led a movement to create national parks in the eastern United States similar to Yosemite and Yellowstone in the west, culminating in the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Shenandoah National Park, Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, and the Blue Ridge Parkway in the 1930s. During the same period, New England forester Benton MacKaye led the movement to build the Appalachian Trail, stretching from Georgia to Maine.

Several significant moments of investment by the United States government into areas of science and technology were established in the mid-20th century, notably with NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, crucial with the design of Apollo program launch vehicles and propulsion of the Space Shuttle program, and at adjacent facilities Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee with the Manhattan Project and advancements in supercomputing and nuclear power.

By the 1950s, poor farming techniques and the loss of jobs to mechanization in the mining industry had left much of central and southern Appalachia poverty-stricken. The lack of jobs also led to widespread difficulties with outmigration. Beginning in the 1930s, federal agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority began investing in the Appalachian region. Sociologists such as James Brown and Cratis Williams and authors such as Harry Caudill and Michael Harrington brought attention to the region&#x27;s plight in the 1960s, prompting Congress to create the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965. The commission&#x27;s efforts helped to stem the tide of outmigration and diversify the region&#x27;s economies. Although there have been drastic improvements in the region&#x27;s economic conditions since the commission&#x27;s founding, the ARC listed 80 counties as &quot;distressed&quot; in 2020, with nearly half of them (38) in Kentucky.

Since the 1980s, population growth in southern Appalachia has brought about concerns of farmland loss and hazards to the local environment. Regarding housing development, exurban development, characterized by its low-density housing, has violated the habitats of native species and contributed significantly to the decline in agricultural land use in larger Appalachia.

There are growing IT sectors in many parts of the region. Frontier, the fastest supercomputer in the world, is housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In the 21st century, Appalachia has swung heavily towards the Republican Party.

==Cities==


Due to topographic considerations, several major cities are located near but not included in Appalachia. These include Cincinnati, Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia. Pittsburgh is the largest city by population to be sometimes considered within the Appalachian region.

As defined by the 2020 census, the following metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are sometimes included as part of Appalachia:

==Culture==

===Ethnic groups===

An estimated 90% of Appalachia&#x27;s earliest European settlers originated from the Anglo-Scottish border country—namely the English counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Northumberland, County Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the Lowland Scottish counties of Ayrshire, Dumfriesshire, Roxburghshire, Berwickshire and Wigtownshire. Most of these were from families who had been resettled in the Ulster Plantation in northern Ireland in the 17th century, but some came directly from the Anglo-Scottish border region. In America, these people are often grouped under the single name &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; or &quot;Scots-Irish&quot;. Many of these Scots-Irish emigrated to the Blue Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee.

Although Swedes and Finns formed only a tiny portion of the Appalachian settlers, it was Swedish and Finnish settlers of New Sweden who brought the northern European woodsman skills such as log cabin construction which formed the basis of backwoods Appalachian material culture.

Germans were a major pioneer group to migrate to Appalachia, settling mainly in western Pennsylvania and southwest Virginia. Smaller numbers of Germans were also among the initial wave of migrants to the southern mountains. The initial wave of Appalachian ethnography and anthropology in the first half of the 20th century disregarded this German culture, instead choosing to focus almost solely on the Scots-Irish component of Appalachian culture. This was likely due to Germanophobia caused by the two World Wars, and has since begun to be corrected.

In the 19th century, Welsh immigrants were brought into the region for their mining and metallurgical expertise, and by 1900 over 100,000 Welsh immigrants were living in western Pennsylvania alone. Thousands of German-speaking Swiss migrated to Appalachia in the second half of the 19th century, and their descendants remain in places such as East Bernstadt, Kentucky, and Gruetli-Laager, Tennessee. The coal mining and manufacturing boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought large numbers of Italians and Eastern Europeans to Appalachia, although most of these families left the region when the Great Depression shattered the economy in the 1930s. African Americans have been present in the region since the 18th century, and currently make up 8% of the ARC-designated region, mostly concentrated in urban areas and former mining and manufacturing towns; The African-American component of Appalachia is sometimes termed Affrilachia.

Native Americans, the region&#x27;s original inhabitants, are now only a small percentage of the region&#x27;s present population, their most notable concentration being the reservation of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina. The Melungeons, a group of mixed African, European, and Native American ancestry, are scattered across northeastern Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, and southwestern Virginia.

According to the American Factfinder&#x27;s 2013 data, the Southern Appalachia has a white majority, comprising 84% of the population. African Americans are 7% and Hispanics or Latinos are 6% of the population. Asians and Pacific Islanders are 1.5% of the population. The counties have great differences among themselves, in terms of racial and ethnic diversity.

===Religion===
Christianity is the main religion in Appalachia, which is characterized by a sense of independence and a distrust of religious hierarchies, both rooted in the evangelical tendencies of the region&#x27;s pioneers, many of whom had been influenced by the Holiness movement and &quot;New Light&quot; movement in England. Many of the denominations brought from Europe underwent modifications or factioning during the Second Great Awakening (especially the Holiness movement) in the early 19th century. Several 18th and 19th-century religious traditions are still practiced in parts of Appalachia, including natural water (or &quot;creek&quot;) baptism, rhythmically chanted preaching, congregational shouting, snake handling, and foot washing. While most church-goers in Appalachia attend fairly well-organized churches affiliated with regional or national bodies, small unaffiliated congregations are not uncommon in rural mountain areas.

Protestantism is the most dominant denomination in Appalachia, although there is a significant Roman Catholic presence in the northern half of the region and urban areas, such as Pittsburgh and Scranton. The region&#x27;s early Lowland and Ulster Scot immigrants brought Presbyterianism to Appalachia, eventually organizing into bodies such as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. English Baptists—most of whom had been influenced by the Separate Baptist and Regular Baptist movements—were also common on the Appalachian frontier, and today are represented in the region by groups such as the Free Will Baptists, the Southern Baptists, Missionary Baptists, and &quot;old-time&quot; groups such as the United Baptists and Primitive Baptists. Circuit riders such as Francis Asbury helped spread Methodism to Appalachia in the early 19th century, and today 9.2% of the region&#x27;s population is Methodist, represented by such bodies as the United Methodist Church, the Free Methodist Church, and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Pentecostal movements within the region include the Church of God (based in Cleveland, Tennessee) and the Assemblies of God. Scattered Mennonite colonies exist throughout the region.

===Dialect===

The Appalachian dialect is a dialect of Midland American English known as the Southern Midland dialect and is spoken primarily in central and southern Appalachia. The Northern Midland dialect is spoken in the northern parts of the region, while Pittsburgh English (more commonly known as &quot;Pittsburghese&quot;) is strongly influenced by the Appalachian dialect. The Southern Appalachian dialect is considered part of the Southern American dialect, although the two are distinguished by the rhotic nature of the Appalachian dialect. Early 20th-century writers believed the Appalachian dialect to be a surviving relic of Old World Scottish or Elizabethan dialects. Recent research suggests, however, that while the dialect has a stronger Scottish influence than other American dialects, most of its distinguishing characteristics have developed in the United States.

===Education===

For much of the region&#x27;s history, education in Appalachia has lagged behind the rest of the nation due in part to struggles with funding from respective state governments and an agrarian-oriented population that often did not see a practical need for formal education. Early education in the region evolved from teaching Christian morality and learning to read the Bible in small, one-room schoolhouses that convened in months when children were not needed to help with farm work. After the Civil War, mandatory education laws and state assistance helped larger communities begin to establish grade schools and high schools. During the same period, many of the region&#x27;s institutions of higher education were established or greatly expanded. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, service organizations such as Pi Beta Phi and various religious organizations established settlement schools and mission schools in the region&#x27;s more rural areas.

In the 20th century, national trends began to have more of an effect on education in Appalachia, sometimes clashing with the region&#x27;s traditional values. The Scopes Trial—the nation&#x27;s most publicized debate over the teaching of the theory of evolution—took place in Dayton, Tennessee, in southern Appalachia in 1925. Despite consolidation and centralization, schools in Appalachia struggled to keep up with federal and state demands into the 21st century. Since 2001, a number of the region&#x27;s public schools were threatened with loss of funding due to difficulties fulfilling the demands of No Child Left Behind.

===Music===
Appalachian music is one of the best-known manifestations of Appalachian culture. Traditional Appalachian music (called old-time music) is derived primarily from the English, Irish, and Scottish ballad and fiddle traditions. African-American blues musicians played a significant role in developing the instrumental aspects of Appalachian music, most notably with the introduction of the five-stringed banjo—one of the region&#x27;s iconic symbols—in the late 18th century. Another instrument known in Appalachian culture was the Appalachian dulcimer which, practically, is a guitar-shaped instrument laid on its side with a flat bottom and the strings plucked in a manner to make alternating notes.

In the years following World War I, British folklorist Cecil Sharp brought attention to Southern Appalachia when he noted that its inhabitants still sang hundreds of English and Scottish ballads that had been passed down to them from their ancestors. Commercial recordings of Appalachian musicians in the 1920s (such as the famous 1927 Bristol sessions) would have a significant impact on the development of country music and bluegrass. Traditional Appalachian music saw a resurgence in popularity across the country during the American folk music revival of the 1960s, when musicologists such as Mike Seeger, John Cohen, and Ralph Rinzler traveled to remote parts of the region in search of musicians who they thought were unaffected by modern music. Today, dozens of annual music festivals held throughout the region preserve the Appalachian music tradition.

===Literature===

Early Appalachian literature typically centered on the observations of people from outside the region, such as Henry Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; (1765) and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1784), although there are notable exceptions, including Davy Crockett&#x27;s &quot;A Narrative of the Life of Davy Crockett&quot; (1834). Travellers&#x27; accounts published in 19th-century magazines gave rise to Appalachian local color, which reached its height with George Washington Harris&#x27;s Sut Lovingood character of the 1860s and native novelists such as Mary Noailles Murfree. Works such as Rebecca Harding Davis&#x27;s &quot;Life in the Iron Mills&quot; (1861), Emma Bell Miles&#x27; &quot;The Spirit of the Mountains&quot; (1905), Catherine Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Christy&quot; (1912), Horace Kephart&#x27;s &quot;Our Southern Highlanders&quot; (1913) marked a shift in the region&#x27;s literature from local color to realism. The transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society and its effects on Appalachia is captured in works such as Olive Tilford Dargan&#x27;s &quot;Call Home to the Heart&quot; (1932), Agnes Sligh Turnbull&#x27;s &quot;The Rolling Years&quot; (1936), James Still&#x27;s &quot;The River of Earth&quot; (1940), Harriette Simpson Arnow&#x27;s &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; (1954), and Harry Caudill&#x27;s &quot;Night Comes to the Cumberlands&quot; (1962). In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of authors like Breece D&#x27;J Pancake, Dorothy Allison, and Lisa Alther brought greater literary diversity to the region.

Along with the above-mentioned, some of Appalachia&#x27;s best known writers include James Agee (&quot;A Death in the Family&quot;), Anne W. Armstrong (&quot;This Day and Time&quot;), Wendell Berry (&quot;Hannah Coulter&quot;, &quot;The Unforeseen Wilderness: An Essay on Kentucky&#x27;s Red River Gorge&quot;, &quot;Selected Poems of Wendell Berry&quot;), Jesse Stuart (&quot;Taps for Private Tussie&quot;, &quot;The Thread That Runs So True&quot;), Denise Giardina (&quot;The Unquiet Earth&quot;, &quot;Storming Heaven&quot;), Lee Smith (&quot;Fair and Tender Ladies&quot;, &quot;On Agate Hill&quot;), Silas House (&quot;Clay&#x27;s Quilt&quot;, &quot;A Parchment of Leaves&quot;), Wilma Dykeman (&quot;The Far Family&quot;, &quot;The Tall Woman&quot;), Keith Maillard (&quot;Alex Driving South&quot;, &quot;Light in the Company of Women&quot;, &quot;Hazard Zones&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Running&quot;, &quot;Morgantown&quot;, &quot;Lyndon Johnson and the Majorettes&quot;, &quot;Looking Good&quot;) Maurice Manning (&quot;Bucolics&quot;, &quot;A Companion for Owls&quot;), Anne Shelby (&quot;Appalachian Studies&quot;, &quot;We Keep a Store&quot;), George Ella Lyon (&quot;Borrowed Children&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Remember?&quot;), Pamela Duncan (&quot;Moon Women&quot;, &quot;The Big Beautiful&quot;), David Joy (&quot;Where All Light Tends to Go&quot;, &quot;The Weight of This World&quot;), Chris Offutt (&quot;No Heroes&quot;, &quot;The Good Brother&quot;), Charles Frazier (&quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, &quot;Thirteen Moons&quot;), Sharyn McCrumb (&quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot;), Robert Morgan (&quot;Gap Creek&quot;), Jim Wayne Miller (&quot;The Brier Poems&quot;), Gurney Norman (&quot;Divine Right&#x27;s Trip&quot;, &quot;Kinfolks&quot;), Ron Rash (&quot;Serena&quot;), Elizabeth Madox Roberts (&quot;The Great Meadow&quot;, &quot;The Time of Man&quot;), Thomas Wolfe (&quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;), Rachel Carson (&quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;, &quot;Silent Spring&quot;; Presidential Medal of Freedom), and Jeannette Walls (&quot;The Glass Castle&quot;).

Appalachian literature crosses with the larger genre of Southern literature. Internationally renowned writers such as William Faulkner and Cormac McCarthy have made notable contributions to the American canon with tales set within Appalachia. McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Suttree&quot; (1979) is an intense vision of the squalidness and brutality of life along the Tennessee River, in the heart of Appalachia. Other McCarthy novels set in Appalachia include &quot;The Orchard Keeper&quot; (1965), &quot;Outer Dark&quot; (1968), and &quot;Child of God&quot; (1973). Appalachia also serves as the origin point for the kid, the protagonist of McCarthy&#x27;s Western masterpiece &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;. Faulkner&#x27;s hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, is on the borderlands of what is considered Appalachia, but his fictional Yoknapatawpha should be considered part of the region. Almost all of the fiction which earned him the Nobel Prize is set there, including &quot;Light in August&quot; and &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot;.

===Folklore and legends===

Appalachian folklore has a strong mixture of European, Native American (especially Cherokee), and Biblical influences. The Cherokee taught the region&#x27;s early European pioneers how to plant and cultivate crops such as corn and squash and how to find edible plants such as ramps. The Cherokee also passed along their knowledge of the medicinal properties of hundreds of native herbs and roots, and how to prepare tonics from such plants. Before the introduction of modern agricultural techniques in the region in the 1930s and 1940s, many Appalachian farmers followed the Biblical tradition of planting by &quot;the signs&quot;, such as the phases of the moon, or when certain weather conditions occurred.

Cherokee folklore continues to influence storytelling in the Appalachians, including depictions and characteristics of regional animals. As told by Eastern Band Cherokee and western North Carolina storyteller Jerry Wolfe, these creatures include the chipmunk, also known as &quot;seven stripes&quot; from an angry bear scratching him down the back—four claw marks and the spaces in between making seven—and the copperhead who sneaks and thieves his way into becoming venomous.

Appalachian folk tales are rooted in English, Scottish, and Irish fairy tales, as well as regional heroic figures and events. Jack tales, which tend to revolve around the exploits of a simple but dedicated figure named &quot;Jack&quot;, are popular at story-telling festivals. Other stories involve wild animals, such as hunting tales. In the industrial areas of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, the composite Joe Magarac steelworker story has been handed down. Regional folk heroes such as the railroad worker John Henry and frontiersmen Davy Crockett, Mike Fink and Johnny Appleseed are examples of real-life figures that evolved into popular folk tale subjects. Murder stories, such as Omie Wise and John Hardy, are popular subjects for Appalachian ballads. Ghost stories, or &quot;haint tales&quot; in regional English, are a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition. Ghost stories native to the region include the story of the Greenbrier Ghost, which is rooted in a Greenbrier County, West Virginia, murder.

Several urban legends and horror stories have been rooted in the Appalachia region. Since the 1960s the Point Pleasant, West Virginia, legend of Mothman has originated and been explored in popular culture including the 2002 film &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; loosely retelling the original tale. Since the 1910s, reports of glowing orbs around the Brown Mountain ridgeline in North Carolina have been the subject of paranormal theories including the ghost of slaves or Cherokee tribal warriors. Known as the Brown Mountain lights, the story has been adapted in popular culture, including an episode of the 1990s sci-fi drama &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The infamous story of the Bell Witch haunting in Tennessee has influenced several major films of the horror genre, including &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, and the &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; series. The not-deer, a legendary creature from the Appalachian folklore of Boone, North Carolina, gained widespread popularity online in the 2020s and became closely associated with the folklore of the region.

===Urban Appalachians===

Urban Appalachians are people from Appalachia who are living in metropolitan areas outside the Appalachian region. In the decades following the Great Depression and World War II, many Appalachian residents moved to industrial cities in the north and west in a migration that became known as the &quot;Hillbilly Highway&quot;. The mechanization of coal mining during the 1950s and 1960s was the major source of unemployment in central Appalachia. Many migration streams covered relatively short distances, with West Virginians moving to Cleveland and other cities in eastern and central Ohio, and eastern Kentuckians moving to Cincinnati and southwest Ohio in search of jobs. More distant cities like Detroit and Chicago attracted migrants from many states. Enclaves of Appalachian culture can still be found in some of these communities.

===Communications===
In the 1940s through the 1960s, Wheeling, West Virginia, became a cultural center of the region because it had a clear-channel AM radio station, WWVA, which could be heard throughout the entirety of the eastern United States at night. Although Pittsburgh&#x27;s KDKA was a 50-kilowatt clear channel station that dated back to the early 1920s (as well as spanning all the East Coast in signal strength), WWVA prided itself on rural and farm programming that appealed to a wider audience in the rural region. Cincinnati&#x27;s WLW also was relied on by many in the central and northern areas of Appalachia.

In the southern part of the region, WSB-AM Atlanta and WSM-AM Nashville, flagship of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, were major stations for the region&#x27;s population during the 20th century, and remain strong in the sub-region.

===Appalachian studies===

Appalachia as an academic interest was the product of a critical scholarship that emerged across the disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s. With a renewed interest in issues of power, scholars could not dismiss the social inequity, class conflict, and environmental destruction encountered by America&#x27;s so-called &quot;hillbillies&quot;. Appalachia&#x27;s emergence in academia is a result of the intersection between social conditions and critical academic interests, and has resulted in the development of many Appalachian studies programs in colleges and universities across the region, as well as in the Appalachian Studies Association.

==Economy==
The economy of Appalachia traditionally rested on agriculture, mining, timber, and in the cities, manufacturing. Since the late 20th century, tourism and second-home developments have assumed an increasingly major role. Appalachia has many different economic sectors, from aerospace and defense industries in the Greater Huntsville area in the southern part of Appalachia to tourism in many areas such as the Great Smokey Mountains and the Blue Ridge Parkway.

===Agriculture===
While the climate of the Appalachian region is suitable for agriculture, the region&#x27;s hilly terrain greatly limits the size of the average farm, a problem exacerbated by population growth in the latter half of the 19th century. Subsistence farming was the backbone of the Appalachian economy throughout much of the 19th century, and while economies in places such as western Pennsylvania, the Great Valley of Virginia, and the upper Tennessee Valley in east Tennessee, transitioned to a large-scale farming or manufacturing base around the time of the Civil War, subsistence farming remained an important part of the region&#x27;s economy until the 1950s. In the early 20th century, Appalachian farmers were struggling to mechanize, and abusive farming practices had over the years left much of the already-limited farmland badly eroded. Various federal entities intervened in the 1930s to restore damaged areas and introduce less harmful farming techniques. In recent decades, the concept of sustainable agriculture has been applied to the region&#x27;s small farms, with some success. Nevertheless, the number of farms in the Appalachian region continues to dwindle, plunging from 354,748 farms on in 1969 to 230,050 farms on in 1997.

Early Appalachian farmers grew both crops introduced from their native Europe as well as crops native to North America (such as corn and squash). Tobacco has long been an important cash crop in Southern Appalachia, especially since the land is ill-suited for cash crops such as cotton. Apples have been grown in the region since the late 18th century, their cultivation being aided by the presence of thermal belts in the region&#x27;s mountain valleys. Hogs, which could free range in the region&#x27;s abundant forests, often on chestnuts, were the most popular livestock among early Appalachian farmers. The American chestnut was also an important human food source until the chestnut blight struck in the 20th century. The early settlers also brought cattle and sheep to the region, which they would typically graze in highland meadows known as balds during the growing season when bottomlands were needed for crops. Cattle, mainly the Hereford, Angus, and Charolais breeds, are now the region&#x27;s chief livestock.

===Logging===
The mountains and valleys of Appalachia once contained what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of timber. The poor roads, lack of railroads, and general inaccessibility of the region, however, prevented large-scale logging in most of the region throughout much of the 19th century. While logging firms were established in the Carolinas and the Kentucky River valley before the Civil War, most major firms preferred to harvest the more accessible timber stands in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. By the 1880s, these stands had been exhausted, and a spike in the demand for lumber forced logging firms to seek out the virgin forests of Appalachia. The first major logging ventures in Appalachia transported logs using mule teams or rivers, the latter method sometimes employing splash dams. In the 1890s, innovations such as the Shay locomotive, the steam-powered loader, and the steam-powered skidder allowed massive harvesting of the most remote forest sections.

Logging in Appalachia reached its peak in the early 20th century, when firms such as the Ritter Lumber Company cut the virgin forests on an alarming scale, leading to the creation of national forests in 1911 and similar state entities to better manage the region&#x27;s timber resources. Arguably the most successful logging firm in Appalachia was the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company, established in 1927 and renamed Georgia-Pacific in 1948 when it expanded nationally. Although logging in Appalachia declined as the industry shifted focus to the Pacific Northwest in the 1950s, rising overseas demand in the 1980s brought a resurgence in Appalachian logging. In 1987, 4,810 lumber firms were operating in the region. In the late 1990s, the Appalachian lumber industry was a multibillion-dollar industry, employing 50,000 people in Tennessee, 26,000 in Kentucky, and 12,000 in West Virginia alone. By 1999, 1.4 million acres were extinguished as a result of deforestation by natural resource industries. Pollution from mining processes and disruption of the land ensued numerous environmental issues. Removal of vegetation and other alterations in the land increased erosion and flooding of surrounding areas. Water quality and aquatic life were also affected.

===Coal mining===

Coal mining is the industry most frequently associated with the region in outsiders&#x27; minds, due in part to the fact that the region once produced two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s coal. At present, however, the mining industry employs just 2% of the Appalachian workforce. The region&#x27;s vast coalfield covers between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama, mostly along the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions. Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania, with smaller operations in western Maryland, Tennessee and Alabama. The Pittsburgh coal seam, which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century, has been called the world&#x27;s most valuable mineral deposit. There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia and over 80 in eastern Kentucky. Most of the coal mined is bituminous, although significant anthracite deposits exist on the fringe of the region in central Pennsylvania. About two-thirds of Appalachia&#x27;s coal is produced by underground mining, the rest by surface mining. Mountaintop removal, a form of surface mining, is a highly controversial mining practice in central Appalachia due to its negative impacts on the environment and health of residents.

In the late 19th century, the post-Civil War Industrial Revolution and the expansion of the nation&#x27;s railroads brought a soaring demand for coal, and mining operations expanded rapidly across Appalachia. Hundreds of thousands of workers poured into the region from across the United States and from overseas, essentially overhauling the cultural makeup of eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. Mining corporations gained considerable influence in state and municipal governments, especially as they often owned the entire towns in which the miners lived. The mining industry was vulnerable to economic downturns, however, and booms and busts were frequent, with major booms occurring during World War I and II, and the worst bust occurring during the Great Depression. The Appalachian mining industry also saw some of the nation&#x27;s bloodiest labor strife between the 1890s and the 1930s. Mining-related injuries and deaths were not uncommon, and ailments such as black lung disease afflicted miners throughout the 20th century. After World War II, innovations in mechanization (such as longwall mining) and competition from oil and natural gas led to a decline in the region&#x27;s mining operations. Environmental restrictions, such as those placed on high-sulfur coal in the 1980s, brought further mine closures. While with annual earnings of $55,000, Appalachian miners make more than most other local workers, Appalachian coal mining employed just under 50,000 in 2004.

Coal mining has made a comeback in some regions in the early 21st century because of the increased prominence of Consol Energy, based in Pittsburgh. The Quecreek Mine rescue in 2002 and continuing mine subsidence problems in abandoned coal mines in western Pennsylvania as well as the Sago Mine disaster and Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia and other regions have also been highlighted in recent times.

===Manufacturing===
The manufacturing industry in Appalachia is rooted primarily in the ironworks and steelworks of early Pittsburgh and Birmingham, and in the textile mills that sprang up in North Carolina&#x27;s Piedmont region in the mid-19th century. Factory construction increased greatly after the Civil War, and the region experienced a manufacturing boom between 1890 and 1930. This economic shift led to a mass migration from small farms and rural areas to large urban centers, causing the populations of cities such as Birmingham, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Asheville, North Carolina, to swell exponentially. Manufacturing in the region suffered a setback during the Great Depression but recovered during World War II and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. However, difficulties paying retiree benefits, environmental struggles, and the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 led to a decline in the region&#x27;s manufacturing operations. Pittsburgh lost 44% of its factory jobs in the 1980s, and between 1970 and 2001, the number of apparel workers in the Appalachian region decreased from 250,000 to 83,000 and the number of textile workers decreased from 275,000 to 193,000.

U.S. Steel, founded in Pittsburgh in 1901, was the world&#x27;s first corporation with more than a billion dollars in initial capitalization. Another Pittsburgh company, Alcoa, helped establish the nation&#x27;s aluminum industry in the early 20th century, and has had a significant impact on the economies of western Pennsylvania and east Tennessee. Union Carbide built the world&#x27;s first petrochemical plant in Clendenin, West Virginia, in 1920, and in subsequent years the Kanawha Valley became known as the &quot;Chemical Capital of the World&quot;. Eastman Chemical, also established in 1920, is Tennessee&#x27;s largest single employer. Companies such as Champion Fibre and Bowater established large pulp operations in Canton, North Carolina, and Greenville, South Carolina, respectively, although the former was dogged by battles with environmentalists throughout the 20th century.

===Tourism===
One of the region&#x27;s oldest industries, tourism became a more important part of the Appalachian economy in the latter half of the 20th century as mining and manufacturing steadily declined. In 2000–2001, tourism in Appalachia accounted for nearly $30 billion and over 600,000 jobs. The mountain terrain—with its accompanying scenery and outdoor recreational opportunities—provides the region&#x27;s primary attractions. The region is home to one of the world&#x27;s most well-known hiking trails (the Appalachian Trail), the nation&#x27;s most-visited national park (the Great Smoky Mountains National Park), and the nation&#x27;s most visited national parkway (the Blue Ridge Parkway). The craft industry, including the teaching, selling, and display or demonstration of regional crafts, also accounts for an important part of the Appalachian economy, bringing (for example) over $100 million annually to the economy of western North Carolina and over $80 million to the economy of West Virginia. Important heritage tourism attractions in the region include the Biltmore Estate and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina, Cades Cove in Tennessee, and Harpers Ferry in West Virginia. Important theme parks include Dollywood and Ghost Town Village, both on the periphery of the Great Smoky Mountains.

The mineral-rich mountain springs of the Appalachians—which for many years were thought to have health-restoring qualities—were drawing visitors to the region as early as the 18th century with the establishment of resorts at Hot Springs, Virginia, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and what is now Hot Springs, North Carolina. Along with the mineral springs, the cool and clear air of the range&#x27;s high elevations provided an escape for lowland elites, and elaborate hotels—such as The Greenbrier in West Virginia and the Balsam Mountain Inn in North Carolina—were built throughout the region&#x27;s remote valleys and mountain slopes. The end of World War I (which opened up travel opportunities to Europe) and the arrival of the automobile (which changed the nation&#x27;s vacation habits) led to the demise of all but a few of the region&#x27;s spa resorts. The establishment of national parks in the 1930s brought an explosion of tourist traffic to the region but created problems with urban sprawl in the various host communities. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, states have placed greater focus on sustaining tourism while preserving host communities.

===Poverty===

Poverty had plagued Appalachia for many years but was not brought to the attention of the rest of the United States until 1940, when James Agee and Walker Evans published &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot;, a book that documented families in Appalachia during the Great Depression in words and photos. In 1963, John F. Kennedy established the President&#x27;s Appalachian Regional Commission. His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, crystallized Kennedy&#x27;s efforts in the form of the Appalachian Regional Commission, which passed into law in 1965.

In Appalachia, severe poverty and desolation were paired with the necessity for careful cultural sensitivity. Many Appalachian people feared that the birth of a new modernized Appalachia would lead to the death of their traditional values and heritage. Because of the isolation of the region, Appalachian people had been unable to catch up to the modernization that lowlanders had achieved. In the 1960s, many people in Appalachia had a standard of living comparable to Third World countries. Lyndon B. Johnson declared a &quot;War on Poverty&quot; while standing on the front porch of an Inez, Kentucky, home whose residents had been suffering from a long-ignored problem. The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 stated:

Since the creation of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) in 1965, the region has seen dramatic progress. New roads, schools, health care facilities, water and sewer systems, and other improvements have brought a better life to many Appalachian residents. In the 1960s, 219 counties in the 13-state Appalachian Region were considered economically distressed. Now that list has been cut by more than half, to 82 counties, but these are &quot;hard-core&quot; pockets of poverty, seemingly impervious to all efforts at improving their lot. Martin County, Kentucky, the site of Johnson&#x27;s 1964 speech, is one such county still ranked as &quot;distressed&quot; by the ARC. As of 2000, the per capita income in Martin County was $10,650, and 37% of its residents lived below the poverty line.

Like Johnson, President Bill Clinton brought attention to the remaining areas of poverty in Appalachia. On July 5, 1999, he made a public statement concerning the situation in Tyner, Kentucky. Clinton told the crowd:

The region&#x27;s poverty has been documented often since the early 1960s. John Cohen documents rural lifestyle and culture in &quot;The High Lonesome Sound&quot;, while photojournalist Earl Dotter has been visiting and documenting poverty, healthcare and mining in Appalachia for nearly forty years. Another photojournalist, Shelby Lee Adams, has been photographing Appalachian families and lifestyle for decades.

Poverty has caused health problems in the region. The diseases of despair, including the opioid epidemic in the United States, and some diseases of poverty are prevalent in Appalachia.

===Tax revenue and absentee land ownership===
In 1982 a seven-volume study conducted by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force was issued by the Appalachian Regional Commission which investigated the issue of absentee land ownership. The study covered 80 counties in six states approximating the area designated &quot;Southern Appalachia&quot; as defined by Thomas R. Ford&#x27;s 1962 work. The states selected were Alabama (15 counties), Kentucky (12 counties), North Carolina (12 counties), Tennessee (14 counties), Virginia (12 counties), and West Virginia (15 counties).
In its summary the report stated that &quot;over 55,000 parcels of property in 80 counties were studied, representing some 20,000,000 acres of land and mineral rights...&quot; It found that &quot;41% of the 20 million acres of land and minerals...are held by only 50 private owners and 10 government agencies. The federal government is the single largest owner in Appalachia, holding over 2,000,000 acres.&quot; The study found that the extractive industries, i.e., timber, coal, etc., were &quot;greatly under-assessed for property tax purposes. Over 75% of the mineral owners in this survey pay under 25 cents per acre in property taxes.&quot; In the major coal counties surveyed the average tax per ton of known coal reserves is only $.0002 (1/50th of a cent).
The government-held lands are tax-exempt, but the government makes a payment in lieu of taxes, which is usually less than the normal tax rates.

&quot;Taken together, the failure to tax minerals adequately, the underassessment of surface lands, and the revenue loss from concentrated federal holdings has a marked impact on local governments in Appalachia. The effect, essentially, is to produce a situation in which a) the small owners carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden; b) counties depend upon federal and state funds to provide revenues, while the large, corporate and absentee owners of the region&#x27;s resources go relatively tax-free; and c) citizens face a poverty of needed services despite the presence in their counties of taxable property wealth, especially in the form of coal and other natural resources.&quot;

In 2013, a similar study that concentrated solely on West Virginia found that 25 private owners hold 17.6% of the state&#x27;s private land of 13 million acres. The federal government owns 1,133,587 acres in West Virginia, 7.4% of the total state acreage of 15,410,560 acres. In 11 counties the top ten absentee landowners own 41% to almost 72% of the private land in each county.

===Appalachian Regional Commission===

The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created by the U.S. Congress in 1965 to bring poor areas of the 13 U.S. states of the main (southern) range of the Appalachians into the mainstream of the American economy. The commission is a partnership of federal, state, and local governments, and was created to promote economic growth and improve the quality of life in the region. The region as defined by the ARC includes 420 counties, including all of West Virginia; counties in 12 other states: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia; and also eight cities in Virginia, where state law makes cities administratively separate from counties. The ARC is a planning, research, advocacy and funding organization; it does not have any governing powers.

The ARC&#x27;s geographic range of coverage was defined broadly to cover as many economically underdeveloped areas as possible; it extends well beyond the area usually thought of as &quot;Appalachia&quot;. For instance, parts of Alabama and Mississippi were included in the commission because of problems with unemployment and poverty similar to those in Appalachia proper, and the ARC region extends into the Northeastern states, which are not traditionally considered part of Appalachia culturally (though a &quot;northern Appalachia&quot; identity has emerged in recent times in parts of both NY and PA, particularly in rural areas). More recently, the Youngstown, Ohio, region was declared part of Appalachia by the ARC due to the collapse of the steel industry in the region in the early 1980s and the continuing unemployment problems in the region since, though aside from Columbiana County, Ohio, the Youngstown DMA is not traditionally or culturally considered part of the region. The ARC&#x27;s wide scope also grew out of the &quot;pork barrel&quot; phenomenon, as politicians from outside the traditional Appalachia area saw a new way to bring home federal money to their areas. However, former Ohio governor Bob Taft has stated, &quot;What is good for Appalachia is good for all of Ohio.&quot;

===Transportation===

Transportation has been the most challenging and expensive issue in Appalachia since the arrival of the first European settlers in the 18th century. Except the October 1, 1940, opening of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the region&#x27;s mountainous terrain continuously thwarted major federal intervention attempts at major road construction until the 1970s. This left large parts of the region virtually isolated and slowing economic growth. Before the Civil War, major cities in the region were connected via wagon roads to lowland areas, and flatboats provided an important means for transporting goods out of the region. By 1900, railroads connected most of the region with the rest of the nation, although the poor roads made travel beyond railroad hubs difficult. When the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in 1965, road construction was considered its most important initiative, and in subsequent decades the commission spent more on road construction than all other projects combined.

The effort to connect Appalachia with the outside world has required numerous civil engineering feats. Millions of tons of rock were removed to build road segments such as Interstate 40 through the Pigeon River Gorge at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line and U.S. Route 23 in Letcher County, Kentucky. Large tunnels were built through mountain slopes at Cumberland Gap in 1996 to speed up travel along U.S. Route 25E, which acts as a regional arterial connecting Appalachia to the East Coast and the Great Lakes regions. The New River Gorge Bridge in West Virginia, completed in 1977, was the longest and is now the fourth-longest single-arch bridge in the world. The Blue Ridge Parkway&#x27;s Linn Cove Viaduct, the construction of which required the assembly of 153 pre-cast segments up the slopes of Grandfather Mountain, has been designated a historic civil engineering landmark.

==Physiographic provinces==
The six physiographic provinces that in whole or in part are commonly treated as components of Appalachia are:
# Appalachian Plateau
# Allegheny Mountains
# Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians
# Great Appalachian Valley
# Blue Ridge Mountains
# Piedmont

==In popular culture==
Depictions of Appalachia and its inhabitants in popular media are typically negative, making the region an object of humor, derision, and social concern. Ledford writes, &quot;Always part of the mythical South, Appalachia continues to languish backstage in the American drama, still dressed, in the popular mind at least, in the garments of backwardness, violence, poverty, and hopelessness.&quot; Otto argues that comic strips &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; by Al Capp and &quot;Barney Google&quot; by Billy DeBeck, which both began in 1934, caricatured the laziness and weakness for &quot;corn squeezin&#x27;s&quot; (moonshine) of these &quot;hillbillies&quot;. The popular 1960s &quot;Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; on television and James Dickey&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Deliverance&quot; perpetuated the stereotype, although the region itself underwent so many changes after 1945 that it scarcely resembles the comic images.

* English composer Frederick Delius wrote a theme and variations entitled &quot;Appalachia&quot;; he first composed this music, subtitled &quot;Variations on an Old Slave Song with final chorus&quot;, in 1896.
* &quot;The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come&quot; (1903), &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; (1908), and other early 20th-century novels of John Fox Jr., set in the Appalachian town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia, and surrounding areas, gave readers an image of frontier life in Appalachia and were made into popular films. Fox himself graduated from Harvard and was a bon vivant newspaperman in New York City. He returned home to the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee to write his stories because of poor health.
* Some comic strips often featured Appalachia, especially &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; by Al Capp. Inge notes that this comic strip, which ran 1934–77, largely ignored religion, politics, blacks and the Civil War, but instead focused its humor on the morality of Dogpatch, examining its memorable and often eccentric people who typically relied on violence to control the social order, and held deep to their faith in land, home, self-sufficiency, and antipathy to outsiders. Arnold finds that starting with World War II Capp increasingly emphasized sex and violence.
* &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; (1944) is the name of a musical composition by Aaron Copland and a ballet of the same name by Martha Graham. Copland did not intend for his music, which he composed for Graham and which incorporates Shaker melodies, to have an Appalachian theme. Graham gave the work its name; her ballet told the story of a young couple living on the frontier in western Pennsylvania.
* Author Catherine Marshall wrote &quot;Christy&quot; (1967), loosely based on her mother&#x27;s years as a teacher in the Appalachian region. The novel was highly popular and became the basis of a short-lived television series of the same name in 1994.
* The 1972 film &quot;Deliverance&quot; takes place in southern Appalachia. The film perpetuated extremely negative stereotypes.
* &quot;The Waltons&quot; was a 1972–1981 television show that depicted a rural Virginia family during the Great Depression through World War II.
* &quot;Face of Appalachia&quot; is a song that appeared first on the album &quot;Tarzana Kid&quot; by John Sebastian in 1974. The song, co-written by Sebastian and Lowell George, was described by Joel Canfield as follows: &quot;Sebastian&#x27;s lyrics weave a heart-rending picture of an old man&#x27;s struggle to impart his childhood memories to his grandson; memories of places and people who no longer exist; of an era long gone.&quot; Cover versions of the song have been recorded by Valerie Carter (1977), Wendy Matthews (1992) and Julie Miller (1997).
* The motion pictures &quot;Where the Lilies Bloom&quot; (1974) and &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980) attempt an accurate portrayal of life in Appalachia which stresses the tensions between Appalachian traditions and the values of urbanized America.
* Alan Hovhaness in 1985 composed a tone poem named &quot;To the Appalachian Mountains&quot; (Symphony no. 60).
* Large-format photographer Shelby Lee Adams, himself a son of Appalachian emigrants, has portrayed the Appalachian family life sympathetically in several books (1993–2003).
* The 1999 drama film &quot;October Sky&quot; focuses on the true story of NASA engineer Homer Hickam and his peers known as the Rocket Boys, who constructed a jet-propulsed rocket in the declining Appalachian coal town of Coalwood, West Virginia as a result of the Space Race.
* The novel &quot;Prodigal Summer&quot; (2000) by Barbara Kingsolver explores the ecology of the region and how the removal of the predators, wolves and coyotes, affected the environment.
* &quot;Songcatcher&quot; (2000) takes place in rural Appalachia in 1907 and features the &quot;lost&quot; ballads of the Scots-Irish brought over in the 19th century and a musicologist&#x27;s quest to preserve them.
* &quot;Stranger with a Camera&quot; (2000) is a documentary film from Appalshop about the representation of Appalachian communities by outsiders in film and video.
* Much of the popular book series &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; (2008) is set in &quot;an area that used to be called Appalachia&quot; which is referred to in the book as District 12. Much of the surroundings and culture reflect present-day Appalachia, such as reliance on coal mining as an industry.
* The 2013 film &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot; is the story of two brothers living in a dying Appalachian Pennsylvania town, struggling for jobs, who get wrapped up in the world of meth-dealing in the mountains.
* &quot;Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis&quot; is a 2016 memoir by JD Vance that opines on the Appalachian region and people, drawing from the Ohio-born author&#x27;s view of his extended family in Kentucky. While the book&#x27;s portrayal of Appalachia was met with controversy and derision from many Appalachians, it was made into a 2020 film directed by Ron Howard. 
* &quot;Fallout 76&quot; (2018) is set in a retrofuturistic, post-nuclear Appalachia, with some of its story arcs exploring the social and economic impact of widespread automation, labor struggles, and anti-government activism, drawing on the region&#x27;s real history, such as the Battle of Blair Mountain.
* Author Barbara Kingsolver seeks to redress Appalachian stereotypes in her novel &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot; (2022), a retelling of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;David Copperfield&quot; that explores the opioid crisis in the region.

<text>The Middle Kingdom of Egypt (also known as The Period of Reunification) is the period in the history of ancient Egypt following a period of political division known as the First Intermediate Period. The Middle Kingdom lasted from approximately 2040 to 1782 BC, stretching from the reunification of Egypt under the reign of Mentuhotep II in the Eleventh Dynasty to the end of the Twelfth Dynasty. The kings of the Eleventh Dynasty ruled from Thebes and the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty ruled from el-Lisht.

The concept of the Middle Kingdom as one of three golden ages was coined in 1845 by German Egyptologist Baron von Bunsen, and its definition evolved significantly throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Some scholars also include the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt wholly into this period, in which case the Middle Kingdom would end around 1650 BC, while others only include it until Merneferre Ay around 1700 BC, last king of this dynasty to be attested in both Upper and Lower Egypt. During the Middle Kingdom period, Osiris became the most important deity in popular religion. The Middle Kingdom was followed by the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt, another period of division that involved foreign rule of Lower Egypt by the Hyksos of West Asia.

==Political history==
===Periods of ancient Egypt===
===Reunification under the Eleventh Dynasty===

After the collapse of the Old Kingdom, Egypt entered a period of weak pharaonic power and decentralization called the First Intermediate Period. Towards the end of this period, two rival dynasties, known in Egyptology as the Tenth and Eleventh, fought for control of the entire country. The Theban Eleventh Dynasty only ruled southern Egypt from the First Cataract to the Tenth Nome of Upper Egypt. To the north, Lower Egypt was ruled by the rival Tenth Dynasty from Herakleopolis. The struggle was to be concluded by Mentuhotep II, who ascended the Theban throne in 2055 BC. During Mentuhotep II&#x27;s fourteenth regnal year, he took advantage of a revolt in the Thinite Nome to launch an attack on Herakleopolis, which met little resistance. After toppling the last rulers of the Tenth Dynasty, Mentuhotep began consolidating his power over all of Egypt, a process that he finished by his 39th regnal year. For this reason, Mentuhotep II is regarded as the founder of the Middle Kingdom.

Mentuhotep II commanded petty campaigns as far south as the Second Cataract in Nubia, which had gained its independence during the First Intermediate Period. He also restored Egyptian hegemony over the Sinai region, which had been lost to Egypt since the end of the Old Kingdom. To consolidate his authority, he restored the cult of the ruler, depicting himself as a god in his own lifetime, wearing the headdresses of Amun and Min. He died after a reign of 51 years and passed the throne to his son, Mentuhotep III.

Mentuhotep III reigned for only twelve years, during which he continued consolidating Theban rule over the whole of Egypt, building a series of forts in the eastern Delta region to secure Egypt against threats from Asia. He also sent the first expedition to Punt during the Middle Kingdom, using ships constructed at the end of Wadi Hammamat, on the Red Sea. Mentuhotep III was succeeded by Mentuhotep IV, whose name, significantly, is omitted from all ancient Egyptian king lists. The Turin King List claims that after Mentuhotep III came &quot;seven kingless years&quot;. Despite this absence, his reign is attested from a few inscriptions in Wadi Hammamat that record expeditions to the Red Sea coast and to quarry stone for the royal monuments. The leader of this expedition was his vizier Amenemhat, who is widely assumed to be the future pharaoh Amenemhet I, the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty.

Mentuhotep IV&#x27;s absence from the king lists has prompted the theory that Amenemhet I usurped his throne. While there are no contemporary accounts of this struggle, certain circumstantial evidence may point to the existence of a civil war at the end of the 11th Dynasty. Inscriptions left by one Nehry, the Haty-a of Hermopolis, suggest that he was attacked at a place called Shedyet-sha by the forces of the reigning king, but his forces prevailed. Khnumhotep I, an official under Amenemhet I, claims to have participated in a flotilla of twenty ships sent to pacify Upper Egypt. Donald Redford has suggested these events should be interpreted as evidence of open war between two dynastic claimants. What is certain is that, however he came to power, Amenemhet I was not of royal birth.

===Twelfth Dynasty===
====Early Twelfth Dynasty====

From the Twelfth Dynasty onwards, pharaohs often kept well-trained standing armies, which included Nubian contingents. These formed the basis of larger forces that were raised for defense against invasion, or expeditions up the Nile or across the Sinai. However, the Middle Kingdom was basically defensive in its military strategy, with fortifications built at the First Cataract of the Nile, in the Delta and across the Sinai Isthmus.

Early in his reign, Amenemhet I was compelled to campaign in the Delta region, which had not received as much attention as Upper Egypt during the 11th Dynasty. Also, he strengthened defenses between Egypt and Asia, building the Walls of the Ruler in the East Delta region. Perhaps in response to this perpetual unrest, Amenemhat I built a new capital for Egypt in the north, known as Amenemhet It Tawy, or &quot;Amenemhet, Seizer of the Two Lands&quot;. The location of this capital is unknown, but is presumably near the city&#x27;s necropolis, the present-day el-Lisht. Like Mentuhotep II, Amenemhet bolstered his claim to authority with propaganda. In particular, the Prophecy of Neferty dates to about this time, which purports to be an oracle of an Old Kingdom priest, who predicts a king, Amenemhet I, arising from the far south of Egypt to restore the kingdom after centuries of chaos.

Propaganda notwithstanding, Amenemhet never held the absolute power commanded in theory by the Old Kingdom pharaohs. During the First Intermediate Period, the governors of the nomes of Egypt, nomarchs, gained considerable power. Their posts had become hereditary, and some nomarchs entered into marriage alliances with the nomarchs of neighboring nomes. To strengthen his position, Amenemhet required registration of land, modified nome borders, and appointed nomarchs directly when offices became vacant, but acquiesced to the nomarch system, probably to placate the nomarchs who supported his rule. This gave the Middle Kingdom a more feudal organization than Egypt had before or would have afterward.

In his twentieth regnal year, Amenemhat established his son Senusret I as his coregent, beginning a practice which would be used repeatedly throughout the rest of the Middle Kingdom and again during the New Kingdom. In Amenemhet&#x27;s thirtieth regnal year, he was presumably murdered in a palace conspiracy. Senusret, campaigning against Libyan invaders, rushed home to Itjtawy to prevent a takeover of the government. During his reign, Senusret continued the practice of directly appointing nomarchs, and undercut the autonomy of local priesthoods by building at cult centers throughout Egypt. Under his rule, Egyptian armies pushed south into Nubia as far as the Second Cataract, building a border fort at Buhen and incorporating all of Lower Nubia as an Egyptian colony. Senusret I also exercised control over the land of Kush, from the Second to the Third Cataract, including the island of Sai. The southernmost inscription containing Sesostris I&#x27;s name has been found on the island of Argo, north of modern Dongola. To the west, he consolidated his power over the Oases, and extended commercial contacts into Syria-Canaan as far as Ugarit. In his 43rd regnal year, Senusret appointed Amenemhet II as junior coregent, before dying in his 46th.
The reign of Amenemhat II has been often characterized as largely peaceful, but records of his , or daybooks, have cast doubt on that assessment. Among these records, preserved on temple walls at Tod and Memphis, are descriptions of peace treaties with certain Syrio-Canaanian cities, and military conflict with others. To the south, Amenemhet sent a campaign through lower Nubia to inspect Wawat. It does not appear that Amenemhet continued his predecessors&#x27; policy of appointing nomarchs, but let it become hereditary again. Another expedition to Punt dates to his reign. In his 33rd regnal year, he appointed his son Senusret II coregent.

Evidence for military activity of any kind during the reign of Senusret II is non-existent. Senusret instead appears to have focused on domestic issues, particularly the irrigation of the Faiyum. This multi-generational project aimed to convert the Faiyum oasis into a productive swath of farmland. Senusret eventually placed his pyramid at the site of el-Lahun, near the junction of the Nile and the Fayuum&#x27;s major irrigation canal, the Bahr Yussef. He reigned only fifteen years, which explains the incomplete nature of many of his constructions. His son Senusret III succeeded him.

====Height of the Middle Kingdom====

Senusret III was a warrior-king, often taking to the field himself. In his sixth year, he re-dredged an Old Kingdom canal around the First Cataract to facilitate travel to Upper Nubia. He used this to launch a series of brutal campaigns in Nubia in his sixth, eighth, tenth, and sixteenth years. After his victories, Senusret built a series of massive forts throughout the country to establish the formal boundary between Egyptian conquests and unconquered Nubia at Semna. The personnel of these forts were charged to send frequent reports to the capital on the movements and activities of the local Medjay natives, some of which survive, revealing how tightly the Egyptians intended to control the southern border. Medjay were not allowed north of the border by ship, nor could they enter by land with their flocks, but they were permitted to travel to local forts to trade. After this, Senusret sent one more campaign in his 19th year but turned back due to abnormally low Nile levels, which endangered his ships. To the north, One of Senusret&#x27;s soldiers records a campaign into Canaan, perhaps against Shechem, the only reference to a military campaign against a certain location in Cannan from Middle Kingdom literature, although there are other references to action against Asiatics. It is not known whether Egypt wished to control Canaan like Northern Nubia, but numerous administrative seals of the period have been found there, as well as other indications of increased activity Northward in this period. As in the old kingdom, the contact was particularly strong with Byblos, known for its valuable wood.
Domestically, Senusret has been given credit for an administrative reform that put more power in the hands of appointees of the central government, instead of regional authorities. Egypt was divided into three &quot;water&quot;, or administrative divisions: North, South, and Head of the South (perhaps Lower Egypt, most of Upper Egypt, and the nomes of the original Theban kingdom during the war with Herakleopolis, respectively). Each region was administered by a Reporter, Second Reporter&quot;,&quot; some kind of council (the &quot;Djadjat&quot;), and staff of minor officials and scribes. The power of the nomarchs seems to drop off permanently during his reign, which has been taken to indicate that the central government had finally suppressed them, though there is no record that Senusret ever took direct action against them.

Senusret III left a lasting legacy as a warrior pharaoh. His name was Hellenized by later Greek historians as Sesostris, a name which was then given to a conflation of Senusret and several New Kingdom warrior pharaohs. In Nubia, Senusret was worshiped as a patron God by Egyptian settlers. The duration of his reign remains something of an open question. His son Amenemhet III began reigning after Senusret&#x27;s 19th regnal year, which has been widely considered Senusret&#x27;s highest attested date. However, a reference to a year 39 on a fragment found in the construction debris of Senusret&#x27;s mortuary temple has suggested the possibility of a long coregency with his son.
The reign of Amenemhat III was the height of the Middle Kingdom&#x27;s economic prosperity. His reign is remarkable for the degree to which Egypt exploited its resources. Mining camps in the Sinai, which had previously been used only by intermittent expeditions, were operated on a semi-permanent basis, as evidenced by the construction of houses, walls, and even local cemeteries. There are 25 separate references to mining expeditions in the Sinai, and four to expeditions in Wadi Hammamat, one of which had over two thousand workers. Amenemhet reinforced his father&#x27;s defenses in Nubia and continued the Faiyum land reclamation project.
After a reign of 45 years, Amenemhet III was succeeded by Amenemhet IV, whose nine-year reign is poorly attested. Clearly by this time, dynastic power had begun to weaken, for which several explanations have been proposed. Contemporary records of the Nile flood levels indicate that the end of the reign of Amenemhet III was dry, and crop failures may have helped to destabilize the dynasty. Further, Amenemhet III had an inordinately long reign, which tends to create succession problems. The latter argument perhaps explains why Amenemhet IV was succeeded by Sobekneferu, the first historically attested female pharaoh of Egypt. Sobekneferu ruled no more than four years, and as she apparently had no heirs, when she died the Twelfth Dynasty came to a sudden end as did the Golden Age of the Middle Kingdom.

===Decline into the Second Intermediate Period===

After the death of Sobeknefru, the throne may have passed to Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep, though in older studies Wegaf, who had previously been the Great Overseer of Troops, was thought to have reigned next. Beginning with this reign, Egypt was ruled by a series of ephemeral kings for about ten to fifteen years. Ancient Egyptian sources regard these as the first kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty, though the term dynasty is misleading, as most kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty were not related. The names of these short-lived kings are attested on a few monuments and graffiti, and their succession order is only known from the Turin Canon, although even this is not fully trusted.

After the initial dynastic chaos, a series of longer-reigning, better-attested kings ruled for about fifty to eighty years. The strongest king of this period, Neferhotep I, ruled for eleven years and maintained effective control of Upper Egypt, Nubia, and the Delta, with the possible exceptions of Xois and Avaris. Neferhotep I was even recognized as the suzerain of the ruler of Byblos, indicating that the Thirteenth Dynasty was able to retain much of the power of the Twelfth Dynasty, at least up to his reign. At some point during the 13th Dynasty, Xois, and Avaris began governing themselves, the rulers of Xois being the Fourteenth Dynasty, and the Asiatic rulers of Avaris being the Hyksos of the Fifteenth Dynasty. According to Manetho, this latter revolt occurred during the reign of Neferhotep&#x27;s successor, Sobekhotep IV, though there is no archaeological evidence. Sobekhotep IV was succeeded by the short reign of Sobekhotep V, who was followed by Wahibre Ibiau, then Merneferre Ai. Wahibre Ibiau ruled ten years, and Merneferre Ai ruled for twenty-three years, the longest of any Thirteenth Dynasty king, but neither of these two kings left as many attestations as either Neferhotep of Sobekhotep IV. Despite this, they both seem to have held at least parts of Lower Egypt. After Merneferre Ai, however, no king left his name on any object found outside the south. This begins the final portion of the Thirteenth Dynasty when southern kings continue to reign over Upper Egypt. But when the unity of Egypt fully disintegrated, the Middle Kingdom gave way to the Second Intermediate Period.
==Administration==
When the Eleventh Dynasty reunified Egypt it had to create a centralized administration such as had not existed in Egypt since the downfall of the Old Kingdom government. To do this, it appointed people to positions that had fallen out of use in the decentralized First Intermediate Period. The highest among these was the vizier. The vizier was the chief minister for the king, handling all the day-to-day business of government in the king&#x27;s place. This was a monumental task, therefore it would often be split into two positions, a vizier of the north, and a vizier of the south. It is uncertain how often this occurred during the Middle Kingdom, but Senusret I clearly had two simultaneously functioning viziers. Other positions were inherited from the provincial form of government at Thebes used by the Eleventh Dynasty before the reunification of Egypt. The &quot;Overseer of Sealed Goods&quot; became the country&#x27;s treasurer, and the &quot;Overseer of the Estate&quot; became the King&#x27;s chief steward. These three positions and the &quot;Scribe of the Royal Document,&quot; probably the king&#x27;s personal scribe, appear to be the most important posts of the central government, judging by the monument count of those in these positions.

Besides this, many Old Kingdom posts which had lost their original meaning and become mere honorifics were brought back into the central government. Only high-ranking officials could claim the title &quot;Member of the Elite&quot;, which had been applied liberally during the First Intermediate Period.

This basic form of administration continued throughout the Middle Kingdom, though there is some evidence of a major reform of the central government under Senusret III. Records from his reign indicate that Upper and Lower Egypt were divided into separate &quot;waret&quot; and governed by separate administrators. Administrative documents and private stelae indicate a proliferation of new bureaucratic titles around this time, which have been taken as evidence of a larger central government. Governance of the royal residence was moved into a separate division of government. The military was placed under the control of a chief general. However, it is possible that these titles and positions were much older, and simply were not recorded on funerary stelae due to religious conventions.

===Provincial government===

Decentralization during the First Intermediate Period left the individual Egyptian provinces, or Nomes, under the control of powerful families who held the hereditary title of &quot;Great Chief of the Nome&quot;, or Nomarch. This position developed during the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, when the various powers of Old Kingdom provincial officials began to be exercised by a single individual. At roughly this time, the provincial aristocracy began building elaborate tombs for themselves, which have been taken as evidence of the wealth and power that these rulers had acquired as nomarchs. By the end of the First Intermediate Period, some nomarchs ruled their nomes as minor potentates, such as the nomarch Nehry of Hermopolis, who dated inscriptions by his own regnal year.

When the Eleventh Dynasty came to power, it was necessary to subdue the power of the nomarchs if Egypt were to be reunified under a central government. The first major steps towards that end took place under Amenemhet I. Amenemhet made the city, not the nome, the center of administration, and only the &quot;haty-a&quot;, or mayor, of the larger cities, would be permitted to carry the title of nomarch. The title of nomarch continued to be used until the reign of Senusret III, as did the elaborate tombs indicative of their power, after which they suddenly disappeared. This has been interpreted several ways. Traditionally, it has been believed that Senusret III took some action to suppress the nomarch families during his reign. Recently, other interpretations have been proposed. Detlef Franke has argued that Senusret II adopted a policy of educating the sons of nomarchs in the capital and appointing them to government posts. In this way, many provincial families may have been bled dry of scions. Also, while the title of &quot;Great Overlord of the Nome&quot; disappeared, other distinctive titles of the nomarchs remained. During the First Intermediate Period, individuals holding the title of &quot;Great Overlord&quot; also often held the title of &quot;Overseer of Priests.&quot; In the late Middle Kingdom, there existed families holding the titles of mayor and overseer of priests as hereditary possessions. Therefore, it has been argued that the great nomarch families were never subdued, but were simply absorbed into the pharaonic administration of the country. While it is true that the large tombs indicative of nomarchs disappeared at the end of the Twelfth Dynasty, grand royal tombs also ceased being built soon thereafter due to general instability surrounding the decline of the Middle Kingdom.

==Agriculture and climate==
Throughout the history of ancient Egypt, the annual inundation of the Nile River was relied upon to fertilize the land surrounding it. This was essential for agriculture and food production. There is evidence that the collapse of the previous Old Kingdom may have been due in part to low flood levels, resulting in famine. This trend appears to have been reversed during the early years of the Middle Kingdom, with relatively high water levels recorded for much of this era, with an average inundation of 19 meters above its non-flood levels. The years of repeated high inundation levels correspond to the most prosperous period of the Middle Kingdom, which occurred during the reign of Amenemhat III. This seems to be confirmed in some of the literature of the period, such as in the Instructions of Amenemhat, where the king tells his son how agriculture prospered under his reign.

==Art==
After the reunification of Egypt in the Middle Kingdom, the kings of the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties were able to turn their focus back to art. In the Eleventh Dynasty, the kings had their monuments made in a style influenced by the Memphite models of the Fifth and early Sixth Dynasties. During this time, the pre-unification Theban relief style all but disappeared. These changes had an ideological purpose, as the Eleventh Dynasty kings were establishing a centralized state after the First Intermediate Period, and returning to the political ideals of the Old Kingdom. In the early Twelfth Dynasty, the artwork had a uniformity of style due to the influence of the royal workshops. It was at this point that the quality of artistic production for the elite members of society reached a high point that was never surpassed, although it was equaled in other periods. Egypt prospered in the late Twelfth Dynasty, and this was reflected in the quality of the materials used for royal and private monuments.

The kings of the Twelfth Dynasty were buried in pyramid complexes based on those of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties. In the Old Kingdom, these were made of stone bricks, but the Middle Kingdom kings chose to have theirs made of mud bricks and finished with a casing of Tura limestone. Private tombs, such as those found in Thebes, usually consisted of a long passage cut into rock, with a small chamber at the end. These tended to have little or no decoration. Stone box sarcophagi with both flat and vaulted lids were manufactured in the Middle Kingdom, as a continuation of the Old Kingdom tradition. The motifs on these were more varied and of higher artistic quality than that of any sarcophagi produced before and after the Middle Kingdom. Additionally, funerary stelae developed in regard to images and iconography. They continued to show the deceased seated in front of a table of offerings, and began to include the deceased&#x27;s wife and other family members.

Towards the end of the Middle Kingdom, there was a change to the art pieces placed in non-royal tombs. The amount of wooden tomb models decreased drastically, and they were replaced by small faience models of food. Magic wands and rods, models of protective animals, and fertility figures began to be buried with the dead. Additionally, the number of statues and funerary stelae increased, but their quality decreased. In the late Twelfth Dynasty, coffins with interior decorations became rare, and the decorations on the outside became more elaborate. The &quot;rishi&quot;-coffin made its first appearance during this time. Made of wood or cartonnage, the coffin was in the shape of a body wrapped in linen, wearing a beaded collar and a funerary mask.

There were also changes to the art form of stelae in the Middle Kingdom. During this time, round-topped stelae developed out of the rectangular form of previous periods. Many examples of both of these types come from this period; excavation at Abydos yielded over 2000 private stelae, ranging from excellent works to crude objects, although very few belonged to the elite. Additionally, classic royal commemorative stelae were first found in this period. These took the form of round-topped stelae, and they were used to mark boundaries. For example, Senusret III used them to mark the boundary between Egypt and Nubia. Because of the prosperity of this period, the lower elite were able to commission statues and stelae for themselves, although these were of poorer artistic quality. Those who commissioned non-royal stelae had the ultimate goal of eternal existence. This goal was communicated with the specific placement of information on the stone slabs similar to royal stelae (the owner&#x27;s image, offering formula, inscriptions of names, lineage and titles).

=== Statuary ===
In the first half of the Twelfth Dynasty, proportions of the human figure returned to the traditional Memphite style of the Fifth and early Sixth Dynasties. Male figures had broad shoulders, a low small of the back, and thick muscular limbs. Females had slender figures, a higher small of the back and no musculature. In this period, sketches for the production of statues and reliefs were laid out on a squared grid, a new guide system. Since this system contained a greater number of lines, it allowed more body parts to be marked. Standing figures were composed of eighteen squares from the feet to the hairline. Seated figures were made of fourteen squares between their feet and hairline, accounting for the horizontal thigh and knee. The black granite seated statue of the king Amenemhat III to the right, above is a perfect example of male proportions and the squared grid system of this period. Most royal statues, such as this one, would serve as representations of the king&#x27;s power.

The quality of Egyptian statuary reached its peak in the Middle Kingdom. Royal statues combined both elegance and strength in a manner that was seldom seen after this period. A popular form of statuary during this time was that of the sphinx. During this period, sphinxes appeared in pairs, and were recumbent, with human faces, and a lion&#x27;s mane and ears. An example would be the diorite sphinx of Senusret III.

One of the innovations in sculpture that occurred during the Middle Kingdom was the block statue, which would continue to be popular through to the Ptolemaic Kingdom almost 2,000 years later. Block statues consist of a man squatting with his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms folded on top of his knees. Often, these men are wearing a &quot;wide cloak&quot; that reduces the body of the figure to a simple block-like shape. The surface of the garment or &quot;wide cloak&quot; allowed space for inscriptions. Most of the detail is reserved for the head of the individual being depicted. In some instances, the modeling of the limbs has been retained by the sculptor. There are two basic types of block statues: ones with the feet completely covered by the cloak and ones with the feet uncovered.

This statue to the right represents a woman from the top echelon of society and demonstrates characteristics of Middle Kingdom art. The heavy tripartite wig frames the broad face and passes behind the ears, thus giving the impression of forcing them forward. They are large in keeping with the ancient Egyptian ideal of beauty; the same ideal required small breasts, and also in this respect the sculpture is no exception. Whereas the natural curve of the eyebrows dips towards the root of the nose, the artificial eyebrows in low relief are absolutely straight above the inner corners of the eyes, a feature which places the bust early in the Twelfth Dynasty. Around 1900 BC these artificial eyebrows began to follow the natural curve and dip toward the nose.

In the later Twelfth Dynasty, the proportions of the human figure changed. These changes survived through the Thirteenth to Seventeenth Dynasties. Male figures had smaller heads in proportion to the rest of the body, narrow shoulders and waists, a high small of the back, and no muscled limbs. Female figures had these proportions more to an extreme with narrower shoulders and waists, slender limbs, and a higher small of the back in order to keep a distinction between male and female measurements.

==Literature==
Richard B. Parkinson and Ludwig D. Morenz write that ancient Egyptian literature—narrowly defined as &quot;belles-lettres&quot; (&quot;beautiful writing&quot;)—were not recorded in written form until the early Twelfth Dynasty. Old Kingdom texts served mainly to maintain the divine cults, preserve souls in the afterlife, and document accounts for practical uses in daily life. It was not until the Middle Kingdom that texts were written for the purpose of entertainment and intellectual curiosity. Parkinson and Morenz also speculate that written works of the Middle Kingdom were transcriptions of the oral literature of the Old Kingdom. It is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing; for example, litter-bearers&#x27; songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom.

It is also thought that the growth of the middle class and growth in the number of scribes needed for the expanded bureaucracy under Senusret II helped spur the development of Middle Kingdom literature. Later ancient Egyptians considered the literature from this time as &quot;classic&quot;. Stories such as the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor and the Story of Sinuhe were composed during this period, and were popular enough to be widely copied afterwards. Many philosophical works were also created at this time, including the Dispute between a man and his Ba where an unhappy man converses with his soul, The Satire of the Trades in which the role of the scribe is praised above all other jobs, and the magic tales supposedly told to the Old Kingdom pharaoh Khufu in the Westcar Papyrus.

Pharaohs of the Twelfth through Eighteenth Dynasty are credited with preserving some of the most interesting of Egyptian papyri:

* 1950 BC: Akhmim Wooden Tablet
* 1950 BC: Heqanakht papyri
* 1800 BC: Berlin papyrus 6619
* 1800 BC: Moscow Mathematical Papyrus
* 1650 BC: Rhind Mathematical Papyrus
* 1600 BC: Edwin Smith papyrus 
* 1550 BC: Ebers papyrus

Geneva Airport {{airport codes|GVA|LSGG}} – formerly and still unofficially known as Cointrin Airport – is an international airport of Geneva, the second most populous city in Switzerland. It is located {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the city centre. It surpassed the 15-million-passengers-a-year mark for the first time in December 2014. The airport serves as a hub for Swiss International Air Lines and easyJet Switzerland. It features a route network of flights mainly to European metropolitan and leisure destinations as well as some long-haul routes to North America, China, Africa, and the Middle East, amongst them Swiss International Air Lines&#x27; only long-haul service (to New York–JFK) outside of Zürich.

The airport lies entirely within Swiss territory, however, its northern limit runs along the Swiss–French border and the airport can be accessed from both countries. The freight operations are also accessible from both countries, making Geneva a European Union freight hub although Switzerland is not a member of the EU. The airport is partially in the municipality of Meyrin and partially in the municipality of Le Grand-Saconnex.

== History ==

{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}

===Early years===
On 11 October 1919, the Grand Council of Geneva approved the establishment of an &quot;airfield&quot; at Meyrin. A simple airfield was established in Cointrin, near the city of Geneva, covering an area of {{convert|54|ha}}. From 1926 to 1931, the airfield&#x27;s wooden sheds were replaced by three concrete hangars. At the time, there was a small amount of air traffic, with Luft Hansa flying from Berlin to Barcelona via Halle, Leipzig, Geneva and Marseille. Swissair also flew the Geneva–Lyon–Paris route through a codesharing agreement with Air Union. By 1930, there were six airlines that flew to Geneva Airport on seven different routes.

1937 saw construction of the first concrete runway; it measured {{Convert|405|by|21|m}}. In 1938, eight airlines were flying to Geneva: Swissair, KLM, Deutsche Luft Hansa, Air France, Malert (Hungary), AB Aerotransport (Sweden), Alpar (Switzerland) and Imperial Airways (UK).

During World War II, the Swiss authorities forbade all flights from Switzerland, but expansion of the airport led to increasing its area to {{convert|95|ha}} and extending the main runway first to {{convert|1000|by|50|m|ft}}. A further {{convert|200|m}} of runway was added near the end of the war as well as provision for future expansion to a length of {{convert|2500|m}}.

As part of the Federal Government&#x27;s post-war planning for the nation&#x27;s airports, Geneva was identified as one of four main urban airports that were to form the first tier of that system. Cointrin was noted as being well suited for extension and did not require a triangular runway arrangement as the prevailing winds are very regularly along a single axis. Authorities agreed to a 2.3M Swiss Francs project to build a first terminal in Geneva and in 1946 the new terminal – which is today used as Terminal 2 – was ready for use, and the runway was enlarged once more to 2000 m. In 1947, the first service to New York started with a Swissair Douglas DC-4. On 17 July 1959, the first jet aircraft landed in Geneva, an SAS Caravelle, and it was followed, 11 years later, by a TWA Boeing 747 which landed in 1970.

===Terminals===
Geneva Airport has two passenger terminals: the newer and larger Terminal 1 (T1), which features the majority of flights, and the smaller and only seasonally used Terminal 2 (T2). It also has a Business Aviation Terminal, also known as Terminal 3 (T3).

====Terminal 1====
Terminal 1, also known as Main terminal (M) is divided into 5 piers, A, B, C, D and F. Piers A, B, C and D are located in the Swiss side of Terminal 1. Passengers travelling from these gates (to Swiss or international destinations) check in at the main check-in hall and use the central security check above the check in hall. Pier A is located directly in front of the main shopping area and serves destinations in the Schengen area and domestic flight to Zürich. Pier B consists of two non-Schengen circular satellite buildings which are reached from the shopping area via an underground walkway, which also houses passport control. Pier C, also non-Schengen, is to the right of Pier A and houses long haul flights using wide body aircraft. Pier D consists of one circular satellite and one bus gate building, which is split between Schengen and non-Schengen passengers on different floors. These are reached via underground walkways from the left end of Pier A.

Before Switzerland&#x27;s integration into the Schengen Area in 2008, Pier F, also known as the French Sector, was used exclusively for passengers arriving from, or departing to destinations in France. It has two gates with jet bridges and four bus gates. The French Sector exists as a stipulation of an agreement between France and the Canton of Geneva dating from the 1960s, and enables travel between the neighboring French region of Pays de Gex and the airport while avoiding Swiss territory and customs. The French Sector area still exists for passengers arriving from French destinations who wish to exit directly to French territory and avoid Swiss customs controls, although passport control and immigration checks have been dropped as part of the Schengen Treaty. Buses to French ski resorts south of Geneva nowadays use the Swiss sector, since the road distance is much shorter through Geneva, and the passport control is dropped also at the border south of Geneva.

In June 2016, Geneva Airport management announced that they will start upgrading the main check-in hall in terminal 1. This will add one thousand square metres to the actual check-in area and help to cope with the higher passenger volume that the airport faces every year. The renovated check-in hall was fully opened by the end of 2017.

=====Long-haul pier &quot;Aile Est&quot;=====
The airport announced in 2012 a plan to replace the current, outdated long-haul section (Pier C) of the terminal, which originally was intended to be an interim solution back in 1975, with a completely reconstructed facility. Construction originally was delayed by several years by Swissair moving its long haul operation to Zurich in 1996. The September 11, 2001, attacks and the bankruptcy of Swissair in 2001 delayed it further. Lately, a few airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, United Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines have started to use the current facility. The need for this new pier was then urgent. The extension of the airport was opposed by some associations (such as NOÉ21).

In December 2021, construction of the new &quot;Aile Est&quot; (&quot;East Wing&quot;) was completed. It is a completely new extension of the terminal replacing the old Pier C in the same location. The new facility is 520 m long and is able to handle six widebody long-haul aircraft at once directly at the building. This building is ecofriendly, electricity produced by 5,000 m2 of solar panels, more than 100 geothermal probes for heat pumps, glazed facades for natural light, additional LED lighting, recovery of rainwater, optimum thermal insulation with triple glazing, eliminates bus rides on the tarmac, and finally power supply and hot / cold direct 3 additional positions instead of an external diesel power. The new terminal pier has been in operation since 14 December 2021 and is used for all long-haul flights and several non-Schengen destinations.

====Terminal 2====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2024}}
Terminal 2 is only used during the winter charter season. This was the original terminal at Geneva Airport. It was built in 1946 and remained in use until the 1960s when the Main Terminal opened. Facilities at Terminal 2 are poor, with only one restaurant and no duty-free shops. Passengers check in and pass through security checks at this terminal, and then take a low floor bus to piers A, B, C and D at T1. Arriving passengers are bussed directly from the aircraft to T2 and then pass through passport control (if needed) and collect their baggage there. Geneva Airport wanted to refurbish T2 as a low-cost terminal. At this time EasyJet was the major low-cost airline in Geneva with up to 80 flights a day during winter. Other major airlines at GVA threatened to leave the airport if EasyJet had its own terminal with lower landing charges. Since then, there has been no information about an upgrade of T2 facilities.

====Business Aviation Terminal====
The Business Aviation Terminal, or Terminal 3 (T3), is located at the south-west end of the airport, about 2 km from Terminal 1. This terminal is a hub for private charter jet companies (also known as Fixed-Base Operators, or FBOs) that offer facilities including VIP lounges, private immigration, and customs screening. Parking at Terminal 3 is limited.

===Runways===
The airport has a single concrete runway (04/22), which is the longest in Switzerland with a length of {{convert|3900|m|abbr=on|0}} and one of the longest in Europe, making it open to use by aircraft of all existing sizes. Adjacent to the commercial runway is a smaller, parallel, grass runway (04L/22R) for light aircraft. Since its opening, the runway had been known as 05/23 until September 13, 2018, when it was changed to 04/22 due to the North Magnetic Pole moving. Usually, runway 22 is used when the wind is calm. If the wind is stronger than {{convert|4|knot}} and in a direction going from 320 to 140 degrees, then runway 04 will be used.

===Other facilities===
* Now defunct Swiss regional airline Baboo had its head office on the grounds of the airport and in Grand-Saconnex.
* Geneva International Airport hosts an office of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).{{cn|date=January 2025}}

The airport is {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} from the Geneva city centre. There is a railway station with trains to Geneva-Cornavin station, and other cities in Switzerland.

===Bus===
There are local buses that stop at the airport. There are also buses to and from Annecy, France, and also seasonal buses to ski resort Chamonix in France and ski resorts in Switzerland. Many transfer companies operate shared transfers in the winter to many French ski resorts. Winter weekends see dozens of coaches at the nearby Charter terminal (former cargo terminal) meeting charter flights from all over Europe, but primarily the UK. These take holidaymakers to/from ski resorts in France, Switzerland and Italy. The buses in general go from the Swiss sector since this shortens the driving distance to most destinations.

==Incidents and accidents==
* In 1950, Air India Flight 245, a Lockheed Constellation, crashed into Mont Blanc while descending toward Geneva.
* In 1966, a very similar accident occurred when Air India Flight 101, a Boeing 707, crashed into Mont Blanc while descending toward Geneva.
* On 17 October 1982, an Egypt Air Boeing 707-366C, SU-APE struck the ground short of runway 23, bounced then slid off the left side of the runway, turned 270 degrees and continued sliding backwards. The right wing separated and a fire which broke out was quickly extinguished by the airport emergency services. Although the plane was a complete write off, the 172 passengers and 10 crew all survived.
* On 23 July 1987, a hijacker was arrested by Swiss authorities on board an Air Afrique Douglas DC-10 after the plane had landed at Geneva to refuel. One passenger was shot and killed by the hijacker before he was overpowered by the crew prior to the plane being stormed by the authorities. 1 crew member and 3 other passengers were injured during the incident.
* On 2 September 1998, Swissair Flight 111 from New York-JFK to Geneva, operated by a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, suffered an inflight fire and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people on board.
* On 20 March 1999, an Iberia MD-87, EC-GRL, had to land without its front undercarriage.
*On 17 February 2014, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 702 on scheduled service departing from Addis Ababa at 00:30 (local time) scheduled to arrive in Rome at 04:40 (local time) was forced to proceed to Geneva airport. The Boeing 767-300 (tail ET-AMF) was flying north over Sudan when it changed radio frequency to squawk 7500—which is used in case of hijacking. Nearing Geneva, the pilots communicated with air traffic control to inquire about possibility of hijackers receiving asylum in Switzerland. The aircraft circled the airport several times, before landing around 6:00 in the morning with one engine and less than 10 minutes of fuel remaining. The airport remained closed as the aircraft stayed on the tarmac. At 7:12 local time, the pilots communicated to ATC that they would be ready to disembark passengers in five minutes. The co-pilot of the plane was found to be the hijacker and was arrested. No passengers were harmed.

==Controversies==
The airport&#x27;s contribution to the economy and its nuisance are the subject of political and public debate. Neighbouring inhabitants and communes are opposed to its growth, particularly because of the noise caused by aircraft.
The business community, for its part, has set up an association to defend the airport, AERIA+. Its members include the Fédération des Entreprises Romandes Genève, the Centre patronal and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Geneva and Vaud.

==In popular culture==
* The old airport building, located next to the current building, is depicted in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; story &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;.

<doc id="292617" wikidata="Q7570085" url="?curid=292617" title="Southern Levant">
<text>The Southern Levant is a geographical region that corresponds approximately to present-day Palestine, Israel, and Jordan; some definitions also include southern Lebanon, southern Syria and/or the Sinai Peninsula. As a strictly geographical description, it is sometimes used by archaeologists and historians to avoid the religious and political connotations of other names for this area. 

Like much of Southwestern Asia, the Southern Levant is an arid region consisting mostly of desert and dry steppe, with a thin strip of wetter, temperate climate along the Mediterranean coast. Geographically it is dominated by the Jordan Valley, a section of the Great Rift Valley bisecting the region from north to south, and containing the Sea of Galilee, the Jordan River and the Dead Sea – the lowest point on the Earth&#x27;s land surface.

The Southern Levant has a long history and is one of the world&#x27;s most intensively investigated areas by archaeologists. It is considered likely to be the first place that both early hominins and modern humans colonized outside of Africa. Consequently, it has a rich Stone Age archaeology, stretching back as early as 1.5 million years ago. With one of the earliest sites for urban settlements, it also corresponds to the western parts of the Fertile Crescent.

==Terminology==

The Southern Levant refers to the lower half of the Levant but there is some variance of geographical definition, with the widest definition including Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, southern Syria, and the Sinai Desert. In the field of archaeology, the southern Levant is &quot;the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan.&quot;

Many scholars studying the region&#x27;s archaeology have adopted the term Levant (including northern and southern halves) as the &quot;term of choice&quot; due to it being a &quot;wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus&quot; that does not have the &quot;political overtones&quot; of Syria-Palestine. A survey of North American dissertations shows the &quot;overwhelming emphasis and scope of these works has been the southern Levant, an area formerly identified as Syria-Palestine including Canaan&quot;, but with most modern Ph.D. dissertations using the terms &#x27;Israel&#x27; and &#x27;Canaan&#x27;.

The term &quot;Southern Levant&quot; has also been criticized as imprecise and awkward. The term Southern Levant has been described in academic discourse as a &quot;at least a strictly geographical&quot; description of the region, avoiding religious and political connotations of names such as &quot;Canaan&quot;, &quot;Holy Land&quot;, &quot;Land of Israel&quot;, or &quot;Palestine&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Southern Levant lies on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, in the world region known variously as the Near East, the Middle East or Western or Southwestern Asia. It is bordered to the east, southeast and southwest by the Syrian, Arabian and Sinai deserts, respectively. Some definitions include parts of these deserts in the region. The Litani River in southern Lebanon is commonly considered the dividing line between the Southern Levant and the Northern Levant (i.e. Syria), or sometimes the Orontes River, also in Lebanon.

For the most part, the climate of the Southern Levant is arid or semi-arid, however a narrow strip along the coast experiences a temperate, Mediterranean climate due to its proximity to the sea. Average annual rainfall decreases sharply away from the coast, from over per year in Galilee, to in the Rift Valley, and less than in the eastern deserts and the Negev. Across the region, precipitation is both highly seasonal―most rain falls between October and May, and hardly any in the summer—and subject to large, unpredictable inter-annual variation. Temperature is also highly variable, with cool winters and hot summers.

The Jordan River bisects much of the region into the Cisjordan and Transjordan. The Huleh basin feeds into the upper Jordan, which moves southward through a natural basalt barrier into the Sea of Galilee before dropping several hundred metres as it flows through the Jordan Valley. The Jordan River terminates at the Dead Sea, whose banks, at below sea level, are the world&#x27;s lowest point on dry land.

==Archaeological findings==
The archaeology of the southern Levant is generally conceived as a series of phases or stages in human cultural and evolutionary development based, for the most part, on tool technology for early pre-historic, proto-historic and early historic periods. Later phases are generally associated with historical periods and are named accordingly. While there is no single, accepted sequence that all archaeologists agree upon, the basic conventions indicate a number of Stone Ages, followed by a Copper/Stone Age, in turn followed by a Bronze Age. The names given to them, derived from the Greek, are also used widely for other regions. The different ages in turn are often divided up into sequential or sometimes parallel chrono-cultural facies, sometimes called “cultures” or “periods”. Sometimes their names are derived from European prehistory, at other times from local sites, often where they were first discovered.

Archaeologically, it is among the most extensively excavated regions in the world.

===Pre-history and Stone Age===
The Southern Levant is amongst the oldest inhabited parts of Eurasia, being on one of three plausible routes by which early hominins could have dispersed out of Africa (along with the Bab al Mandab and the Strait of Gibraltar). &quot;Homo erectus&quot; left Africa and became the first hominin species to colonise Europe and Asia approximately two million years ago, probably through the Southern Levant. During this phase of the Pleistocene epoch the region was wetter and greener, allowing &quot;H. erectus&quot; to find places with fresh water as it followed other African animals that were dispersing out of Africa at the same time. One such location was &#x27;Ubeidiya, on the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee, where some of the oldest hominin remains in Eurasia have been discovered, dating to between 1.2 million and 1.5 million years ago.

Several Stone Ages, when stone tools prevailed and make up the bulk of artifacts, are followed by periods when other technologies came into use. They lent their names to the different periods. The basic framework for the southern Levant is, as follows: Paleolithic or Old Stone Age is often divided up into phases called, from early-to-late: Lower Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic. An Epipaleolithic (latest Paleolithic) period, also known as Mesolithic (transition to Neolithic) follows and is, in turn succeeded by a Neolithic (New Stone Age).

The following Chalcolithic period includes the first evidence of metallurgy with copper making its appearance. However, as stone technology remains prevalent, the name, Chalcolithic (Copper/Stone) age combines the two.

===Bronze Age===
Bronze is used for the following periods, but is actually a misnomer for a good part of that time. An Early Bronze Age is divided into three major phases, Early Bronze I, II and III, but copper and not bronze was the most common metal in use, while stone technology continued to contribute the bulk of tools. Early Bronze III is followed by another period, alternately named Early Bronze IV, Middle Bronze I, Intermediate Bronze or Early Bronze-Middle Bronze. In this period the name is apt; true bronze (a tin alloy of copper) makes its appearance in this time span.

The next period is generally known as Middle Bronze II and is generally broken down into two sub-periods, Middle Bronze IIa and Middle Bronze IIb. Some scholars acknowledge a Middle Bronze III. The next period is known as Late Bronze and is often sub-divided into Late Bronze I and II.

===Iron Age===
The introduction of iron, although relatively rare, especially in the earliest phases, caused the following phase to be named the Iron Age. It is variously sub-divided into Iron I, Iron II and sometimes Iron III, with subdivisions becoming increasingly popular as sequences become better known. Some archaeologists suggest that there in the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, the large cultural differences are explained by foreign invasion, that is, the introduction of new ethnicity. More recent evidence indicates that the large culture changes were not the result of a foreign invasion. Rather, the Iron Age people of the southern Levant were related to their Bronze Age predecessors.

===Later historical periods===
The post-Iron Age is generally thought of as historical and accordingly names of periods reflect this. The very latest Iron Age phase is sometimes called &quot;Assyrian&quot; and the following period is universally known as the Persian period.

The 333 BCE conquest of the region by Alexander the Great is accepted as the beginning of the Hellenistic period. The Deuterocanonical book 2 Maccabees records: &quot;Apollonius the son of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celesyria and Phenicia&quot;, Celesyria being the transliteration of Coele-Syria. It is followed by the Roman period, with an Early and Late Roman sub-period. The 4th century is recognised as the beginning of the Byzantine period, that lasted until the Arab conquest of the region.

The following period is known as Early Arab and sub-periods by the names of reigning dynasties. The Crusader conquest of the region is known, appropriately as the Crusader period, which in part overlaps with Ayyubid rule, and it is followed by a Mamluk period after the conquering power. In 1516–17 the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and gave its name to the period that lasted until 1917–18, when the British conquered it in World War I.

<text>The Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) is the air force of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. It was known as the Rhodesian Air Force until 1980. The Air Force of Zimbabwe saw service in the Mozambican Civil War in 1985 and the Second Congo War of 1998–2001.

==History==

===Formation and early days===
The Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF; previously known as the Royal Rhodesian Air Force), was reconstituted into the Air Force of Zimbabwe in 1980. The RhAF&#x27;s mixed collection of aircraft were joined by other aircraft from 1981 onwards, supplied by Kenya, Britain, China and elsewhere.
Support also came from the Pakistan Air Force who trained most of the Zimbabwean pilots in the initial days, assisted in the re-construction of Thornhill Air Base, and provided Air Marshal Azim Daudpota to Zimbabwe as the Chief of Air Staff (1983–1986).

In 1981, the Air Force of Zimbabwe ordered 8 eight Hawk MK60s, which were delivered in July 1982. On the night of 25 July 1982 a sabotage attack on Thornhill Airbase damaged four Hawks, nine Hunters and a single FTB-337G. One Hawk was written off, another was repaired on site and the other two were returned to BAE for a rebuild. A follow-up order for five additional Hawks was completed in September 1992.

The first supersonic interceptor operated by the air force was the Chinese-built Chengdu J-7/F7 Airguard, 12 of the II and IIN variants were delivered in 1986. Two Eurocopter AS532 Cougar helicopters were reported to be in use for VIP duties in 1997, delivered in April 1995 and September 1996. In April 2021 a newer (refurbished) Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma was added to the fleet.

===Second Congo War 1998–2003===
The Second Congo War, also known as &quot;Coltan War&quot; and the Great War of Africa, began in August 1998 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly called Zaire), and officially ended in July 2003 when the Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo took power; although hostilities are currently ongoing.
Zimbabwe&#x27;s well-trained military entered the war as the best-equipped side. In mid-August 1998, the AFZ deployed five or six F-7s, most of the C.212s, at least four Cessna 337G Lynxs, and a dozen or more helicopters, including Alouettes, Bell 412s and Mi-35s, to Congo. All aircraft were flown by Zimbabwean pilots. After receiving an urgent shipment of spare Hawks, the AFZ apparently deployed some of them as well. At the start of the war, the Hawks had been reported to be in unflyable condition. Due to these circumstances the AFZ contingent in the Congo in August and September 1998 consisted of flights from No.3, No.4, No.5, No.7 and No.8 Squadrons, while a flight from No.2 Squadron was to follow later.

The No.2 AFZ Squadron deployed 12 BAe Hawk T.Mk.60/60As, which were used as strike-fighters and equipped with AIM-9B Sidewinder AAMs, Mk.82-series bombs, and Hunting BL.755 cluster-bomber units (CBUs), as well as launchers for unguided rockets. Only six or seven F-7s From No.5 squadron were fully mission-capable. Prior to the war in Congo, Zimbabwe was in the middle of negotiations with China for 12 additional F-7s.

For transport, the AFZ had the No.3 Squadron, flying 12 CASA C-212 Aviocar and six Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander light transports which had already seen heavy service, and were to see even more of this in Congo. Transport and liaison were also duties of the No.7 Squadron, equipped with Aérospatiale SA 316B Alouette IIIs (including ex-Portuguese Air Force – and Romanian IAR-built examples), as well as of the No.8 Squadron, equipped with Agusta-Bell 412SPs which were later armed with rocket launchers for this war. However, the latter unit would soon play a significant role in the war in DRC, as it was only recently equipped with the newest addition to the AFZ: six Mi-35 helicopters (including two Mi-35Ps). The first AFZ Mi-35-crews were trained at Thornhill AB, in Gweru, by Russian instructors. CO of this unit was Sqn. Ldr. Mukotekwa.

The first noted AFZ operation took place on 26 August 1998, where they destroyed a 5 km armoured column of rebels as they were approaching Kinshasa. After defeating the invaders in Kinshasa, the Zimbabweans, in the belief that Kabila&#x27;s government was already safe, suggested that there was no need to continue the war, and peace should be negotiated. This resulted in the reinforcement of rebel efforts as well as the Rwandans and Ugandans rushing better-equipped units into the battle. The garrisons in eastern Congo that remained loyal to Kabila fell to rebel attacks. The Ndigili airport, in Kibanseke Province, as well as Kitona, both held by Zimbabwean troops, were attacked simultaneously. In both cases, the AFZ responded with fierce air strikes. Rebels claimed that up to 100 civilians were killed by their bombs.

A series of fierce battles were fought between 4 and 13 September 1998, during which the Angolan mechanised forces were finally able to deploy their full firepower. The Chadian contingent was meanwhile deployed in NE Congo, where it participated in re-capture of Lubutu. The AFZ and FAC were active in this area for several days, flying a number of strikes during which cluster-bomb units (CBUs) were used. According to government reports, 45 rebels were killed and 19 captured in this battle.

On 13 September, when the Angolans attacked towards Kamina, the Zimbabweans found themselves under fierce attacks by thousands of rebels in the Manono area. It was in this area that the AFZ suffered its first documented loss of this war: on 4 September the Aermacchi SF.260 flown by wing commander Sharaunga crashed in bad weather, killing the pilot. Nine days later an Alouette III helicopter carrying several high-ranking officers, including Col. Kufa and Sqn. Ldr. Vundla, was shot down by rebels in eastern central Congo. Kufa and Vundla were killed, while Flt. Sgt. Sande was captured by RCD.

In late October 1998, the Zimbabweans launched an offensive in SE Congo. The offensive was made possible owing to the deployment of additional foreign troops in Congo, including some 2,000 Namibians. This began with a series of air strikes, partially flown by BAe Hawk T.Mk.60s of the No.2 Squadron, newly deployed in Congo, and by F-7s of the No.5 Squadron. These units first targeted airfields in Gbadolite, Dongo and Gmena, and then rebel and Rwandan communications and depots in the Kisangani area, on 21 November. On the following day the No.2 Squadron launched a strike package of six aircraft, armed with Mk.82 bombs and Matra 155 rocket launchers for unguided rockets calibre 68mm, which reached out far over central Congo. They deployed over Lake Tanganyika and attacked ferries used to transport Burundi troops and supplies into the war in Congo. According to Zimbabwean reports their strike came as a complete surprise. With machine-guns and light infantry weapons as the only means of air defense, six ferries were sunk and 600 Burundi and Rwandan troops killed. In a similar attack, on 7 December 1998, Zimbabwean planes or helicopters sank two rebel boats on Lake Tanganyika some 40 km north of Moba.

In November 1998, it was reported that a $54 million shipment of helicopters, fighters and spotter aircraft had arrived in Zimbabwe to assist in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is unclear who received the delivered weapons. There were only very few reports about the fighting in the next few days, probably because the Congolese, Zimbabwean and Angolan governments found themselves under heavy pressure from Western powers because of this offensive. The few reports released from sources close to the rebels indicated Zimbabwean and Congolese attacks on Nuyuzu, Kasinge and towards Manono, supported by T-62 tanks and heavy artillery. According to Zimbabwean reports the Hawks and F-7s continued their operations and made additional attacks against Kalemi on 24 November, and a new round of strikes against different airfields in eastern Congo two days late. After the attacks the pilots of No.5 Squadron claimed destruction of an unidentified An-12 transport on the ground.

When Congolese President Laurent Kabila was assassinated in early 2001, the Zimbabwean Air Force deployed five Chengdu J-7/F7 Airguard to Kinshasa to participate in a fly-past at the state funeral. One of the five fighter planes crashed en route to the event and while four subsequently made the fly-past, two of the remaining aircraft also crashed during the return flight home. The crashes were blamed on low flying hours for pilots in the air force and insufficient training time.

==Current organizational structure==
The AFZ is subdivided into the Administration Wing, the Engineering Wing, the Flying Wing, and the Regimental Wing. The Administration Wing supports equipment purchasing, recruitment, staff support, food supplies, and related functions. The Engineering Wing maintains and inspects aircraft and related equipment, and covers the School of Technical Training, a tertiary education institution responsible for training aircraft maintenance engineering technicians. The training institute is the only federation aviation school in Africa. The Flying Wing handles aircrew personnel divided into eight squadrons at three primary bases. It also covers the schools for flying and parachute training. The Regimental Wing covers those squadrons specially selected to guard other AFZ assets, such as personnel and installations.
and weapon activations.

Directorates found in the air force of Zimbabwe:
*Regiment
*Civil Military Relations
*Finance
*Training
*Health Services
*Intelligence
*Administration
*Engineering

==Aircraft==

=== Current inventory ===
Ascertaining a list of aircraft types operated by the Air force of Zimbabwe is difficult because of secrecy. AFZ has been constantly linked to Mikoyan MiG-29 since 1980 and even sent pilots to the then-USSR for training. In February 2002 the EU enforced an arms embargo on Zimbabwe in reaction to severe violations of human rights in the nation. Unable to buy spare parts for the British designed and manufactured BAE Systems Hawk, in 2006 the air force received the first K-8. The air force also has Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter jets donated by the late Muammar Gaddafi. In the late 1980s an order for MiG-29s placed with Russia, but was cancelled in 1992. Negotiations to buy 14 MiG-29SMTs from Russia were held again in 2004 but an order for JF-17 fighters was apparently placed instead. One BAE Systems Hawk was returned to service in 2019 for the AFZ 40th anniversary mass flypast and was noted in a flypast at the April 2022 Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. Between 2022 and 2023, the AFZ was able to restore more of its BAE Systems Hawks to service; a spokesman for the defense forces declined to comment on the circumstances of their refurbishment.

===Retired aircraft===
Previous notable aircraft operated by the Air Force consisted of the English Electric Canberra, de Havilland Vampire, C-47 Dakota, Aermacchi AL-60, Reims 337 Lynx

== Rank structure ==
The AFZ&#x27;s rank structure is similar to the RAF&#x27;s rank structure from where, via the Rhodesian Air Force, its ranks were derived.

==Aircraft losses==
Exact figures for the Air Force of Zimbabwe&#x27;s aircraft losses have not been publicly published. It is believed four Hawks were lost, three F7s and several helicopters.

*Michael Enslin, 21 years of age the time, was shot down in a BAe Hawk at 1000 feet while recovering from a dive. He survived for 5 days in the bush until he was rescued. He was the third pilot to be shot down.
*SF.260MC flown by Wing Commander. Sharaunga crashed in bad weather, killing the pilot.
*The Pilot Wing Commander became disorientated at night while on the way to take part in a flypast at Laurent Kabila&#x27;s funeral, and the pilot ejected. He was found alive in the jungle by Zimbabwean troops five days later.

==Incidents and accidents==
*The Air Force suffered a major setback on 25 July 1982 when four of their eight BAE Hawks were damaged in a sabotage attack a few days after their arrival at Thornhill Air Base. Plane 602 was written off, plane 601 was kept in Zimbabwe for repairs, whilst planes 600 and 603 were shipped back to British aerospace for repairs to airworthy status
*22 July 1985, a UFO was witnessed by dozens of persons on the ground and in the control tower at Bulawayo Airport now Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport. The air traffic controllers watched it hover and tracked it on radar and two BAE Systems Hawk jets were scrambled to pursue it and the pilots described it as incredibly shiny, reflecting the colours of the sunset they estimated that the UFO was travelling at twice the speed of sound
*More than 20 airspace intrusions were reported in the first nine days of October 1992. The violations appeared to be in the vicinity of Thornhill Air Base and the violators are believed to be South African transport planes on their way to Angola.
*February 1995, a Chengdu F-7 crashed near Lalapanzi after encountering some engine problems. Fight Lieutenant Zisengwe died in the plane crash
*21/22 January 2001, an unnamed Wing Commander flying a Chengdu F7 became disoriented at night while on the way to take part in a flypast at Laurent Kabila&#x27;s funeral. He ejected and was found alive in the jungle by Zimbabwean troops five days later.
*In 2005, a CASA C212-200 Aviocar military transport plane came down during take-off at the Harare International Airport, killing two pilots – Wing Commander Lysias Charuka and Air Lieutenant Aletini Silaigwana
*1 April 2005 Aérospatiale Alouette III Crashed soon after take-off in Gokwe, the pilot tried to avoid telephone lines. All four on board survived
*5 September 2008, a K-8 Karakoram training jet crashed into Block 1 Married Quarters flats at Thornhill Air Base in the Midlands town of Gweru during a training sortie. The jet skimmed over trees and houses as it headed for a school before turning sharply and smashing into two high-rise residential flats. There were no injuries or deaths other than the two pilots Flight Lieutenant Kudzai Kelvin Majongosi of Chirumanzu and Flight Lieutenant Dumisani Ndlovu of Bulawayo. Both were 28 years old
*On 22 September 2010, K-8 serial number 2021C piloted by &quot;Venom&quot; practicing for the Africa Aerospace and Defence Expo display burst a tire on landing and rolled to the end of the runway at AFB Ysterplaat, Cape Town. It took some time to get the runway open again and aircraft in the air at the time diverted to Cape Town International Airport
*On 4 September 2014 a SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 trainer aircraft crashed into a shanty town on the western outskirts of the capital soon after takeoff from the Charles Prince Airport on a routine training mission over the Mount Hampden area when it suddenly nose-dived and crashed. The two pilots, Squadron leader Taurayi Jombo aged 36, and Air Lieutenant Evidence Edzai Begede aged 28 died on the spot. Such was the force of the impact that one of the pilots was decapitated but there were no further casualties only extensive structural damage to buildings nearby
*On the morning of 23 April 2015 a K-8 crashed in an open field a few kilometers from Thornhill Airbase after catching fire. Both pilots ejected safely
*An SIAI-Marchetti trainer aircraft SF.260 crashed into a compound in Somabhula, about 24 km south-west of Gweru on 24 November 2020 killing Flight Instructor and Squadron Leader Mkhululi Dube and trainee pilot Silungile Sweswe
*On 23 April 2021, an Agusta Bell 412 AB-412 helicopter from Number 8 Squadron crashed in Arcturus just 32 km east of Harare. It was on a general handling sortie. Four crew members and one child on the ground died. Among the crew was Annita Mapiye, the country&#x27;s first female Air Force helicopter pilot. No mayday was transmitted 
*An Mi-35 helicopter gunship made an emergency landing in an open field in Chitungwiza on 8 July 2021 after the pilot, a group captain, tried his luck on an empty tank against the advice of the engineer. On board were two pilots and five aircraft technicians. They all survived without injuries.
* On 3 February 2023 an SF-260 on a training sortie crashed in the Mlezu college area near Gweru. Both Pilots Group Captain Benson Munyanduki and Wing Commander Daniel Manyenga perished. This was the air force&#x27;s fourth crash in a little over two years.

The largest nearby business centres are Düsseldorf and Essen; other cities within a {{convert|20|km|mi|0|adj=on}} radius are Duisburg, Krefeld, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Neuss, and Wuppertal. The airport extends over a compact {{convert|6.13|km2}} of land – small in comparison to airports of a similar capacity. The airport has more than 18,200 employees.

With around 16{{nbsp}}million passengers passing through in 2022, the airport was the fourth busiest in Germany, after Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport. It was the 31st-busiest airport in Europe in 2022.

===Ownership===
The city of Düsseldorf owns half the airport, with the other half owned by various commercial entities. Düsseldorf Airport is a public–private partnership with the following owners:
* 50% city of Düsseldorf
* 50% Airport Partners GmbH (owners: 40% AviAlliance GmbH, 40% Aer Rianta International cpt, 20% AviC GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA)

==History==
===Early years===

The current airport was opened on 19 April 1927, after two years of construction. The first international route was inaugurated by SABENA in 1929 between Brussels, Antwerp, Düsseldorf and Hamburg.

At the beginning of World War II, civil use of the airport ceased in September 1939 and the airfield was used by the military. After the end of the war, the airport reopened for civil use in 1948. With the area under British administration, the first international flights were operated by British European Airways to London.

Since 1950, the airport is owned by a state-owned operations company.

On 1 April 1955, Lufthansa started services between Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, and Munich, which still exist today. In 1959, the first scheduled jet aircraft landed in Düsseldorf on Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; Copenhagen-Khartoum route. In 1961, LTU relocated its home base from Cologne Bonn Airport and in the same year, Düsseldorf Airport handled more than one{{nbsp}}million passengers for the first time.

In 1969, the main runway was lengthened to 3000 metres while a new second terminal was under construction. The new Terminal 2, which is today&#x27;s Terminal B, opened in April 1973. Another addition, today&#x27;s Terminal A, was opened in 1977 while the last annex, Terminal C, opened in 1986.

===Düsseldorf Airport fire===

On 11 April 1996, the Düsseldorf Airport fire, which is the worst structural airport fire worldwide to date, broke out. It was caused by welding work on an elevated road in front of Terminal A above its arrivals area. Insufficient structural fire protection allowed the fire and especially the smoke to spread fast, destroying large parts of the passenger areas of the airport. Seventeen people died, mostly due to smoke inhalation, with many more hospitalised. At the time, the fire was the biggest public disaster in the history of North Rhine-Westphalia. Damage to the airport was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions; Terminals A and B had to be completely reconstructed. While repairs were ongoing, passengers were housed in big tents.

In November 1997, Terminal C was completely redeveloped, with three lightweight construction halls serving as departure areas. Also in 1997 construction began on the new inter-city railway station at the eastern edge of the airport. In 1998 the rebuilt Terminal A was reopened and the airport changed its name from &quot;Rhine Ruhr Airport&quot; to &quot;Düsseldorf International&quot;. Reconstruction of the central building and Terminal B began in the same year.

===Development since the 2000s===

The first construction stage in the &quot;Airport 2000+&quot; programme commenced in 1998 with the laying of a foundation stone for an underground parking garage under the new terminal.

The new Düsseldorf Airport station was opened in May 2000, with a capacity of 300 train departures daily. 16{{nbsp}}million passengers used the airport that year; Düsseldorf is now the third-biggest airport in Germany. The new departures hall and Terminal B were opened in July 2001 after 2½ years of construction time; the rebuilt Gebäude Ost (East Building) was reopened.

In 2002, the inter-terminal shuttle bus service was replaced by the suspended monorail called the &quot;SkyTrain&quot; connecting the terminal building with the InterCity train station. The monorail travels the {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} between the terminal and station at a maximum speed of {{convert|50|km/h}}. The system was developed by Siemens and is based on the similar H-Bahn operating with two lines on the Dortmund university campus.

On 12 November 2006, the first Airbus A380 landed in Düsseldorf as part of a Lufthansa promotional flight.

In March 2013, the Airport received a new corporate design and dropped the phrase &quot;International&quot; from its official name.

In January 2015, Emirates announced it would schedule the Airbus A380 on one of their two daily flights from Dubai to Düsseldorf starting in July 2015. In May 2015, the airport finished construction of the new facilities needed to handle the A380, including a parking position with three jet-bridges, widened taxiways and new ground handling equipment.

In June 2015, Lufthansa announced the closure of its long-haul base at Düsseldorf Airport for economic reasons by October 2015. The base consisted of two Airbus A340-300s which served Newark and Chicago-O&#x27;Hare. Newark remained a year-round service which is operated in a W-pattern from Munich Airport (Munich - Newark - Düsseldorf - Newark - Munich) while the Chicago service was suspended for the winter 2015/2016 season. A few months later, Lufthansa announced the cancellation of the Düsseldorf-Chicago route. The same route was served by American Airlines during the summer seasons from 2013 to 2016, when it was discontinued.

In January 2017, the airport&#x27;s largest hub operator Air Berlin announced a massive downsizing of its operations due to restructuring measures. While some leisure routes were handed to Niki more than a dozen destinations were cancelled entirely. In August 2017, Air Berlin also announced the termination of all long-haul routes from Düsseldorf to destinations in the Caribbean on short notice due to ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. However, both Condor and Eurowings announced it would step in and start some of the terminated Caribbean destinations by themselves. Shortly after, Air Berlin also announced the termination of all remaining long-haul operations leading to the loss of several connections to the United States at Düsseldorf Airport. On 9 October 2017, Air Berlin announced the termination of all of its own operations, excluding wet leases, by the end of the month leading to the loss of one of the airport&#x27;s largest customers.

In February 2018, Eurowings announced the relocation of all long-haul routes currently served from Cologne Bonn Airport to Düsseldorf by late October 2018 to strengthen its presence there.

In March 2018, Lufthansa announced it would close its base at Düsseldorf Airport after the 2018/2019 winter schedule which ended in March 2019. When the single remaining long-haul route to Newark was taken over by Eurowings, 400 staff members were offered a relocation to either Frankfurt Airport or Munich Airport. In November 2018, Ryanair also announced they would close their base in Düsseldorf after only a year. Its routes were taken over by Lauda.

In August 2020, Delta Air Lines removed the Atlanta route from their schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It started resuming its three-times-weekly service to and from Atlanta on 9 May 2023, albeit making the route to Düsseldorf summer seasonal only, therefore leaving the airport without any transatlantic connection in the winter season.

Shortly after Delta Air Lines suspended its Atlanta route, Ryanair announced the closure of its base in Düsseldorf — which was operated on a wetlease basis by Lauda — by 24 October 2020. In September 2020, Singapore Airlines permanently removed the route to Singapore from their schedule.

In the autumn of 2022, German airline Sundair drastically reduced its operations from Düsseldorf, leaving a single route to Beirut. The two previously based aircraft were relocated. In January 2023 it became public that Sundair would not return to Düsseldorf in the summer season of 2023 with any flight, eradicating its former base from the network. Just five months after resuming the previously long-standing route to Atlanta, Delta Air Lines announced in September 2023 that it would not return to Düsseldorf in the 2024 summer season, leaving Düsseldorf without scheduled transatlantic flights.{{Cn|date=June 2024}}

==Facilities==

===Terminals===
Düsseldorf Airport has three terminals connected by a central spine, even though the terminals are essentially concourses within a single terminal building. The current terminal buildings are capable of handling up to 22 million passengers per year.

====Terminal A====
Terminal A was opened in 1977 and has 16 gates (A01–A16) used by Lufthansa and Eurowings, its airline partners and Star Alliance members, Austrian Airlines, Croatia Airlines, LOT Polish Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and Swiss International Air Lines. Terminal A houses two Lufthansa lounges. It was refurbished fundamentally for two years after the 1996 fire.

====Terminal B====
Terminal B was originally inaugurated in 1973 and has 11 gates (B01–B11) used for domestic and EU flights by a few Star Alliance members such as Aegean Airlines, but mainly by SkyTeam and Oneworld members like Air France, British Airways, KLM, Finnair, Iberia and ITA Airways. Also located within this terminal are leisure carriers such as TUIfly and Condor. Terminal B houses an observation deck, which got shut down after the COVID-19 outbreak due to economic reasons, and one contract lounge After the fire in 1996, the whole terminal building was torn down and reconstructed. It was reopened in 2001.

====Terminal C====
Terminal C was opened in 1986 and has 8 gates (C01–C08) used exclusively for non-Schengen flights by non-Star Alliance airlines (except Turkish Airlines). These are long-haul flights – among others – by Emirates and Etihad Airways. Terminal C has a direct access to Airport City&#x27;s &quot;Maritim Hotel&quot;, part of a German hotel chain, and houses lounges operated by the airport and Emirates. Terminal C was the least affected terminal after the fire in 1996, reopening the same year after intensive maintenance work. Thus it was the only usable Terminal at Düsseldorf Airport for a couple of years. Terminal C features the airport&#x27;s only parking position equipped with three jet-bridges to handle the Airbus A380.

====Executive Terminal====
Jet Aviation operates a small terminal solely for private and corporate customers.

===Runways and apron===
Düsseldorf has two runways, which are {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}} and {{convert|2700|m|ft|0}} long. There are plans to extend the {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|adj=on}} runway to {{convert|3600|m|ft|0}}, but the town of Ratingen has been blocking the expansion, as it lies within the approach path of the runway. 107 aircraft parking positions are available on the aprons.

===Airport City===
Starting in 2003, an area of {{convert|23|ha}} southwest of the airport terminal began redevelopment as Düsseldorf Airport City with an anticipated gross floor area of {{convert|250000|m2}}. Already based at Düsseldorf Airport City are corporate offices of Siemens and VDI, a large Porsche centre and showroom, a Maritim Hotel, and a Sheraton Hotel. Messe Düsseldorf is situated in close proximity to Düsseldorf Airport City (some {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

==Ground transportation==


===Train===
{{main|Düsseldorf Airport Terminal station|Düsseldorf Airport station}}
Düsseldorf Airport has two railway stations: 
*The S-Bahn station, Düsseldorf Airport Terminal station, is located below the terminal. It is served by the S11 suburban line, which has its northern terminus there.
*The main station, Düsseldorf Airport station, is located {{cvt|2.5|km}} from the terminal, and is served by all categories of railway, including Intercity Express (ICE) high-speed trains. A fully automatic suspended monorail called &quot;SkyTrain&quot; connects this station to the airport parking areas and the passenger terminals and also serves as an inter-terminal connection.

===Road===
The airport can be reached via its own motorway section which is part of the motorway A44 (Belgium – Kassel, Exit &quot;Düsseldorf-Flughafen&quot;) which also connects to motorways A52, A57 and A3. There are also several local bus lines connecting the airport with nearby areas and Düsseldorf city center.

==Other facilities==
* Düsseldorf Airport had the headquarters of Air Berlin&#x27;s technical training facilities and also served as one of their maintenance bases.
* When LTU International existed, its head office was in &quot;Halle 8&quot; at Düsseldorf Airport.
* The corporate head office of Blue Wings was also located in Terminal A at the airport.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 22 December 1955, a &quot;Manx Airlines&quot; Douglas C-47 on a positioning flight crashed at DUS attempting a visual approach rather than an instrument landing system approach in low clouds. The aircraft descended too low and struck trees, crashing about three miles from the runway. All three occupants were killed.

*On 3 November 1957, a &quot;Karl Herfurtner Düsseldorf&quot; Douglas C-54 crashed into a residential area 4.5 km (2.8 mi) S of DUS after takeoff due to mismanagement of the flight by the chief pilot. There were six fatalities out of the 10 on board and one killed on the ground.

==See also==
* Transport in Germany
* Weeze Airport, an airport {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north-west from Düsseldorf, that is sometimes advertised by low-cost airlines as &quot;Düsseldorf-Weeze&quot; or &quot;Weeze (Düsseldorf)&quot;. A German court ruled that naming the airport after Düsseldorf would be misleading to passengers; however, some airlines still use that name in advertisements outside Germany.

<doc id="292662" wikidata="Q16000351" url="?curid=292662" title="The Groundlings">
<text>The Groundlings is an American improvisational and sketch comedy troupe and school based in Los Angeles, California. The troupe was formed by Gary Austin in 1974 and uses an improv format influenced by Viola Spolin, whose improv techniques were taught by Del Close and other members of the Second City, located in Chicago and later St. Louis. They used these techniques to produce sketches and improvised scenes. Its name is taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Act III, Scene II: &quot;...to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise.&quot; In 1975 the troupe purchased and moved into its location on Melrose Avenue.

The Groundlings School holds sessions every six weeks with over 300 students per session, with more than 2,000 students per year going through the program. The competitive program, with admission by audition, consists of five levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced Improv, Writing Lab, and Advanced Writing Lab). Participants must satisfy instructors&#x27; requirements in order to advance from the first three levels. For Writing Lab and Advanced Writing Lab, students are voted on by then-current members of the Main Company as to whether they will move on. This vote is based on the students writing and performing Groundlings style sketch shows.

The program can take several years to complete. Students may be asked to repeat Basic and Intermediate classes multiple times. Upon completion of Advanced Writing Lab, students may be voted into the Sunday Company, where they may remain for no more than 18 months. (Sunday Company members are cast for six months at a time, and can be voted into Sunday Company for a maximum of three six-month periods.) Sunday Company members are eligible to be voted into Main Company (or &quot;The Groundlings&quot;) at the end of each six-month term of Sunday Company.

Many Groundlings performers appeared in movies and television, including several who have become cast members and writers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, and the G4 network while also being active on the internet, mainly YouTube.

==History==
In 1972, Gary Austin (a veteran of San Francisco&#x27;s The Committee) assembled a group of performers in Los Angeles to work on their craft. They would improvise, perform monologues, scenes, characters, songs, dances, and classic plays. After about a year, they started doing performances and inviting friends to come and watch. Word got out about the workshop, more people started coming, and a core group of performers began to showcase their material at various venues around Hollywood. 
In January 1974, Austin announced that he wanted to create a theatre company. There were fifty founding members of the company (membership at that time required payment of $25 to attend workshops). They developed material in the workshops and performed the best pieces in the weekend shows. The group produced its first show in the 30-seat basement of 1089 North Oxford Avenue, (earlier, the Oxford Theatre, then &quot;The MET&quot;, later the &quot;Eastwood Performing Arts Center&quot;) near the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Western Avenue. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; theatre critic Sylvie Drake was in the audience the first weekend, and wrote a rave review.
As the buzz about the new company increased, the entertainment industry started taking notice. Comedian Lily Tomlin was a regular in the audience, and she hired several Groundlings to perform on her &quot;The Lily Tomlin Show&quot;. Later that year Lorne Michaels, who produced Tomlin&#x27;s TV special, asked Groundling Laraine Newman to be a cast member for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.
Membership in the company grew to 90. To keep the size of the company down, it required selection by audition. Phil Hartman, then a graphic designer, tried out in the first audition. He was accepted, but due to competition, he had to wait more than a year before starting to perform in shows. With such a large company, workshops seven days a week, and sold-out shows going up three nights a weekend, the Groundlings needed a place to call their own.

The Groundlings School of improvisation began in 1978 with 17 students and staff members Gary Austin, Tom Maxwell, Phyllis Katz, Laraine Newman, and Tracy Newman. In the 21st century, it has an annual enrollment of more than 4200 students. The Sunday Company was formed by Suzanne Kent in 1982 to further develop the talent coming through the school.
In 1975 the company acquired what became The Groundlings Theatre at 7307 Melrose Avenue (the building was previously used as an interior decorator&#x27;s studio, a furniture showroom, a gay bar, and a massage parlor). Through equity and with the use of their own funds, company members set out to modernize the building and convert it into a performance space. They battled through four years of red tape, building codes, and parking restrictions before producing any shows on the stage. During that time the Groundlings performed their revues at a handful of theaters all over town, including The Improv, The Matrix, The Hollywood Canteen, and the White House. Finally in April 1979, the revitalized 99-seat theater opened its doors to audiences.
In November 1979, Gary Austin stepped down from his position as artistic director. Tom Maxwell was elected as his successor, and he served for the next ten years. In 1989, the Groundlings began the enduring tradition of having Groundlings or Groundlings alumni direct each new revue. The Main Company of no more than 30 members, collectively makes artistic, business and creative decisions. In April 2017 the Groundlings paid tribute to passing of their founder, Gary Austin, by gathering at the theatre and laying flowers at his plaque.

==Operations==
Students must pass an audition to get into the Basic class. If a student passes the audition, their results are valid for one year. If a student does not pass the audition, they are allowed to audition again in four months. Students are allowed to audition a total of three times.

After completing the Advanced Lab level, a student may be voted into the Sunday Company, which performs every Sunday at 7:30pm. During this time, students write, rehearse and perform new material every week. After six months of performing in the Sunday Company, students are either voted to remain in the company for another six months, voted to be dismissed from the school, or voted into the Main Company, also known as The Groundlings. No one can stay in the Sunday Company for longer than 18 months nor less than six months.

All members of the Main Company are selected from members of the Sunday Company. All of the Main Company members can remain in the company for as long as they desire. Usually members do not stay for longer than a decade; most of the Groundlings retire sooner from the company. The Main Company (capped at no more than 30 members at any time) collectively acts as the organization&#x27;s artistic director, democratically making business and creative decisions as a group.

==Shows==
The Groundlings Revues (now commonly referred to as the Main Shows) were the first shows performed by the company and they established the Groundlings improv, character, and sketch comedy style. In 1981, the revue was given a title, &quot;L.A. 200, Groundlings 3&quot;. Since that time every revue has had its own name, and has the word &quot;Groundling&quot; in the title. Initially one or two revues were performed in a year, increasing to three by the 1990s, and four in 2007, in addition to a special holiday show in December. Main Shows are performed every Friday at 8:00 p.m. and every Saturday at 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.

In 1992, Melanie Graham created &quot;Cookin With Gas&quot;, a weekly short form improv show performed by Groundlings, Groundlings Alumni, Sunday Company members, and special celebrity guests. The show continues to be performed every Thursday night at 8:00 p.m., and is now the longest running improv show in Los Angeles. It was followed in 2001 by the long-form improv &quot;Crazy Uncle Joe Show&quot;, which runs every Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m.

==Creation of &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;==
Beginning in 1981, the company added alternative format shows to the theatre&#x27;s regular line-up. The first one was &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, created and co-written by Paul Reubens as a showcase for his Pee-wee Herman character, which he created in Groundlings workshops and revues. Pee-wee and his friends (played by and co-written by other Groundlings including Phil Hartman, Lynne Marie Stewart, John Paragon, Edie McClurg, and John Moody) started performing Saturdays at midnight, after the regular revues. Quickly the show became a huge LA hit; it moved to The Roxy Theatre on Sunset Blvd and was filmed for an HBO special. In the following years, Pee-wee became a pop culture icon; films, toys, and a children&#x27;s television show were created about the character. An updated revival of the original stage show (with many of the Groundlings reprising their roles) had a successful run in Los Angeles&#x27; Nokia Theatre and in New York on Broadway at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on November 11, 2010. The production was filmed for another HBO Special.

==In popular culture==
Groundlings cast on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Mad TV&quot; have often adapted their sketches and characters developed at the Groundlings into TV audience favorites. Former members of the Groundlings have further developed such materials into shows and films, such as &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark&quot;, &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;, and &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;.
In 1998, the Groundlings were given an improv television program on the F/X network called &quot;Instant Comedy with The Groundlings&quot;. In September 2008, the Groundlings began producing short-form sketch episodes for Crackle.

On September 12, 2011, the Groundlings featured a sketch titled &quot;Resting Bitch Face&quot; (written by Patric Cagle, co-starring Nate Clark, and directed by Mitch Silpa). The sketch was uploaded to YouTube on October 11 and performed repeatedly during fall of the same year.

The film &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; was written by Groundlings alum Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo and featured a cast consisting heavily of members of the Groundlings, including Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and others in supporting roles. The movie was a box office success and nominated for two Academy Awards. In the same year, Groundlings Jim Rash and Nat Faxon won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for &quot;The Descendants&quot;.

==&quot;David Blaine Street Magic&quot;==
In 2006, the Groundlings recorded a skit called &quot;David Blaine Street Magic&quot; performed in the alleyway behind the theater. After being uploaded to YouTube, it became one of the most popular videos on the website. As of October 2014, the video has had more than 38 million views and 60,000 comments since October 12, 2006. The skit stars Mitch Silpa parodying David Blaine in both the topics of Blaine&#x27;s performances and his mannerisms. The skit is written by Michael Naughton and Mikey Day who play the two innocent bystanders in the video.

<text>Chestnut Hill is a neighborhood in the Northwest Philadelphia section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It is known for the high incomes of its residents and high real estate values, as well as its private schools.

==Geography==
===Boundaries===
Chestnut Hill is bounded as follows:
* on the northwest by Northwestern Avenue (a county line and city limit, beyond which lies a panhandle of Springfield Township, Montgomery County that juts into Whitemarsh Township);
* on the west by the Wissahickon Gorge (part of the Fairmount Park system) (beyond which lie Upper Roxborough and Andorra);
* on the northeast by Stenton Avenue (a county line and city limit, beyond which lie Erdenheim and Wyndmoor, both in Springfield Township); and
* on the southeast by the Cresheim Valley (part of Fairmount Park) (beyond which lies Mount Airy).

===ZIP code===
The USPS does not officially correlate neighborhood names to Philadelphia ZIP codes (all are called simply &quot;Philadelphia&quot; or &quot;Phila&quot;). However, the 19118 ZIP code is almost entirely coterminous with the cultural-consensus boundaries of Chestnut Hill.

==History==
The village of Chestnut Hill was part of the German Township laid out by Francis Daniel Pastorius and came to include the settlements originally known as Sommerhausen and Crefeld, as well as part of Cresheim. It served as a gateway between Philadelphia and the nearby farmlands. During the American Revolutionary War era (late 18th century), the area was one of many summer vacation spots due to its higher elevation, 400–500 feet (120 to 150 m) above sea level, and cooler temperatures than the historic Center City. Chestnut Hill is still stereotypically known as one of the more affluent sections of Philadelphia. However, there are many residents who fall within lower/middle class incomes.

Chestnut Hill (along with many other towns and farmlands of Philadelphia County) became part of the City of Philadelphia in 1854 as part of the Act of Consolidation, when the County and the City became completely coterminous. In the same year, the Chestnut Hill Railroad (Chestnut Hill East Line) opened, making an easy commute to and from Center City. In 1884, a second railway line was added by the Philadelphia, Germantown and Chestnut Hill Railroad (Connecting Railway).

During the American Civil War, Chestnut Hill was home to Mower U.S. Army General Hospital, constructed to serve Union army soldiers.

From the mid-19th century through the mid-20th, the neighborhood served as both a &quot;railroad suburb&quot; and a &quot;streetcar suburb&quot; of Center City; although it was part of Philadelphia, it was a leafy outlying part functioning as a bedroom community. The neighborhood contains a wide variety of 19th and early 20th century residential buildings by many of the most prominent Philadelphia architects.

In 1985, the neighborhood was designated as the Chestnut Hill Historic District with the National Register of Historic Places. Citing its natural resources, architectural character, and thoughtful planning, the American Planning Association has recognized it among its Great Places in America.

== Historic and notable architecture ==

==Public transportation==
Public transportation in southeastern Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia and the surrounding counties, is provided by SEPTA, the region&#x27;s mass transit authority.

===Regional rail (commuter rail)===

Two SEPTA Regional Rail commuter train lines serve Chestnut Hill: the Chestnut Hill East Line and Chestnut Hill West Line.

===Buses===
Chestnut Hill is served by SEPTA bus routes from both the City Transit Division (23, 77 and L) and the Suburban Division (94 and 97).

===Trolleys===
Trams in the southeastern Pennsylvania region are known as &quot;trolleys.&quot; The trolley network of this region was very extensive prior to World War II, but has shrunk since that era. Chestnut Hill was formerly served by trolleys. Trolley service to Chestnut Hill began in 1894, and trolley tracks still run down the Belgian-block-paved main street of the neighborhood, Germantown Avenue, which was served by SEPTA Route 23. SEPTA &quot;temporarily suspended&quot; regular trolley service in 1992. From 1992 until 1996, weekend-only service ran between Chestnut Hill and Mount Airy, re-branded The &quot;Chestnut Hill Trolley.&quot; Sporadic trolley charter trips ran down Germantown Avenue and into North Philadelphia until 2003.

In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation completed work on restoring segments of the trolley infrastructure and streetscape in Chestnut Hill, Mount Airy and Germantown. As of 2011, SEPTA spokespeople publicly state that there are no plans to reinstate trolley service on Route 23, despite claims to the contrary in their annual capital budget reports. The dismantling of Route 23 infrastructure is unpopular with a large segment of local residents.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
* Chestnut Hill College

===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public education====

Residents are zoned to schools in the School District of Philadelphia. Students in grades kindergarten through 8 are zoned to John Story Jenks School, while students in grades 9 through 12 are zoned to Roxborough High School.

Students were previously zoned to Germantown High School.

====Private education====
Chestnut Hill is home to several private schools. The Pre-K-12 Springside Chestnut Hill Academy, educates single-sex Pre-K-8 and coed 9–12, formed in 2010 through the merger of Springside School and Chestnut Hill Academy. Other private schools in Chestnut Hill are The Crefeld School (7-12), and the K-8 Norwood-Fontbonne Academy. Nearby private schools in adjacent neighborhoods that attract some Chestnut Hill residents include Germantown Friends School, William Penn Charter School, and Germantown Academy.

===Public libraries===

Free Library of Philadelphia operates the Chestnut Hill Branch at 8711 Germantown Avenue.

==Parks, arboretums, and recreation==
* Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania
* Pastorius Park
* Wissahickon Valley Park of the Fairmount Park system

The community previously held the Chestnut Hill Harry Potter Festival, but in 2018 the event was canceled since the copyright owners cracked down on for-profit uses of the brand. In 2017 there were 50,000 attendees to that year&#x27;s 7th annual event.

In 2019, the festival resumed as the Witches &amp; Wizards Festival.

<doc id="292664" wikidata="Q2837746" url="?curid=292664" title="Allan MacNab">
<text>Sir Allan Napier MacNab, 1st Baronet (19 February 1798 – 8 August 1862) was a Canadian political leader, land speculator and property investor, lawyer, soldier, and militia commander who served in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada twice (representing a different county – Wentworth and Hamilton – each time), the Legislative Assembly for the Province of Canada once, and served as joint Premier of the Province of Canada from 1854 to 1856. MacNab was &quot;likely the largest land speculator in Upper Canada during his time&quot; as mentioned both in his official biography in retrospect and in 1842 by Sir Charles Bagot.

MacNab was a member of the Family Compact in Upper Canada. He briefly shared a military regiment (the 49th Regiment of Foot) with another member (James FitzGibbon) in the War of 1812. MacNab was left out of the regiment following regimental cuts after the War of 1812, and found employment in the law office of another Family Compact member&#x27;s grandfather – George D&#x27;Arcy Boulton (aka D&#x27;Arcy Boulton Sr.)

==Early life==
He was born in Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) to Allan MacNab and Anne Napier (daughter of Captain Peter William Napier, R.N., the commissioner of the port and harbour of Quebec). When MacNab was a one year old, he was baptized in the Anglican church in St. Mark&#x27;s Parish of Newark. His father was a lieutenant in the 71st Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Rangers under Lt-Col. John Graves Simcoe. After the Queen&#x27;s Rangers were disbanded, the family moved around the country in search of work and eventually settled in York (now Toronto), where MacNab was educated at the Home District Grammar School.

==War of 1812==
As a fourteen-year-old boy, MacNab fought in the War of 1812. He probably served at the Battle of York and certainly in the Canadian forlorn hope that headed the Anglo-Canadian assault on Fort Niagara. The twenty local men eliminated two American pickets of twenty men each with the bayonet before taking part in the final assault. Captain Kerby, of the Incorporated Militia Battalion, was reportedly the first man into the fort.

==Legal and business career==
After his service in the War of 1812, MacNab studied law in Toronto under (at the time) Judge George D&#x27;Arcy Boulton, where MacNab &quot;took nearly twice the average time to qualify at the bar was a result of his inadequate education and his preference for active work&quot;. MacNab was admitted to the bar in 1824, and called to the bar in 1826. In 1826, MacNab moved from York to Hamilton, where he established a successful law office, but it was chiefly by land speculation that he made his fortune. There was no Anglican church in Hamilton yet, so MacNab attended a Presbyterian church until Christ Church was established in 1835.

A successful entrepreneur as well as politician, MacNab, with Glasgow merchant Peter Buchanan, was responsible for the construction of the Great Western Railway of Ontario. MacNab also served on several boards, including as a board member of the Beacon Fire and Life Insurance Co. of London alongside prominent financier Thomas Clarkson.

Following an amount of &quot;liberal credit&quot; rewarded from the Bank of Upper Canada regarding legislative assistance given by MacNab, and his own cash reserves, MacNab sought to own land. By May 1832, MacNab owned &quot;some 2000 acres of wild land in London, Gore, and Newcastle districts&quot;. The amount increased and by 1835 MacNab had &quot;cornered much of the best land in the centre of expanding Hamilton&quot;. MacNab&#x27;s land holdings fluctuated often, and their total value at any one time is unknown, but in a suggestion of just how massive the amounts of land and sales were, Charles Bagot stated in 1842 that MacNab was &quot;a huge proprietor of land – perhaps the largest in the country&quot;. This is stated in MacNab&#x27;s biography as &quot;probably true&quot;.

MacNab&#x27;s land purchases (especially in the early 1830s) placed financial strain on MacNab initially, but proved to be worth it in the long run. In one scenario, MacNab purchased a piece of land in November 1832 located in Burlington Heights from J. S. Cartwright for 2500 pounds – 500 more than MacNab wanted – where MacNab saw the &quot;symbol of his social aspirations&quot; built: the opulent and luxury 72-room Dundurn Castle. On the day of the sale for the land, between 5000 and 10000 pounds of fire damage ravaged MacNab&#x27;s Hamilton projects.

MacNab could prove to be unethical but effective with his business career: case in point is MacNab being some three years behind in payments for an extremely important creditor named Samuel Peters Jarvis, and after some three years time MacNab stated he would not pay Jarvis back for this credit as Jarvis &quot;owed MacNab for past services&quot;. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but Jarvis simply stated MacNab as one word for this – villain.

==Upper Canada Rebellion, 1837==

Before the Rebellion broke out, MacNab argued for increased American immigration as &quot;they are a useful and enterprising people and if admitted would be of great advantage to the country&quot; in 1837. Again before the Rebellion, MacNab was appointed as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 4th Regiment of the Gore militia in May 1830, partly through the influence of the Chisholm family of Oakville.

MacNab opposed the reform movement in Upper Canada that was led by William Lyon Mackenzie. When Mackenzie led the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837, MacNab was part of the force of British regular troops and Upper Canada militia that moved against Mackenzie at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern in Toronto on 7 December, dispersing Mackenzie&#x27;s rebels in less than an hour.

MacNab in turn for the victory at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern was awarded sole command of troops sent to London District by Lieutenant Governor Sir Francis Bond Head and led a militia of his own against the rebels marching towards Toronto from London, led by Charles Duncombe. Duncombe&#x27;s men also dispersed when they learned that MacNab was waiting for them, but the quality of MacNab&#x27;s leadership was nonetheless regarded as &quot;mixed&quot;. There were &quot;extreme problems&quot; in communication, procuring supplies, and controlling the volunteers, along with MacNab ignoring basic operational procedures. MacNab was given 250 troops but ultimately had some 1500 men assembled total, as MacNab argued &quot;as early as December 14&quot;.

Mackenzie fled to the United States following his defeat at the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern on 7 December, and return to Canada on 13 December, occupying Navy island, with increased American sympathy. MacNab was dispatched by Sir Bond Head on Christmas Day (25 December 1837) to command the troops in Niagara with support from both naval forces and regular officers. MacNab saw himself alternating between &quot;drilling or dining&quot; for about 4 to 5 days as &quot;supplies and billeting were inadequate and orders were vague&quot; regarding command centers in Toronto and Montreal. Moreover, there were contradictory reports coming to both Head and MacNab regarding the amount of American supplies and the strength and morale of Mackenzie&#x27;s new rebel force, and Head refused to sanction Navy island but offered no other alternatives. There were some 2000 raw and reckless volunteers amassed as troops by 29 December 29.

29 December proved to be important to MacNab as two attacks happened against Mackenzie&#x27;s forces on 29 December under MacNab&#x27;s command: a dawn attack and a dusk attack. The first attack proved how little discipline the officers had under MacNab, how little control MacNab had over them, and how weak the line of command was, and the second attack showed how reckless MacNab could be if his position as &quot;commander&quot; was stood up. The dawn (first) attack was not sanctioned or ordered by MacNab and was the result of a group of particularly bibulous officers and the event nearly ended in disaster. The second (dusk) attack however both ended in disaster and was the result of MacNab&#x27;s order. MacNab and Captain Andrew Drew, a retired officer of the Royal Navy, commanding a party of militia, acting on information and guidance from Alexander McLeod, attacked Mackenzie&#x27;s supply ship at Navy Island, an American ship called the Caroline. The sinking of the &quot;SS Caroline&quot; happened in American waters and saw an American citizen killed – the stakes became raised and the reaction was swift and immediate. The event became known as the Caroline affair. The affair saw MacNab indicted for murder in Erie County, New York, and subsequently replaced by Colonel Hughes, taking MacNab&#x27;s post of Commander in Niagara. However, before leaving the frontier MacNab protested that Hughes would be the one to receive &quot;all the credit&quot; whilst MacNab and the militia had done &quot;all the drudgery&quot;. Later, MacNab quitted the Niagara frontier on 14 January 1838. There were some 3500 troops amassed only four days before. On the evening of 14 January, Mackenzie and his force slipped off the island and Hughes (MacNab&#x27;s replacement) was occupying Navy island as MacNab was lobbying in Toronto for his command position back.

During the Rebellions, MacNab appreciated &quot;degrees of involvement&quot; with rebel forces in that he jailed &quot;only the rebel leaders&quot; under his own initiative and saw the &quot;common followers&quot; of the rebels as people who were &quot;deceived&quot;, even promising clemency to some. MacNab also shared a common philosophy in his own troops, believing that officers earn the respect of their subordinates &quot;not only through courage in war but also by tempering strict justice with kindness and approachability off the battlefield&quot;.

In 1838, Macnab was knighted for his zeal in suppressing the rebellion.

In 1860, Macnab was appointed an honorary colonel in the British army, and aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria.

==Political career==
MacNab represented Hamilton in Parliament from 1830 until his death in 1862, first in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada (1830–1840), then in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada (1841–1860), and finally in the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada representing the Western Division (1860–1862). He was joint Premier of the province from 1854 to 1856.

In 1829, MacNab refused to testify before a House of Assembly committee which was investigating the hanging of an effigy of Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne, chaired by Reformer W. W. Baldwin. MacNab was subsequently sentenced to jail for 10 days by the House of Assembly, following apparent &quot;prodding&quot; from William Lyon Mackenzie. MacNab returned to the public as a &quot;Tory martyr&quot;, and effectively utilized/exploited this image to defeat the Reformers in Wentworth County and secure the political victory for both he and John Willson.

In April 1833, MacNab secured the appointment of the land registrar of Wentworth for his brother David Archibald. This was important as whoever controlled this office could &quot;quietly acquire choice and undeveloped land in the Wentworth area without a need for a public auction&quot;. This benefitted MacNab as a land speculator as &quot;he had gained a seemingly impregnable hold over Wentworth’s land development and, as a result, a firm grip on the county’s commercial and political future&quot; due to appointing his brother.

MacNab came under public scrutiny when he was ousted as president of the Desjardins Canal Company in 1834, after having mortgaged a large block of personal land as security for a government loan to the company in 1832.

MacNab committed a breach of privilege and was arrested by the sergeant-at-arms during the 10th Parliament of Upper Canada after a motion by the legislative assembly. MacNab retaliated by seconding a motion in December 1831 which was accusing William Lyon Mackenzie of breach of privilege and motioned for him to be expelled from the house on the grounds of libel. The motion failed after Tory legislators feared the political backlash of supporting an obscure parliamentary privilege. This was the first of five expulsions, MacNab active in all of them.

MacNab acted as a &quot;spearhead&quot; in the political attacks against Mackenzie (because of his involvement in all five expulsions) and this was beneficial for MacNab, causing him to gain power within the Assembly and maintain a solid link with the members of so-called &quot;Tory York&quot;. This was beneficial for the Tories in Canada regarding their control of power in the Upper Canadian commercial and economic sectors, as MacNab acted as bridge for all members to communicate with each other, whereas previously there was only &quot;intra-party maneuverings&quot;. This &quot;intra-party struggle&quot; was most evident and apparent when it came to banks and land speculation.

MacNab was a &quot;Compact Tory&quot; – a supporter of the Family Compact which had controlled Upper Canada prior to the union of the Canadas. In the first Parliament of the new Province of Canada, he supported the principle of union, but was an opponent of the Governor General, Sydenham, and his policy of creating a government with a broad base of moderate supporters in the Assembly. He opposed the policy of the &quot;Ultra Reformers&quot; to implement responsible government.

MacNab only partly encompassed the Tory ideology in Canada and was not a religious elitist: MacNab supported all denominations (plus Catholics) in having an equal share to the proceeds from the clergy reserves, MacNab often attended a Presbyterian church whilst being Anglican, MacNab married a Catholic in his second marriage, and opposed Orangeman Ogle Robert Gowan partly because of how strong his Protestant stance was.

Although MacNab received the title of &quot;Baronet&quot; through a baronetcy patronage by Sir Edmund Walker Head in July 1856, the action was nearly entirely the result of Head&#x27;s &quot;sympathetic recommendation&quot; over any sort of rewarded action.

When Parliament met at Montreal, MacNab took apartments there at Donegana&#x27;s Hotel.

==Family==
MacNab was married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth Brooke, who died 5 November 1826, possibly of complications following childbirth. Together, they had two children.

He married his second wife, Mary, who died 8 May 1846 and was a Catholic; she was the daughter of John Stuart, Sheriff of the Johnstown District, Ontario. The couple&#x27;s two daughters, Sophia and Minnie, were raised as Catholics.

The couple&#x27;s elder daughter, Sophia, was born at Hamilton. She married at Dundurn Castle, Hamilton, on 15 November 1855, William Keppel, Viscount Bury, afterwards the 7th Earl of Albemarle, who died in 1894. Sophia was the mother of Arnold Keppel, 8th Earl of Albemarle (born in London, England, 1 June 1858), and of eight other children. One of her sons, the Honourable Derek Keppel, served as Equerry to The Duke of York after 1893 and was in Canada with His Royal Highness, in 1901 at 53 Lowndes Square, London, S. W., England. Another of her sons, George Keppel, was married to Alice Keppel, a mistress of Edward VII, and great-grandmother of Queen Camilla, wife of Charles III.

==Death==
MacNab died at his home, Dundurn Castle, in Hamilton. His deathbed conversion to Catholicism caused a furore in the press in the following days. The &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; and the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; expressed strong doubts about the conversion, and the Anglican rector of Christ Church declared that MacNab died a Protestant.

However, MacNab&#x27;s Catholic baptism is recorded at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Hamilton, at the hands of John Farrell, Bishop of Hamilton, on 7 August 1862.

When the 12th Chief of Clan Macnab died, he bequeathed all his heirlooms to MacNab, whom he considered the next Chief. When the latter&#x27;s son was killed in a shooting accident in Canada, the position of Chief of Clan Macnab passed to the Macnabs of Arthurstone.

==Legacy==
MacNab Street and Sir Allan MacNab Secondary School in Hamilton, Ontario are both named after him.

Dundurn Castle, his stately Italianate style home in Hamilton, is open to the public.

A ship was named &quot;Sir Allan MacNab&quot; and was sturdily built in Canada but was not altogether designed for speed. The master in 1855 was Captain Cherry, and the tonnage of the ship was 840, then quite large.

<text>Curt Carl Alfred von Bardeleben (4 March 1861 – 31 January 1924) was a German chess master, journalist, and member of the German nobility.

==Biography==
Curt von Bardeleben started playing chess when he was ten years old and quickly developed into one of the strongest players in Weimar. Originally a student of law, Bardeleben gave it up in order to become a professional chess player. He later quit competitive chess for four years between 1883 and 1887 to complete his law studies. He recorded some fine tournament results, especially in the 1880s and 1890s. Although his later chess career was spotty, he continued to be a strong player. In 1908 he lost a match to future world champion Alexander Alekhine, who described him as &quot;a charming old chap&quot; but also said he lacked the will to win. Bardeleben was married three times in the early 1900s, supposedly to women who wanted his title of nobility. He was described thus by Edward Lasker: 
He always wore a black cut-away suit of dubious vintage. Apparently he could never spare enough money to buy a new suit, although I learned one day that at fairly regular intervals he received comparatively large sums – from one to several thousand marks – through the simple expedient of marrying, and shortly after, divorcing, some lady who craved the distinction of his noble name and was willing to pay for it. Unfortunately, when he received his reward, it was usually far exceeded by the amount of the debts he had accumulated since his last divorce. Evil tongues had it that the number of the ladies involved in these brief marital interludes had grown so alarmingly that they could easily have made up a Sultan&#x27;s harem.
Bardeleben tied for first place with Fritz Riemann at Leipzig 1888, tied for first place with Carl August Walbrodt at Kiel 1893, was first at Berlin (SV Centrum) 1897, and tied for first place with Carl Schlechter and Rudolf Swiderski at Coburg 1904. He edited the magazine &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot; from 1887 through 1891. Bardeleben seemingly committed suicide by jumping out of a window in 1924. According to one obituary, however, he fell out by accident. His life and death have been cited as an inspiration for the main character in the novel &quot;The Defense&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov, which was made into the movie &quot;The Luzhin Defence&quot;.

==Game vs. Steinitz==

Bardeleben is perhaps best known for the game he lost to the former world champion Wilhelm Steinitz at Hastings 1895, especially because he simply walked out of the tournament room instead of resigning. Although he was sharing the second place in the tournament before this game (7.5 in 9 rounds, Mikhail Chigorin had the lead with 8), he achieved only 4 points in the final 12 rounds. The game against Steinitz:

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5 cxd5 18. Nd4 Kf7 19. Ne6 Rhc8 20. Qg4 g6 21. Ng5+ Ke8 22. Rxe7+ Kf8 23. Rf7+ Kg8 24. Rg7+ 1-0

<doc id="292676" wikidata="Q148540" url="?curid=292676" title="Republic of Florence">
<text>The Republic of Florence (; Old Italian: &quot;Republica di Fiorenza&quot;), known officially as the Florentine Republic, was a medieval and early modern state that was centered on the Italian city of Florence in Tuscany, Italy. The republic originated in 1115, when the Florentine people rebelled against the Margraviate of Tuscany upon the death of Matilda of Tuscany, who controlled vast territories that included Florence. The Florentines formed a commune in his successors&#x27; place. The republic was ruled by a council known as the Signoria of Florence. The signoria was chosen by the (titular ruler of the city), who was elected every two months by Florentine guild members.

During the Republic&#x27;s history, Florence was an important cultural, economic, political and artistic force in Europe. Its coin, the florin, was the dominant trade coin of Western Europe for large scale transactions and became widely imitated throughout the continent. During the Republican period, Florence was also the birthplace of the Renaissance, which is considered a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political and economic &quot;rebirth&quot;.

The republic had a checkered history of coups and countercoups against various factions. The Medici faction gained governance of the city in 1434 under Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. The Medici kept control of Florence until 1494. Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, who later became Pope Leo X, reconquered the republic in 1512.

Florence repudiated Medici authority for a second time in 1527, during the War of the League of Cognac. The Medici reassumed their rule in 1531 after an 11-month siege of the city, aided by Emperor Charles V. Pope Clement VII, himself a Medici, appointed his relative Alessandro de&#x27; Medici as the first &quot;Duke of the Florentine Republic&quot;, thereby transforming the Republic into a hereditary monarchy.

The second duke, Cosimo I, established a strong Florentine navy and expanded his territory, conquering Siena. In 1569, the pope declared Cosimo the first grand duke of Tuscany. The Medici ruled the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until 1737.

==Background==

The city of Florence was established in 59 BC by Julius Caesar. Since 846 AD, the city had been part of the Marquisate of Tuscany. After Margravine Matilda of Tuscany died in 1115, the city did not submit readily to her successor, Rabodo (r. 1116–1119), who was killed in a dispute with the city.

It is not known precisely when Florence formed its own republican/oligarchical government independent of the marquisate, although the death of Rabodo in 1119 should be a turning point. The first official mention of the Florentine republic was in 1138, when several cities around Tuscany formed a league against the then-margrave of Tuscany, Duke Henry X of Bavaria. The country was nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire.

According to a study carried out by Enrico Faini of the University of Florence, there were about fifteen old aristocratic families who moved to Florence between 1000 and 1100: Amidei; Ardinghi; Brunelleschi; Buondelmonti; Caponsacchi; Donati; Fifanti; Gherardini of Montagliari; Guidi; Nerli; Porcelli; Sacchetti; Scolari; Uberti; and Visdomini.

==History==
===12th century===
The newly independent Florence prospered in the 12th century through extensive trade with foreign countries. This, in turn, provided a platform for the demographic growth of the city, which mirrored the rate of construction of churches and palazzi. This prosperity was shattered when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa invaded the Italian peninsula in 1185. As a result, the margraves of Tuscany reacquired Florence and its townlands. The Florentines reasserted their independence when Emperor Henry VI died in 1197.

===13th century===
Florence&#x27;s population continued to grow into the 13th century, reaching 30,000 inhabitants. As has been said, the extra inhabitants supported the city&#x27;s trade and vice versa. Several new bridges and churches were built, most prominently the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, begun in 1294. The buildings from this era serve as Florence&#x27;s best examples of Gothic Architecture. Politically, Florence was barely able to maintain peace between its competing factions. The precarious peace that existed at the beginning of the century was destroyed in 1216 when two factions, known as the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, went to war. The Ghibellines were supporters of the noble rulers of Florence, whereas the Guelphs were populists.

The Ghibellines, who had ruled the city under Frederick of Antioch since 1244, were deposed in 1250 by the Guelphs. The Guelphs led Florence to prosper further. Their primarily mercantile orientation soon became evident in one of their earliest achievements: the introduction of a new coin, the florin, in 1252. It was widely used beyond Florence&#x27;s borders due to its reliable, fixed gold content and soon became one of the common currencies of Europe and the Near East. The same year saw the creation of the Palazzo del Popolo. The Guelphs lost the reins of power after Florence suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Montaperti against Siena in 1260. The Ghibellines resumed power and undid many of the advances of the Guelphs, for example the demolition of hundreds of towers, homes, and palaces. The fragility of their rule caused the Ghibellines to seek out an arbitrator in the form of Pope Clement IV, who openly favoured the Guelphs, and restored them to power.

The Florentine economy reached a zenith in the latter half of the 13th century, and its success was reflected by the building of the famed Palazzo della Signoria, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio. The Florentine townlands were divided into administrative districts in 1292. In 1293, the Ordinances of Justice were enacted, which effectively became the constitution of the republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance. The city&#x27;s numerous luxurious palazzi were becoming surrounded by townhouses built by the ever prospering merchant class. In 1298, the Bonsignori family of Siena, one of the leading banking families of Europe, went bankrupt, and the city of Siena lost its status as the most prominent banking center of Europe to Florence.

===14th century===
In 1304, the war between the Ghibellines and the Guelphs led to a great fire that destroyed much of the city. Napier gives the following account:

The golden florin of the Republic of Florence was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities to play a significant commercial role since the 7th century. As many Florentine banks were international companies with branches across Europe, the florin quickly became the dominant trade coin of Western Europe for large scale transactions, replacing silver bars in multiples of the mark.

In fact, with the collapse of the Bonsignori family, several new banking families sprang up in Florence: the Bardis, Peruzzis and the Acciaioli. The friction between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines did not cease, authority still passed between the two frequently.

Florence&#x27;s reign as the foremost banking city of Europe did not last long; the aforesaid families were bankrupt in 1340, not because of Edward III of England&#x27;s refusal to pay his debts, as is often stated (the debt was just £13,000) but because of a Europe-wide economic recession. While the banks perished, Florentine literature flourished, and Florence was home to some of the greatest writers in Italian history: Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. They were Europe&#x27;s first vernacular writers, choosing the Tuscan dialect of Italian (which, as a result, evolved into the standard Italian language) over Latin.

Florence was hit hard by the Black Death. Having originated in the Orient, the plague arrived in Messina in 1347. The plague devastated Europe, robbing it of an estimated one-third of its population. This, combined with the economic downturn, took its toll on the city-state. The ensuing collapse of the feudal system changed the social composition of Europe forever; it was one of the first steps out of the Middle Ages.
The war with Avignon papacy strained the regime. In 1378 discontented wool workers revolted. The Ciompi revolt, as it is known, established a revolutionary commune. In 1382 the wealthier classes crushed the seeds of rebellion.

The famous Medici bank was established by Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici in October 1397. The bank continued to exist (albeit in an extremely diminished form) until the time of Ferdinando II de&#x27;Medici in the 17th century. But, for now, Giovanni&#x27;s bank flourished.

Beginning in 1389, Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan expanded his dominion into the Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia and Tuscany. During this period Florence, under the leadership of Maso degli Albizzi and Niccolò da Uzzano was involved in three wars with Milan (1390–92, 1397–98, 1400–02). The Florentine army, commanded by John Hawkwood, contained the Milanese during the first war. The second war started in March 1397. Milanese troops devastated the Florentine &quot;contado&quot;, but were checked in August of that year.

The war expenses exceeded one million florins and necessitated tax raises and forced loans. A peace agreement in May 1398 was brokered by Venice, but left the struggle unresolved. Over the next two years Florentine control of Tuscany and Umbria collapsed. Pisa and Siena as well as a number of smaller cities submitted to Gian Galeazzo, while Lucca withdrew from the anti-Visconti league, with Bologna remaining the only major ally. In November 1400 a conspiracy involving both exiles and internal opponents was uncovered. Two Ricci were implicated as leaders of a plot to eliminate the regime&#x27;s inner circle and open the gates to the Milanese. Confessions indicated that the plan had wide support among the elites, including a Medici and several of the Alberti.

The republic bankrolled the emperor-elect Rupert. However, he was defeated by the Milanese in the fall of 1401. Visconti then turned to Bologna. On 26 June 1402, combined Bolognese-Florentine forces were routed at Casalecchio, near Bologna, which was taken on the 30th. The road to Tuscany was open. However, Florence was saved after an outbreak of plague had spread from Tuscany to Emilia and Lombardy: Gian Galeazzo died from it on 3 September 1402.

===15th century===

The Visconti domains were divided between three heirs. Gabriele Maria Visconti sold Pisa to the Republic of Florence for 200,000 florins. Since the Pisans did not intend to voluntarily submit to their long-time rivals, the army under Maso degli Albizzi took Pisa on 9 October 1406 after a long siege, that was accompanied by numerous atrocities.

The state authorities had been approached by the Duchy of Milan in 1422, with a treaty, that prohibited Florence&#x27;s interference with Milan&#x27;s impending war with the Republic of Genoa. Florence obliged, but Milan disregarded its own treaty and occupied a Florentine border town. The conservative government wanted war, while the people bemoaned such a stance as they would be subject to enormous tax increases. The republic went to war with Milan, and won, upon the Republic of Venice&#x27;s entry on their side. The war was concluded in 1427, and the Visconti of Milan were forced to sign an unfavourable treaty.

The debt incurred during the war was gargantuan, approximately 4,200,000 florins. To pay, the state had to change the tax system. The current &quot;estimo&quot; system was replaced with the catasto. The &quot;catasto&quot; was based on a citizen&#x27;s entire wealth, while the &quot;estimo&quot; was simply a form of income tax. Apart from war, Filippo Brunelleschi created the renowned dome of the Santa Maria del Fiore, which astounded contemporaries and modern observers alike.

====Medicis&#x27; rule====
The son of Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici succeeded his father as the head of the Medici Bank. He played a prominent role in the government of Florence until his exile in 1433, after a disastrous war with Tuscany&#x27;s neighbour, the Republic of Lucca. Cosimo&#x27;s exile in Venice lasted for less than a year, when the people of Florence overturned Cosimo&#x27;s exile in a democratic vote. Cosimo returned to the acclaim of his people and the banishment of the Albizzi family, who had exiled him.

=====Cosimo de&#x27; Medici=====

The Renaissance began during Cosimo&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; rule of Florence, the seeds of which had arguably been laid before the Black Death tore through Europe. Niccolò Niccoli was the leading Florence humanist scholar of the time. He appointed the first Professor of Greek, Manuel Chrysoloras (the founder of Hellenic studies in Italy), at the University of Florence in 1397. Niccoli was a keen collector of ancient manuscripts, which he bequeathed to Cosimo upon his death in 1437. Poggio Bracciolini succeeded Niccoli as the principal humanist of Florence. Bracciolini was born Arezzo in 1380. He toured Europe, searching for more ancient Greco-Roman manuscripts for Niccoli. Unlike his employer, Bracciolini also authored his own works. He was made the Chancellor of Florence shortly before his death, by Cosimo, who was his best friend.
Florence hosted the Great Ecumenical Council in 1439; this council was launched in an attempt to reconcile the Byzantine Eastern Orthodox Church with Roman Catholicism. Pope Eugenius IV convened it in reply to a cry for assistance from the Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) John VIII Palaiologos. John VIII&#x27;s empire was slowly being devoured by the Ottoman Turks.The council was a huge boost to Florence&#x27;s international prestige. The council deliberated until July 1439. Both parties had reached a compromise, and the Pope agreed to militarily aid the Byzantine Emperor. However, upon John VIII&#x27;s homecoming to Constantinople, the Greeks rejected the compromise, leading to riots throughout what remained of the Byzantine Empire. John VIII was forced to repudiate the agreement with the Roman church to appease the rioters. As a result, no Western aid was forthcoming and the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s fate was sealed. Fourteen years later in 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans.

Cosimo&#x27;s fervent patronage transformed Florence into the epitome of a Renaissance city. He employed Donatello, Brunelleschi, and Michelozzo. All these artistic commissions cost Cosimo over 600,000 florins.

Foreign relations, both as a backdrop to Cosimo&#x27;s rise to power and during the first twenty years of his rule, were dominated by the Wars in Lombardy. This series of conflicts between the Venetian Republic and the Duchy of Milan for hegemony in Northern Italy lasted from 1423 to 1454 and involved a number of Italian states, that occasionally switched sides according to their changing interests. Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan invaded Florence twice in the 1430s, and again in 1440, but his army was finally defeated in the battle of Anghiari. The Milanese invasions were largely instigated by the exiled Albizzi family. Death of Filippo Maria in 1447 led to a major change in the alliances. In 1450 Cosimo&#x27;s current ally Francesco Sforza established himself as the Duke of Milan. Florentine trade interests made her support Sforza&#x27;s Milan in the war against Venice, while the fall of Constantinople in 1453 dealt a blow to Venetian finances. Eventually, the Peace of Lodi recognized Venetian and Florentine territorial gains and the legitimacy of the Sforza rule in Milan. The Milan-Florence alliance played a major role in stabilizing the peninsula for the next 40 years.

The political crisis of 1458 was the first serious challenge to the Medici rule. The cost of wars had been borne by the great families of Florence, and disproportionately so by Medici&#x27;s opponents. A number of them (Serragli, Baroncelli, Mancini, Vespucci, Gianni) were practically ruined and had to sell their properties, and those were acquired by Medici&#x27;s partisans at bargain prices. The opposition used partial relaxation of Medici control of the republic institutions to demand political reforms, freedom of speech in the councils and a greater share in the decision-making. Medici&#x27;s party response was to use threats of force from private armies and Milanese troops and arranging a popular assembly dominated by Cosimo&#x27;s supporters. It exiled the opponents of the regime and introduced the open vote in councils, &quot;in order to unmask the anti-Medician rebels&quot;.

From 1458 Cosimo withdrew from any official public role, but his control of Florence was greater than ever. In the spring of 1459 he entertained the new pope Pius II, who stopped in Florence on his way to the Council of Mantua to declare a crusade against the Ottomans, and Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Francesco&#x27;s son, who was to escort the pope from Florence to Mantua. In his memoirs, Pius said that Cosimo &quot;was considered the arbiter of war and peace, the regulator of law; less a citizen than master of his city. Political councils were held in his home; the magistrates he chose were elected; he was king in all but name and legal status…. Some asserted that his tyranny was intolerable.&quot;

=====Piero de&#x27; Medici=====

Piero the Gouty was the eldest son of Cosimo. Piero, as his sobriquet &quot;the gouty&quot; implies, suffered from gout and did not enjoy good health. Lorenzo the Magnificent was Piero&#x27;s eldest son by his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni. Piero&#x27;s reign furthered the always fractious political divisions of Florence when he had called up huge debts owed to the Medici Bank. These debts were owed primarily by a Florentine nobleman, Luca Pitti. Lucca called for an armed insurrection against Piero, but a co-conspirator rebutted this. Duke Francesco Sforza of Milan died in 1466, and his son Galeazzo Maria Sforza became the new Milanese duke. With the death of Francesco Sforza, Florence lost a valuable ally among the other Italian states.

In August 1466, the conspirators acted. They received support from the Duke of Ferrara, who marched troops into the Florentine countryside with the intent of deposing Piero. The coup failed. The Florentines were not willing to support it, and soon after their arrival, Ferrara&#x27;s troops left the city. The conspirators were exiled for life. While the internal problems were fixed, Venice took the opportunity to invade Florentine territory in 1467. Piero appointed Federigo da Montefeltro, Lord of Urbino, to command his mercenaries. An inconclusive battle ensued, with the Venetians forces retreating. In the winter of 1469 Piero died.

=====Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici=====
Lorenzo succeeded his father, Piero. Lorenzo, as heir, was accordingly groomed by his father to rule over Florence.

Lorenzo was the greatest artistic patron of the Renaissance. He patronised Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Botticelli, among others. During Lorenzo&#x27;s reign, the Renaissance truly descended on Florence. Lorenzo commissioned a multitude of amazing pieces of art and also enjoyed collecting fine gems. Lorenzo had many children with his wife Clarice Orsini, including the future Pope Leo X and his eventual successor in Florence, Piero the Unfortunate.

Lorenzo&#x27;s brother Giuliano was killed before his own eyes in the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478. This plot was instigated by the Pazzi family. The coup was unsuccessful, and the conspirators were executed in a very violent manner. The scheme was supported by the Archbishop of Pisa, Francesco Salviati, who was also executed in his ceremonial robes. News of this sacrilege reached Pope Sixtus IV (who had also supported the conspiracy against the Medicis). Sixtus IV was &quot;outraged&quot; and excommunicated everyone in Florence. Sixtus sent a papal delegation to Florence to arrest Lorenzo. The people of Florence were obviously enraged by the Pope&#x27;s actions, and the local clergy too. The populace refused to resign Lorenzo to the papal delegation. A war followed, which lasted for two years until Lorenzo tactfully went about diplomatically securing a peace. Lorenzo died in 1492 and was succeeded by his son Piero.

=====Piero &#x27;the Unfortunate&#x27;=====

Piero ruled Florence for a mere two years. Charles VIII of France invaded Italy in September 1494. He demanded passage through Florence to Naples, where he intended to secure the throne for himself. Piero met Charles at the fringes of Florence to try and negotiate. Piero capitulated to all Charles&#x27; demands, and upon arriving back in the city in November, he was branded as a traitor. He was forced to flee the republic with his family.

====Savonarola====
After the fall of the Medici, Girolamo Savonarola ruled the state. Savonarola was a priest from Ferrara. He came to Florence in the 1480s. By proclaiming predictions and through vigorous preaching, he won the people to his cause. Savonarola&#x27;s new government ushered in democratic reforms. It allowed many exiles back into Florence, who were banished by the Medici. Savonarola&#x27;s ulterior goal, however, was to transform Florence into a &quot;city of God&quot;. Florentines stopped wearing garish colours, and many women took oaths to become nuns. Savonarola became most famous for his &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, where he ordered all &quot;vanities&quot; to be gathered and burned. These included wigs, perfume, paintings, and ancient pagan manuscripts. Savonarola&#x27;s rule collapsed a year later. He was excommunicated by Pope Alexander VI in late 1497. In the same year, Florence embarked on a war with Pisa, which had been &quot;de facto&quot; independent since Charles VIII&#x27;s invasion three years before. The endeavour failed miserably, and this led to food shortages. That, in turn, led to a few isolated cases of the plague. The people blamed Savonarola for their woes, and he was tortured and executed in the Piazza della Signoria by being burned at the stake by Florentine authorities, in May 1498.

===16th century===
====Piero Soderini====

In 1502, the Florentines chose Piero Soderini as their first ruler for life. Soderini succeeded where Savonarola had failed, when the Secretary of War, Niccolò Machiavelli, recaptured Pisa in 1509. It was at this time that Machiavelli introduced a standing army in Florence, replacing the traditional use of hired mercenaries.

====Giovanni de&#x27; Medici====

Soderini was repudiated in September 1512, when Cardinal Giovanni de&#x27; Medici captured Florence with Papal troops during the War of the League of Cambrai. The Medici rule of Florence was thus restored.
Soon after retaking Florence, Cardinal Giovanni de&#x27; Medici was recalled to Rome. Pope Julius II had just died, and he needed to be present for the ensuing Papal conclave. Giovanni was elected Pope, taking the name Leo X. This effectively brought the Papal States and Florence into a political union. Leo X ruled Florence by proxy, first appointing his brother Giuliano de&#x27; Medici to rule in his stead, and then in 1516, replacing Giuliano with his cousin, Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici.

Lorenzo II&#x27;s government proved unpopular in Florence. According to U.S. President and historian John Adams, &quot;at this time the citizens of the state of Florence were in secret very discontented, because the Duke Lorenzo, desiring to reduce the government to the form of a principality, appeared to disdain to consult any longer with the magistrates and his fellow-citizens as he used to do, and gave audiences very seldom, and with much impatience; he attended less to the business of the city, and caused all public affairs to be managed by Messer Goro da Pistoia, his secretary.&quot; In 1519, Lorenzo died from syphilis, shortly before his wife gave birth to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, the future Queen of France.

====Giulio de&#x27; Medici====
Following the death of Lorenzo II, Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici governed Florence until 1523, when he was elected Pope Clement VII. U.S. President John Adams later characterized his administration of Florence as &quot;very successful and frugal.&quot; Adams chronicles Cardinal Giulio as having &quot;reduced the business of the magistrates, elections, customs of office, and the mode of expenditure of public money, in such a manner that it produced a great and universal joy among the citizens.&quot;

On the death of Pope Leo X in 1521, Adams writes there was a &quot;ready inclination in all of the principal citizens [of Florence], and a universal desire among the people, to maintain the state in the hands of the Cardinal de&#x27; Medici; and all this felicity arose from his good government, which since the death of the Duke Lorenzo, had been universally agreeable.&quot;

When Cardinal Giulio was elected Pope Clement VII, he appointed Ippolito de&#x27; Medici and Alessandro de&#x27; Medici to rule Florence, under the guardianship of Cardinal Passerini. Ippolito was the son of Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, while Alessandro was allegedly the son of Clement VII. Cardinal Passerini&#x27;s regency government proved highly unpopular.

In May 1527, Rome was sacked by the Holy Roman Empire. The city was destroyed, and Pope Clement VII was imprisoned. During the tumult, a faction of Republicans drove out the Medici from Florence. A new wave of Puritanism swept through the city. Many new restricting fundamentalist laws were passed.

In 1529, Clement VII signed the Treaty of Barcelona with Charles V, under which Charles would, in exchange for the Pope&#x27;s blessing, invade Florence and restore the Medici. They were restored after a protracted siege.

===&quot;Dukes of the Republic of Florence&quot;===

Following the Republic&#x27;s surrender in the Siege of Florence, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor issued a proclamation explicitly stating that he and he alone could determine the government of Florence. On 12 August 1530, the Emperor created the Medici hereditary rulers (&quot;capo&quot;) of the &quot;Republic&quot; of Florence. The title &quot;Duke of the Florentine Republic&quot; was chosen because it would bolster Medici power in the region.

====Alessandro de&#x27; Medici====

Pope Clement VII intended his relative Alessandro de&#x27; Medici to be the ruler of Florence, but also wanted to give the impression that the Florentines had democratically chosen Alessandro as their ruler. 
Even after Alessandro&#x27;s accession in 1530 (he reigned as Duke of the Florentine Republic from 1532 on), Imperial troops remained stationed in Florence. In 1535, several prominent Florentine families, including the Pazzi (who attempted to kill Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in the Pazzi Conspiracy) dispatched a delegation under Ippolito de&#x27; Medici, asking Charles V to depose Alessandro. Much to their dismay, the Emperor rejected their appeal. Charles had no intention of deposing Alessandro, who was married to Charles&#x27; daughter Margaret of Parma.

Alessandro continued to rule Florence for another two years until he was murdered on 1 January 1537 by his distant relative Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici.

====Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici====

As Alessandro left no legitimate issue, the question of succession was open. Florentine authorities selected Cosimo I in 1537. At the news of this, the exiled Strozzi family invaded and tried to depose Cosimo, but were defeated at Montemurlo. Cosimo completely overhauled the bureaucracy and administration of Florence. In 1542, the Imperial troops stationed in Florence by Charles V were withdrawn.

In 1548, Cosimo was given a part of the Island of Elba by Charles V, and based his new developing navy there. Cosimo founded the port city of Livorno and allowed the city&#x27;s inhabitants to enjoy freedom of religion. In alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, Cosimo defeated the Republic of Siena, which was allied with France, in the Battle of Marciano on 2 August 1554. On 17 April 1555, Florence and Spain occupied the territory of Siena, which, in July 1557 Philip II of Spain bestowed on Cosimo as a hereditary fiefdom. The ducal family moved into the Palazzo Pitti in 1560. Cosimo commissioned the architect Vasari to build the Uffizi, as offices for the Medici bank, continuing the Medici tradition of patronage of the arts.

===End of the Republic===

In 1569, Cosimo was elevated to the rank of the Grand Duke of Tuscany by Pope Pius V. This marks the end of the Florence Republic, and the beginning of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

Medici rule continued into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the family became extinct in 1737.
==Administrations of the Republic==

Florence was governed by a council called the &quot;signoria&quot;, which consisted of nine men. The head of the signoria was the &quot;gonfaloniere&quot;, who was chosen every two months in a lottery, as was his &quot;signoria&quot;. To be eligible, one had to have sound finances, no arrears or bankruptcies, he had to be older than thirty, had to be a member of Florence&#x27;s seven main guilds (merchant traders, bankers, two clothe guilds, and judges). The lottery was often pre-determined, and the results were usually favourable to influential families. The roster of names in the lottery were replaced every five years.

The main organs of government were known as the &quot;tre maggiori&quot;. They were: the twelve good men, the standard bearers of the &quot;gonfaloniere&quot;, and the &quot;signoria&quot;. The first two debated and ratified proposed legislation, but could not introduce it. The &quot;gonfaloniere&quot;&#x27;s initial two month-term in office was expanded upon the fall of Savonarola in 1498, to life, much like that of the Venetian &quot;doge&quot;. The &quot;signoria&quot; held meetings each day in the &quot;Palazzo della Signoria.&quot; Various committees controlled particular aspects of government, e.g. the Committee of War. For administrative purposes, Florence was divided into four districts, which were divided into four sub-districts. The main purpose of these counties was to ease the gathering of local militias.

To hold an elective office, one had to be of a family that had previously held office. The Medici family effectively ruled Florence on a hereditary basis, from 1434 to 1494, and 1512–1527.

After Alessandro de&#x27; Medici was installed as the &quot;Duke of the Florentine Republic&quot; in 1530, in April 1532, Pope Clement VII convinced the &quot;Balía&quot;, Florence&#x27;s ruling commission, to draw up a new constitution, which formally created a hereditary monarchy. It abolished the age-old &quot;signoria&quot; (elective government) and the office of &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; (titular head-of-state elected for a two-month term) and replaced it with three institutions:

* the &quot;consigliere&quot;, a four-man council elected for a three-month term, headed by the &quot;Duke of the Florentine Republic&quot;.
* the Senate, composed of forty-eight men, chosen by the &quot;Balía&quot;, was vested with the prerogative of determining Florence&#x27;s financial, security, and foreign policies. Additionally, the senate appointed the commissions of war and public security, and the governors of Pisa, Arezzio, Prato, Voltera and Cortona and ambassadors.
* the Council of Two Hundred was a petitions court; membership was for life.

<text>The Arabian or Arab horse ( , DMG &quot;al-ḥiṣān al-ʿarabī&quot;) is a breed of horse with historic roots on the Arabian Peninsula. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian is one of the most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world. It is also one of the oldest modern breeds. Although modern DNA cannot trace breed purity in the modern population beyond 200 years, there is archaeological evidence of horses in the Middle East with landrace characteristics that resemble modern Arabians dating back 3,500 years. Throughout history, Arabian horses have spread around the world by both war and trade, used to improve other breeds by adding speed, refinement, endurance, and strong bone. Today, Arabian bloodlines are found in almost every modern breed of riding horse.

The Arabian developed in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits, including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans, created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.

The Arabian is a versatile breed. Arabians dominate the discipline of endurance riding and compete today in many other fields of equestrian sport. They are one of the top ten most popular horse breeds in the world. They are now found worldwide, including the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, continental Europe, South America (especially Brazil), and their land of origin, the Middle East.

==Breed characteristics==

Arabian horses have refined, wedge-shaped heads, a broad forehead, large eyes, large nostrils, and small muzzles. Most display a distinctive concave, or &quot;dished&quot; profile. Many Arabians also have a slight forehead bulge between their eyes, called the &quot;jibbah&quot; by the Bedouin, that adds additional sinus capacity, believed to have helped the Arabian horse in its native dry desert climate. Another breed characteristic is an arched neck with a large, well-set windpipe set on a refined, clean throatlatch. This structure of the poll and throatlatch was called the &quot;mitbah&quot; or &quot;mitbeh&quot; by the Bedouin. In the ideal Arabian, it is long, allowing flexibility in the bridle and room for the windpipe.

Other distinctive features are a relatively long, level croup, or top of the hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians to have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flatwork such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and the superiority of the breed in endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.

===Skeletal analysis===

Some Arabians, though not all, have 5 lumbar vertebrae instead of the usual 6, and 17 pairs of ribs rather than 18. A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to the hip (determined by the length of the pelvis), that allows agility and impulsion. A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the &quot;hip&quot; (the pelvis or ilium), leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly. However, the croup is formed by the sacral vertebrae. The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the ilium to the spine, the structure and length of the femur, and other aspects of hindquarter anatomy, which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum. Thus, the Arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance, such as the Thoroughbred, where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup. Thus, the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup. Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles, and so unlike angle, length of hip and croup do go together as a rule.

===Size===
The breed standard stated by the United States Equestrian Federation, describes Arabians as standing between tall, &quot;with the occasional individual over or under&quot;. Thus, all Arabians, regardless of height, are classified as &quot;horses&quot;, even though is the traditional cutoff height between a horse and a pony. A common myth is that Arabians are not strong because they are relatively small and refined. However, the Arabian horse is noted for a greater density of bone than other breeds, short cannons, sound feet, and a broad, short back, all of which give the breed physical strength comparable to many taller animals. Thus, even a smaller Arabian can carry a heavy rider. For tasks where the sheer weight of the horse matters, such as farm work done by a draft horse, any lighter-weight horse is at a disadvantage. However, for most purposes, the Arabian is a strong and hardy light horse breed able to carry any type of rider in most equestrian pursuits.

===Temperament===

For centuries, Arabian horses lived in the desert in close association with humans. For shelter and protection from theft, prized war mares were sometimes kept in their owner&#x27;s tent, close to children and everyday family life. Only horses with a naturally good disposition were allowed to reproduce, with the result that Arabians today have a good temperament that, among other examples, makes them one of the few breeds where the United States Equestrian Federation rules allow children to exhibit stallions in nearly all show ring classes, including those limited to riders under 18.

On the other hand, the Arabian is also classified as a &quot;hot-blooded&quot; breed, a category that includes other refined, spirited horses bred for speed, such as the Akhal-Teke, the Barb, and the Thoroughbred. Like other hot-bloods, Arabians&#x27; sensitivity and intelligence enable quick learning and greater communication with their riders; however, their intelligence also allows them to learn bad habits as quickly as good ones, and they do not tolerate inept or abusive training practices. Some sources claim that it is more difficult to train a &quot;hot-blooded&quot; horse. Though most Arabians have a natural tendency to cooperate with humans, when treated badly, like any horse, they can become excessively nervous or anxious, but seldom become vicious unless seriously spoiled or subjected to extreme abuse. At the other end of the spectrum, romantic myths are sometimes told about Arabian horses that give them near-divine characteristics.

The Arabian Horse Association registers purebred horses with the coat colors bay, gray, chestnut, black, and roan. Bay, gray and chestnut are the most common; black is less common. The classic roan gene does not appear to exist in Arabians; rather, Arabians registered by breeders as &quot;roan&quot; are usually expressing rabicano or, sometimes, sabino patterns with roan features. All Arabians, no matter their coat color, have black skin, except under white markings. Black skin provided protection from the intense desert sun.

====Gray and white====

Although many Arabians appear to have a &quot;white&quot; hair coat, they are not genetically &quot;white&quot;. This color is usually created by the natural action of the gray gene, and virtually all white-looking Arabians are actually grays. A specialized colorization seen in some older gray Arabians is the so-called &quot;bloody-shoulder&quot;, which is a particular type of &quot;flea-bitten&quot; gray with localized aggregations of pigment on the shoulder.

There are a very few Arabians registered as &quot;white&quot; defined as having a white coat, pink skin and dark eyes from birth. These animals are believed to manifest a form of dominant white, W3, a result of a nonsense mutation in DNA tracing to a single stallion foaled in 1996. It is possible that white mutations have occurred in Arabians in the past and it is likely that mutations other than W3 exist but have not been verified by genetic testing.

====Sabino====

One spotting pattern, sabino, does exist in purebred Arabians. Sabino coloring is characterized by white markings such as &quot;high white&quot; above the knees and hocks, irregular spotting on the legs, belly and face, white markings that extend beyond the eyes or under the chin and jaw, and sometimes lacy or roaned edges.

The genetic mechanism that produces sabino patterning in Arabians is now thought to be a form of dominant white, and more than one gene may be involved. However, studies at the University of California, Davis indicate that Arabians do not appear to carry the autosomal dominant gene &quot;SB1&quot; or &quot;sabino 1&quot;, that often produces bold spotting and some completely white horses in other breeds. The inheritance patterns observed in sabino-like Arabians also do not follow the same mode of inheritance as &quot;sabino 1&quot;.

====Rabicano or roan====
There are very few Arabians registered as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.

====Colors that do not exist in purebreds====
There is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex (&quot;Appaloosa&quot;) spotting patterns, except for sabino.
 Spotting or excess white was believed by many breeders to be a mark of impurity until DNA testing for verification of parentage became standard. For a time, horses with belly spots and other white markings deemed excessive were discouraged from registration and excess white was sometimes penalized in the show ring.

Purebred Arabians never carry dilution genes. Therefore, purebreds cannot be colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin.

To produce horses with some Arabian characteristics but coat colors not found in purebreds, they have to be crossbred with other breeds. Though the purebred Arabian produces a limited range of potential colors, they do not appear to carry any color-based lethal disorders such as the frame overo gene (&quot;O&quot;) that can produce lethal white syndrome (LWS). Because purebred Arabians cannot produce LWS foals, Arabian mares were used as a non-affected population in some of the studies seeking the gene that caused the condition in other breeds. Nonetheless, partbred Arabian offspring can, in some cases, carry these genes if the non-Arabian parent was a carrier.

===Genetic disorders===
There are six known genetic disorders in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia of the affected animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three are thought to be autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born. One may be an autosomal dominant. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; partbred Arabians may inherit deleterious genetics from other breeds.

Genetic diseases that can occur in purebred Arabians, or in partbreds with Arabian ancestry in both parents, are the following:
* Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, carriers (heterozygotes) show no signs. Similar to the &quot;bubble boy&quot; condition in humans, an affected foal is born with a complete lack of an immune system, and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection, usually before the age of three months. There is a DNA test that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of the gene causing SCID, thus testing and careful, planned matings can now eliminate the possibility of an affected foal ever being born.
* Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), also called Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, carriers show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals are born with a coat color dilution that lightens the tips of the coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.
* Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, homozygous horses are affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, but at some stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related to the death of the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.
* Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a condition where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and at the base of the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and rear legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1 month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is now a genetic test for OAAM.
* Equine juvenile epilepsy, or Juvenile Idiopathic Epilepsy, sometimes referred to as &quot;benign&quot; epilepsy, is not usually fatal. Foals appear normal between epileptic seizures, and seizures usually stop occurring between 12 and 18 months. Affected foals may show signs of epilepsy anywhere from two days to six months from birth. Seizures can be treated with traditional anti-seizure medications, which may reduce their severity. Though the condition has been studied since 1985 at the University of California, Davis, the genetic mode of inheritance is unclear, though the cases studied were all of one general bloodline group. Recent research updates suggest that a dominant mode of inheritance is involved in transmission of this trait. One researcher hypothesized that epilepsy may be linked in some fashion to Lavender Foal Syndrome due to the fact that it occurs in similar bloodlines and some horses have produced foals with both conditions.
*Guttural Pouch Tympany (GPT) occurs in horses ranging from birth to 1 year of age and is more common in fillies than in colts. It is thought to be genetic in Arabians, possibly polygenic in inheritance, but more study is needed. Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube to act like a one-way valve – air can get in, but it cannot get out. The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic nonpainful swelling. Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic examination of the skull. Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation. Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening, to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx. Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives.

The Arabian Horse Association in the United States has created a foundation that supports research efforts to uncover the roots of genetic diseases. The organization F.O.A.L. (Fight Off Arabian Lethals) is a clearinghouse for information on these conditions. Additional information is available from the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO).

Recent trends in breeding for halter showing have given rise to Arabian horses with extremely concave facial features, raising concerns that the trait is detrimental to the animal&#x27;s welfare. Comparisons have been made to a similar trend with some dog breeds, where show judging awarding certain features has led to breeders seeking an ever more exaggerated form, with little concern as to the inherent function of the animal. Some veterinarians speculate that an extremely concave face is detrimental to a horse&#x27;s breathing, but the issue has not been formally studied.

==Legends==

Arabian horses are the topic of many myths and legends. One origin story tells how Muhammad chose his foundation mares by a test of their courage and loyalty. While there are several variants on the tale, a common version states that after a long journey through the desert, Muhammad turned his herd of horses loose to race to an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water. Before the herd reached the water, Muhammad called for the horses to return to him. Only five mares responded. Because they faithfully returned to their master, though desperate with thirst, these mares became his favorites and were called &quot;Al Khamsa&quot;, meaning, &quot;the five&quot;. These mares became the legendary founders of the five &quot;strains&quot; of the Arabian horse. Although the &quot;Al Khamsa&quot; are generally considered fictional horses of legend, some breeders today claim the modern Bedouin Arabian actually descended from these mares.

Another origin tale claims that King Solomon was given a pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad (&quot;the pure&quot;) by the Queen of Sheba. A different version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib (&quot;Gift to the Rider&quot;), to the Banu Azd people when they came to pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.

Yet another creation myth puts the origin of the Arabian in the time of Ishmael, the son of Abraham. In this story, the Angel Jibril (also known as Gabriel) descended from Heaven and awakened Ishmael with a &quot;wind-spout&quot; that whirled toward him. The Angel then commanded the thundercloud to stop scattering dust and rain, and so it gathered itself into a prancing, handsome creature - a horse - that seemed to swallow up the ground. Hence, the Bedouins bestowed the title &quot;Drinker of the Wind&quot; to the first Arabian horse.

Finally, a Bedouin story states that Allah created the Arabian horse from the south wind and exclaimed, &quot;I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I establish thee as one of the Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings.&quot; Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: &quot;I want to make a creature out of you. Condense.&quot; Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a &quot;kamayt&quot;-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: &quot;I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation.&quot;

==Origins==
Arabians are thought to be one of the oldest human-developed horse breeds in the world. Recent genetic studies of mitochondrial DNA in Arabian horses of Polish and American breeding suggest that the modern breed has heterogeneous origins with ten haplogroups. The modern concept of breed purity in the modern population cannot be traced beyond 200 years.

The progenitor stock, the Oriental subtype, had characteristics similar to the modern Arabian. Horses with these features appeared in rock paintings and inscriptions in the Arabian Peninsula dating back 3500 years. In ancient history throughout the Ancient Near East, horses with refined heads and high-carried tails were depicted in artwork, particularly that of Ancient Egypt in the 16th century BC.

Some 20th-century scholars of the Arabian horse once theorized that the Arabian came from a separate subspecies of horse, known as &quot;equus caballus pumpelli&quot;. However, others, including Gladys Brown Edwards, a noted Arabian researcher, stated that the &quot;dry&quot; oriental horses of the desert, from which the modern Arabian developed, were &quot;Equus ferus caballus&quot; with specific landrace characteristics based on the environments in which they lived, rather than being a separate subspecies. Horses with similar, though not identical, physical characteristics include the Marwari horse of India, the Barb of North Africa, the Akhal-Teke of western Asia and the now-extinct Turkoman Horse.

===Desert roots===

There are different theories about where the ancestors of the Arabian originally lived. Most evidence suggests the proto-Arabian came from the area along the northern edge of the Fertile Crescent. Another hypothesis suggests the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula, in modern-day Yemen, where three now-dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago, perhaps as far back as the Ice Age. This hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between 6590 and 7250 BCE in Al-Magar, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, that appeared to portray horses.

The proto-Arabian horse may have been domesticated by the people of the Arabian Peninsula known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000 years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.

Regardless of origin, climate and culture ultimately created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse to cooperate with humans to survive; humans were the only providers of food and water in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72 hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel&#x27;s milk. The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.

The Bedouin way of life depended on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed, endurance, soundness, and intelligence. Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter, and therefore would not give away the position of the fighters. A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators. Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features.

===Strains and pedigrees===
For centuries, the Bedouin tracked the ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood were known as &quot;Asil&quot; and crossbreeding with non-&quot;Asil&quot; horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin did not believe in gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.

Over time, the Bedouin developed several sub-types or &quot;strains&quot; of Arabian horse, each with unique characteristics, and traced through the maternal line only. According to the Arabian Horse Association, the five primary strains were known as the Keheilan, Seglawi, Abeyan, Hamdani and Hadban. Carl Raswan, a promoter and writer about Arabian horses from the middle of the 20th century, held the belief that there were only three strains, Kehilan, Seglawi and Muniqi. Raswan felt that these strains represented body &quot;types&quot; of the breed, with the Kehilan being &quot;masculine&quot;, the Seglawi being &quot;feminine&quot; and the Muniqi being &quot;speedy&quot;. There were also lesser strains, sub-strains, and regional variations in strain names. Therefore, many Arabian horses were not only &quot;Asil&quot;, of pure blood, but also bred to be pure in strain, with crossbreeding between strains discouraged, though not forbidden, by some tribes. Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin, and they also believed in telegony, believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of &quot;impure&quot; blood, the mare herself and all future offspring would be &quot;contaminated&quot; by the stallion and hence no longer &quot;Asil&quot;.

This complex web of bloodline and strain was an integral part of Bedouin culture; they not only knew the pedigrees and history of their best war mares in detail, but also carefully tracked the breeding of their camels, Saluki dogs, and their own family or tribal history. Eventually, written records began to be kept; the first written pedigrees in the Middle East that specifically used the term &quot;Arabian&quot; date to 1330 AD. As important as strain was to the Bedouin, modern studies of mitochondrial DNA suggest that Arabian horses alive today with records stating descent from a given strain may not actually share a common maternal ancestry.

==Historic development==

===Role in the ancient world===

Fiery war horses with dished faces and high-carried tails were popular artistic subjects in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, often depicted pulling chariots in war or for hunting. Horses with oriental characteristics appear in later artwork as far north as that of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. While this type of horse was not called an &quot;Arabian&quot; in the Ancient Near East until later, these proto-Arabians shared many characteristics with the modern Arabian, including speed, endurance, and refinement. For example, a horse skeleton unearthed in the Sinai peninsula, dated to 1700 BC and probably brought by the Hyksos invaders, is considered the earliest physical evidence of the horse in Ancient Egypt. This horse had a wedge-shaped head, large eye sockets and small muzzle, all characteristics of the Arabian horse.

===In Islamic history===
Following the Hijra in AD 622 (also sometimes spelled Hegira), the Arabian horse spread across the known world of the time, and became recognized as a distinct, named breed. It played a significant role in the History of the Middle East and of Islam. By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa, by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula by 720. Their war horses were of various oriental types, including both Arabians and the Barb horse of North Africa. More Arabian horses were introduced to North Africa as a result of the migration of Banu Hilal.

Arabian horses also spread to the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully dominated the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.

El Naseri, or Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt (1290–1342) imported and bred numerous Arabians in Egypt. A stud farm record was made of his purchases describing many of the horses as well as their abilities, and was deposited in his library, becoming a source for later study. Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and, later, to Americans.

===Egypt===

Historically, Egyptian breeders imported horses bred in the deserts of Palestine and the Arabian peninsula as the source of their foundation bloodstock. By the time that the Ottoman Empire dominated Egypt, the political elites of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for horse racing, and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure-blooded Arabians. One of the most famous was Muhammad Ali of Egypt, also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha, who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century. After his death, some of his stock was bred on by Abbas I of Egypt, also known as Abbas Pasha. However, after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854, his heir, El Hami Pasha, sold most of his horses, often for crossbreeding, and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts. A remnant of the herd was obtained by Ali Pasha Sherif, who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock. At its peak, the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, an epidemic of African horse sickness in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd, wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines. Late in his life, he sold several horses to Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt, who exported them to Crabbet Park Stud in England. After his death, Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her Sheykh Obeyd stud.

Meanwhile, the passion brought by the Blunts to saving the pure horse of the desert helped Egyptian horse breeders to convince their government of the need to preserve the best of their own remaining pure Arabian bloodstock that descended from the horses collected over the previous century by Muhammad Ali Pasha, Abbas Pasha and Ali Pasha Sherif. The government of Egypt formed the Royal Agricultural Society (RAS) in 1908, which is known today as the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (EAO).
RAS representatives traveled to England during the 1920s and purchased eighteen descendants of the original Blunt exports from Lady Wentworth at Crabbet Park, and brought them to Egypt in order to restore bloodlines had been lost. Other than several horses purchased by Henry Babson for importation to the United States in the 1930s, and one other small group exported to the US in 1947, relatively few Egyptian-bred Arabian horses were exported until the overthrow of King Farouk I in 1952. Many of the private stud farms of the princes were then confiscated and the animals taken over by the EAO. In the 1960s and 1970s, as oil development brought more foreign investors to Egypt, some of whom were horse fanciers, Arabians were exported to Germany and to the United States, as well as to the former Soviet Union. Today, the designation &quot;Straight Egyptian&quot; or &quot;Egyptian Arabian&quot; is popular with some Arabian breeders, and the modern Egyptian-bred Arabian is an outcross used to add refinement in some breeding programs.

==Arrival in Europe==

Probably the earliest horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly, through Spain and France. Others would have arrived with returning Crusaders—beginning in 1095, European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored war horses who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses and their descendants were used to develop faster, agile light cavalry horses that were used in warfare into the 20th century.

Another major infusion of Arabian horses into Europe occurred when the Ottoman Turks sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, many of whom were mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached Vienna, where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry. Some of these animals provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe.

===Polish and Russian breeding programs===
With the rise of light cavalry, the stamina and agility of horses with Arabian blood gave an enormous military advantage to any army who possessed them. As a result, many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments that crossed Arabians on local stock, one example being Knyszyna, the royal stud of Polish king Zygmunt II August, and another the Imperial Russian Stud of Peter the Great.

European horse breeders also obtained Arabian stock directly from the desert or via trade with the Ottomans. In Russia, Count Alexey Orlov obtained many Arabians, including Smetanka, an Arabian stallion who became a foundation sire of the Orlov trotter. Orlov then provided Arabian horses to Catherine the Great, who in 1772 owned 12 pure Arabian stallions and 10 mares. By 1889 two members of the Russian nobility, Count Stroganov and Prince Nikolai Borisovich Shcherbatov, established Arabian stud farms to meet the continued need to breed Arabians as a source of pure bloodstock.

In Poland, notable imports from Arabia included those of Prince Hieronymous Sanguszko (1743–1812), who founded the Slawuta stud. Poland&#x27;s first state-run Arabian stud farm, Janów Podlaski, was established by the decree of Alexander I of Russia in 1817, and by 1850, the great stud farms of Poland were well-established, including Antoniny, owned by the Polish Count Potocki (who had married into the Sanguszko family); later notable as the farm that produced the stallion Skowronek.

===Central and western Europe===

The 18th century marked the establishment of most of the great Arabian studs of Europe, dedicated to preserving &quot;pure&quot; Arabian bloodstock. The Prussians set up a royal stud in 1732, originally intended to provide horses for the royal stables, and other studs were established to breed animals for other uses, including mounts for the Prussian army. The foundation of these breeding programs was the crossing of Arabians on native horses; by 1873 some English observers felt that the Prussian cavalry mounts were superior in endurance to those of the British, and credited Arabian bloodlines for this superiority.

Other state studs included the Babolna Stud of Hungary, set up in 1789, and the Weil stud in Germany (now Weil-Marbach or the Marbach stud), founded in 1817 by King William I of Württemberg. King James I of England imported the first Arabian stallion, the Markham Arabian, to England in 1616. Arabians were also introduced into European race horse breeding, especially in England via the Darley Arabian, Byerly Turk, and Godolphin Arabian, the three foundation stallions of the modern Thoroughbred breed, who were each brought to England during the 18th century. Other monarchs obtained Arabian horses, often as personal mounts. One of the most famous Arabian stallions in Europe was Marengo, the war horse ridden by Napoleon Bonaparte.

During the mid-19th century, the need for Arabian blood to improve the breeding stock for light cavalry horses in Europe resulted in more excursions to the Middle East. Queen Isabel II of Spain sent representatives to the desert to purchase Arabian horses and by 1847 had established a stud book; her successor, King Alfonso XII imported additional bloodstock from other European nations. By 1893, the state military stud farm, Yeguada Militar was established in Córdoba, Spain for breeding both Arabian and Iberian horses. The military remained heavily involved in the importation and breeding of Arabians in Spain well into the early 20th century, and the Yeguada Militar is still in existence today.

This period also marked a phase of considerable travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate. By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they could find in order to preserve the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron.

===Rise of the Crabbet Park Stud===
Perhaps the most famous of all Arabian breeding operations founded in Europe was the Crabbet Park Stud of England, founded 1878. Starting in 1877, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including visits to the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd, bringing the best Arabians they could find to England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh Obeyd stud farm in Egypt, near Cairo. Upon Lady Anne&#x27;s death in 1917, the Blunts&#x27; daughter, Judith, Lady Wentworth, inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne&#x27;s portion of the estate, and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father. Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil Covey, who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses. Along with Crabbet, the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance.

===Early 20th-century Europe===
In the early 20th century, the military was involved in the breeding of Arabian horses throughout Europe, particularly in Poland, Spain, Germany, and Russia; private breeders also developed a number of breeding programs. Significant among the private breeders in continental Europe was Spain&#x27;s Cristóbal Colón de Aguilera, XV Duque de Veragua, a direct descendant of Christopher Columbus, who founded the Veragua Stud in the 1920s.

===Modern warfare and its impact on European studs===
Between World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, many historic European stud farms were lost; in Poland, the Antoniny and Slawuta Studs were wiped out except for five mares. Notable among the survivors was the Janów Podlaski Stud Farm. The Russian Revolution, combined with the effects of World War I, destroyed most of the breeding programs in Russia, but by 1921, the Soviet government reestablished an Arabian program, the Tersk Stud, on the site of the former Stroganov estate, which included Polish bloodstock as well as some importations from the Crabbet Stud in England. The programs that survived the war re-established their breeding operations and some added to their studs with new imports of desert-bred Arabian horses from the Middle East. Not all European studs recovered. The Weil stud of Germany, founded by King Wilhelm I, went into considerable decline; by the time the Weil herd was transferred to the Marbach State Stud in 1932, only 17 purebred Arabians remained.

The Spanish Civil War and World War II also had a devastating impact on horse breeding throughout Europe. The Veragua stud was destroyed, and its records lost, with the only survivors being the broodmares and the younger horses, who were rescued by Francisco Franco. Crabbet Park, Tersk, and Janów Podlaski survived. Both the Soviet Union and the United States obtained valuable Arabian bloodlines as spoils of war, which they used to strengthen their breeding programs. The Soviets had taken steps to protect their breeding stock at Tersk Stud, and by utilizing horses captured in Poland they were able to re-establish their breeding program soon after the end of World War II. The Americans brought Arabian horses captured in Europe to the United States, mostly to the Pomona U.S. Army Remount station, the former W.K. Kellogg Ranch in California.

In the postwar era, Poland, Spain, and Germany developed or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms. The studs of Poland in particular were decimated by both the Nazis and the Soviets, but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards. During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.

===After the Cold War===
While only a few Arabians were exported from behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, those who did come to the west caught the eye of breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, and the rise of the European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations. Today, Arabian horses are traded all over the world.

==In America==
The first horses on the American mainland since the end of the Ice Age arrived with the Spanish Conquistadors. Hernán Cortés brought 16 horses of Andalusian, Barb, and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519. Others followed, such as Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, who brought 250 horses of similar breeding to America in 1540. More horses followed with each new arrival of Conquistadors, missionaries, and settlers. Many horses escaped or were stolen, becoming the foundation stock of the American Mustang.

===Early imports===
Colonists from England also brought horses of Arabian breeding to the eastern seaboard. One example was Nathaniel Harrison, who imported a horse of Arabian, Barb and Turkish ancestry to America in 1747.

One of George Washington&#x27;s primary mounts during the American Revolutionary War was a gray half-Arabian horse named Blueskin, sired by the stallion &quot;Ranger&quot;, also known as &quot;Lindsay&#x27;s Arabian&quot;, said to have been obtained from the Sultan of Morocco. Other Presidents are linked to ownership of Arabian horses; in 1840, President Martin Van Buren received two Arabians from the Sultan of Oman, and in 1877, President Ulysses S. Grant obtained an Arabian stallion, Leopard, and a Barb, Linden Tree, as gifts from Abdul Hamid II, the &quot;Sultan of Turkey&quot;.

A. Keene Richard was the first American known to have specifically bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on Thoroughbreds, and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.

Leopard is the only stallion imported prior to 1888 who left known purebred descendants in America. In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert-bred Arabian mare *Naomi, and bred her to Leopard, producing Leopard&#x27;s only purebred Arabian son, Anazeh, who sired eight purebred Arabian foals, four of whom still appear in pedigrees today.
===Development of purebred breeding in America===
In 1908, the Arabian Horse Registry of America was established, recording 71 animals, and by 1994, the number had reached half a million. Today there are more Arabians registered in North America than in the rest of the world put together.

The origins of the registry date to 1893, when the Hamidie Society sponsored an exhibit of Arabian horses from what today is Syria at the World Fair in Chicago. This exhibition raised considerable interest in Arabian horses. Records are unclear if 40 or 45 horses were imported for the exposition, but seven died in a fire shortly after arrival. The 28 horses that remained at the end of the exhibition stayed in America and were sold at auction when the Hamidie Society went bankrupt. These horses caught the interest of American breeders, including Peter Bradley of the Hingham Stock Farm, who purchased some Hamidie horses at the auction, and Homer Davenport, another admirer of the Hamidie imports.

Major Arabian importations to the United States included those of Davenport and Bradley, who teamed up to purchase several stallions and mares directly from the Bedouin in 1906. Spencer Borden of the Interlachen Stud made several importations between 1898 and 1911; and W.R. Brown of the Maynesboro Stud, interested in the Arabian as a cavalry mount, imported many Arabians over a period of years, starting in 1918. Another wave of imports came in the 1920s and 30s when breeders such as W.K. Kellogg, Henry Babson, Roger Selby, James Draper, and others imported Arabian bloodstock from Crabbet Park Stud in England, as well as from Poland, Spain and Egypt. The breeding of Arabians was fostered by the U. S. Army Remount Service, which stood purebred stallions at public stud for a reduced rate.

Several Arabians, mostly of Polish breeding, were captured from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II. In 1957, two deaths in England led to more sales to the United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth, and then from Hanstead with the passing of Gladys Yule. As the tensions of the Cold War eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt, and in the late 1970s, as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia.

===Modern trends===
In the 1980s, Arabians became a popular status symbol and were marketed similarly to fine art. Some individuals also used horses as a tax shelter. Prices skyrocketed, especially in the United States, with a record-setting public auction price for a mare named NH Love Potion, who sold for $2.55 million in 1984, and the largest syndication in history for an Arabian stallion, Padron, at $11 million. The potential for profit led to over-breeding of the Arabian. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 closed the tax-sheltering &quot;passive investment&quot; loophole, limiting the use of horse farms as tax shelters, the Arabian market was particularly vulnerable due to over-saturation and artificially inflated prices, and it collapsed, forcing many breeders into bankruptcy and sending many purebred Arabians to slaughter. Prices recovered slowly, with many breeders moving away from producing &quot;living art&quot; and towards a horse more suitable for amateur owners and many riding disciplines. By 2003, a survey found that 67% of purebred Arabian horses in America are owned for recreational riding purposes. , there are more than 660,000 Arabians that have been registered in the United States, and the US has the largest number of Arabians of any nation in the world.

==In Australia==

===Early imports===

Arabian horses were introduced to Australia in the earliest days of European Settlement. Early imports included both purebred Arabians and light Spanish &quot;jennets&quot; from Andalusia, many Arabians also came from India. Based on records describing stallions &quot;of Arabic and Persian blood&quot;, the first Arabian horses were probably imported to Australia in several groups between 1788 and 1802. About 1803, a merchant named Robert Campbell imported a bay Arabian stallion, Hector, from India; Hector was said to have been owned by Arthur Wellesley, who later became known as the Duke of Wellington. In 1804 two additional Arabians, also from India, arrived in Tasmania one of whom, White William, sired the first purebred Arabian foal born in Australia, a stallion named Derwent.

Throughout the 19th century, many more Arabians came to Australia, though most were used to produce crossbred horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt&#x27;s Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses and some of them became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding cavalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.

===In the 20th and 21st centuries===
In the early 20th century, more Arabian horses, mostly of Crabbet bloodlines, arrived in Australia. The first Arabians of Polish breeding arrived in 1966, and Egyptian lines were first imported in 1970. Arabian horses from the rest of the world followed, and today the Australian Arabian horse registry is the second largest in the world, next to that of the United States.

==Modern breeding==

Arabian horses today are found all over the world. They are no longer classified by Bedouin strain, but are informally classified by the nation of origin of famed horses in a given pedigree. Popular types of Arabians are labeled &quot;Polish&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot;, &quot;Crabbet&quot;, &quot;Russian&quot;, &quot;Egyptian&quot;, and &quot;Domestic&quot; (describing horses whose ancestors were imported to the United States prior to 1944, including those from programs such as Kellogg, Davenport, Maynesboro, Babson, Dickenson and Selby). In the US, a specific mixture of Crabbet, Maynesboro and Kellogg bloodlines has acquired the copyrighted designation &quot;CMK&quot;.

Each set of bloodlines has its own devoted followers, with the virtues of each hotly debated. Most debates are between those who value the Arabian most for its refined beauty and those who value the horse for its stamina and athleticism; there are also a number of breeders who specialize in preservation breeding of various bloodlines. Controversies exist over the relative &quot;purity&quot; of certain animals; breeders argue about the genetic &quot;purity&quot; of various pedigrees, discussing whether some horses descend from &quot;impure&quot; animals that cannot be traced to the desert Bedouin. The major factions are as follows:

*The Arabian Horse Association (AHA) states, &quot;The origin of the purebred Arabian horse was the Arabian desert, and all Arabians ultimately trace their lineage to this source.&quot; In essence, all horses accepted for registration in the United States are deemed to be &quot;purebred&quot; Arabians by AHA.
*The World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) has the broadest definition of a purebred Arabian. WAHO states, &quot;A Purebred Arabian horse is one which appears in any purebred Arabian Stud Book or Register listed by WAHO as acceptable.&quot; By this definition, over 95% of the known purebred Arabian horses in the world are registered in stud books acceptable to WAHO. WAHO also researched the purity question in general, and its findings are on its web site, describing both the research and the political issues surrounding Arabian horse bloodlines, particularly in America.
*At the other end of the spectrum, organizations focused on bloodlines that are the most meticulously documented to desert sources have the most restrictive definitions. For example, The Asil Club in Europe only accepts &quot;a horse whose pedigree is exclusively based on Bedouin breeding of the Arabian peninsula, without any crossbreeding with non-Arabian horses at any time&quot;. Likewise, the Al Khamsa organization takes the position that &quot;The horse...which are called &quot;Al Khamsa Arabian Horses&quot;, are those horses in North America that can reasonably be assumed to descend entirely from bedouin Arabian horses bred by horse-breeding bedouin tribes of the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula without admixture from sources unacceptable to Al Khamsa.&quot; Most restrictive of all are horses identified as &quot;straight Egyptian&quot; by the Pyramid Society, which must trace in all lines to the desert and also to horses owned or bred by specific Egyptian breeding programs. By this definition, straight Egyptian Arabians constitute only 2% of all Arabian horses in America.
*Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had enormous difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians because many of the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.

==Influence on other horse breeds==

Because of the genetic strength of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have played a part in the development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.

Today, people cross Arabians with other breeds to add refinement, endurance, agility and beauty. In the US, Half-Arabians have their own registry within the Arabian Horse Association, which includes a special section for Anglo-Arabians (Arabian-Thoroughbred crosses). Some crosses originally registered only as Half-Arabians became popular enough to have their own breed registry, including the National Show Horse (an Arabian-Saddlebred cross), the Quarab (Arabian-Quarter Horse), the Pintabian the Welara (Arabian-Welsh Pony), and the Morab (Arabian-Morgan). In addition, some Arabians and Half Arabians have been approved for breeding by some Warmblood registries, particularly the Trakehner registry.

There is intense debate over the role the Arabian played in the development of other light horse breeds. Before DNA-based research developed, one hypothesis, based on body types and conformation, suggested the light, &quot;dry&quot;, oriental horse adapted to the desert climate had developed prior to domestication; DNA studies of multiple horse breeds now suggest that while domesticated horses arose from multiple mare lines, there is very little variability in the Y-chromosome between breeds. Following domestication of the horse, due to the location of the Middle East as a crossroads of the ancient world, and relatively near the earliest locations of domestication, oriental horses spread throughout Europe and Asia both in ancient and modern times. There is little doubt that humans crossed &quot;oriental&quot; blood on that of other types to create light riding horses; the only actual questions are at what point the &quot;oriental&quot; prototype could be called an &quot;Arabian&quot;, how much Arabian blood was mixed with local animals, and at what point in history.

For some breeds, such as the Thoroughbred, Arabian influence of specific animals is documented in written stud books. For older breeds, dating the influx of Arabian ancestry is more difficult. For example, while outside cultures, and the horses they brought with them, influenced the predecessor to the Iberian horse in both the time of Ancient Rome and again with the Islamic invasions of the 8th century, it is difficult to trace precise details of the journeys taken by waves of conquerors and their horses as they traveled from the Middle East to North Africa and across Gibraltar to southern Europe. Mitochondrial DNA studies of modern Andalusian horses of the Iberian peninsula and Barb horses of North Africa present convincing evidence that both breeds crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and influenced one another. Though these studies did not compare Andalusian and Barb mtDNA to that of Arabian horses, there is evidence that horses resembling Arabians, whether before or after the breed was called an &quot;Arabian&quot;, were part of this genetic mix. Arabians and Barbs, though probably related to one another, are quite different in appearance, and horses of both Arabian and Barb type were present in the Muslim armies that occupied Europe. There is also historical documentation that Islamic invaders raised Arabian horses in Spain prior to the Reconquista; the Spanish also documented imports of Arabian horses in 1847, 1884 and 1885 that were used to improve existing Spanish stock and revive declining equine populations.

==Uses==
Arabians are versatile horses that compete in many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the horse show disciplines of saddle seat, Western pleasure, and hunt seat, as well as dressage, cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others. They are used as pleasure riding, trail riding, and working ranch horses for those who are not interested in competition.

===Competition===

Arabians dominate the sport of endurance riding because of their stamina. They are the leading breed in competitions such as the Tevis Cup that can cover up to in a day, and they participate in FEI-sanctioned endurance events worldwide, including the World Equestrian Games.

There is an extensive series of horse shows in the United States and Canada for Arabian, Half-Arabian, and Anglo-Arabian horses, sanctioned by the USEF in conjunction with the Arabian Horse Association. Classes offered include Western pleasure, reining, hunter type and saddle seat English pleasure, and halter, plus the very popular &quot;Native&quot; costume class. &quot;Sport horse&quot; events for Arabian horses have become popular in North America, particularly after the Arabian Horse Association began hosting a separate Arabian and Half Arabian Sport Horse National Championship in 2003 that by 2004 grew to draw 2000 entries. This competition draws Arabian and part-Arabian horses that perform in hunter, jumper, sport horse under saddle, sport horse in hand, dressage, and combined driving competition.

Other nations also sponsor major shows strictly for purebred and partbred Arabians, including Great Britain France, Spain, Poland, and the United Arab Emirates.

Purebred Arabians have excelled in open events against other breeds. One of the most famous examples in the field of western riding competition was the Arabian mare Ronteza, who defeated 50 horses of all breeds to win the 1961 Reined Cow Horse championship at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California. Another Arabian competitive against all breeds was the stallion Aaraf who won an all-breed cutting horse competition at the Quarter Horse Congress in the 1950s. In show jumping and show hunter competition, a number of Arabians have competed successfully against other breeds in open competition, including the purebred gelding Russian Roulette, who has won multiple jumping classes against horses of all breeds on the open circuit, and in eventing, a purebred Arabian competed on the Brazilian team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

Part-Arabians have also appeared at open sport horse events and even Olympic level competition. The Anglo-Arabian Linon was ridden to an Olympic silver medal for France in Dressage in 1928 and 1932, as well as a team gold in 1932, and another French Anglo-Arabian, Harpagon, was ridden to a team gold medal and an individual silver in dressage at the 1948 Olympics. At the 1952 Olympics, the French rider Pierre d&#x27;Oriola won the Gold individual medal in show jumping on the Anglo-Arabian Ali Baba. Another Anglo-Arabian, Tamarillo, ridden by William Fox-Pitt, represents the United Kingdom in FEI and Olympic competition, winning many awards, including first place at the 2004 Badminton Horse Trials. More recently a gelding named Theodore O&#x27;Connor, nicknamed &quot;Teddy&quot;, a 14.1 (or 14.2, sources vary) hand pony of Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Shetland pony breeding, won two gold medals at the 2007 Pan American Games and was finished in the top six at the 2007 and 2008 Rolex Kentucky Three Day CCI competition.

===Other activities===
Arabians are involved in a wide variety of activities, including fairs, movies, parades, circuses and other places where horses are showcased. They have been popular in movies, dating back to the silent film era when Rudolph Valentino rode the Kellogg Arabian stallion Jadaan in 1926&#x27;s &quot;Son of the Sheik&quot;, and have been seen in many other films, including &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; featuring the stallion Cass Ole, &quot;The Young Black Stallion&quot;, which used over 40 Arabians during filming, as well as &quot;Hidalgo&quot; and the 1959 version of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.

Arabians are mascots for football teams, performing crowd-pleasing activities on the field and sidelines. One of the horses who serves as &quot;Traveler&quot;, the mascot for the University of Southern California Trojans, has been a purebred Arabian. &quot;Thunder&quot;, a stage name for the purebred Arabian stallion J B Kobask, was mascot for the Denver Broncos from 1993 until his retirement in 2004, when the Arabian gelding Winter Solstyce took over as &quot;Thunder II&quot;. Cal Poly Pomona&#x27;s W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center Equestrian Unit has made Arabian horses a regular sight at the annual Tournament of Roses Parade held each New Year&#x27;s Day in Pasadena, California.

Arabians also are used on search and rescue teams and occasionally for police work. Some Arabians are used in polo in the US and Europe, in the Turkish equestrian sport of Cirit (), as well as in circuses, therapeutic horseback riding programs, and on guest ranches.

<text>Ronald Edward Santo (February 25, 1940 – December 3, 2010) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) third baseman who played for the Chicago Cubs from 1960 through 1973 and the Chicago White Sox in 1974. In 1990, Santo became a member of the Cubs broadcasting team providing commentary for Cubs games on WGN radio and remained at that position until his death in 2010. In 1999, he was selected to the Cubs All-Century Team. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012.

Santo was an All-Star for nine seasons during his 15-year career. He led the National League (NL) in triples one time, in walks four times, and in on-base percentage two times. He batted .300 or more and hit 30 or more home runs four times each, and is the only third baseman in MLB history to post eight consecutive seasons with over 90 runs batted in (RBI) (1963–70).

He also was a Gold Glove Award winner for five consecutive seasons. He led the NL in total chances eight times, in games, putouts and assists seven times each, and in double plays six times. From to , he held the NL record for assists in a single season. He also set NL records for career assists (4,532), total chances (6,777) and double plays (389) at third base, all of which were eventually broken between and by Mike Schmidt. His NL total of 2,102 games at third base is 52 short of Eddie Mathews&#x27; league record, and he ranks sixth in putouts (1,930) and ninth in fielding percentage (.954).

Santo enjoyed his success despite battling diabetes since he was a teenager, a condition which was concealed from the public until 1971; it eventually necessitated the amputation of the lower half of both his legs. Since 1979, Santo endorsed the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation&#x27;s annual Ron Santo Walk to Cure Diabetes in Chicago. He helped raise over $65 million for the foundation. In 2002, he was named the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Person of the Year.&quot;

==Early life==
Santo was raised in southeast Seattle, attending Franklin High School, and played newly organized youth baseball in the Babe Ruth League. He grew up near Sicks Stadium, home of the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Seattle Rainiers, and had summer jobs there as a batboy, groundskeeper and clubhouse attendant, while playing three sports in high school. At age 14 he made the Seattle all-star team that advanced to the 1954 Babe Ruth World Series. In a game at Washington DC Stadium, Santo was inserted at first base, by Coach Dave Tacher, to replace a 15-year-old player who broke his thumb. In that game Santo hit a grand slam over the 354 foot mark in left center field and the Washington All Stars defeated Tennessee.

==Major league career==

===Chicago Cubs (1960–1973)===

Santo was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1959, and made his debut on June 26, 1960. In 1961 he set a Cubs record with 41 double plays at third base, breaking the previous mark of 33 set by Bernie Friberg in 1923. In 1962 he led the National League in assists for the first time with 332, setting the team record for assists at third base, breaking the mark of 323 set by Randy Jackson in 1951. Santo continued to lead the NL in assists every year through 1968, breaking Ned Williamson&#x27;s major league record of leading the league six times; Brooks Robinson went on to lead the American League eight times. Mike Schmidt eventually tied Santo&#x27;s NL mark of seven. In 1963 Santo broke the modern NL record with 374 assists at third base, passing Tommy Leach&#x27;s 1904 mark of 371. In 1966, he set the all-time league record with 391, the previous record being Billy Shindle&#x27;s 382 in 1892; his total was 99 higher than that of league runner-up Ken Boyer. Santo broke his own record in 1967 with 393 assists, which remained the NL record until Schmidt posted 404 in 1974. He also finished fourth in the 1967 NL Most Valuable Player Award voting results. Santo&#x27;s assist totals from 1963 through 1968 were the six highest by an NL third baseman between 1905 and 1973. He also led the NL in putouts every year from 1962 through 1967 and again in 1969, tying the league record shared by Pie Traynor and Willie Jones in leading the league seven times; Tim Wallach later tied the mark as well.

Santo was deeply saddened by the loss of teammate Ken Hubbs, the Cubs second baseman, killed in a plane crash just prior to the 1964 season. Santo was interviewed by Tom Harmon, narrator of the film &quot;A Glimpse of Greatness–The Story of Ken Hubbs&quot;, in which Santo paid the highest respects to the young Hubbs.

In 1969, Santo and the Cubs were in first place in the National League East for 180 days, before going 8–17 in their final 25 games, while the New York &quot;Miracle&quot; Mets went 37–11 in their final 48 games. During that season, the Cubs sent their entire starting infield, including Santo, to the All-Star Game in Washington, D.C.; he and Cubs shortstop Don Kessinger started for the NL team. Santo finished the season with a .289 batting average, 29 home runs and a career-high 123 runs batted in (RBI), and finished fifth in the NL&#x27;s MVP voting.

====Heel click====

During the 1969 season, Santo became known for performing a heel click after a game on June 22, 1969, against the Montreal Expos. Going into the bottom of the ninth inning, the Expos were leading 6–3. With one out, Paul Popovich hit a single and moved up to second base after another single by Billy Williams. Although Santo grounded out for the second out, Popovich and Williams each moved up a base. Then future Hall of Famer Ernie Banks singled to bring home Williams and Popovich and bring the Cubs within a run. Rick Bladt substituted as a pinch runner for Banks. That set it up for Jim Hickman, who hit a two-run walk-off home run to win the game 7–6. When Hickman reached home plate, Santo was so excited that after congratulating him by bear hugging and pounding him on his head, Santo ran down the third base line and jumped three times, clicking his heels on each jump.

The next day, Santo walked into manager Leo Durocher&#x27;s office; Durocher asked him to keep clicking his heels whenever the Cubs won at Wrigley Field to motivate the team. Santo continued this after every home win. The stunt antagonized opponents and served to make the team a target for payback in the final weeks of the season. When the Cubs began their September swoon, which took place shortly after Santo called out rookie teammate Don Young in public after a loss against the Mets in New York, he discontinued the heel click routine suddenly. His final &quot;click&quot; was performed on September 2, the last Cub home victory while still in first place. During and after the epic collapse, Santo never again performed the heel click, as critics decried the routine for its arrogance and overconfidence, which many believe was at the root of the late fade. On the day Santo was enshrined in the Hall of Fame, the Cubs&#x27; starting lineup all did the &quot;kick&quot; at the start of the game in tribute.

====Trade veto====
Santo became the first player to invoke the ten-and-five rule under the collective bargaining agreement that was signed to end the 1972 Major League Baseball strike. The rule allowed players with ten years&#x27; service, the last five with the same team, to decline any trade. The Cubs had agreed upon a deal to send Santo to the California Angels; the ballclub would have received in return two young pitchers: Andy Hassler, who went on to have a middling career as a reliever/spot starter, and Bruce Heinbechner, a very highly regarded left-handed pitching prospect, who died before the beginning of the 1974 season. Santo&#x27;s desire to stay in Chicago was his motivation to veto the deal on December 8, 1973.

===Chicago White Sox (1974)===
He then asked Cubs management to try for a deal with the crosstown White Sox which was made official on December 11, 1973, with the North Siders acquiring Steve Swisher, Steve Stone and Ken Frailing. Jim Kremmel was also sent to the Cubs to complete the transaction one week later on December 18. The White Sox already had a third baseman, Bill Melton, so Santo was relegated mostly to designated hitter duty, which he hated. He wanted to play in the field, but White Sox manager Chuck Tanner would not bench Melton and unsuccessfully tried Santo at second base. Finishing 1974 with a .221 batting average and 5 home runs, Santo retired from baseball at the age of 34.

==Post-retirement==

===Broadcast career===
As the &quot;single biggest Cubs fan of all time,&quot; Santo joined the Cubs&#x27; broadcast booth in 1990 as the WGN radio color commentator. He worked with play-by-play announcer Pat Hughes, and these radio broadcasts were also known as the &quot;Pat and Ron Show&quot;. He also worked with Harry Caray, Thom Brennaman, Steve Stone and Bob Brenly. Santo also briefly worked with Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers commentator Wayne Larrivee. In addition to his broadcasting career, he did commercials for Seattle Sutton&#x27;s Healthy Eating, which he endorsed, along with joining Hughes in ads for Walgreens and Chevrolet. In Chicago, Santo was known for his unabashed broadcast enthusiasm, including groans and cheers during the game. As excitable as Santo was when a great play for the Cubs occurred, he was equally as vocal in his displeasure when events turned against the Cubs.

===Struggle with diabetes===
In the early years of his playing career, he carefully concealed the fact that he had type 1 diabetes. He feared that if this information were to be known, he would be forced into retirement. Because the methods of regulating diabetes in the 1960s and 1970s were not as advanced as they are today, Santo gauged his blood sugar levels based on his moods. If he felt his blood sugar was low, he would snack on a candy bar in the clubhouse.

As part of the publicity surrounding &quot;Ron Santo Day&quot; at Wrigley Field on August 28, 1971, he revealed his struggle with diabetes. He was diagnosed with this disease at the age of 18, and was given a life expectancy of 25 years. Santo had both his legs amputated below the knee as a result of his diabetes: the right in 2001 and the left in 2002.

In 2004 Santo and his battle against diabetes were the subject of a documentary, &quot;This Old Cub&quot;. The film was written, co-produced and directed by Santo&#x27;s son Jeff.

Santo shared a bond in this respect with 2008 Cubs rookie Sam Fuld, who also has type 1 diabetes.

===Charities===
The Santo family has been involved with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation since 1979, with the annual Ron Santo Walk to Cure Diabetes in Chicago having raised over $65 million for the organization. In 2002, Santo was named the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Person of the Year.&quot; Santo also inspired Bill Holden to walk from Arizona to Chicago to raise $250,000 for diabetes research. During the 2016 World Series, the JDRF hosted watch parties for road games hosted by family members.

===Death===

Santo died at 12:40 am on December 3, 2010, at the age of 70 in a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona, due to complications from bladder cancer and diabetes. (Many media outlets reported the date as &quot;the night of the 2nd&quot; or &quot;overnight.&quot;) Santo had lapsed into a coma on December 1.
 A funeral mass was celebrated at Holy Name Cathedral on December 10, where Santo&#x27;s casket was carried in by former teammates Ernie Banks, Ferguson Jenkins, Randy Hundley, Glenn Beckert, and Billy Williams, draped with the No. 10 flag that flew over Wrigley the day his number was retired. He was eulogized by his longtime broadcast partner Pat Hughes, along with Cubs owner Tom Ricketts and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig. Following the service, the procession paused outside Tribune Tower, home of WGN Radio, before heading north to circle Wrigley Field, starting at third base. Santo was later cremated and his ashes scattered on the field at the Friendly Confines.

On August 10, 2011, Santo was memorialized and &quot;immortalized&quot; at Wrigley Field with the presentation of a statue in his likeness. The statue is a portrayal of a young Santo playing defense at third base, leaning to his right while throwing a ball. The base of the statue cites his legacy as an announcer, his baseball achievements and his impact on research into juvenile diabetes. The statue today is in Gallagher Way, outside of Wrigley Field&#x27;s third base grandstand alongside statues of Ryne Sandberg, Ernie Banks, Fergie Jenkins and Billy Williams.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==

===BBWAA===
When Santo first became eligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in , he was named on less than four percent of all ballots cast by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), resulting in his removal from the ballot in subsequent years; he was one of several players re-added to the ballot in following widespread complaints about overlooked candidates, with the remainder of their 15 years of eligibility restored even if this extended beyond the usual limit of 20 years after their last season. After receiving 13 percent of the vote in the 1985 election, his vote totals increased in 10 of the next 13 years until he received 43 percent of the vote in his final year on the ballot, finishing third in the voting behind electee Don Sutton and 2000 inductee Tony Pérez.

===Veterans Committee===
Following revamped voting procedures for the Veterans Committee, which had elected players retired for over 20 years to the Hall of Fame, Santo finished third in , tied for first in , and again finished first in voting for the and inductions, but fell short of the required number of votes each year.

===Golden Era Committee===
Santo&#x27;s next opportunity for admission to the Hall of Fame following a further major change to the voting structure and process announced in 2010, came during the voting in 2011 by the new 16-member Golden Era Committee which considers every three years, ten candidates identified by the Historical Overview Committee from the 1947 to 1972 era.

Although Santo became a widely supported candidate for selection, his initial poor showing in balloting has been attributed to various factors, including a longtime tendency of BBWAA voters to overlook third basemen; at the time Santo retired, only three of the over 120 players elected were third basemen, and only Pie Traynor had been elected by the BBWAA. Also, the fact that Santo&#x27;s best years occurred in the pitching-dominated 1960s has been cited as a factor that led the voters to perhaps overlook him. Another possible reason that was suggested was that voters had not focused sufficiently on Santo&#x27;s high walk totals and defense. These aspects of play are perhaps more valued by sabermetrics — newer methods of evaluating a baseball player&#x27;s productivity — than they have been by BBWAA voters in the past. For example, Santo&#x27;s career adjusted on-base plus slugging (OPS+; the sum of a player&#x27;s on-base percentage and slugging percentage, adjusted for the park and league in which he played and expressed as a percentage of the league average) would rank him exactly in the middle of the ten major league third basemen who were in the Hall of Fame in 2011.

One argument that was raised against Santo&#x27;s Hall of Fame candidacy is that his batting statistics over the course of his career were significantly better at home than on the road. He hit 216 of his 342 home runs at home, and only 126 on the road. His career batting average at home was .296, versus .257 on the road. However, several players elected to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA, such as Carl Yastrzemski, Wade Boggs, Jim Rice and Kirby Puckett, batted significantly better in their home parks than they did on the road. Hall of Famers with a significant differential between their home numbers and road numbers in terms of home runs include Mel Ott (323 homers at home and 188 on the road), Frank Robinson (321 at home, 265 on the road), Jimmie Foxx (299 at home, 235 on the road) and Hank Greenberg (205 at home, 126 on the road). Others have also commented that two Cubs 
players who were in their prime during Santo&#x27;s prime years have already been honored by the Hall of Fame (Ferguson Jenkins and Billy Williams), and the Cubs also featured a third Hall of Famer, Ernie Banks, who was arguably past his prime, yet the team never won a pennant. However, the late 1960s Cubs were far from the only team in baseball history with multiple Hall of Famers that did not win a pennant or a World Series.

Santo also fell short of such traditional standards of Hall election as 3,000 hits and 500 home runs; however, by the time his career ended, only two third basemen (Brooks Robinson and Lave Cross) had even collected 2,500 hits, and only one (Eddie Mathews) had reached the 500-home run plateau. Bill James, a notable statistical guru who has ranked Santo among the 100 greatest players of all time (sixth among third basemen), believed his election to the Hall of Fame was long overdue.

Even though Santo was disappointed at being bypassed by the Hall of Fame, on the day his jersey number 10 was retired by the Cubs, the ever-optimistic and emotional &quot;old Cub&quot; told the cheering Wrigley Field crowd, &quot;This is &quot;my&quot; Hall of Fame!&quot; During Ryne Sandberg&#x27;s Hall of Fame acceptance speech in 2005, Sandberg reiterated his support for Santo&#x27;s selection, saying, &quot;...for what it&#x27;s worth, Ron Santo just gained one more vote from the Veterans Committee.&quot; On April 19, 2007, the Illinois House of Representatives adopted HB 109 (Cross), urging the Veterans Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame to elect Ron Santo to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
While Santo initially received little support for induction into the Hall of Fame, his standing among baseball enthusiasts and sabermetricians gradually increased over time, culminating with his induction to the Hall of Fame two years after his death.

====Hall of Fame election====

On December 5, 2011, the 16-member Golden Era Committee that began voting on ten candidates selected by the BBWAA screening committee, was composed of Hank Aaron, Pat Gillick, Al Kaline, Ralph Kiner, Tommy Lasorda, Juan Marichal, Brooks Robinson, Billy Williams, Paul Beeston, Bill DeWitt, Roland Hemond, Gene Michael, Al Rosen, Dick Kaegel, Jack O&#x27;Connell, and Dave Van Dyck. They were charged with determining whether Santo would be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2012. Williams, Santo&#x27;s long-time teammate and friend, had made a fresh case for Santo, emphasizing his personal struggle with diabetes during his career, and his post-retirement charitable work to try to find a cure. Santo received 15 of the 16 possible votes and was the only one of the ten Golden Era Ballot candidates to be elected to the Hall of Fame by the committee&#x27;s first vote. Santo&#x27;s widow Vicki accepted the plaque on Induction Day, and spoke about his love of the Cubs and his devotion to people with diabetes.

In 1960, Santo married his high school sweetheart Judy Scott. Together, the couple had three children. They divorced in 1982. The following year, he married his second wife Vicki; they remained married until his death. The couple resided in Bannockburn, Illinois.

==Legacy==
Santo led the league in double plays six times (1961, 1964, 1966–68, 1971), tying the major league record held by Heinie Groh; Mike Schmidt also later tied this record. He led the National League in total chances every season from 1961 through 1968. He appeared at third base in every Cubs game from April 19, 1964 through May 31, 1966, establishing a league record with 364 consecutive games at the position; his 164 games at third base in 1965 remain the major league record.

He won the NL Player of the Month award three times: June 1963 (.384, 6 HR, 22 RBI); July 1964 (.395, 7 HR, 27 RBI); and June 1969 (.400, 6 HR, 34 RBI).

Santo broke Eddie Mathews&#x27; NL record of 369 career double plays at third base in 1972, and in 1973 he broke Mathews&#x27; league records of 4,284 assists and 6,606 total chances. Schmidt passed Santo&#x27;s record for double plays in 1986, his record for assists in 1987, and his mark for total chances in 1988. During his 14-season run with the Cubs, Santo hit 337 home runs, then the eighth most by a NL right-handed hitter; his 1,071 career walks with the Cubs remain the team record for a right-handed hitter. He was the first third baseman to hit 300 home runs and win five Gold Gloves, a feat since matched only by Schmidt and Scott Rolen.

Santo became the first player in major league history to wear a batting helmet with protective ear flaps, when in 1966, in the midst of trying to break the Cubs&#x27; modern consecutive-game hitting streak record of 27 games (set by Hack Wilson in 1929), Santo was sidelined for nearly two weeks following a pitch thrown by the Mets&#x27; Jack Fisher. The beaning fractured his cheekbone and ended his consecutive playing streak. When he returned (and broke the hitting record with a 28-game streak) he was wearing an improvised ear flap on his batting helmet in order to protect the injury; ear flaps have since become standard equipment on batting helmets.

In 1999, he was named to the Cubs All-Century Team.

On September 28, 2003, Santo&#x27;s jersey No. 10 was retired by the Cubs organization, making him the third player so honored behind his teammates Ernie Banks (#14) and Billy Williams (#26). Other prominent Cubs had worn No. 10 after Santo&#x27;s retirement, notably Dave Kingman and Leon Durham; the most recent wearer had been interim manager Bruce Kimm, just the previous year. In April 2004, Santo was inducted into the inaugural class of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (Washington&#x27;s high school athletics league) Hall of Fame as a graduate of Seattle&#x27;s Franklin High School. About a month after Santo&#x27;s death, Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts announced that Santo would be honored by the Cubs in the 2011 season. From spring training through the end of the season, the Cubs wore a patch on the sleeve of their jersey with the number 10 on it.

Shortly after his death in 2010, Bleacher Report released a ranking of the 50 most beloved announcers in baseball history, in which Santo was placed 16th. On his entry, Sam Westmoreland wrote about Santo that &quot;he made his share of errors, but that just made him all the more lovable and beloved. He passed as an icon, and deserves a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame.&quot;

<doc id="292702" wikidata="Q237103" url="?curid=292702" title="Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné">
<text>Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, [[marquise]] de Sévigné (; 5 February 1626 – 17 April 1696), also widely known as Madame de Sévigné or Mme de Sévigné (), was a French aristocrat, remembered for her letter-writing. Most of her letters, celebrated for their wit and vividness, were addressed to her daughter, Françoise-Marguerite de Sévigné. She is revered in France as one of the great icons of French 17th-century literature.

==Life==
Marie de Rabutin-Chantal was born in the fashionable Place des Vosges (then called the &quot;Place Royale&quot;), Paris, to an old and distinguished family from Burgundy. Her father, Celse Bénigne de Rabutin, baron de Chantal, was the son of Saint Jeanne Françoise de Chantal, a friend and disciple of Saint Francis de Sales; her mother was Marie de Coulanges. Her father was killed during the English attack on the Isle of Rhé in July 1627, which began the Anglo-French War of 1627-1629. His wife did not survive him by many years, and Marie was left an orphan at the age of seven. She then passed into the care of her maternal grandparents.
When her grandfather, Philippe de Coulanges, died in 1636, her uncle, Christophe de Coulanges, abbé of Livry, became her guardian. She received a good education in his care and often referred to him in her correspondence as &quot;le Bien Bon&quot; [the very good].

Marie de Rabutin-Chantal married Henri, marquis de Sévigné, a nobleman from Brittany allied to the oldest houses of that province, but of no great estate. The marriage took place on 4 August 1644, and the couple went almost immediately to the Sévigné manor house of Les Rochers, near Vitré (which she was to immortalize in her letters). She gave birth to a daughter, Françoise, on 10 October 1646 (whether at Les Rochers or in Paris is not certain), and to a son, Charles, at Les Rochers on 12 March 1648.

Henri was a serial philanderer who spent money recklessly, but through her uncle&#x27;s careful financial oversight Marie was able to keep much of her fortune separate. On 4 February 1651, Henri de Sévigné was mortally wounded in a duel with the Chevalier d&#x27;Albret after a quarrel over his mistress, Mme de Gondran, and died two days later. Though only twenty-four when her husband died, Mme de Sévigné never married again. Instead, she devoted herself to her children. She spent most of 1651 in retirement at Les Rochers, but returned to Paris that November. Thereafter, she divided her time between the city and the countryside. In Paris, she frequented salons, especially that of Nicolas Fouquet, superintendent of finances to King Louis XIV.

Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s most amusing correspondence before her daughter&#x27;s marriage was addressed to her cousin and friend Roger de Bussy-Rabutin. However, in 1658, she quarrelled with him.

On 29 January 1669, her daughter Françoise married François Adhémar de Monteil, comte de Grignan, a nobleman from Provence who had been married twice before. The couple intended to live in Paris, but Grignan was soon appointed as lieutenant governor of Provence, necessitating that they live there. 
Mme de Sévigné was very close to her daughter, and sent her the first of her famous letters on 6 February 1671. Their correspondence lasted until Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s death.

By 1673, Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s letters were being copied and circulated. Therefore, she knew that her letters were semi-public documents and crafted them accordingly.

The year 1676 saw several important events in Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s life. For the first time she was seriously ill and did not thoroughly recover until she had visited Vichy. The letters depicting life at this 17th-century spa are among her best. The trial and execution of Madame de Brinvilliers took place that same year. This event figures in the letters.

The following year, in 1677, she moved into the Hôtel Carnavalet and welcomed the whole Grignan family to it. She returned to Provence in October 1678. On 17 March 1680, she had the grief of losing La Rochefoucauld, the most eminent and one of her closest friends. The proportion of letters for the decade 1677–1687 is much smaller than that which represents the decade preceding it. In February 1684, her son Charles married Jeanne Marguerite de Mauron from Brittany. In the arrangements for this marriage, Mme de Sévigné divided all her fortune among her children and reserved for herself only part of the life interest.

In 1688, the whole family was greatly excited by the first campaign of the young marquis de Grignan, Mme de Grignan&#x27;s only son, who was sent splendidly equipped to the siege of Philippsburg. In the same year, Mme de Sévigné attended the Saint-Cyr performance of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Esther&quot;, and some of her most amusing descriptions of court ceremonies and experiences date from this time. In 1689, she wrote positively of the preacher Antoine Anselme.

The year 1693 saw the loss of two of her oldest friends: her cousin Roger de Bussy-Rabutin and Madame de La Fayette. There was a family connection between these two great writers: in 1650, Mme de La Fayette&#x27;s mother, then widowed, married Renaud de Sévigné, uncle of the great letter writer. Another friend almost as intimate, Mme de Lavardin, followed in 1694.

During an illness of her daughter in 1696, Mme de Sévigné caught a &quot;fever&quot; (possibly influenza or pneumonia), and died on 17 April at Grignan, and was buried there. Her daughter was not present during her illness.

==Works==

Madame de Sévigné corresponded with her daughter for nearly thirty years. A clandestine edition, containing twenty-eight letters or portions of letters, was published in 1725, followed by two others the next year. Pauline de Simiane, Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s granddaughter, decided to officially publish her grandmother&#x27;s correspondence. Working with the editor Denis-Marius Perrin of Aix-en-Provence, she published 614 letters in 1734–1737, then 772 letters in 1754. The letters were selected according to Mme de Simiane&#x27;s instructions: she rejected those that dealt too closely with family matters, or those that seemed poorly written. The remaining letters were often rewritten in accordance with the style of the day. This raises a question of the letters&#x27; authenticity.

Of the 1,120 known letters, only 15 percent are signed, the others having been destroyed soon after they were read. However, in 1873, some early manuscript copies of the letters, directly based on Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s originals, were found in an antique shop. These accounted for about half of the letters to Mme de Grignan.

Mme de Sévigné&#x27;s letters play an important role in the novel &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; by Marcel Proust where they figure as the favorite reading of the narrator&#x27;s grandmother, and, following her death, his mother. De Sévigné is the model for María, Marquesa de Montemayor, in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot;.

<text>French West Africa (, ) was a federation of eight French colonial territories in West Africa: Mauritania, Senegal, French Sudan (now Mali), French Guinea (now Guinea), Ivory Coast, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Dahomey (now Benin) and Niger. The federation existed from 1895 until 1958. Its capital was Saint-Louis in Senegal until 1902, and then Dakar until the federation&#x27;s collapse in 1960.

With an area of 4,689,000 km2, French West Africa was eight times the size of Metropolitan France. French Equatorial Africa had an additional area of 2,500,000 km2.

== History ==
Until after World War II, almost none of the Africans living in the colonies of France were citizens of France. Rather, they were &quot;French subjects,&quot; lacking rights before the law, property ownership rights, rights to travel, dissent, or vote. The exception was the Four Communes of Senegal: those areas had been towns of the tiny Senegal Colony in 1848 when, at the abolition of slavery by the French Second Republic, all residents of France were granted equal political rights. Anyone able to prove they were born in these towns was legally French. They could vote in parliamentary elections, which had been previously dominated by white and mixed-race residents of Senegal.

The Four Communes of Senegal were entitled to elect a deputy to represent them in the French parliament in 1848–1852, 1871–1876, and 1879–1940. In 1914, the first African, Blaise Diagne, was elected as the deputy for Senegal in the French Parliament. In 1916, Diagne pushed a law through the National Assembly (loi Blaise Diagne) granting full citizenship to all residents of the so-called Four Communes. In return, he promised to help recruit millions of Africans to fight in World War I. Thereafter, all black Africans of Dakar, Gorée, Saint-Louis, and Rufisque could vote to send a representative to the French National Assembly.

As the French pursued their part in the scramble for Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, they conquered large inland areas, and at first, ruled them as either a part of the Senegal colony or as independent entities. These conquered areas were usually governed by French Army officers, and dubbed &quot;military territories&quot;. In the late 1890s, the French government began to rein in the territorial expansion of its &quot;officers on the ground&quot;, and transferred all the territories west of Gabon to a single governor based in Senegal, reporting directly to the Minister of Overseas Affairs. The first governor-general of Senegal was named in 1895, and in 1904, the territories he oversaw were formally named French West Africa (AOF). Gabon would later become the seat of its own federation French Equatorial Africa (AEF), which was to border its western neighbor on the modern boundary between Niger and Chad.

France abolished slavery in French West Africa. This process was gradual. Slavery was formally illegal in all French land including their colonies from 1848, but this law only applied to French citizens in territories officially under French law, which meant that indigenous subjects without French citizenship were not obliged to obey. 
In French West Africa in 1903-1905, the French authorities started to enforce anti-slavery laws against indigenous slave owners in territories under French control due to pressure from French abolitionists: the laws against slave trade were enforced, and fugitive slaves were not returned to their owners. 

In 1905, the French officially abolished slavery in most of French West Africa. From 1906 to 1911, as emancipation progressed, over a million slaves in French West Africa fled from their masters to earlier homes.

After the Fall of France in June 1940 and the two battles of Dakar against the Free French Forces in July and September 1940, authorities in West Africa declared allegiance to the Vichy regime, as did the colony of French Gabon in AEF. Gabon fell to Free France after the Battle of Gabon in November 1940, but West Africa remained under Vichy control until the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942.

Following World War II, the French government began a process of extending limited political rights in its colonies. In 1945 the French Provisional Government allocated ten seats to French West Africa in the new Constituent Assembly called to write a new French Constitution. Of these five would be elected by citizens (which only in the Four Communes could an African hope to win) and five by African subjects. The elections brought to prominence a new generation of French-educated Africans. On 21 October 1945 six Africans were elected, the Four Communes citizens chose Lamine Guèye, Senegal/Mauritania Léopold Sédar Senghor, Ivory Coast/Upper Volta Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Dahomey/Togo Sourou-Migan Apithy, Soudan-Niger Fily Dabo Sissoko, and Guinea Yacine Diallo. They were all re-elected to the 2nd Constituent Assembly on 2 June 1946.

In 1946, the Loi Lamine Guèye granted some limited citizenship rights to natives of the African colonies. The French Empire was renamed the French Union on 27 October 1946, when the new constitution of the Fourth Republic was established. In late 1946 under this new constitution, each territory was for the first time (excepting the Four Communes) able to elect local representatives, albeit on a limited franchise, to newly established General Councils. These elected bodies had only limited consultative powers, although they did approve local budgets. The Loi Cadre of 23 June 1956 brought universal suffrage to elections held after that date in all French African colonies. The first elections under universal suffrage in French West Africa were the municipal elections of late 1956. On 31 March 1957, under universal suffrage, territorial Assembly elections were held in each of the eight colonies (Togo as a UN trust Territory was at this stage on a different trajectory). The leaders of the winning parties were appointed to the newly instituted positions of Vice-Presidents of the respective Governing Councils — French Colonial Governors remained as Presidents.

The Constitution of the French Fifth Republic of 1958 again changed the structure of the colonies from the French Union to the French Community. Each territory was to become a &quot;Protectorate&quot;, with the consultative assembly named a National Assembly. The Governor appointed by the French was renamed the &quot;High Commissioner&quot;, and made head of state of each territory. The Assembly would name an African as Head of Government with advisory powers to the Head of State. Legally, the federation ceased to exist after the 1958 French constitutional referendum to approve this French Community. All the colonies except Guinea voted to remain in the new structure. Guineans voted overwhelmingly for independence. In 1960, a further revision of the French constitution, compelled by the failure of the French Indochina War and the tensions in Algeria, allowed members of the French Community to unilaterally change their own constitutions. Senegal and former French Sudan became the Mali Federation (1960–61), while Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper Volta and Dahomey subsequently formed the short-lived Sahel-Benin Union, later the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente.

== Territorial changes ==
The administrative structure of French colonial possessions in West Africa, while more homogeneous than neighboring British possessions, was marked by variety and flux. Throughout the history of the AOF, individual colonies and military territories were reorganized numerous times, as was the &quot;Government General&quot; in Dakar. French Upper Volta was formed and parceled out to neighboring colonies twice. The future states of Mauritania and Niger remained out of the federation until the 1920s and 1940s respectively. They were &quot;Military Territories&quot;, directly controlled by the French Army. World War II, and the passing of the Loi Cadre (&quot;Overseas Reform Act of 1956&quot;), both radically restructured the administration of the colonies. French Togoland, seized by France from Germany in World War I, was for most of this period not nominally a colony but a Mandate territory.

== Federal structure ==
In theory, the Governors-General of the AOF reported directly to the Minister of Colonies in Paris, while individual colonies and territories reported only to Dakar. Originally created in 1895 as a union of Senegal, French Sudan, French Guinea and Ivory Coast only, the federation was placed on a permanent footing in 1904. A governor-general was based first in Saint-Louis, then (from 1902) in Dakar (both in Senegal, the oldest French settlement). The AOF subsequently expanded to neighbouring French-ruled territories: Dahomey was added in 1904, after having been put under colonial tutelage in 1892; Mauritania in 1920, and when the territory of Upper Volta was divided from French Sudan by colonial decree in 1921, it automatically also entered the AOF. Between 1934 and 1937, the League of Nations Mandate territory of French Togoland was subsumed into Dahomey, and between its seizure from Germany in World War I and independence it was administered through the AOF. In 1904, both Mauritania and Niger were classed &quot;Military Territories&quot;: ruled by the AOF in conjunction with officers of the French Colonial Forces.

== Colonial administration ==

Each colony of French West Africa was administered by a Lieutenant Governor, responsible to the Governor General in Dakar. Only the Governor-General received orders from Paris, via the Minister of Colonies. The Minister, with the approval of the French Chamber of Deputies (French National Assembly after 1946), chose Lieutenants Governor and Governors-General.

=== Governors-General ===
=== Grand Council of French West Africa ===
Beginning in 1946, a Grand Council of French West Africa was created in Dakar. Two representatives from each colony, usually the Lieutenant Governor and a representative of the French population there, were seated. This council had only consultative powers over the office of the Governor General. The functioning of such bodies rested upon the Indigénat legal code of 1885.

== Local administration ==
Despite this state of flux, and with the exception of the Senegalese Communes, the administrative structure of French rule at the lower levels remained constant, based upon the Cercle system. This was the smallest unit of French political administration in French colonial Africa that was headed by a European officer. They might range in size, but French Sudan (modern Mali) consisted of less than a dozen Cercles for most of its existence. Thus, a Cercle Commander might be the absolute authority over hundreds of thousands of Africans.

=== Cercles ===
A Cercle consisted of several cantons, each of which in turn consisted of several villages, and was almost universal in France&#x27;s African colonies from 1895 to 1946.

The &quot;Cercle Commander&quot; (&quot;commandant de cercle&quot;) was subject to the authority of a District Commander, and the government of the colony above him, but was independent of the Military structure (outside Military areas, e.g.: modern Niger and Mauritania prior to the Second World War). Below the &quot;Cercle Commander&quot; were a series of African &quot;Chefs de canton&quot; and &quot;Chefs du Village&quot;: &quot;chiefs&quot; appointed by the French and subject to removal by the Europeans. As well, the &quot;Cercle Commander&quot; made use of a large number of servants, employees, and African officers such as the &quot;Gardes-de-cercle&quot; police, any military units seconded to them by government authorities, and sub-administrators such as the &quot;Precepteur du marché&quot; trade inspectors, etc.

Because of administrative practice and geographic isolation, Cercle Commanders had a tremendous amount of power over the lives of the Africans around them. The Cercle Commanders also had tremendous power over the economic and political life of their territories. Legally, all Africans outside the Four Communes of Senegal were &quot;subjects&quot; under the Indigénat legal code of 1885. This code gave summary powers to French administrators, including the rights to arrest, try, punish and imprison subjects. It also gave French local authorities the right to requisition forced labour, usually limited to able-bodied men for a few weeks a year, but in practice having few restrictions. These &quot;tools&quot; included the Civilizing mission ideology common in the period following the First World War. Every new Cercle Commander might well bring with him vast projects for development and the restructuring of the people&#x27;s lives he governed.

=== Chiefs ===
The other official office particular to the local administration of French West Africa was the &quot;Chief&quot;. These were Africans appointed by French officials for their loyalty to France, regardless of their rights to local power. These chiefs were assigned created territories based on the scale of a French Canton, as well as on the small scale tribal structures the French found in the coastal areas of the Rivières du Sud colony in the 1880s, modern Guinea. The Canton, then, was much smaller than, and qualitatively different from, the pre-colonial states of the Sahel (such as the Toucouleur Empire) which the French would later conquer.

They were styled &quot;Chefs de canton&quot;, &quot;Chefs du Village&quot;, or occasionally taking the title of precolonial states assimilated by the French structure whole. This last was uncommon, but became more prevalent in the later colonial territories conquered, as fewer administrators were available to rule over larger, less populated territories with strong pre-colonial state structures.

Where these larger polities resisted the French, they were often broken into small chiefdoms. Larger polities which presented a segment of the elite who would work with the French were maintained under new leadership. The Sultan of Agadez, the Sultan of Damagaram, and the Djermakoy of Dosso are examples of these large scale &quot;Chefs de canton&quot;. But even these rulers were replaced by individuals handpicked by French authorities.

Regardless of source, chiefs were given the right to arm small numbers of guards and made responsible for the collection of taxes, the recruitment of forced labour, and the enforcement of &quot;customary law&quot;. In general, Canton Chiefs served at the behest of their Cercle Commander and were left to see to their own affairs as long as calm was maintained and Administrative orders were carried out.

== Geography ==
With an area of some (mostly the desert or semi-desert interior of Mauritania, Sudan and Niger) extending from Africa&#x27;s westernmost point to the depths of the Sahara, the Federation contained more than ten million inhabitants at its creation, and some 25 million at its dissolution. The AOF included all of the Senegal River valley, most of the Niger River valley, and most of the West African Sahel region. It also included tropical forests in Ivory Coast and Guinea, the Fouta Djallon highlands, and the Aïr Mountains of modern Niger.

=== Territories ===
* Ivory Coast
* Dahomey (currently Benin)
* French Sudan (currently Mali)
* Guinea
* Mauritania
* Niger
* Senegal
* Upper Volta (currently Burkina Faso)
* French Togoland (currently Togo)
* Enclaves of Forcados and Badjibo (in modern Nigeria)

== Postage stamps ==
The French colonial territories in the federation issued their own postage stamps until 1943. In many cases the stamps were inscribed with the name of the federation &quot;Afrique Occidentale Française&quot; as well as the colony&#x27;s own name.

In 1943 and 1944, stamps of Senegal and Mauritania were overprinted with new values and valid throughout French West Africa.

The first issues printed specifically for the federation were the Eboue common design type and a definitive series depicting colonial soldiers, both in 1945. A series of 1947 featured 19 scenes and people of the various colonies, then during the 1950s there were about 30 various commemoratives. The last issue inscribed &quot;Afrique occidentale française&quot; and &quot;RF&quot; was the Human Rights issue of December 1958.

It was followed by a Stamp Day issue on 21 March 1959, which omitted the federation&#x27;s name and was inscribed &quot;CF&quot; along with &quot;Dakar-Abidjan&quot; for use in Ivory Coast and Senegal.

<text>The Mohawk River is a river in the U.S. state of New York. It is the largest tributary of the Hudson River. The Mohawk flows into the Hudson in Cohoes, New York, a few miles north of the state capital of Albany. The river is named for the Mohawk Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. A major waterway, in the early 19th century, the river&#x27;s east-west valley provided the setting and water for development of the Erie Canal, as a key to developing New York. The largest tributary, the Schoharie Creek, accounts for over one quarter (26.83%) of the Mohawk River&#x27;s watershed. Another main tributary is the West Canada Creek, which makes up for 16.33% of the Mohawk&#x27;s watershed. 

==Course==
The river&#x27;s source is at the confluence of the West Branch Mohawk River and East Branch Mohawk River in north-central Oneida County. It begins flowing generally southeastward towards the Hamlet of Hillside, first receiving Blue Brook then McMullen Brook and Haynes Brook. In Hillside is the confluence of Lansing Kill, after which it flows towards the Hamlet of North Western receiving Stringer Brook along the way. After North Western it receives Tannery Brook then Wells Creek in the Hamlet of Frenchville. At Frenchville it curves to the southwest and heads toward the Hamlet of Westernville receiving Deans Gulf along the way. In Westernville it enters Delta Reservoir. After exiting the reservoir it heads south toward the City of Rome receiving Hurlbut Glen Brook and passing the Rome Fish Hatchery along the way. On the south side of the City it enters the Erie Canal and begins to flow east.
After Rome the river flows generally east through the Mohawk Valley, passing by the cities of Utica, Little Falls, Canajoharie, Amsterdam, and Schenectady before entering the Hudson River at Cohoes, just north of Albany.

===Modifications===
The river and its supporting canal, the Erie Canal, connect the Hudson River and port of New York with the Great Lakes at Buffalo, New York. The lower part of the Mohawk River has five permanent dams, nine movable dams (seasonal), and five active hydropower plants.

Schoharie Creek and West Canada Creek are the principal tributaries of the Mohawk River. Both of these tributaries have several significant dams including the Hinckley Dam on the West Canada and the Gilboa Dam on the upper reaches of Schoharie Creek. The Gilboa Dam, which was completed in 1926 as part of the New York City water supply system, is the subject of an active and aggressive rehabilitation project.

==Geology==
The Mohawk watershed drains a large section of the Catskill Mountains, the Mohawk Valley proper, and a section of the southern Adirondack Mountains. All three regions have distinct bedrock geology, and the underlying rocks become progressively younger to the south. Overall, this part of New York is represented by lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that unconformably overlie the Grenville-aged (Proterozoic, here about 1.1 billion years old) metamorphic rocks of the Adirondacks. In the watershed, these rocks are only significant in the headwaters of the West Canada Creek. Much of the main trunk of the Mohawk River sits in Cambro-Ordovician carbonates (limestone) and Middle Ordovician sandstones and shales. The southern tributaries (Catskill Mountains) are underlain by a thin sequence of Devonian limestones that are overlain by a thick sequence of sandstones and shale of the Catskill Delta, which is also Devonian in age.

During the Pleistocene (c. 1.8 to 0.01 mya), the watershed was extensively modified by continental glaciation. As a result of glacial scour and deposition, the surficial deposits in much of the watershed are poorly sorted boulder- and clay-rich glacial till. During deglaciation, several glacial lakes left varved clay deposits. In the final stages of deglaciation, approximately 13,350 years ago, the catastrophic draining of Glacial Lake Iroquois, a pro-glacial lake, was through what would become the modern Mohawk Valley. In this final phase, the enormous discharge of water caused local deep scour features (e.g. the Potholes at Little Falls), and extensive sand and gravel deposition, which is one of the key sources of municipal groundwater including the Scotia Delta, which is also known as the Great Flats Aquifer.

==Etymology==
The river is named for the Mohawk Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. In the 1700s and before, the Mohawk people, a section of Iroquois Confederacy, were based in the Mohawk Valley. Their territory ranged north to the St. Lawrence River, southern Quebec and eastern Ontario; south to greater New Jersey and into Pennsylvania; eastward to the Green Mountains of Vermont; and westward to the border with the Iroquoian Oneida Nation&#x27;s traditional homeland territory.

==History==
The river has long been important to transportation and migration to the west as a passage through the Appalachian Mountains, between the Catskill Mountains and Allegheny Plateau to the south and the Adirondack Mountains to the north. The Mohawk Valley allowed easier passage than going over the mountains to the north or south of the valley. As a result, it was strategically important during the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, and a number of important battles were fought here. The fertile Mohawk Valley also attracted early settlers.

The river was the highway of the native Mohawk people. The Mohawk name for the river is &quot;Teionontatátie&quot;, &quot;a river flowing through a mountain&quot; (or &quot;Yeionontatátie&quot;, &quot;going round a mountain&quot;).
The first recorded European exploration of the Mohawk was a trip by the Dutchman Harman Meyndertsz van den Bogaert in 1634. He followed the river upstream from Albany for a distance of 100 miles, including all the territory of the Mohawks.

In 1661 Dutch colonists founded the city of Schenectady on the Mohawk River approximately from Albany. &quot;For fifty years Schenectady was the outpost of civilization and Dutch-English rule in the Mohawk valley.&quot;

In 1712 the British, now in control of New York, built Fort Hunter at the confluence of the Mohawk and the Schoharie Creek, about upriver from Schenectady. Around 600 Palatine Germans were settled along the Mohawk and Schoharie Creek. Swedish explorer and botanist, Pehr Kalm, visited the area along the river in the mid-18th century where he encountered some of the indigenous peoples belonging to the Iroquois confederacy, and has left a record for posterity of some of their customs in his journal.

In the early nineteenth century water transport was a vital means of transporting both people and goods. A corporation was formed to build the Erie Canal off the Mohawk River to Lake Erie. Its construction simplified and reduced the difficulties of European westward settler migration.

The Mohawk Valley still plays an important role in transportation. Railroads followed the Water Level Route, as did major east–west roads such as Route 5 and Interstate 90.

The Mohawk River Heritage Corridor Commission was created to preserve and promote the natural and historic assets of the Mohawk River. This commission was created by the NY State Legislature in 1997 to improve historic preservation along the river.

===Flooding and discharge===
The Mohawk River has a relatively long record of flooding that has been documented back to settlement in the 17th century. The average volume of water that flows through the Mohawk is about every year. Much of the water flows through the watershed in the spring as snow melts rapidly and enters the tributaries and the main trunk of the river. The maximum average daily flow on the river occurs between late March and early April. For the period between 1917 and 2000, the highest mean daily flow is c. as measured at Cohoes, near the confluence with the Hudson. The lowest mean daily flow of occurs in late August. There is a long record of significant and damaging floods along the entire length of the river.

Because the river and its tributaries typically freeze in the winter, the spring melt is commonly accompanied by ice floes that get stuck and jammed along the main trunk of the river. This annual spring breakup typically occurs in the last few weeks of March, although there are numerous floods that have occurred before or after this time, such as in 2018 when the ice jam breakup happened in late February after record warm weather in the region. These ice jams can cause considerable damage to structures along the riverbanks and on the floodplain. The most severe flood of record on the main trunk of the Mohawk River was the spring breakup flood that occurred from 27 to 28 March 1914. This flood caused a tremendous amount of damage to the infrastructure because it was a spring breakup flood with enormous amounts of ice. Ice jams of some significance occur about every other year.

One major flood on the Mohawk was on 26–29 June 2006, during the Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006. Flooding was caused by a stalled frontal system that resulted in of rain across central New York and widespread flooding occurred in the Mohawk, Delaware, and Susquehanna watersheds. Across the state, this event caused over $227 million in damage and resulted in the loss of four lives. This flooding was acute in the upper parts of the Mohawk watershed.

The Mohawk River also saw significant flooding during the weeks between August 21, 2011, and September 5, 2011, due to torrential rains experienced from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Many of the Mohawk Barge Canal locks sustained major damage, especially near Waterford and Rotterdam Junction.

Another major flood was on June 28, 2013. It was caused by heavy rain that had fallen in the region for weeks. On the night of June 27, 2013, the Jordanville area reported that 4 inches of rain fell in one hour. The next day, the Mohawk River flooded the valley, residents were stranded and without power for about a week. There was considerable damage everywhere, especially Mohawk and Fort Plain.

On July 3, 1985, Congress approved a project at Amsterdam for work to be done on the Mohawk River and South Chuctanunda Creek. South Chuctanunda Creek was cleared at the upstream end of the project for approximately . New flood walls were installed along the right bank of South Chuctanunda Creek and the Mohawk River. A new wing wall was installed on the left bank of South Chuctanunda Creek at the upstream end of the New York Central Railroad Bridge. The South Chuctanunda was realigned and reshaped for approximately and riprap was added where needed. The existing channel of the South Chuctanunda was slightly reshaped downstream of the Florida Avenue bridge. Construction plans for the project were issued on November 15, 1962. Construction work began on February 25, 1963, with construction being completed on June 4, 1965. The flood walls protect the city of Amsterdam from floods of from the Mohawk River and floods of from South Chuctanunda Creek. The floodwalls were able to prevent $13.6 million in damages from tropical storms Lee and Irene. In July 2012, governor Cuomo announced a project to improve the flood walls on South Chuctanunda Creek and Mohawk River. The floodwalls and river banks were repaired at a cost of $164,248.

==Watershed management==
Historically, the Mohawk watershed has lacked a watershed management plan typical in many adjacent basins. In 2010, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation released the Mohawk River Basin Action Agenda, which is the first framework for a watershed management plan in this basin. This plan identifies five priority goals for the Mohawk River Basin that are designed to enhance ecosystem health and the vitality of the region. The Action Agenda, developed by the NYS DEC in collaboration with a number of stakeholders in the basin with public input, advocates an ecosystem-based approach to watershed management. In October 2014, Riverkeeper, an environmental advocacy and clean water watchdog organization, announced that they will be expanding the reach of their efforts from the Hudson River to the Mohawk as well.
