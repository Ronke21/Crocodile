<text>The Franklin eBookMan is a discontinued handheld device made to read ebooks. This gadget, made from 1999 until 2002, has standard PDA functions and can play and record sounds. It has a black on green touchscreen, contains 8 or 16 MB of RAM, and uses its own proprietary operating system. Its handwriting recognition system accepts nearly natural handwriting. 

Three models of eBookman were produced: the 900 (8 Mb memory - no backlight), the 901 (8 Mb memory - backlight) and the 911 (16 Mb memory - backlight). All come with an MMC (not SD-compatible for the 8Mb model, but properly compatible with the 16Mb models.) slot which allows for memory expansion. The eBookMan can read contacts and appointments from Microsoft Outlook; synchronization with a Windows PC is done through a USB cable. 

Early eBookMan units lost all information stored on them when the batteries were changed. Franklin acknowledged the problem, and replaced all defective units at no charge. Its digital rights management system is tied directly to the hardware, which resulted in an immediate problem for marketing: it was not possible to try the device in-store since it wouldn&#x27;t work until the user connected it to an Internet-linked PC and downloaded their own registered version of the OS. Support was provided via a home page at Franklin, now removed, which when development ceased in 2002 was still describing the device as &#x27;new&#x27;.

Although research and development on the eBookMan ceased in 2002, new eBookMans continued to be available from Ectaco. As of April 30, 2011, all support and downloads for eBookMan were discontinued. 

There is an active user base. Some users have written programs for the eBookMan. Many games were developed and a free version of the Mobipocket reader was developed for the eBookMan to take the place of the underpowered Franklin reader which came with the device.

<text>Harry Peter &quot;Bud&quot; Grant Jr. (May 20, 1927 – March 11, 2023) was an American professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL) and Canadian Football League (CFL). Grant was head coach of the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings for 18 seasons; he was the team&#x27;s second (1967–83) and fourth (1985) head coach, leading them to four Super Bowl appearances, 11 division titles, one league championship and three National Football Conference championships. Before coaching the Vikings, he was the head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for 10 seasons, winning the Grey Cup four times.

Grant attended the University of Minnesota and was a three-sport athlete, in football, basketball, and baseball. After college, he played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Minneapolis Lakers where he won the 1950 NBA Finals. Grant left the NBA to play in the NFL with the Philadelphia Eagles before leaving for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL. A statue of Grant stands in front of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers&#x27; current stadium, Princess Auto Stadium.

Grant is the most successful coach in Vikings history, and he was the most successful in Blue Bombers history until he was surpassed by Mike O&#x27;Shea during the 2024 season. He is the fifth-most winningest coach in professional football history with a combined 286 wins in the NFL and CFL. Grant was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. He was the first coach to guide teams to both the Grey Cup and the Super Bowl, the only other being Marv Levy.
==Early life==
Grant was born on May 20, 1927, in Superior, Wisconsin, to Harry Peter Sr. and Bernice Grant. His mother called him &quot;Buddy Boy&quot;, which later became &quot;Bud&quot;. As a child, Grant was diagnosed with poliomyelitis and a doctor suggested he become active in sports to strengthen his weakened leg muscles over time. He started with baseball, adding basketball and football as he got older. Due to a lack of organized school teams, he arranged football games between neighborhoods and contacted kids from other schools to participate. During weekends, he spent time outdoors alone hunting rabbits. In his late teens and college years, he played organized baseball in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

In 1940, Grant and two friends were duck hunting on Yellow Lake in northern Wisconsin when the Armistice Day Blizzard occurred. Grant survived by sheltering at a gas station while his friends were at a farmer&#x27;s house.

Grant played football, basketball, and baseball at Superior Central High School.

==Playing career==
===University of Minnesota===
He graduated from high school in 1945 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois and played on the football team coached by Paul Brown. Using an acceptance letter from the University of Wisconsin–Madison to be discharged from the service, Grant decided to attend the University of Minnesota instead. He was a three-sport, nine-letterman athlete in football, basketball, and baseball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers, earning All-Big Ten Conference honors in football twice.

While at the University of Minnesota, Grant was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

===Minneapolis Lakers===
After leaving the University of Minnesota, Grant was selected in both the NFL and NBA draft. He was selected in the first round (14th overall) of the 1950 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and fourth round (47th overall) selection of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft. He played 35 games during the 1949–50 NBA season and signed with the Lakers for the 1950–51 NBA season. He chose to continue his basketball career with the Lakers because they were local and because he was offered a raise to stay for the season. Grant&#x27;s close friend Sid Hartman was the Lakers&#x27; general manager, which may have influenced his decision to remain with the team. He averaged 2.6 points per game in his two seasons as a reserve with the Lakers and was a member of the 1950 championship team. After the death of Arnie Ferrin in 2022, he became the oldest living NBA champion.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
After two seasons in the NBA, Grant decided to end his professional basketball career. He contacted the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL and agreed to play for the team during the 1951 NFL season. In his first season with the Eagles, Grant played as a defensive end and led the team in sacks (an unofficial statistic at the time). He switched to offense as a wide receiver for his second season with the club and ranked second in the NFL for receiving yardage, with 997 yards on 56 catches, including seven touchdowns.

Grant&#x27;s contract expired at the end of the 1952 NFL season and the Eagles refused to pay him what he thought he was worth. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL had been interested in Grant while in college. Grant left for Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1953 and became the first professional player to &quot;play out his option&quot; and leave for another team. He played for the Blue Bombers until 1956 as an offensive end and was named a Western Conference all-star three times. He led the Western Conference in pass receptions for the 1953, 1954, and 1956 seasons and receiving yards for the 1953 and 1956 seasons. He also holds the distinction of having made five interceptions in a playoff game, played on October 28, 1953, which is a record in all of professional football. The Blue Bombers played for the Grey Cup in 1953, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 41st Grey Cup game.

==Coaching career==
=== Winnipeg Blue Bombers ===

Blue Bombers management decided that they needed a new coach prior to the 1957 season. On January 30, 1957, Grant accepted the Blue Bombers head coaching position after impressing management with his ability to make adjustments on offense and defense as a player. Club president J. T. Russell thought that Grant could coach even though nobody else did. Grant remained the head coach of the Blue Bombers until 1966. At age 29 (he was 30 by the time he coached his first game), Grant became the youngest head coach in CFL history.

During his ten seasons as head coach in Winnipeg, he led the team to six Grey Cup appearances winning the championship four times in 1958, 1959, 1961, and 1962. He finished his Blue Bombers coaching career with a regular season record of 102 wins, 56 losses, and two ties and an overall record of 118 wins, 64 losses, and 3 ties. Grant was the CFL Coach of the Year in 1965. Grant took on additional responsibilities as a club manager between 1964 and 1966. Max Winter, the Minnesota Vikings founder, contacted Grant in 1961 and asked him to coach the new NFL expansion team. Grant declined the offer and remained in Winnipeg until 1967 when Winter and General Manager Jim Finks were successful in luring Grant to Minnesota.

=== Minnesota Vikings ===

The Minnesota Vikings hired Grant as their head coach on March 11, 1967, taking over from their original coach, Norm Van Brocklin.

Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach&#x27;s lead if he were to panic or lose his poise during the course of a game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and did not allow heaters on the sidelines during games. As per the latter practice it goes that Grant posited that with the heaters present on the sidelines the players would gather around the source of the warmth but if the heaters were not present the players would be paying attention to the game.

In his second year, Grant led the team to a divisional championship and his first NFL playoffs appearance. In 1969, he led the team to its first NFL Championship and their first appearance in the Super Bowl. The Vikings lost in Super Bowl IV to the American Football League champion Kansas City Chiefs. Prior to the 1970 season, Minnesota released Joe Kapp. After starting Gary Cuozzo at quarterback in 1970 and 1971, the Vikings re-acquired Fran Tarkenton prior to the 1972 season. During the 1970s, the Vikings appeared in three more Super Bowls (VIII, IX, and XI) under Grant and lost each one, but he was the first coach to lead a team to four Super Bowl appearances. He retired after the 1983 NFL season and was succeeded by Les Steckel, who led the team to a 3–13 record the following season. Steckel was fired as head coach after the 1984 season and Grant returned as coach for the Vikings in 1985. After one season where he returned the club to a 7–9 record, he stepped down again. Grant retired as the eighth most successful coach in NFL history with an overall record of 161 wins, 99 losses, and 5 ties. As of 2021, he also remains the most successful coach in Vikings history. During his tenure with the Vikings, he led the Vikings to four Super Bowl games, 11 division titles, one league championship, and three NFC championships.

Grant was the first coach to lead his teams to both a Grey Cup and a Super Bowl, with the only other one being Marv Levy.

:* The 1982 NFL season was shortened to nine games due to a players&#x27; strike.

== Post-coaching career ==
After retiring, Grant became a less prominent public figure and focused on hunting and fishing as well as supporting environmental reforms. He was a spokesperson against Native American hunting and fishing treaty rights in Minnesota. In 1993, Grant&#x27;s efforts resulted in a death threat. In 2005, he spoke at a Capitol rally in Minnesota for the conservation of wetlands, wetland wildlife, and water. Grant addressed 5,000 supporters, saying, &quot;In this legislative session, we want to see some action. It&#x27;s more important than any stadium they could ever build in this state.&quot; In 1983, Grant was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and in 1994, he would be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame by Sid Hartman, who was by then a senior Minnesota sports columnist.

Until his death, Grant was still listed as a consultant for the Vikings and maintained an office at the team&#x27;s headquarters at TCO Performance Center in Eagan, Minnesota.

In 2004, Bud Grant would be asked to return to the position of Vikings head football coach by Red McCombs, hypothetically replacing Mike Tice. However, the deal would break down over the salary Grant would receive. As Grant would state afterwards, &quot;I would have come back...for a short time, anyway. It certainly would have been exciting to do at 78 years old.&quot;

In 2014, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers unveiled a statue of Coach Grant outside IG Field. In 2016, Grant was inducted into the Blue Bomber ring of honour.

== Personal life and death ==
Bud married Pat (née Patricia Nelson; born March 28, 1927) in 1950, and they had six children (Kathy, Laurie, Harry III &quot;Peter&quot;, Mike, Bruce, and Danny). Bruce died July 25, 2018, from brain cancer. Mike started coaching in 1979 at Minnetonka High School, then became the Forest Lake head coach from 1981 to 1986 and 1989 to 1991. In between those stints, Mike served as the Saint John&#x27;s (Minnesota) offensive coach in 1987 and 1988. Mike has been the football head coach for Eden Prairie High School in Eden Prairie, Minnesota since 1992. Mike Grant has coached Eden Prairie to 11 state championships since he began his tenure at the school. Bud Grant&#x27;s grandson Ryan Grant was a quarterback and linebacker at Eden Prairie and played at the University of Minnesota (2008–2012) as a linebacker. Bud&#x27;s granddaughter Jenny is married to former NFL quarterback Gibran Hamdan.

Pat Grant died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on March 4, 2009, at age 81.

Bud Grant died at home in Bloomington, Minnesota, on March 11, 2023, at age 95.

<doc id="272590" wikidata="Q778412" url="?curid=272590" title="Pro Football Hall of Fame">
<text>The Pro Football Hall of Fame is the hall of fame for professional American football, located in Canton, Ohio. Opened on September 7, 1963, the Hall of Fame enshrines exceptional figures in the sport of professional football, including players, coaches, officials, franchise owners, and front-office personnel, almost all of whom made their primary contributions to the game in the National Football League (NFL).

, there are a total of 382 members of the Hall of Fame. Between four and nine new inductees are normally enshrined every year. For the 2020 class, a 20-person group consisting of five modern-era players and an additional 15 members, known as the &quot;Centennial Slate&quot;, were elected to the Hall of Fame to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NFL.

The Chicago Bears have the most inductees, with 34 (42, including players with minor portion of their career with team).

==History==

The city of Canton, Ohio, successfully lobbied the NFL to have the Hall of Fame built in Canton, citing three reasons. First, the NFL was founded in Canton on September 17, , (at that time it was known as the American Professional Football Association). Second, the now-defunct Canton Bulldogs were a successful pro football team and the NFL&#x27;s first repeat champion (in 1922 and 1923). Third, the Canton community held a fundraising effort that garnered nearly $400,000 () to get the Hall of Fame built. Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11, 1962, and the Hall of Fame was opened to the public on September 7, 1963.

The original building contained just two rooms and of interior space. In April , ground was broken for the first of many expansions. This first expansion cost $620,000, and was completed on May 10, . The size was increased to by adding another room. The pro shop opened with this expansion. This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time. This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the American Football League and its success in the final two AFL-NFL World Championship games.

In November 1977, work began on another expansion project, costing $1,200,000. It was completed in November 1978, enlarging the gift shop and research library, while doubling the size of the theater. The total size of the hall was now , more than 2.5 times the original size.

The building remained largely unchanged until July 1993. The Hall then announced yet another expansion, costing $9,200,000, and adding a fifth room. This expansion was completed on October 1, 1995, and increased the building&#x27;s size to . The most notable addition was the GameDay Stadium, which shows an NFL Films production on a Cinemascope screen.

In 2013, the Hall of Fame completed its largest expansion and renovation to date; the total size of the hall is now .

===Hall of Fame Village===

Hall of Fame Village, an estimated $900 million expansion project adjacent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, completed Phase I of construction in 2022, a Phase II is planned, although no news has been put out recently. 

===Executive directors or presidents===
*Dick McCann (April 4, 1962 – November 5, 1967)
*Dick Gallagher (April 1968 – December 31, 1975)
*Pete Elliott (February 1979 – October 31, 1996)
*John Bankert (November 1, 1996 – December 31, 2005)
*Steve Perry (April 24, 2006 – January 2014)
*David Baker (January 6, 2014 – October 16, 2021)
*Jim Porter (2021 – present)

==Inductees==
Through 2022, all players in the Hall, except Buffalo Bills guard Billy Shaw, played at least some part of their professional career in the NFL; Shaw played his entire career in the American Football League (AFL) prior to the 1970 AFL–NFL merger.

Though several Hall of Famers have had AFL, Canadian Football League, World Football League, United States Football League, Arena Football League and/or Indoor Football League experience, and there is a division of the Hall devoted to alternative leagues such as these, to this point no player, coach or contributor have made the Hall without having made significant contributions to either the NFL, AFL, or All-America Football Conference.

For CFL stars, there is a corresponding Canadian Football Hall of Fame; only one player, Warren Moon, and two coaches, Bud Grant and Marv Levy, are enshrined in both halls.

Again for the Arena Football League, there is also a corresponding Arena Football Hall of Fame; similarly, only one player, Kurt Warner, has been enshrined into both halls. The Indoor Football League, in which Terrell Owens played one season, has also established a Hall of Fame.

The Chicago Bears have the most Hall of Famers among the league&#x27;s franchises with either 40 or 32 enshrinees depending on whether players that only played a small portion of their careers with the team are counted.

===Selection process===

====Selection Committee====
Enshrinees are selected by a 50-person committee, largely made up of media members, officially known as the Selection Committee.

Each city that has a current NFL team sends one representative from the local media to the committee; a city with more than one franchise sends one representative for each franchise.

There are also 15 at-large delegates, including one representative from the Pro Football Writers Association. Except for the PFWA representative, who is appointed to a two-year term, all other appointments are open-ended, and terminated only by death, incapacitation, retirement, or resignation.

====Voting procedure====

To be eligible for the nominating process, a player or coach must have been retired for at least five years; any other contributor such as a team owner or executive can be voted in at any time.

Fans may nominate any player, coach or contributor by simply writing via letter or email to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Selection Committee is then polled three times by mail (once in March, once in September, and once in October) to eventually narrow the list to 25 semi-finalists. In November, the committee then selects 15 finalists by mail balloting.

A Seniors and Contributors Committee, subcommittees of the overall Selection Committee, nominate Seniors (those players who completed their careers more than 25 years ago) and Contributors (individuals who made contributions to the game in areas other than playing or coaching). The Seniors Committee and Contributors Committee add one or two finalist(s) on alternating years, which makes a final ballot of 18 finalists under consideration by the full committee each year. Committee members are instructed to only consider a candidate&#x27;s professional football contributions and to disregard all other factors.

The Selection Committee then meets on &quot;Selection Saturday&quot;, the day before each Super Bowl game to elect a new class. To be elected, a finalist must receive at least 80% support from the Committee. At least four, but no more than nine, candidates are elected annually.

===2020 Centennial Slate===
In 2020, a special Blue-Ribbon Panel selected an additional 15 new members, known as the Centennial Slate, to be inducted into the Hall of Fame to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NFL. Among these 15 members, ten would be seniors. On January 11, during the weekend of the NFL divisional playoffs, Hall of Fame president David Baker went on the set of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; to personally tell Bill Cowher, who was working as an analyst on that pregame show, that he was selected as one of the members of the Centennial Slate.

One day later, Baker went on the set of &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; to inform Jimmy Johnson, working as an analyst on Fox&#x27;s studio show, that he was also selected. The rest of the Centennial Slate members were revealed on January 15.

The remaining 13 members of the Centennial Slate elected to the Hall of Fame in 2020 are: Jim Covert, Winston Hill, Harold Carmichael, Duke Slater, Ed Sprinkle, Steve Sabol, Alex Karras, Bobby Dillon, Donnie Shell, George Young, Cliff Harris, Mac Speedie, and former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.

They were enshrined in 2021 due to COVID-19, but are still considered part of the Centennial Class of 2020.

===Enshrinement ceremony===

The enshrinement ceremony is the main event of the annual &quot;Enshrinement Week Powered by Johnson Controls&quot; that kicks off every NFL season. The celebration is held in Canton, throughout the week surrounding the enshrinement ceremony. All members of the Hall of Fame are invited to attend the annual ceremony.

Enshrinees do not go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of a certain team. Rather, all of an enshrinee&#x27;s affiliations are listed equally. While the Baseball Hall of Fame plaques generally depict each of their inductees wearing a particular club&#x27;s cap (with a few exceptions, such as Catfish Hunter and Greg Maddux), the bust sculptures of each Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee make no reference to any specific team. In addition to the bust that goes on permanent display at the Hall of Fame, inductees receive a distinctive Gold Jacket, and previous inductees nearly always wear theirs when participating at the new inductee ceremonies.

Previous induction ceremonies were held during the next day (Sunday from 1999 to 2005, Saturday in 2006), situated on the steps of the Hall of Fame building.

Starting in 2002, the ceremony was moved to Fawcett Stadium (now Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium), where it was held from 1963 to 1965. Since 2007, the enshrinement ceremony has been held on the Saturday night, since 2017 two days after the Hall of Fame Game. In 2022, the ceremony was moved to noon ET.

==Hall of Fame Game==
The Hall of Fame Game, the annual NFL preseason opener, is played in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium at Hall of Fame Village in Canton, Ohio. In 2017, the Hall of Fame Game was held for the first time on Thursday night. The preseason classic kicks off Enshrinement Week and marks the start of the NFL preseason.

==Black College Football Hall of Fame==
The Pro Football Hall of Fame museum includes a permanent exhibit recognizing the inductees of the Black College Football Hall of Fame. The two organizations partnered in 2016, also creating the Black College Football Hall of Fame Classic played at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

==Ralph Hay Pioneer Award==

The Ralph Hay Pioneer Award is an American football award given by the Pro Football Hall of Fame periodically to an individual who has made significant and innovative contributions to professional football. The award is named after Canton Bulldogs owner and National Football League founder and chief organizer Ralph Hay. It was originally called the Daniel F. Reeves Pioneer Award, named after Los Angeles Rams owner and hall of fame inductee Dan Reeves. The award is the highest and the most prestigious honor given by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, other than enshrinement. As of 2022, Steve Sabol, Art McNally, Marion Motley and Bill Willis are the only people to receive the award and also become a Hall of Fame inductee.

===Honorees===

==Criticism==

The small number of candidates elected each year has helped foster what some perceive as an inequality of representation at certain positions or in certain categories of player, to the exclusion of defensive players in general (defensive backs and outside linebackers in particular), special teams players, wide receivers, and those from the &quot;seniors&quot; category. There has also been criticism that deserving players have been overlooked because they played most or all of their careers on poor teams.

In 2009, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article criticized the Hall for not including punter Ray Guy on its ballot. Guy was eventually inducted as part of the 2014 class for the Hall of Fame.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame is unique among North American major league sports halls of fame in that officials have been generally excluded. Only two figures, both inducted for their work as supervisor or director of officiating as opposed to game officiating—1966 inductee Hugh &quot;Shorty&quot; Ray and 2022 inductee Art McNally—have been enshrined; McNally is the only inductee in the Hall to have experience as an in-game official. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and Hockey Hall of Fame have each inducted game officials as members.

Another prominent absence from the Hall is sports-journalist and broadcaster Howard Cosell, who has yet to either be awarded the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award or even get fully inducted despite his well-known association with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;; an August 2010 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article hints that Cosell may have even been &quot;blacklisted&quot; by the NFL.

As the late 2010s approached, a number of controversial and polarizing figures began to reach eligibility for the Hall. For example, Darren Sharper&#x27;s career achievements make him a candidate for the Hall, but there is debate over whether he should be inducted due to his conviction on multiple rape and drug distribution charges after he retired. Official guidelines state that off the field character issues are not allowed to influence the selection process and have not affected the ability of figures such as O. J. Simpson and Lawrence Taylor to remain enshrined in the Hall. 

Terrell Owens&#x27; exclusion from the Hall in his first two years of eligibility despite his strong individual statistics was a subject of public debate: while Owens was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018, he refused to attend the enshrinement ceremony.

<doc id="272596" wikidata="Q138198" url="?curid=272596" title="Spanish Socialist Workers' Party">
<text>The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party ( ; PSOE ) is a social democratic political party in Spain. The PSOE has been in government longer than any other political party in modern democratic Spain: from 1982 to 1996 under Felipe González, 2004 to 2011 under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and since 2018 under Pedro Sánchez.

The PSOE was founded in 1879, making it the oldest party currently active in Spain. The PSOE played a key role during the Second Spanish Republic, being part of the coalition government from 1931 to 1933 and 1936 to 1939, when the republic was defeated in the Spanish Civil War. The party was then banned under the Francoist dictatorship and its members and leaders were persecuted or exiled; the ban was only lifted in 1977 in the transition to democracy. Historically Marxist, it abandoned the ideology in 1979. Like most mainstream Spanish political organizations since the mid–1980s, the PSOE has been considered by experts to have embraced a positive outlook towards European integration.

The PSOE has historically had strong ties with the General Union of Workers (UGT), a major Spanish trade union. For a couple of decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership. However, since the 1980s the UGT has frequently criticised the economic policies of the PSOE, even calling for general strikes against the PSOE governments on 14 December 1988, 28 May 1992, 27 January 1994 and 29 September 2010, jointly with the Workers&#x27; Commissions, another major trade union in Spain. Both the trade unions and the left have often criticised the economic policies of the PSOE for their economically liberal nature. They have denounced policies including deregulation and the increase in precarious and temporary work, cuts in unemployment and retirement benefits, and the privatisation of big state-owned organisations and public services. The PSOE has traditionally attracted a higher share of female voters than its rivals. Same-sex marriage and adoption were legalised in 2005 under the Zapatero Government and, more recently, a transgender rights bill was passed to allow more freedom in regards to gender identity.

The PSOE is a member of the Party of European Socialists, Progressive Alliance and the Socialist International. The PSOE&#x27;s 21 Members of the European Parliament sit in the Socialists and Democrats European parliamentary group.

== History ==
=== Restoration regime (1879–1931) ===

The PSOE was founded by Pablo Iglesias on 2 May 1879 in the Casa Labra tavern in Tetuán Street near the Puerta del Sol at the centre of Madrid. Iglesias was a typesetter who had previously come in contact with the Spanish section of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association and with Paul Lafargue. The first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people on 20 July of that same year. The bulk of the growth of the PSOE and its affiliated trade union, the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) was chiefly restricted to the Madrid-Biscay-Asturias triangle up until the 1910s. The obtaining of a seat at the Congress by Pablo Iglesias at the 1910 Spanish general election in which the PSOE candidates presented within the broad Republican–Socialist Conjunction became a development of great symbolical transcendence and gave the party more publicity at the national level.
The PSOE and the UGT took a leading role in the general strike of August 1917 in the context of the events leading to the Spanish crisis of 1917 during the conservative government of Eduardo Dato. The strike was crushed by the army as a result of further undermining of the constitutional order. The members of the organizing committee (Julián Besteiro, Francisco Largo Caballero, Daniel Anguiano and Andrés Saborit) were accused of sedition and sentenced to life imprisonment. Sent to the prison of Cartagena, they were released a year later after being elected to the Cortes in the 1918 Spanish general election. During the 1919−1921 crisis of the socialist internationals, the party experienced tensions between the members endorsing the Socialist International and the advocates for joining the Communist International. Two consecutive splits of dissidents willing to join the Communist International, namely the Spanish Communist Party in 1920 and the Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party in 1921, broke away from the PSOE and soon merged to create the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). The PSOE was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.

After the death of Pablo Iglesias in 1925, Julián Besteiro replaced him as president of both the PSOE and the UGT. During the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, corporatist PSOE and UGT elements were willing to engage in limited collaboration with the regime, against the political stance defended by other socialists such as Indalecio Prieto and Fernando de los Ríos, who instead advocated a closer collaboration with republican forces. The last years of the dictatorship saw a divergence emerge among the corporatist which was personified by Francisco Largo Caballero, who began to endorse the rapport with bourgeois republicans; and Julián Besteiro, who continued to show great distrust towards them. Besteiro&#x27;s refusal to participate in the Revolutionary Committee led to his resignation as president both of the party and the trade union in February 1931. He was replaced as president of the party by Remigio Cabello.

=== Second Republic and Civil War (1931–1939) ===

After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931, three PSOE members were included in the cabinet of the provisional government, namely Indalecio Prieto (Finance), Fernando de los Ríos (Education) and Francisco Largo Caballero (Labour). The socialist presence remained in the rest of cabinets of the Social-Azañist Biennium (1931–1933).

After the November 1933 general election which marked a win for the centre-right forces in a climate of increasing polarization and growing unemployment, along with a desire to make amends for the mistake of not having sided with the republicans in the election against the united right, Largo Caballero adopted a revolutionary rhetoric, calling for violent revolution and a transitionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Indalecio Prieto had also participated in the increasingly aggressive rhetoric, having already condemned the heavy-hand repression of the December 1933 largely anarchist uprising by the government, that has been cheered on by the CEDA leaders on parliament. The Socialist Youth of Spain (JSE) also engaged into a shrilling revolutionary rhetoric while Besteiro firmly opposed the insurrectionary drift of the militancy.
The formation of a new cabinet that included CEDA ministers in October 1934 was perceived among the left as a reaction, with the CEDA party being indistinguishable from contemporary fascism to most workers while CEDA leader Gil-Robles had advocated the establishment of a corporative state already in the 1933 electoral campaign. The UGT called for a nationwide general strike for 5 October which developed into a full-blown insurrection (the Revolution of 1934) in the mining region of Asturias which was vocally supported by socialists such as Largo Caballero and Prieto. After the end of the revolt, whose repression was entrusted to generals Francisco Franco and Manuel Goded, most PSOE and UGT leaders were jailed.
A growing rift between Prieto and Largo Caballero (with disparate views of politics, albeit sharing a general pragmatist approach) formed in 1935 while Besteiro&#x27;s hold on the party diminished significantly. Followers of Indalecio Prieto would ultimately become &quot;estranged from the party left&quot;. The PSOE formed part of the broad left-wing Popular Front electoral coalition that stood for election in the 1936 Spanish general election and achieved a victory in seats over the right.

In September 1936, a few months into the Spanish Civil War (which lasted until 1939), a cabinet presided over by Largo Caballero was formed (he also held the functions of Minister of War). In November, Largo Caballero succeeded in bringing some CNT members into his government. The left socialist &quot;caballeristas&quot; were revolutionary in rhetoric, although in reality they proposed moderate reformist policies while in government. The May Days of 1937 in Barcelona destabilised the government which was replaced by a new cabinet led by Juan Negrín, another socialist.

=== Clandestinity and exile (1939–1974) ===

With the PSOE reduced to clandestinity during the Francoist dictatorship, its members were persecuted, with many leaders, members and supporters being imprisoned or exiled and even executed. Prime Minister Negrín fled to France in March 1939 after the final collapse of the Republican front and his fall from office. The aging and ill Julián Besteiro, who preferred to stay in Spain over exile, died in a Francoist prison in 1940. Julián Zugazagoitia, government minister in 1937–1938, was captured in exile by the Gestapo, handed over to Spain and executed in 1940. The party was legalised again only in 1977 during the Spanish transition to democracy.

Disputes between the followers of Indalecio Prieto (who had exiled to Mexico) and Juan Negrín over the political strategy of the Republican government in exile soon arose. Negrín, whose 1937–1939 spell at the government in wartime was seen negatively by large elements of both &quot;caballerista&quot; and &quot;prietista&quot; extraction, had become vilified. The party was re-organized along new lines in 1944 in the 1st Congress in Exile that took place in Toulouse and in which Rodolfo Llopis became the party&#x27;s new secretary-general.

The PSOE congresses in exile during the post-war period were marked by strong anti-communist positions as a reflection of how the exiles remembered the last events of the Civil War (which featured bitter strifes with the communists) and in line with the stance of other parties of the Socialist International during the Cold War, neglecting any kind of rapprochement with the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). The relative void left in Spain by the PSOE, with a Toulouse-based direction lacking in dynamism and innovation, was filled by the PCE and other new clandestine organizations such as the Agrupación Socialista Universitaria (ASU), the Popular Liberation Front (FELIPE) or later the Enrique Tierno Galván&#x27;s Socialist Party of the Interior. The Toulouse executive board became increasingly detached from the party in Spain in the 1960s an insurmountable chasm between the former and the party in the interior was already defined by 1972.

=== Return to democracy ===
==== González leadership (1974–1996) ====

The 25th party congress was held in Toulouse in August 1972. In 1974, Felipe González was elected Secretary-General at the 26th party congress in Suresnes, replacing Llopis. González was from the reform wing of the party and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the party. The direction of the PSOE shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who had not fought the war. Llopis led a schism to form the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (historic). González showed intentions to move the party away from its Marxist and socialist background, turning the PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977, the PSOE became the unofficial opposition leading party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the Cortes Generales (which until then it had been the PCE, leading more aggressively among a larger representation of underground parties since the last free popular vote during the Civil War on Republican territory). Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the Popular Socialist Party agreed to merge into the PSOE.

At the 27th party congress in May 1979, González resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September of that year, the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which González was re-elected when the party agreed to move away from Marxism. Western European social-democratic parties supported González&#x27;s stand and the Social Democratic Party of Germany granted them money. PSOE party symbol was changed from the anvil with the book to the social democratic fist and rose created in the French Socialist Party, redrawn for the PSOE by José María Cruz Novillo. In the 1978 Spanish constitutional referendum, the PSOE supported the Spanish constitution which was approved. In the 1979 Spanish general election, the PSOE gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party. In the 1982 Spanish general election, the PSOE was victorious with 48.1% of the vote (10,127,392 total). González became Prime Minister of Spain on 2 December, a position he held until May 1996.

Although the party had opposed NATO, most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation after reaching the government. The González administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of &quot;North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&quot; and &quot;NATO&quot;, using the unofficial &quot;Atlantic Alliance&quot; terms. A symbol of this U-turn is Javier Solana who campaigned against NATO but ended up years later as its Secretary General. The PSOE supported the United States in the Gulf War (1991). PSOE won the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections. Under the Gonzalez administration, public expenditure on education, health, and pensions rose in total by 4.1 points of the country&#x27;s GDP between 1982 and 1992.

Economic crisis and state terrorism (GAL) against the violent separatist group ETA eroded the popularity of González. In the 1996 Spanish general election, the PSOE lost to the conservative People&#x27;s Party (PP) (PP). Between 1996 and 2001, the PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. The PSOE suffered a heavy defeat in the 2000 Spanish general election, with 34.7% of the popular vote. However, the PSOE remained as the ruling party in the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Asturias, Castilla-La Mancha and Extremadura.

==== Zapatero and Rubalcaba leadership (2000–2014) ====

In 2000, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was elected as the new Secretary-General, reforming the party. Later, the PSOE won the 2003 Spanish local elections. The PSOE strongly opposed the Iraq War which was supported by the Aznar government.
In the 2003 Catalan regional election, the PSOE&#x27;s Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) increased its vote total, but ended up in second place after Convergence and Union. After a period of negotiations, the party formed a pact with the Initiative for Catalonia Greens, the Republican Left of Catalonia and the United and Alternative Left, governing Catalonia until 2010.

In the 2004 Spanish general election, the PSOE won with almost 43% of the votes following the 11M terrorist (11 March) attacks. It was alleged by PP that the PSOE, with the help of the national newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, did not observe the &quot;reflection journey&quot; which forbade political parties from trying to sway public opinion (forbidden by Spanish law), calling the opposing political party &quot;assassins&quot; and blaming the terrorist attack on them. The PSOE maintained their lead in the 2004 European Parliament election.

In 2005, the PSOE called for a yes vote on the European Constitution. The PSOE also favoured the negotiations between the government and the ETA during the 2006 cease-fire which had a &quot;de facto&quot; end with the Madrid–Barajas Airport terrorist attack. In the 2008 Spanish general election, the PSOE won again, with Zapatero remaining prime minister. The PSOE increased their share of seats in the Congress of Deputies from 164 to 169 after the latest election.
After waning popularity throughout their second term, mainly due to their handling of the worsening economic climate in Spain in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the PSOE was defeated in the 2011 Spanish general election by the conservative People&#x27;s Party. Shortly after, an extraordinary congress was held in which Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, former Deputy to Zapatero and Minister of the Interior, was elected Secretary-General defeating Carme Chacón, the other candidate, who stood for the Zapatero platform. This victory caused huge internal divisions and weakened the party&#x27;s external image.

In 2013, the PSOE held a political conference which introduced a completely new platform, widely seen as a move to the left in an attempt to regain votes from parties such as the United Left, whose popularity rose steadily due to the general discontent with the two-party system and spending cuts. That platform was the basis for the 2014 European Parliament election manifesto, promoted as a solid alternative to the conservative plan for Europe. The expectations inside the party which chose Elena Valenciano as their election candidate were optimistic, but the PSOE suffered another defeat due to the appearance of new parties such as Podemos which managed to gain the support of left-wing voters, with PSOE winning 14 seats. Shortly thereafter, Rubalcaba resigned as Secretary-General and an Extraordinary Congress was convoked.

==== Sánchez leadership (2014–present) ====
This party congress was the first to use a primary election system with three candidates, namely Pedro Sánchez, Eduardo Madina and José Antonio Pérez Tapias. Sánchez was elected with 49% of the vote of the affiliates and therefore became Secretary-General on 27 July 2014.

In the 2015 Spanish municipal elections, the PSOE won 25% of the vote, one of its worst results since the restoration of democracy. Together with the fall of the People&#x27;s Party which won 27% of votes, it meant the end of the two-party system in Spain in favor of new parties. The PSOE alone lost 943 councilors. The 2015 Spanish general election produced a hung parliament broken into four major parties. Due to the large increase of parties such as Podemos (left) and Citizens (centre-right), the PSOE got about 20% of the vote, its worst result since democracy was restored. The parliament was so fragmented that no government could be formed and six months later new elections were held. The 2016 Spanish general election resulted in the PSOE losing a further five seats despite gaining 0.6% of the vote (still the party&#x27;s second-worst popular vote total after 2015 since the restoration of democracy), leaving the party with 85 seats in the parliament, their lowest total since the restoration of democracy and the fewest since the 1933 in Republican Spain left the party with 59 seats in the 473-member parliament.
With the exception of the 2015 Andalusian regional election, elections held during the early leadership of Sánchez were losses for the PSOE. In addition, the policy of pacts conducted by Sánchez after the 2016 general election, based on Sánchez&#x27;s outright refusal to facilitate a People&#x27;s Party government, caused a faction within the party critical of Sánchez to gain momentum, led by President of Andalusia Susana Díaz. On 28 September 2016, the Secretary of Federal Policy Antonio Pradas went to the party&#x27;s headquarters and presented the &quot;en bloc&quot; resignation of 17 members of the Federal Executive and the demands of those who resigned for the party to be run by an interim manager and to pressure Sánchez to resign as secretary-general. The Executive later lost two more members in the &quot;en bloc&quot; resignation, bringing the total number of resignations to 19. Resigning executives included the president of the party Micaela Navarro, the former Minister Carme Chacón, the President of Valencia Ximo Puig and the President of Castilla–La Mancha Emiliano García-Page. This launched the 2016 PSOE crisis. On the afternoon of 1 October 2016, after holding a tense Federal Committee meeting, Sánchez resigned as party General-Secretary, forcing an extraordinary party congress to choose a new General-Secretary. That night, it was reported that an interim manager would be chosen, later confirmed to be the President of Asturias Javier Fernández Fernández. Sánchez announced his intention to run for General-Secretary of the party as did Susana Díaz (one of the leaders of the anti-Sánchez faction of the party) and Patxi López, former President of the Basque Autonomous Community. At the 39th federal congress in June 2017, Díaz received 48.3% of endorsements, outpacing both Sánchez (43.0% of endorsements) and López (8.7% of endorsements), but Sánchez won an absolute majority of the party&#x27;s popular vote at 50.3% (Díaz received 39.9% and López 9.8%). Both Díaz and López withdrew before the delegate vote, returning Sánchez as the General-Secretary and ending the crisis. Sánchez won every region of Spain except for the home regions of López and Díaz.

In mid-2018, the National Court found that the conservative People&#x27;s Party profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the Gürtel case, confirming the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure that ran in parallel with the party&#x27;s official one since 1989 and that sentenced that the PP helped to establish &quot;a genuine and effective system of institutional corruption through the manipulation of central, autonomous and local public procurement&quot;. The PSOE Parliamentary Group in the Congress of Deputies filed a motion of no confidence against the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, presenting Sánchez as alternative candidate. The PSOE&#x27;s motion passed with the support of Unidos Podemos (UP), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT), Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Coalició Compromís, EH Bildu and New Canaries (NCa), bringing down the Rajoy government. The PP voted against the proposal, joined by Citizens (C&#x27;s), the Navarrese People&#x27;s Union (UPN) and the Asturias Forum (FAC). The Canarian Coalition (CC) abstained. Following the successful motion of no confidence, Sánchez became prime minister on 2 June 2018 in a minority government. In December 2018, the PSOE&#x27;s branch in Andalusia was defeated in the 2018 Andalusian regional election for the first time since the restoration of democracy, with a centre-right coalition of PP, C&#x27;s and the resurgent right-wing nationalists Vox taking power in the region.

For most of his first term as prime minister, Sánchez relied on support from the UP and the NC to get his agenda passed, occasionally being forced into negotiating with the Catalan separatist parties the ERC and the PDeCAT and the PNV on individual issues. In February 2019, the ERC, the PDeCAT and En Marea withdrew their support of Sánchez&#x27;s government by voting against and helping defeat the 2019 General State Budget and Sánchez called an early election for 28 April 2019. The April 2019 Spanish general election resulted in victory for the PSOE, with the party winning 123 seats on 28.7% of the vote in the Cortes and an absolute majority of 139 in the Senate, gains of 38 and 79 seats respectively. The PSOE also finished eight percentage points ahead of the PP which finished second in both seats and in the popular vote. At election night, party supporters demanded Sánchez to reject any coalition with Cs. On the same day as the April 2019 general election, the 2019 Valencian regional election resulted in the Valencian branch of the PSOE being re-elected in coalition with the Valencianist party Compromís and UP.

On 26 May 2019, the PSOE became the largest Spanish party in the European Parliament following the 2019 European Parliament election. The PSOE gained six seats to bring their total to 20 and won all but eight provinces in the country. 26 May also saw regional elections for every region in the country except Valencia, Catalonia, Andalusia, the Basque Country and Galicia. In every region, the PSOE gained seats and votes from the 2015 regional elections. The PSOE finished first in terms of votes and seats in every region except for Cantabria, where the Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC) finished first and the PSOE third behind the PP; and Navarra, where the conservative regionalist NA+ finished first and the Socialist Party of Navarre finished second. PSOE governments were re-elected in Castilla-La Mancha and Extremadura, with the party receiving an absolute majority of seats in both regions. The party took over the Presidency of the Canary Islands with the support of New Canaries and Podemos, ending 26 years of Canarian Coalition government. On the same date, the PSOE became the largest party in the municipalities following the local elections.

Following months of political deadlock, Sánchez called a second general election in seven months. In the November 2019 Spanish general election, the PSOE lost only three members of parliament and 0.7% of the popular vote in the election, but the PP and VOX gained 23 and 28 seats respectively, further worsening the deadlock. As of 23 December, there was still no government in place, although members of PSOE, PSC and UP have voted overwhelmingly to join in a coalition government, agreed to by Sánchez and UP Secretary-General Pablo Iglesias Turrión. On 5 January 2020, the PSOE–UP government failed its first investiture vote, with 166 votes in favor and 165 opposed with 18 abstentions and one UP parliamentarian absent, therefore the government fell short of an absolute majority. On 7 January, the investiture motion, this time requiring only a simple majority, passed with 167 votes in favour and 165 against. PSOE, UP, En Comú Podem, Grupo Común da Esquerda, PNV, Más País, Compromís, NCa, the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG) and Teruel Existe (TE) voted in favor of the government, with PP, Vox, Cs, Together for Catalonia (JxCat), the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), NA+, CC, PRC and FAC voting against while ERC and EH Bildu both abstained.

In 2021, PSOE started a podcast called &quot;Donde hay partido&quot;.

== Ideology ==
=== From Marxism to social democracy ===

The PSOE was founded with the purpose of representing and defending the interests of the proletariat formed during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. In its beginnings, the PSOE&#x27;s main objective was the defense of worker&#x27;s rights and the achievement of the ideals of socialism, emerging from contemporary philosophy and Marxist politics, by securing political power for the working class and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to achieve social ownership of the means of production. The ideology of the PSOE has evolved throughout the 20th century according to relevant historical events and the evolution of Spanish society.

In 1979, the party abandoned its definitive Marxist thesis at the hands of its Secretary-General Felipe González, not before overcoming great tensions and two party congresses, the first of which preferred to maintain Marxism. Before this situation, notable internal leaders such as and founded the internal faction of Left Socialists which included the militants who would not renounce Marxism. This allowed for the consolidation of the leftist forces in the PSOE. From this moment, the diverse events both outside and within the party led to projects that resembled those of other European social-democratic parties and acceptance of the defence of the market economy. The democratic socialist faction has been especially critical of the party&#x27;s Third Way move to the centre starting in the 1980s for its economic liberal nature, denouncing the policies of deregulation, cuts in social benefits, and privatisations.

The PSOE defines itself as social democratic, left-wing and progressive. It is grouped with other self-styled socialists, social democrats and labour parties in the Party of European Socialists, and supports pro-Europeanism. During his shift to the left in 2017, party leader Pedro Sánchez stood for a refoundation of social democracy in order to transition to a post-capitalist society and end neoliberal capitalism as well as for the indissoluble link between social democracy and Europe.

=== Federalism ===
During the Second Spanish Republic, the structure of the state was still open within the party, with two differing views, namely a centralist view as well as a federal one competing against one another. The later years of the Francoist dictatorship saw a period in which the PSOE defended the right to &quot;self-determination of the peoples of Spain&quot;, as a reflection of a newer ideological and a pragmatist approach of the party. Ultimately, the party, while sticking to their preference for a federal system, gradually ceased to mention the notion of self-determination during the Spanish transition to democracy. Ideas in support of to the independence of the autonomous territories of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia, have been adopted by some elements of the party, while the others in the PSOE are heavily critical of said notions, because, as they see it, the principle of territorial equality among the autonomous communities would be under threat if the autonomous territories became independent.

==== Terms ====
* &quot;Baron&quot;: unofficial term for the party&#x27;s regional leaders. They can be very powerful, especially if they run an autonomous community. There have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate in the past. Some &quot;barons&quot; were Pasqual Maragall (Catalonia), who did not run for re-election in 2006; Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra (Extremadura), who did not run for re-election in 2007; Manuel Chaves (Andalusia), who renounced Andalucia&#x27;s presidency in 2009 to assume the Third Vice Presidency of the Spanish Government; and José Montilla (Catalonia). The term &quot;baron&quot; is more colloquial than official, representing the great power regional leaders have in the party, but it has been falling out of use since 2016.
* &quot;Compañero&quot; (&quot;companion&quot;, &quot;comrade&quot;): a term of address among Socialists, analogous to the English &quot;comrade&quot; and the Russian &quot;tovarisch&quot;.
==== Factions ====
There have been several currents or internal factions within the PSOE based on personal or ideological affinities. Some of them have ended in splits from the PSOE. Examples of currents include the &quot;Terceristas&quot; (an historical faction that wished to enter the Third International) and, more recently, &quot;Izquierda Socialista&quot; (Socialist Left, the left-wing of the party since 1979). Some factions have brought infighting to the party, more notably: 
* The divide between &quot;Guerristas&quot; (followers of Alfonso Guerra), and &quot;Renovadores&quot; (Renewers, right-wing of the party). 
* More recently, the divide has been between the &quot;Sanchistas&quot; (followers of Pedro Sánchez) and &quot;Susanistas&quot; (followers of Susana Díaz). The &quot;Sanchistas&quot; won in the 2017 primary elections.

<text>Wellingborough ( ) is a market town and civil parish in North Northamptonshire, England, from London and from Northampton, north of the River Nene.

Originally named &quot;Wendelingburgh&quot; (the stronghold of Wændel&#x27;s people), the Anglo-Saxon settlement is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wendelburie&quot;. The town&#x27;s market was granted a royal charter in 1201 by King John. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 56,564. The built-up area also includes suburbs Wilby, Great Doddington, Little Irchester, Redhill Grange, Stanton Cross and Glenvale Park.

== History ==
The town was established in the Anglo-Saxon period and was called &quot;Wendelingburgh&quot;. It is surrounded by five wells: Redwell, Hemmingwell, Witche&#x27;s Well, Lady&#x27;s Well and Whytewell, which appear on its coat of arms. Henrietta Maria, the Queen Consort of King Charles I, came with her physician Théodore de Mayerne to take the waters on 14 July 1627.
The medieval town of Wellingborough housed a modest monastic grange – now the Jacobean Croyland Abbey – which was an offshoot of the monastery of Crowland (or Croyland) Abbey, near Peterborough, some down-river. This part of the town is known as Croyland.

All Hallows Church is the oldest existing building in Wellingborough and dates from c. 1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church. The earliest part of the building is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch. The church was enlarged with the addition of more side chapels and by the end of the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law. The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.

Wellingborough was given a Market Charter dated 3 April 1201 when King John granted it to the &quot;Abbot of Croyland and the monks serving God there&quot; continuing, &quot;they shall have a market at Wendligburg (Wellingborough) for one day each week that is Wednesday&quot;.

In the Elizabethan era the Lord of the Manor, Sir Christopher Hatton was a sponsor of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s expeditions; Drake renamed one of his ships the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; after the heraldic symbol of the Hatton family. A hotel in a Grade II listed building built in the 17th century, was known variously as the Hind Hotel and later as the Golden Hind Hotel.
During the English Civil War the largest substantial conflict in the area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted in the killing of a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.

Wellingborough was bombed during World War II, on Monday 3 August 1942. Six people were killed and 55 injured; fortunately, being a bank holiday, thousands of people were away at a fair at a nearby village. Many houses and other buildings in the centre of the town were damaged in the attack.

Originally the town had two railway stations: the first called , opened in 1845 and closed in 1966, linked Peterborough with Northampton. The second station, Wellingborough Midland Road, is still in operation with trains to London and the East Midlands. Since then the &#x27;Midland Road&#x27; was dropped from the station name. The Midland Road station opened in 1857 with trains serving Kettering and a little later Corby, was linked in 1867 to London St Pancras. In 1898 in the Wellingborough rail accident six or seven people died and around 65 were injured. In the 1880s two businessmen held a public meeting to build three tram lines in Wellingborough, the group merged with a similar company in Newport Pagnell who started to lay tram tracks, but within two years the plans were abandoned due to lack of funds.

== Governance ==
Wellingborough is part of the unitary authority of North Northamptonshire. Until 2021 it was seat of Borough Council of Wellingborough The borough council covered 20 settlements including the town together with Bozeat, Earls Barton, Easton Maudit, Ecton, Finedon, Great Doddington, Great Harrowden, Grendon, Hardwick, Irchester, Isham, Little Harrowden, Little Irchester, Mears Ashby, Orlingbury, Strixton, Sywell, Wilby, and Wollaston.

In April 2021 the Borough of Wellingborough was abolished and replaced by a new unitary authority called North Northamptonshire, which covers the areas of the districts of Wellingborough, Corby, East Northamptonshire and Kettering. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Concurrent with these changes, the unparished area of Wellingborough was established as a civil parish and gained a new Town Council, eliminating the need for charter trustees. Wellingborough has a mayor.

Wellingborough is part of the Wellingborough Constituency which includes the town, surrounding villages and other urban areas. The current MP is Gen Kitchen. Most wards in the (former) Borough Council of Wellingborough are covered by the constituency and also include the wards in the (former) East Northamptonshire district, the wards are: Bozeat, Brickhill, Croyland, Finedon, Great Doddington and Wilby, Harrowden &amp; Sywell (excluding Ecton, Mears Ashby, and Sywell which all appear in the Daventry constituency due to overlapping parliamentary and local government boundary reviews), Hatton, Higham Ferrers Lancaster, Higham Ferrers Chichele, Irchester, Isebrook, Queensway, Redwell, Rixon, Rushden Hayden, Rushden Spencer, Rushden Bates, Rushden Sartoris, Rushden Pemberton, Swanspool, Victoria, and Wollaston. Wellingborough is currently represented in the House of Commons by Gen Kitchen. In the 1918 general election it became the first constituency in southern England outside London to be represented by the Labour Party.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, Wellingborough was represented by the East Midlands constituency in the European Parliament.

== Geography ==

=== Geology ===
The town is sited on the hills adjoining the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian Middle Ages, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils seems to have been good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.

=== Iron ore ===
The most economically important aspect of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals, giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel-making process and the &quot;basic slag&quot; smelting chemistry, which combine to make high-quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best-developed bulk iron-producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.

Iron ore quarrying was a major industry in and around Wellingborough from the 1860s until the 1960s. James Rixon and Wiliam Ashwell opened a major ironworks on the north side of the town in 1870, supplied by the extensive ironstone quarries around Finedon to the east of the town. Three narrow gauge tramways served the iron ore industry, the Wellingborough Tramway, Neilson&#x27;s Tramway and the Finedonhill Tramway. The Wellingborough Tramway served Rixon&#x27;s ironworks until 1966.

=== Hydrography ===
Wellingborough has the river Ise to the east, across which are Irthlingborough and Finedon, and the river Nene to the south, across which is Irchester.
The Nene formed parts of the boundaries of the historical hundred of Hamferdsho, to which Wellingborough once belonged, and was made navigable past Wellingborough in the middle 18th century.
A new channel for it was constructed in the meadows below Wellingborough bridge in 1832.

Swanspool Brook, known in the 19th century as Swans&#x27;-pool, runs through the town past the southern end of Sheep Street, and around the erstwhile grounds of Croyland Abbey.
A bridge over it was built in 1798, replacing a prior smaller bridge, and in the 19th century an embankment ran for roughly alongside the stream from Croyland.

=== Climate ===
Wellingborough experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification) which is similar to most of the British Isles.

=== Compass ===
Wellingborough&#x27;s nearest towns are Northampton, Rushden, Higham Ferrers and Irthlingborough.

== Demography ==
Wellingborough&#x27;s population expanded rapidly from the 1960s and 1970s as agreements were signed between the Urban District Council and London County Council and the Greater London Council for the town to re-house over-spill population from London. Following the post World War II arrival of immigrants from the Commonwealth of Nations into Britain, a sizeable Black Caribbean and Indian/Pakistani community grew up in the market town, and now represents 11% of the town.

==Housing==

===Housing estates===
Wellingborough is home to three medium-sized public housing estates: Hemmingwell, Queensway and Kingsway. Hemmingwell and Kingsway as well as a large portion of Queensway were built to re-house over-spill population from London. There are also smaller estates such as Spring Gardens and Knights Court. These estates account for a large part of the Wellingborough residence. Glenvale Park, on the northern edge of the town, is a large-scale residential development under construction from the 2020s.

== Economy ==

Wellingborough has approximately 2,500 registered businesses within its boundaries. Much of the town centre was redeveloped during the 1970s, when it grew rapidly from London overspill. The Borough Council has adopted a &#x27;Town Centre Action Plan&#x27;. The former traditional economic structure based on footwear and engineering is gradually diversifying with wholesale, logistics, and service sectors providing new opportunities for employment.

As a market town, Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly located in the town centre. The only shopping centre, Swansgate, previously known as the Arndale Centre, was built in the 1970s. Since 2009 the Borough Council has been looking at rebuilding the centre and major stores want bigger floor-spaces. Supplementing the town centre shops are several out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets. The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market.

Other businesses operating within the town include motorsport, high performance engineering, distribution, engineering, environmental technology and renewable energy, digital and creative media, financial and business services, and global brands, once such brand being Cummins UK at Park Farm and Lok&#x27;nStore Plc. The revived incarnation of British electrical retailer Comet is also based in the town. There are several industrial estates in the town, these include Park Farm, Denington, Leyland and Finedon Road.
;Future developments

As part of its Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM) study, the government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire into which growth will be directed over the next thirty years. It allocates 12,800 additional homes to Wellingborough, and will also create additional facilities, further improve the town centre, improve infrastructure and increase employment opportunities. A jobs growth target of 12,400 jobs has been set to accompany the large scale housing growth. A plan for 3,000 homes north of the town has been accepted by the British Government after an appeal by Bee Bee Developments. The plan was first refused by Wellingborough Borough Council .

As a result, plans have been made for a major urban extension in the town, mainly to the east of the railway station. When finished, the town would be around 30% larger and 3,200 new homes would be built on &#x27;Stanton Cross&#x27; site, with new schools, bus stops, community centres, shops, a doctor&#x27;s surgery and new open spaces.
The railway station would be developed into an &#x27;interchange&#x27; with local buses and trains. The upgrade would provide a new platform, footbridge and new station buildings. Outside the station a new road bridge from Midland Road over the railway line is also planned with a new footbridge to reach the new development. Other plans to include the development of the High Street, Shelley Road and the north of the town areas are also being considered.

In November 2021 development on two fields between Park Farm and the Queensway estate was underway with a mix of one to four-bedroom properties and much needed social housing for the town. The development will comprise 600 properties, including 180 affordable homes, education, health and sports facilities and dedicated open space.

Developer contributions to the town also include money towards the expansion of All Saints Primary School and a new secondary school at Stanton Cross. ECL was appointed as Principal Contractors for the Park Farm’s infrastructure and groundworks.

<text>The Aylesbury duck is a breed of domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It is a large duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a horizontal stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.

Duck rearing became a major industry in Aylesbury in the 19th century. The ducks were bred on farms in the surrounding countryside. Fertilised eggs were brought into the town&#x27;s &quot;Duck End&quot;, where local residents would rear the ducklings in their homes. The opening of a railway to Aylesbury in 1839 enabled cheap and quick transport to the markets of London, and duck rearing became highly profitable. By the 1860s the duck rearing industry began to move out of Aylesbury into the surrounding towns and villages, and the industry in Aylesbury itself began to decline.

In 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.

The First World War badly damaged the remaining duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and leaving only a few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although there is only one surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.

==Origins and description==

The precise origin of the Aylesbury duck is unclear. Before the 18th century, duck breeds were rarely recorded in England, and the common duck, bred for farming, was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks would occasionally occur. White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts.

In the 18th century selective breeding of white common ducks led to a white domestic duck, generally known as the English White. Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury, and raising English Whites became popular in Aylesbury and the surrounding villages. By 1813 it was remarked that &quot;ducks form a material article at market from Aylesbury and places adjacent: they are white, and as it seems of an early breed: they are bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers&quot;. The duck farmers of Aylesbury went to great lengths to ensure the ducks retained their white colouring, keeping them clear of dirty water, soil with a high iron content and bright sunlight, all of which could discolour the ducks&#x27; feathers. Over time, selective breeding of the English White for size and colour gradually led to the development of the Aylesbury duck.

A rather large duck breed, the Aylesbury duck has pure white plumage and bright orange legs and feet. Its legs are placed midway along the body and it stands with its underside parallel to the ground, giving it a body described as &quot;boat-shaped&quot;. It has a relatively long and thin swan-like neck, and a long pink bill which comes straight out from the head.

An Aylesbury duckling incubates in the egg for 28 days. Until eight weeks after hatching, the time of their first moult, ducks and drakes (females and males) are almost indistinguishable. After moulting, males have two or three curved tail feathers and a fainter, huskier quack than the female. By one year of age, females and males grow to an average weight of respectively, although males can reach around .

Unlike the Rouen duck, the other popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after hatching weigh up to , large enough to eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after the close of the game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.

==Aylesbury duck farming==
Unlike most livestock farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on farms in the countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.

Stock ducks would be chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females at any given time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, typically to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.

Female Aylesbury ducks would not sit still for the 28 days necessary for their eggs to hatch, and as a consequence the breeders would not allow mothers to sit on their own eggs. Instead the fertilised eggs would be collected and transferred to the &quot;duckers&quot; of Aylesbury&#x27;s Duck End.

===Rearing===
The duckers of Aylesbury would buy eggs from the breeders, or be paid by a breeder to raise the ducks on their behalf, and would raise the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a secondary source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings. Many of the tasks related to rearing the ducks would be carried out by the women of the household, particularly the care of newly hatched ducklings.

The eggs would be divided into batches of 13, and placed under broody chickens. In the last week of the four-week incubation period the eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water to soften the shells and allow the ducklings to hatch.

Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid and thrive best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into groups of three or four ducklings, each accompanied by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker&#x27;s cottage, but towards the end of the 19th century they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.

The aim of the ducker was to get every duckling as fat as possible by the age of eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings&#x27; drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.
While ducks are naturally aquatic, swimming can be dangerous to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck&#x27;s growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.

Although there were a few large-scale duck rearing operations in Aylesbury, raising thousands of ducklings each season, the majority of Aylesbury&#x27;s duckers would raise between 400 and 1,000 ducklings each year. Because ducking was a secondary occupation, it was not listed in Aylesbury&#x27;s census returns or directories and it is impossible to know how many people were engaged in it at any given time. Kelly&#x27;s Directory for 1864 does not list a single duck farmer in Aylesbury, but an 1885 book comments that: 
The Duck End was one of the poorer districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19th century it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with stagnant water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.

===Slaughter and sale===
When the ducklings were ready for slaughter, the duckers would generally kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally take place in the morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been plucked. The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.

The market for duck meat in Aylesbury itself was small, and the ducks were generally sent to London for sale. By the 1750s Richard Pococke recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from Aylesbury to London every Saturday, and in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the ducks continued to be sent over the Chiltern Hills to London by packhorse or cart.

On 15 June 1839 the entrepreneur and former Member of Parliament (MP) for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built under the direction of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway&#x27;s Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1 October 1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.

A routine became established in which salesmen would provide the duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, take them to the stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.

==Developments in the late 19th century==
In 1845, the first National Poultry Show was held, at the Zoological Gardens in London; one of the classes of poultry exhibited was &quot;Aylesbury or other white variety&quot;. The personal interest of Queen Victoria in poultry farming, and its inclusion in the Great Exhibition of 1851, further raised public interest in poultry. From 1853 the Royal Agricultural Society and the Bath and West of England Society, the two most prominent agricultural societies in England, included poultry sections in their annual agricultural shows. This in turn caused smaller local poultry shows to develop across the country.

Breeders would choose potential exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, and they would be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20th century the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.

===Pekin ducks===

In 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced from China to Britain for the first time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought to have such a delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks.

Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were becoming inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were more susceptible to disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks did not have the delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.

Until the mid-19th century duck rearing was concentrated on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury&#x27;s soil by years of duck rearing, and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused the decline of the duck rearing industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.

==Decline==

By the time Beatrix Potter&#x27;s 1908 &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot;—about an Aylesbury duck although set in Cumbria—caused renewed interest in the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline. The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed. Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19th century, and from 1873 onwards competition from Pekin and Pekin cross ducks was undercutting Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace.

The First World War devastated the remaining duckers of Buckinghamshire. The price of duck food rose steeply while the demand for luxury foodstuffs fell, and wartime restructuring ended the beneficial financial arrangements with the railway companies. By the end of the war small-scale duck rearing in the Aylesbury Vale had vanished, with duck raising dominated by a few large duck farms. Shortages of duck food in the Second World War caused further disruption to the industry, and almost all duck farming in the Aylesbury Vale ended. A 1950 &quot;Aylesbury Duckling Day&quot; campaign to boost the reputation of the Aylesbury duck had little effect; by the end of the 1950s the last significant farms had closed, other than a single flock in Chesham owned by Mr L. T. Waller, and by 1966 there were no duck breeders or rearers of any size remaining in Aylesbury. the Waller family&#x27;s farm in Chesham remains in business, the last surviving flock of pure Aylesbury meat ducks in the country.

Aylesbury ducks were imported into the United States in 1840, although they never became a popular breed. They were added to the American Poultry Association&#x27;s &quot;Standard of Perfection&quot; breeding guidelines in 1876. As of 2013, the breed was listed as critically endangered in the United States by The Livestock Conservancy.

== Legacy ==
The Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury. Aylesbury United F.C. are nicknamed &quot;The Ducks&quot; and include an Aylesbury duck on their club badge, and the crest on the coat of arms of the town&#x27;s council features an Aylesbury duck on plaited straw, representing the two historic industries of the town. The Aylesbury Brewery Company, now defunct, featured the Aylesbury duck as its logo. Duck Farm Court is a shopping area of modern Aylesbury located near the historic hamlet of California, close to one of the main breeding grounds for ducks in the town, and there have been two pubs in the town with the name &quot;The Duck&quot; in recent years; one in Bedgrove that has since been demolished and one in Jackson Road that has recently been renamed.

<doc id="272603" wikidata="Q7380877" url="?curid=272603" title="Rushton Triangular Lodge">
<text>The Triangular Lodge is a folly, designed by Sir Thomas Tresham and constructed between 1593 and 1597 near Rushton, Northamptonshire, England. It is now in the care of English Heritage. The stone used for the construction was alternating bands of dark and light limestone.

==History==
The lodge is Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England.
Tresham was a Roman Catholic and was imprisoned for a total of fifteen years in the late 16th century for refusing to become a Protestant. On his release in 1593, he designed the Lodge as a protestation of his faith. His belief in the Holy Trinity is represented everywhere in the Lodge by the number three: it has three walls 33 feet long, each with three triangular windows and surmounted by three gargoyles. One wall is inscribed &#x27;15&#x27;, another &#x27;93&#x27;, and the last &#x27;TT&#x27;. The building has three floors, upon a basement, and a triangular chimney. Three Latin texts, each 33 letters long, run around the building on each facade. The quotations are:
#&quot;Aperiatur terra &amp; germinet Salvatorem&quot;: &quot;Let the earth open and … bring forth salvation&quot; (Isaiah 45:8)
#&quot;Quis separabit nos a charitate Christi?&quot;: &quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&quot; (Romans 8:35)
#&quot;Consideravi opera tua, Domine, et expavi&quot; : &quot;I have contemplated thy works, O Lord, and was afraid&quot; (a paraphrase of Habakkuk 3:2)

The windows on each floor are of different designs, all equally ornate. The largest, those on the first floor, are in the form of a trefoil, which was the emblem of the Tresham family. The basement windows are small trefoils with a triangular pane at their centre. The windows on the ground floor are of a lozenge design, each having 12 small circular openings surrounding a central cruciform slit. Heraldic devices of various families surround these windows.

The slightly raised ground floor has an entrance in the south-east facade. Over the door, beneath Tresham&#x27;s coat of arms, is the Latin inscription: &quot;Tres testimonium dant &quot;, meaning &quot;The number three bears witness&quot; or &quot;Tresham bears witness&quot; (Tres was the pet name his wife used for Tresham in her letters). Also above the door are the numbers &quot;5555&quot;. The figures are oddly shaped, and architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner speculated that this may once have read &quot;3333&quot;, but that number seems to have no particular significance. It has, however, been pointed out that if 1593 is subtracted from 5555, it leaves 3962 (the date, BC, of the Flood, according to Bede).

The principal room on each floor is hexagonal, thus leaving the three corner spaces triangular; one of these spaces contains a spiral staircase, the remaining two are small rooms. The building is crowned, above the quotations on each facade, by three steep gables each surmounted by a three-sided obelisk at the apex. Among the emblems carved on the gables are, on the southeast side, the highly symbolic seven-branched candelabrum within an octagonal plaque, and a heptagonal plaque depicting the seven eyes of God. On the north side are a Pelican in her piety, a symbol of Christ and the Eucharist, and a Hen and Chickens; on the southwest gable are a Dove and Serpent; and the Hand of God touching a globe. The triangular chimney is adorned with the holy monogram &quot;IHS&quot;, a lamb and cross, and a chalice.

While the lodge is indisputably a testament to Tresham&#x27;s faith, it is also an example of the Elizabethan love of allegory. Carved in the gables are the numbers &quot;3509&quot; and &quot;3898&quot;: these are said to be the dates (BC) of the Creation and the Calling of Abraham. Among the more recent dates carved on the building are 1580, thought to be the date of Tresham&#x27;s conversion, and also the future (at the time of their carving) dates 1626 and 1641 - to what do they refer? One suggestion is that not only are they divisible by three, but that, when 1593 is subtracted from them, they give 33 and 48, the years in which Jesus and the Virgin Mary are said to have died.

The broken inscriptions inscribed on each gable combine to read &quot;Respicite non mihi laboravi&quot;, which means &quot;Behold I have not laboured for myself alone&quot;.

The Lodge was the only building Tresham designed which he saw completed before his death in 1605. Nikolaus Pevsner in his &quot;The Buildings of England: Northamptonshire&quot; states: &quot;as a testament of faith this building must be viewed with respect&quot;. He also considered the lodge so architecturally important that he chose its photograph for the front cover of the first edition (1961) of his book; it also features on the cover of the 1973 edition.

The Lodge figures prominently in the chapter of Alan Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;Voice of the Fire&quot; concerning Tresham&#x27;s son Francis, a Gunpowder Plot conspirator. Moore, a Northampton native, touches on the history of several local sites in his speculative magical realist history of the town. It is also featured on the cover of the album &quot;Sun Structures&quot; released in February 2014 by the English psychedelic band Temples.

<doc id="272607" wikidata="Q1194193" url="?curid=272607" title="Peer group">
<text>In sociology, a peer group is both a social group and a primary group of people who have similar interests (homophily), age, background, or social status. Members of peer groups are likely to influence each others&#x27; beliefs and behaviour. 

During adolescence, peer groups tend to face dramatic changes. Adolescents tend to spend more time with their peers and have less adult supervision. Peer groups give a sense of security and identity. A study found that during the adolescent phase as adolescents spend double time with their peers compared to the time youth spend with their parents. Adolescents&#x27; communication shifts during this time as well. They prefer to talk about school and their careers with their parents, and they enjoy talking about sex and other interpersonal relationships with their peers. Children look to join peer groups who accept them, even if the group is involved in negative activities. Children are less likely to accept those who are different from them. Friendship and support is important for people to have an active social life. Similarly, it is equally important to people with disability as it can help them to feel included, valued and happier. Social interaction among peers may influence development; quality of life outcomes. This interaction and positive relationship benefit subjective wellbeing and have a positive effect on mental and physical health.

[[Cliques]] are small groups typically defined by common interests or by friendship. Cliques typically have 2–12 members and tend to be formed by age, gender, race, and social class. Clique members are usually the same in terms of academics and risk behaviors. Cliques can serve as an agent of socialization and social control. Being part of a clique can be advantageous since it may provide a sense of autonomy, a secure social environment, and overall well-being.

Crowds are larger, more vaguely defined groups that may not have a friendship base. Crowds serve as peer groups, and they increase in importance during early adolescence, and decrease by late adolescence. The level of involvement in adult institutions and peer culture describes crowds.

==Socialization==
At an early age, the peer group becomes an important part of socialization Unlike other agents of socialization, such as family and school, peer groups allow children to escape the direct supervision of adults. Among peers, children learn to form relationships on their own, and have the chance to discuss interests that adults may not share with children, such as clothing and popular music, or may not permit, such as drugs and sex. Peer groups can have great influence or peer pressure on each other&#x27;s behavior, depending on the amount of pressure. However, currently more than 23 percent of children globally lack enough connections with their age group, and their cognitive, emotional and social development are delayed than other kids.

==Developmental psychology==
Developmental psychologists, Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, Harry Stack Sullivan, and social learning theorists have all argued that peer relationships provide a unique context for cognitive, social, and emotional development. Modern research echoes these sentiments, showing that social and emotional gains are indeed provided by peer interaction.

Vygotsky&#x27;s Sociocultural Theory focuses on the importance of a child&#x27;s culture and notes that a child is continually acting in social interactions with others. He also focuses on language development and identifies the zone of proximal development. The Zone of Proximal development is defined as the gap between what a student can do alone and what the student can achieve through teacher assistance. The values and attitudes of the peer group are essential elements in learning. Those who surround themselves with academically focused peers will be more likely to internalize this type of behavior.

Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development identifies four stages of cognitive development. He believes that children actively construct their understanding of the world based on their own experiences. In addition Piaget identified with aspects of development, occurring from middle childhood onwards, for which peer groups are essential. He suggested that children&#x27;s speech to peers is less egocentric than their speech to adults. Egocentric speech is referring to the speech that is not adapted to what the listener just said.

Erikson&#x27;s stages of psychosocial development include eight stages ranging from birth to old age. He has emphasized the idea that the society, not just the family, influences one&#x27;s ego and identity through developmental stages. Erikson went on to describe how peer pressure is a key event during the adolescences stage of psychosocial development. In his Latency stage, which includes children from 6–12 years old and this is when the adolescents begin to develop relationships among their peers.

Harry Stack Sullivan has developed the Theory of Interpersonal Relations. Sullivan described friendships as providing the following functions: (a) offering consensual validation, (b) bolstering feelings of self-worth, (c) providing affection and a context for intimate disclosure, (d) promoting interpersonal sensitivity, and (e) setting the foundation for romantic and parental relationships. Sullivan believed these functions developed during childhood and that true friendships were formed around the age of 9 or 10.

Social learning theorists such as John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner, and Albert Bandura, all argue for the influences of the social group in learning and development. Behaviourism, Operant Learning Theory, and Cognitive Social Learning Theory all consider the role the social world plays on development.

In &quot;The Nurture Assumption&quot; and &quot;No Two Alike&quot;, psychologist Judith Rich Harris suggests that an individual&#x27;s peer group significantly influences their intellectual and personal development. Several longitudinal studies support the conjecture that peer groups significantly affect scholastic achievement, particularly when adult involvement is low. Relatively few studies have examined the effect peer groups have on tests of cognitive ability. However, there is some evidence that peer groups influence tests of cognitive ability.

==Positive attributes (advantages)==
===Serve as a source of information===
Peer groups provide perspective outside of the individual&#x27;s viewpoints. Members inside peer groups also learn to develop relationships with others in the social system. Peers, particularly group members, become important social referents for teaching other members customs, social norms, and different ideologies. Positive peer relationships improve social interaction and enhance positive engagement levels in adolescents with and without disabilities. Peers foster overall well-being by offering practical, emotional, and social support.

===Teach gender roles===
Peer groups can also serve as a venue for teaching members gender roles. Through gender-role socialization, group members learn about sex differences, and social and cultural expectations. While boys and girls differ greatly, there is not a one-to-one link between sex and gender roles with males always being masculine and females always being feminine. Both genders can contain different levels of masculinity and femininity. Peer groups can consist of all males, all females, or both males and females. Studies show that the majority of peer groups are unisex.

===Serve as a practicing venue to adulthood===
Adolescent peer groups provide support as teens assimilate into adulthood. Major changes include: decreasing dependence on parents, increasing feelings of self-sufficiency, and connecting with a much larger social network. Adolescents are expanding their perspective beyond the family and learning how to negotiate relationships with others in different parts of the social system. Peers, particularly group members, become important social referents. Peer groups also influence individual members&#x27; attitudes and behaviours on many cultural and social issues, such as: drug use, violence, and academic achievement. and even the development and expression of prejudice.

===Teach unity and collective behaviour in life===
Peer groups provide an influential social setting in which group norms are developed and enforced through socialization processes that promote in-group similarity. Peer groups&#x27; cohesion is determined and maintained by such factors as group communication, group consensus, and group conformity concerning attitude and behavior. As members of peer groups interconnect and agree on what defines them as a group, a normative code arises. This normative code can become very rigid, such as when deciding on group behavior and clothing attire. Member deviation from the strict normative code can lead to rejection from the group.

===Identity formation===
Peer groups (friends group) can help individuals form their own identity. Identity formation is a developmental process where a person acquires a sense of self. One of the major factors that influence the formation of a person&#x27;s identity is his or her peers. Studies have shown that peers provide normative regulation, and that they provide a staging ground for the practice of social behaviors. This allows individuals to experiment with roles and discover their identities. The identity formation process is an important role in an individual&#x27;s development. Erik Erikson emphasized the importance of identity formation, and he illustrated the steps one takes in developing his or her sense of self. He believed this process occurs throughout one&#x27;s entire life. Peer interactions have a significant impact on adolescents, developing empathy, conflict resolution, and interpersonal skills, these relationships also play a crucial role in shaping body image and satisfaction.

==Negative attributes (disadvantages)==

===Peer pressure===
The term peer pressure is often used to describe instances where an individual feels indirectly pressured into changing their behavior to match that of their peers. Taking up smoking and underage drinking are two of the best known examples. In spite of the often negative connotations of the term, peer pressure can be used positively, for example, to encourage other peers to study, or not to engage in activities such as the ones discussed above. Although peer pressure is not isolated to one age group, it is usually most common during the adolescent stage. Adolescence is a period characterized by experimentation, and adolescents typically spend a lot of time with their peers in social contexts. Teenagers compel each other to go along with certain beliefs or behaviors, and studies have shown that boys are more likely to give in to it than girls. There has been much research done to gain a better understanding about the effects of peer pressure, and this research will allow parents to handle and understand their children&#x27;s behaviors and obstacles they will face due to their peer groups. Learning how peer pressure impacts individuals is a step to minimizing the negative effects it leads to.

===Future problems===
Success of peer relationships is linked to later psychological development and to academic achievement. Therefore, if one does not have successful peer relationships it may lead to developmental delays and poor academic achievement—perhaps even in-completion of a high school degree. Children with poor peer relationships may also experience job related and marital problems later in life.

===Risk behaviors===
Several studies have shown that peer groups are powerful agents of risk behaviors in adolescence. Adolescents typically replace family with peers regarding social and leisure activities, and many problematic behaviors occur in the context of these groups. A study done in 2012 focused on adolescents&#x27; engagement in risk behaviors. Participants completed a self-report measure of identity commitment, which explores values, beliefs, and aspirations, as well as a self-report that measures perceived peer group pressure and control. Both peer group pressure and control were positively related to risky behaviors. However, adolescents who were more committed to a personal identity had lower rates of risk behaviors. Overall, this study shows us that adolescent identity development may help prevent negative effects of peer pressure in high-risk adolescents.

===Aggression and prosocial behavior===
Social behaviors can be promoted or discouraged by social groups, and several studies have shown that aggression and prosociality are susceptible to peer influence. A longitudinal study done in 2011 focused on these two behaviors. A sample of adolescents was followed over a one-year period, and results showed that adolescents who joined an aggressive group were more likely to increase their aggression levels. Also, adolescents were likely to display prosocial behaviors that were similar to the consistent behaviors of the group they were in. An adolescent&#x27;s peer group plays a role in shaping him or her into an adult, and the lack of positive behavior can lead to consequences in the future.

===Sexual promiscuity===
Adolescence is also characterized by physical changes, new emotions, and sexual urges, and teenagers are likely to participate in sexual activity. A longitudinal study done in 2012 followed a group of adolescents for thirteen years. Self-reports, peer nominations, teacher ratings, counselor ratings, and parent reports were collected, and results showed a strong correlation between deviant peer groups and sexual promiscuity. Many teens claimed that the reasons for having sex at a young age include peer pressure or pressure from their partner. The effects of sexual activity at a young age are of great concern. Pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are only a few of the consequences that can occur.

=== Exclusion ===
In peer-dominated contexts, functional diversity may lead to marginalization and exclusion. Socially excluded children may have unsatisfying peer relationships, low self-esteem, and lack of achievement motivation, which affect their social and academic aspects of life, mental health, and general well-being. Individuals with disabilities encounter challenges in peer relationships, including deficits in social skills such as emotion detection, conflict resolution, and conceptual understanding.

==Adolescents and their peer groups==

===Gavin&#x27;s study===

In one cross-sectional, correlational study, four different developmental stages were examined: preadolescence (Grades 5 and 6), early adolescence (Grades 7 and 8), middle adolescence (Grades 9 and 10) and late adolescence (Grades 11 and 12). Self-report measures were used in which adolescents completed questionnaires. First, the students rated the importance of being in a popular group. Next, positive and negative behaviour were assessed. The extent to which students were bothered by negative behaviour targeted at them by others in their groups was also assessed. Structural group properties were also examined, including: group leadership or status hierarchy, group permeability, and group conformity.

Researchers found that middle adolescents reported placing more importance on being in a popular group and perceived more group conformity and leadership within their groups than pre- and late adolescents. Early and middle adolescents also reported more negative interactions and fewer positive interactions with group members and more negative interactions with those not part of their peer groups. Girls reported having more positive group interactions, being more bothered by negative interactions, and having more permeable group boundaries. Boys reported more negative interactions with those outside their groups and are more likely to have leaders in their peer groups. Researchers believe that the decrease in conformity throughout adolescence relates to the decrease in importance of leadership in late adolescence because having a group leader provides a person to model oneself after. They also note the relationship between the importance of being in a popular peer group and conformity. Both become less important in late adolescence, showing that it is less important to conform when the value of group membership decreases. It is believed that positive interactions outside of peer groups increase and negative interactions outside of peer groups decrease by late adolescence because older adolescents feel more comfortable and have less need to control the behaviours of others. Findings that boys have more leaders are consistent with research showing that boys partake in more dominance struggles.

===Tarrant&#x27;s study===

A questionnaire was handed out to 58 males and 57 females, aged 14–15 in the Midlands region of the UK. The first section dealt with group structure and activities of participants&#x27; peer groups. Participants were asked how many people were in their group, the gender composition of the group, frequency of group meetings, and the group&#x27;s usual meeting places. The second section addressed the participants&#x27; levels of identification with their peer groups. The next section of the questionnaire was an intergroup comparison task in which participants compared their peer group to an outgroup. The comparison referred to how sixteen different adjectives &quot;fit&quot; or &quot;described&quot; both their ingroup and outgroup. The final part of the questionnaire was designed to check the manipulation of the adjective valence. In this section, participants rated the desirability of the above sixteen adjectives in their own opinions.

Findings supported social identity theory as participants consistently favoured the ingroup in two ways: the ingroup was always associated with a greater number of positive characteristics compared to the outgroup, and the more a participant identified with the ingroup, the higher their evaluations were for it.

===Same race peer groups===

Consistent with the dictionary definition of peer groups, youth tend to form groups based on similarities. It has been found that one of these similarities is by race. Preference for same race grows stronger as youth develop. When Latino and Caucasian youth were given surveys asking them to indicate who in their school they had the highest preference to spend time with, they both nominated peers of their same race over peers of different races. This is especially prevalent in classrooms and schools that have a clear cut majority and minority racial groups. Though benefits of homophily are met, preference for one&#x27;s own racial group can lead to rejection of the racial out group, which can cause stress for both groups particularly in females.

===Cross race peer groups===

For classrooms and schools that have a more equal distribution of racial groups, there can be more socialization across peer groups. Cross racial peers groups can be very beneficial, lowering prejudice and increasing prosocial behaviors. Having a cross racial friend has also been shown to give youth a higher status and feel more socially satisfied. Diverse peer groups also lower the feelings of victimization felt by youth.

=== Disability and peer group ===
An effective approach to promoting peer relationships among adolescents with disabilities may require a comprehensive strategy that addresses the individual and social aspects of support, fostering understanding. This might involve imparting information and resources on disabilities to both peers and schools, organizing meaningful social activities with friends, and providing emotional support.

<doc id="272624" wikidata="Q1269096" url="?curid=272624" title="Grayson Perry">
<text>Sir Grayson Perry (born 24 March 1960) is an English artist. He is known for his ceramic vases, tapestries, and cross-dressing, as well as his observations of the contemporary arts scene, and for dissecting British &quot;prejudices, fashions and foibles&quot;.

Perry&#x27;s vases have classical forms and are decorated in bright colours, depicting subjects at odds with their attractive appearance. There is a strong autobiographical element in his work, in which images of Perry as &quot;Claire&quot;, his female alter-ego, and &quot;Alan Measles&quot;, his childhood teddy bear, often appear. He has made a number of documentary television programmes and has curated exhibitions. He has published two autobiographies, &quot;Grayson Perry: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Girl&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; (2016), written and illustrated a graphic novel, &quot;Cycle of Violence&quot; (2012), written a book about art, &quot;Playing to the Gallery&quot; (2014), and published his illustrated &quot;Sketchbooks&quot; (2016). Various books describing his work have been published. In 2013 he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures.

Perry has had solo exhibitions at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan. His work is held in the permanent collections of 
the British Council and Arts Council, Crafts Council, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

Perry was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003. He was interviewed about the win and resulting press in Sarah Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Seven Days in the Art World&quot;. In 2008 he was ranked number 32 in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot;. In 2012, Perry was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.

==Early life==
Born into a working-class family, Perry was four years old when his father, Tom, left home after discovering his mother, Jean was having an affair with a milkman, whom she later married and who Perry has claimed was violent. Subsequently, he spent an unhappy childhood moving between his parents and created a fantasy world based around his teddy in order to cope with his sense of anxiety. He considers that a person&#x27;s early experiences are important in shaping their aesthetic and sexuality. Perry described his first sexual experience at the age of seven when he tied himself up in his pyjamas.

Perry spent a short period of his school life at King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford (KEGS). Following the encouragement of his art teacher, he decided to study art. He did an art foundation course at Braintree College of Further Education from 1978 to 1979, followed by a BA in fine art at Portsmouth College of Art and Design (now the University of Portsmouth), graduating in 1982. He had an interest in film and exhibited his first piece of pottery at a New Contemporaries show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1980. 

In the months following his graduation, he joined the Neo Naturists, a group started by Christine Binnie to revive the &quot;true sixties spirit – which involves living one&#x27;s life more or less naked and occasionally manifesting it into a performance for which the main theme is body paint&quot;. They put on events at galleries and other venues. At this time Perry was living in squats in central London.

When he left for Portsmouth in 1979, his stepfather told him &quot;Don&#x27;t come back&quot;. Perry was estranged from his mother; when she died in 2016, he did not attend her funeral.

==Personal life==
As of 2010, he lives in north London with his wife, the author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry. They have one daughter, Florence, born in 1992.

In 2015 he was appointed to succeed Kwame Kwei-Armah as chancellor of University of the Arts London.

Perry is a keen mountain biker and motorcyclist.

=== Politics ===
Perry is a supporter of the Labour Party and has designed works of art to raise funds for the party. In September 2015, Perry endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Perry said he would back Corbyn as he was &quot;doing something interesting for the political debate.&quot; He added: &quot;I think he&#x27;s gold.&quot; In October 2016, he said that Corbyn had &quot;no chance of winning an election&quot;. In 2024 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Perry had donated £180,000 to the party.

=== Cross-dressing ===
From an early age he liked to dress in stereotypically women&#x27;s clothes and in his teens realised that he was a transvestite. At the age of 15, he moved in with his father&#x27;s family in Chelmsford, where he began to go out dressed as a woman. When he was discovered by his father, he said he would stop but his stepmother told everyone about it, and a few months later, threw him out. He returned to his mother and stepfather at Great Bardfield in Essex.
Perry frequently appears in public dressed as a woman, and he has described his female alter-ego, &quot;Claire&quot;, variously as &quot;a 19th century reforming matriarch, a middle-England protester for &quot;No More Art&quot;, an aero-model-maker, or an Eastern European Freedom Fighter&quot;, and &quot;a fortysomething woman living in a Barratt home, the kind of woman who eats ready meals and can just about sew on a button&quot;. In his work, Perry includes pictures of himself in stereotypically women&#x27;s clothes: for example, &quot;Mother of All Battles&quot; (1996) is a photograph of Claire holding a gun and wearing a dress, in ethnic Eastern European style, embroidered with images of war, exhibited at his 2002 &quot;Guerrilla Tactics&quot; show. One critic has called Perry &quot;The social critic from hell&quot;.

Perry has designed many of Claire&#x27;s outfits but fashion students at Central Saint Martins Art College in London take part in an annual competition to design new dresses for Claire. An exhibition, &quot;Making Himself Claire: Grayson Perry&#x27;s Dresses,&quot; was held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, from November 2017 to February 2018.

==Work==

As well as pottery, Perry has worked in printmaking, drawing, embroidery and other textile work, film and performance. He has written a graphic novel, &quot;Cycle of Violence.&quot; Perry often works with media such as ceramics and weaving, which are traditionally considered to be lower down the hierarchy of arts than sculpture and painting. 

===Ceramics===
The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam mounted a solo exhibition of his work in 2002, &quot;Guerrilla Tactics.&quot; It was partly for this work that he was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003, the first time it was given to a ceramic artist.

Perry&#x27;s work refers to several ceramic traditions, including Greek pottery and folk art. He has said, &quot;I like the whole iconography of pottery. It hasn&#x27;t got any big pretensions to being great public works of art, and no matter how brash a statement I make, on a pot it will always have certain humility ... [F]or me the shape has to be classical invisible: then you&#x27;ve got a base that people can understand&quot;. His vessels are made by coiling, a traditional method. Most have a complex surface employing many techniques, including &quot;glazing, incision, embossing, and the use of photographic transfers&quot;, which requires several firings. To some, he adds sprigs, little relief sculptures stuck to the surface. The high degree of skill required by his ceramics and their complexity distances them from craft pottery. It has been said that these methods are not used for decorative effect but to give meaning. Perry challenges the idea, implicit in the craft tradition, that pottery is merely decorative or utilitarian and cannot express ideas.

In his work Perry reflects upon his upbringing as a boy, his stepfather&#x27;s anger and the absence of proper guidance about male conduct. Perry&#x27;s understanding of the roles in his family is portrayed in &quot;Using My Family&quot;, from 1998, where a teddy bear provides affection, and the contemporaneous &quot;The Guardians&quot;, which depicts his mother and stepfather.

Much of Perry&#x27;s work contains sexually explicit content. Some of his sexual imagery has been described as &quot;obscene sadomasochistic sex scenes&quot;. He also has a reputation for depicting child abuse and yet there are no works depicting sexual child abuse although &quot;We&#x27;ve Found the Body of Your Child&quot;, 2000 hints at emotional child abuse and child neglect. In other work, he juxtaposes decorative clichés like flowers with weapons and war. Perry combines various techniques as a &quot;guerrilla tactic&quot;, using the approachable medium of pottery to provoke thought.

===Tapestries===

Perry created the 15m x 3m &quot;The Walthamstow Tapestry&quot; in 2009. The large woven tapestry bears hundreds of brand names surrounding large figures in the stages of life from birth to death.

Perry&#x27;s 2012 TV documentary series &quot;All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry,&quot; about class &quot;taste&quot; variables, included him making large tapestries, called &quot;The Vanity of Small Differences.&quot; Their format was inspired by William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress.&quot; Of the tapestries, Perry says, 
&quot;The Vanity of Small Differences&quot; consists of six tapestries that tell the story of Tim Rakewell. Some of the characters, incidents and objects I have included I encountered whilst filming &quot;All in the Best Possible Taste&quot;. The tapestries tell a story of class mobility. I think nothing has such a strong influence on our aesthetic taste as the social class we grow up in.

The sketches were translated using Adobe Photoshop to design the finished images and the tapestries were woven on a computer-controlled loom.

Perry produced a pair of large-scale tapestries for A House for Essex, called &quot;The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope&quot; in 2015.

===A House for Essex (&quot;Julie&#x27;s House&quot;) (2012–2015)===

In 2015 the external work was completed on a holiday home in Wrabness, Essex, created by Perry working with Fashion Architecture Taste (FAT). Known as A House for Essex or Julie&#x27;s House, it was built over the River Stour, as a commission for the charity Living Architecture. The house encapsulates the story of Julie May Cope, a fictional Essex woman, &quot;born in a flood-struck Canvey Island in 1953 and mown down last year by a curry delivery driver in Colchester&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Ellis Woodman said, &quot;Sporting a livery of green and white ceramic tiles, telephone-box red joinery and a gold roof, it is not easy to miss. ... Decoration is everywhere: from the external tiles embossed with motifs referencing Julie&#x27;s rock-chick youth to extravagant tapestries recording her life&#x27;s full narrative. Perry has contributed ceramic sculptures, modelled on Irish Sheelanagigs, which celebrate her as a kind of latter-day earth mother while the delivery driver&#x27;s moped has even been repurposed as a chandelier suspended above the double-height living room.&quot;

Perry made a variety of artwork used inside the house, depicting Julie Cope&#x27;s life. He made a series of large-scale tapestries, &quot;The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope,&quot; which include &quot;A Perfect Match&quot; (2015) and &quot;In Its Familiarity, Golden&quot; (2015), and for the bedrooms, &quot;Julie and Rob&quot; (2013) and &quot;Julie and Dave&quot; (2015). He also wrote an essay, &quot;The Ballad of Julie Cope&quot; (2015) and created a series of black and white woodcuts, &quot;Six Snapshots of Julie&quot; (2015). Perry also released the series in a signed colour edition of 68. The work was shown in an exhibition, &quot;Grayson Perry: The Life of Julie Cope,&quot; at Firstsite in Colchester, Essex, from January to February 2018.

==Media==
===Television===
In 2005, Perry presented a Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Why Men Wear Frocks,&quot; in which he examined transvestism and masculinity at the start of the 21st century. Perry talked about his own life as a transvestite and the effect it had on him and his family, frankly discussing its difficulties and pleasures. The documentary won a Royal Television Society award for best network production.

He was the subject of a &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; episode in 2006 and the subject of an &quot;Imagine&quot; documentary broadcast in November 2011.

His three-part series for Channel 4, &quot;All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry,&quot; was broadcast in June 2012. The series analysed the ideas of taste held by the different social classes of the UK. Perry explores both male and female culture in each social class and what they buy, in three parts: &quot;Working Class Taste,&quot; &quot;Middle Class Taste,&quot; and &quot;Upper Class Taste.&quot; At the same time, he photographs, and then illustrates his experiences and the people, transcribing them into large tapestries, entitled &quot;The Vanity of Small Differences.&quot;

In 2014, Perry presented a three-part documentary series for Channel 4, &quot;Who Are You?,&quot; on identity. In it, he creates diverse portraits for the National Portrait Gallery, London, of ex-MP Chris Huhne, Rylan Clark-Neal from &quot;The X Factor,&quot; a Muslim convert, and a young transgender man.

In 2016, he presented a series exploring masculinity for Channel 4, &quot;Grayson Perry: All Man.&quot;

In 2018, Perry explored &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; in a four-part documentary series on Channel 4. The documentary series focused on death, marriage, birth, and coming of age as Perry compared the way people in the UK dealt with these themes compared to others around the world. Each episode culminated in Perry helping those in the UK to create ceremonies that were appropriate to their own situations.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Perry presented &quot;Grayson&#x27;s Art Club&quot; from his home studio alongside his wife Philippa, encouraging viewers to produce and share their own artworks from lockdown. Along with pieces submitted by practising artists and celebrity guests, the public&#x27;s work went on display at an exhibition in Manchester, however, this did not go ahead due to COVID-19 restrictions. The programme&#x27;s second series began in February 2021.

In 2020 Channel 4 broadcast the series &quot;Grayson Perry&#x27;s Big American Road Trip&quot;. Perry crossed the US on a motorbike, exploring its biggest fault lines, from race to class and identity. As America headed for a presidential election, Perry asked how its growing divisions could be overcome.

In 2025, Perry participated in the sixth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Kingfisher&quot;. He was eliminated in the sixth episode.

Other television and radio appearances also include the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, &quot;HARDtalk&quot;, &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, and &quot;QI&quot;.

===Writing and lectures===
Perry was an arts correspondent for &quot;The Times,&quot; writing a weekly column until October 2007.

Perry gave the 2013 BBC Reith Lectures. In a series of talks titled Playing to the Gallery, he considered the state of art in the 21st century. The individual lectures, titled &quot;Democracy Has Bad Taste&quot;, &quot;Beating the Bounds&quot;, &quot;Nice Rebellion, Welcome In!&quot; and &quot;I Found Myself in the Art World&quot;, were broadcast in October and November 2013 on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service. He expanded the lectures into a book, &quot;Playing to the Gallery: Helping Contemporary Art in its Struggle to Be Understood&quot; (2014).

He guest edited an issue of &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 2014, entitled &quot;The Great White Male Issue&quot;.

In 2017 Perry gave the inaugural Orwell Lecture in the North for The Orwell Foundation, entitled &quot;I&#x27;ve read all the academic texts on empathy&quot;.

===Judging===
In 2007 Perry curated an exhibition of art by prisoners and ex-offenders entitled &quot;Insider Art&quot; at the Institute of Contemporary Arts presented by the Koestler Trust, a charity that promotes art as rehabilitation in prisons, young offenders institutions and secure psychiatric units. He described the artworks as &quot;raw and all the more powerful for that&quot;. In 2011 he returned to the annual Koestler Trust exhibition, this time held at London&#x27;s Southbank Centre and judged the award winners in &quot;Art by Offenders&quot; with Will Self and Emma Bridgewater.

<doc id="272627" wikidata="Q444418" url="?curid=272627" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Iceland">
<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Iceland. Regular mail service in Iceland was first established by a charter of 13 May 1776, and on 1 January 1873, Iceland issued its first postage stamps. The design was the same as for the Danish numeral issue of the time (numeral of value surmounted by a crown all inside an oval), denominated with values ranging from 2 to 16 skilling, and inscribed &quot;ÍSLAND&quot;. All are scarce or rare, and used copies are especially hard to find.

==Chronology==

In 1876 the currency changed to eyrir (pl. aurar) and króna. This meant new stamps, which were issued beginning in August. The same basic design, with some changes of color and perforation, continued in use through 1901. In 1897 a shortage of 3-aurar stamps led to the overprinting of 5-aurur stamps with þrir or þrir / 3; these are rare, and unfortunately excellent counterfeits have been produced.

In 1902 the numeral stamps were officially withdrawn and declared invalid for postage, since a new set depicting King Christian IX was to be issued. But then the Minister of Iceland changed his mind for reasons which are still unclear and had the numerals reissued, overprinted Í GILDI / &#x27;02--&#x27;03 in red or black, the overprint indicating that they were still valid. While some of the overprints are common, costing the collector less than one US dollar or one euro, others are among the great rarities of Icelandic philately. There are also many inverts and typographical errors to be found.
In 1906 King Christian died, and so in 1907 a new series of stamps came out, featuring overlapping profiles of Christian IX and King Frederik VIII.

1911 saw Iceland&#x27;s first commemorative stamps, a set honoring Jón Sigurðsson, the leader of Iceland&#x27;s independence movement in the 19th century, on the 100th anniversary of his birth. In February of the following year, a set was issued with Frederick&#x27;s silhouette. Although Frederick died in May 1912, no new stamps were issued until 1915, when another set of the 1907 design was issued in new colors.

King Christian X first appeared on Icelandic stamps in a new set of 1920. Periodic stamp shortages plagued the postal service during the 1920s, and locally surcharged stamps were produced in 1921, 1922, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1929, and 1930. The first pictorial, non-portrait stamps were issued in 1925, a set of five showing views of Iceland. Iceland&#x27;s first airmail stamp was issued in 1928; it was produced by overprinting a crude image of an airplane on a regular 10-aurar stamp.

In 1930, Iceland celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the Althing with an attractive series of 15 regular and 5 airmail stamps featuring a wide variety of historical, mythological, and scenic images. In 1928 Icelandic authorities received a proposal from the &#x27;Society of the Friends of Iceland&#x27; &quot;Verein der Islandsfreunde&quot; in Vienna Austria, proposing to produce these stamps as a gift to Iceland for the Millenary celebrations. Against the advice of the Head Postmaster, Sigurður Briem, the Icelandic government accepted the offer to produce 813,000 kronur&#x27;s worth of stamps, 600,000 kronur&#x27;s worth of which were to go to Iceland, and the rest to the Society for its trouble. Iceland&#x27;s share of the stamps were delivered in December 1929, but in 1930 it became apparent that a fraud had been committed and a much larger than authorised number of stamps had been produced, by the insertion of the figure &#x27;1&#x27; before the value in the print order. Police investigations had not been completed before the outbreak of World War II, and were not resumed afterwards.

In May 1931, stamps were overprinted Zeppelin / 1931 for use on mail sent via the airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, which visited Reykjavík on 1 July. The zeppelin did not actually land, but it got low enough to pass mail bags up and down.

Also in 1931, a new issue came out depicting the Gullfoss waterfall. In addition, stamps of the 1920 issue, but with the vignette of the king much more finely engraved, started appearing periodically, through 1937.

Iceland&#x27;s first semi-postal stamps appeared in 1933. The subjects of the three stamps depicted categories of recipients; rescue workers, children, and the elderly.
In 1938 a dramatic series featured images of Geysir, the namesake of all other geysers.

Iceland again honored Jón Sigurðsson on its issue marking the independent republic established on 17 June 1944 (and again on the 150th anniversary of his birth on 17 June 1961 and the centenary of the deaths of Jón and his wife, Ingibjorg Einarsdóttir, in 1979).

In 1948, the eruption of the volcano Hekla was marked by another set of dramatic images.

After independence, Iceland pursued a relatively restrained stamp-issuing policy, bringing out about 20 new stamps each year. There were annual Christmas and Europa issues, and sets depicting local scenery, flora, and fauna, as well as heritage and the works of local artists.

Iceland Post announced in 2020 that it would cease issuing stamps. The postal service said that it would continue to sell its stamps in stock to customers and may reprint older stamps if necessary to replenish its stock. Nevertheless, in 2023, Iceland Post released a souvenir sheet consisting of four stamps in order to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the country&#x27;s first postage stamp.

<doc id="272640" wikidata="Q357536" url="?curid=272640" title="Lever Brothers">
<text>Lever Brothers was a British manufacturing company founded in 1885 by two brothers: William Hesketh Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme (1851–1925), and James Darcy Lever (1854–1916). They invested in and successfully promoted a new soap-making process invented by chemist William Hough Watson. Lever Brothers entered the United States market in 1895 and acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall &amp; Sons, in 1925. Lever Brothers was one of several British companies that took an interest in the welfare of its British employees. Its brands included Lifebuoy, Lux and Vim. Lever Brothers merged with Margarine Unie to form Unilever in 1929.

== History ==
Starting with a small grocery business begun by his father, William Lever and his brother James entered the soap business in 1885 by buying a small soap works in Warrington. The brothers teamed up with a Cumbrian chemist, William Hough Watson, who became an early business partner. Watson invented the process which resulted in a new soap, using glycerin and vegetable oils such as palm oil, rather than tallow. The resulting soap was a good, free-lathering soap, at first named Honey Soap then later named Sunlight Soap. Production reached 450 tons per week by 1888. Larger premises were built on marshes at Bromborough Pool on the Wirral Peninsula at what became Port Sunlight. Though the company was named Lever Brothers, James never took a major part in running the business. He fell ill in 1895, likely as a result of diabetes, and resigned his directorship two years later.

Lever Brothers entered the United States market in 1895, with a small New York City sales office. In 1898, it bought a soap manufacturer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Curtis Davis Company, moved its U.S. headquarters to Cambridge and started production at a factory located at what is now Technology Square. In 1925, Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall &amp; Sons.

By 1929, Lever Brothers employed 1,000 workers in Cambridge, and 1,400 nationwide, making it the third-largest soap manufacturer in the U.S.

In 1949, Unilever moved its US headquarters and laboratories to Park Avenue, New York, and in 1959, it closed the Cambridge factory.

=== Employee welfare and use of forced labour ===
Lever Brothers was one of several British companies that took an interest in the welfare of its British employees. The model village of Port Sunlight was developed between 1888 and 1914 adjoining the soap factory to accommodate the company&#x27;s staff in good quality housing, with high architectural standards and many community facilities. The paternalism found at Port Sunlight did not exist in the operations of its subsidiary in the Belgian Congo, where Lever Brothers, through their subsidiary &quot;Huileries du Congo Belge&quot; (HCB), utilised forced labour between 1911 and 1945.

===Brands===
By 1911, the company had its own oil palm plantations in the Belgian Congo and the Solomon Islands. Lever Brothers Ltd also acquired other soap companies including A&amp;F Pears, John Knight of London, Gossage&#x27;s of Widnes, Watson&#x27;s of Leeds, Crosfield&#x27;s of Warrington, Hazlehurst &amp; Sons of Runcorn and Hudson&#x27;s of Liverpool. The town of Leverville (the present-day Lusanga) was founded in the then district of Kwango, later part of the Province of Léopoldville, in the western part of the Belgian Congo and was named after William Lever (later Viscount Leverhulme).

=== Unilever ===
In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, named as a blend of the two firms&#x27; names. By 1930, it employed 250,000 people and in terms of market value, was the largest company in Britain. Unilever was the first modern multinational company.

The Lever Brothers name was kept until the 1990s as an imprint, as well as the name of the US subsidiary, Lever Brothers Company, and a Canadian subsidiary, Lever Brothers Limited. Lever Brothers was sold to a US capital firm, Pensler Capital Corporation, and renamed Korex in 2008. Korex Don Valley assumed operations of the Lever Brothers Toronto plant. It has since closed and gone bankrupt. The Toronto plant is now being redeveloped into an office and industrial district by First Gulf Corporation.

== Presidents ==
Among its presidents was Charles Luckman, who, in the 1950s, championed the construction of the Lever House in New York City. Luckman left the company before the building&#x27;s completion, moving on to a notable architectural career, including the design of Madison Square Garden, the Theme Building, the master plan for Los Angeles International Airport, the Aon Center, and major buildings at the Kennedy Space Center and Johnson Space Center.

<doc id="272659" wikidata="Q276542" url="?curid=272659" title="Syfy">
<text>Syfy (a paraphrased neology of former name Sci-Fi Channel, later shortened to Sci Fi; stylized as SYFY in all caps since 2017) is an American basic cable television channel, owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group division and business segment of Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal. Launched on September 24, 1992, the channel broadcasts programming relating to the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres. , Syfy is available to approximately 69,000,000 pay television households in the United States, down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households. 

==History==
In 1989 in Boca Raton, Florida, communications attorneys and cable TV entrepreneurs, Mitchell Rubenstein and his business-partner wife Laurie Silvers, devised the concept for the Sci-Fi Channel and signed up eight of the top ten cable TV operators. They additionally licensed exclusive rights to the British TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (which shifted over from PBS), &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, and the cult series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. 

In 1992, Rubenstein and Silvers sold the channel to USA Networks, then a joint venture between Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures. Rubenstein and Silvers became vice-chairs of USA Networks. The channel was seen as a natural fit with the classic films and television series that both studios had in their vaults, including Universal&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and the Rod Serling TV series &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, along with Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.

&quot;Star Trek&quot;″s creator Gene Roddenberry and author Isaac Asimov were recruited by Rubenstein and Silvers to serve on the initial advisory board, but both Roddenberry and Asimov had died by the time the channel finally launched on September 24, 1992. Rubenstein recalled: &quot;The first thing that was on the screen was &#x27;Dedicated to the memories of Isaac Asimov and Gene Roddenberry&#x27;.&quot; Leonard Nimoy was master of ceremonies at the channel&#x27;s launch party, held at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. Asimov&#x27;s widow Janet and Roddenberry&#x27;s widow Majel Barrett were both in attendance. The first program aired on the network was the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

In 1994 Paramount was sold to Viacom, followed by Seagram&#x27;s purchase of a controlling stake in MCA (of which Universal was a subsidiary) from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company in 1995. In 1997 Viacom sold its stake in USA Networks to Universal, who spun off all its television assets to Barry Diller the next year into the new company Studios USA. Three years later, Diller would sell Studios USA back to Universal, by then a subsidiary of Vivendi SA (at the time known as Vivendi Universal). Vivendi&#x27;s film and television production and cable television assets were then merged with General Electric&#x27;s NBC to form NBC Universal in 2004. In 2009 the network was rebranded as &quot;Syfy&quot;, and in 2010 Comcast purchased Syfy&#x27;s parent company NBCUniversal. Comcast was one of the original cable TV operators to carry the channel.

A high-definition version of the channel launched on October 3, 2007, on DirecTV.

In 2013 Syfy was given the James Randi Educational Foundation&#x27;s Pigasus Award for what was described as questionable reality programming involving paranormal subjects.

===Branding history===
From 1992 to 1999, the network&#x27;s first logo consisted of a planet with a ring, made to look like Saturn, with &quot;SCI-FI CHANNEL&quot; written on it. The network&#x27;s second logo, which was used from 1999 to 2002, dropped the hyphen and the word &quot;CHANNEL&quot;. The network&#x27;s third and final &quot;ringed planet&quot; logo ran from 2002 to 2009, and was designed by Lambie-Nairn. The logo made its debut on December 2, 2002, with the launch of the Steven Spielberg miniseries &quot;Taken&quot;. The network also launched a new image campaign with the tagline &quot;If&quot;, which expresses the limitless possibilities of the imagination. Identification bumps depicted surreal situations such as a baby breathing fire, as well as a woman in a stately sitting room kissing a bug-eyed, big-eared animal.

On March 16, 2009, NBCUniversal announced that Sci Fi was rebranding as &quot;Syfy&quot;. Network officials also noted that, unlike the generic term &quot;sci fi&quot;, which represents the entire genre, the term &quot;Syfy&quot; as a sensational spelling can be protected by trademark and therefore would be easier to market on other goods or services without fear of confusion with other companies&#x27; products. The only significant previous use of the term &quot;Syfy&quot; in relation to science fiction was by the website SyFy Portal, which became Airlock Alpha after selling the brand to an unnamed company in February 2009.

The name change was greeted with initial negativity, with people deliberately mispronouncing &quot;Syfy&quot; as or to make fun of the name change. The parody news anchor Stephen Colbert made fun of the name change on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; by giving the channel a &quot;Tip of the Hat&quot; for &quot;spelling the name the way it&#x27;s pronounced&quot; and noting that &quot;the tide is turning in my long fought battle against the insidious &#x27;soft C. The new name took effect on July 7, 2009. Syfy has since added reality shows and edged further from strictly science fiction, fantasy and horror programming.

The rebranding efforts at NBC Universal&#x27;s Sci Fi Channels worldwide resulted in most rebranding as &quot;Syfy&quot; or &quot;Syfy Universal&quot;; however, over one-third of the channels did not take on &quot;Syfy&quot; as any part of their names: channels in Japan and the Philippines rebranded to or were replaced by Universal Channel, while each of the channels in Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia would become Sci Fi Universal. In Polish, &quot;Syfy&quot; does not suggest imagination or science fiction, but rather something gross, without value or even syphilis. In Australia, NBCUniversal was a partner in SF alongside Foxtel, CBS Studios International and Sony Pictures Television; after the channel shut down in 2013, NBCUniversal launched a local version of Syfy in 2014.

On May 11, 2017, in honor of the network&#x27;s upcoming 25th anniversary, Syfy unveiled a major rebranding that took effect on-air June 19. The new branding was intended to re-position the channel back towards targeting fans of the fantasy and sci-fi genres. Network head Chris McCumber explained that the network&#x27;s goal was to &quot;put fans at the center of everything we do&quot;, and explained a stacked, square-shaped form of the logo as being akin to a &quot;badge&quot;. Syfy also planned to place a larger focus on its genre news division Syfy Wire, disclosing the possibility of extending the website to television as well.

==Programming==
Syfy&#x27;s original programming includes made-for-cable movies, miniseries, and television series. Under NBCUniversal ownership, the channel has expanded into general-interest programming outside of the sci-fi genre to target a more mainstream audience. Such programming has included crime dramas, &quot;WCG Ultimate Gamer&quot;, and professional wrestling from WWE (including &quot;ECW&quot;, &quot;NXT&quot;, and &quot;SmackDown&quot;).

Syfy has been used for overflow sports and sports entertainment programming from its sister networks. It has participated in NBC Sports&#x27; &quot;Championship Sunday&quot; effort to broadcast all matches on the final matchday of the Premier League soccer season across NBCUniversal cable networks. In February 2022, &quot;WWE Raw&quot; and &quot;NXT&quot; aired on Syfy for two weeks due to USA Network&#x27;s broadcasts of the 2022 Winter Olympics; this was repeated during the 2024 Summer Olympics.

===Animation===
During its early years, Syfy aired anime films and original video animations on early Saturday morning under the title of &quot;Saturday Anime&quot;. On June 11, 2007, the channel launched a weekly two-hour programming block called &quot;Ani-Monday&quot;, featuring English dubs of various anime series licensed by Manga Entertainment. During February 2008, the channel also aired anime on Tuesday nights in a second programming block. In July 2009, Syfy announced that they had renewed and expanded their licensing agreement with Manga Entertainment to add a two-hour block of horror anime (also called &quot;Ani-Monday&quot;) to sister channel Chiller. Syfy&#x27;s anime block was later moved to Thursday nights, starting March 14, 2011, where it remained until all anime programming was dropped on June 9, 2011.

On April 20, 2019, Syfy launched a new late night adult animation block called &quot;TZGZ&quot; which aired until March 13, 2021.

===Syfy original films=== 

Sci Fi Pictures original films are independently-made B-movies with production budgets of $1 million to $2 million each. The initiative was spearheaded by Thomas Vitale in 2001, and was managed by Vitale, Chris Regina, and Ray Cannella, with the later additions of Karen O&#x27;Hara and Macy Lao. Syfy is also one of the sponsors for the Coalition for Freedom of Information.

==Media==
===Websites and divisions=== 

====Syfy.com====
Syfy&#x27;s website launched in 1995, under the name The Dominion (though using scifi.com in its URL); it changed to SciFi.com in 2000. The site has won a Webby Award and a Flash Forward Award.

From 2000 to 2005, SciFi.com published original science fiction short stories in a section called &quot;Sci Fiction&quot;, edited by Ellen Datlow, who won a 2005 Hugo Award for her work there. The stories themselves won a World Fantasy Award, the first Theodore Sturgeon Award for online fiction (for Lucius Shepard&#x27;s novella &quot;Over Yonder&quot;), and four of the Science Fiction Writers of America&#x27;s Nebula Awards, including the first for original online fiction (for Linda Nagata&#x27;s novella &quot;Goddesses&quot;).

On April 22, 2006, the site launched Sci Fi Pedia, a commercial wiki on topics including anime, comics, fandom, fantasy, games, horror, science fiction, toys, UFOs, genre-related art and audio, and the paranormal. In 2009, Sci Fi Pedia was shut down without explanation.

As part of the channel&#x27;s rebranding in 2009, the URLand the site&#x27;s namewas changed to Syfy.com. As of 2010, Syfy.com began to contain webisode series including &quot;&quot; (as of October 26, 2010), &quot;The Mercury Men&quot; (as of July 25, 2011), and &quot;Nuclear Family&quot; (as of October 15, 2012).

====SyfyGames====
SyfyGames.com is an online games portal which offers free-to-play MMO and casual games. The site features predominantly sci-fi and fantasy games from third-party developers. In April 2015, the News section of SyfyGames.com was rebranded to feature &quot;news from G4&quot;.

In 2010, Syfy Games signed a deal with the now defunct publisher THQ to co-produce &quot;De Blob 2&quot;. Syfy Games would also co-produce &quot;Red Faction: Armageddon&quot;.

====Syfy Wire==== 
Syfy Wire (formerly Sci-Fi Wire and Blastr) is a website operated by Syfy featuring coverage of news in the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres. The site was rebranded in 2010 as Blastr, with the addition of feature articles, guest columnists (such as Phil Plait), popular science news and coverage, and video content. In December 2016, Blastr rebranded as Syfy Wire; editor-in-chief Adam Swiderski stated that this change was to closer associate the website with the Syfy television channel.

As of March 2018, Syfy Wire releases five regular podcasts, including two recap series following &quot;The Expanse&quot; and the final season of &quot;Colony&quot;, as well as &quot;The Fandom Files&quot;, which features interviews with public figures about their pop culture obsessions. Guests have included Leland Chee and Mike Daniels of the Green Bay Packers.

===Periodicals===
====&quot;Sci Fi&quot; magazine====
Sci Fi magazine was first published in June 1994, as Sci-Fi Entertainment, with the additional description &quot;The Official Magazine of the Sci-Fi Channel&quot; on the cover. The publisher from Volume 1, Issue 1, was Mark Hintz, with Carl A. Gnam Jr. as editorial director and Ted Klein as editor. Scott Edelman took over as editor with the December 1996 issue, holding that position until leaving after the June 2000 issue, by which point the magazine&#x27;s name had already been shortened to &quot;Sci Fi&quot;, in keeping with the channel&#x27;s name change to Sci Fi in 1999; Scott Edelman returned to be editor of the channel&#x27;s online magazine, &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot;, moving back to editor of &quot;Sci Fi&quot; in February 2002. The magazine was published by Sovereign Media Co, based in Herndon, Virginia. As of October 2023, the magazine is still described at the Sovereign Media website, but the link to the publication is no longer active there, and no link is available at the Syfy.com site; the last functioning archived link from the Syfy.com page is for the issue available in October 2014.

====&quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot;====
&quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot; was an online magazine started on August 15, 1995, and edited by Craig Engler and Brooks Peck. In April 1996, it began appearing exclusively on &quot;The Dominion&quot; as part of a partnership with the site, before being sold to the Sci Fi Channel completely in 1999. The publication covered various aspects of science fiction, including news, reviews, original art, and interviews, until it merged with Sci-Fi Wire in January 2009.

<doc id="272678" wikidata="Q192258" url="?curid=272678" title="Quidditch Through the Ages">
<text>Quidditch Through the Ages is a 2001 book written by British author J. K. Rowling using the pseudonym of Kennilworthy Whisp about Quidditch in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. It purports to be the Hogwarts library&#x27;s copy of the non-fiction book of the same name mentioned in several novels of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

The book benefits the BBC affiliated charity Comic Relief. Over 80% of the cover price of each book sold goes directly to poor children in various places around the world.

==Synopsis==

In 2001, Rowling penned two companion books to the &quot;Harry Potter series&quot;, &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, for British charity and offshoot of Live Aid, Comic Relief with all of her royalties going to the charity. As of July 2008, the books combined are estimated to have earned over $30 million for Comic Relief. The two books have since been made available in hardcover.

==Audiobook adaptation==
The book was recorded as an unabridged audiobook in 2018 and read by Andrew Lincoln. The Audible version of the audiobook also includes over an hour and a half of bonus content. This includes the history of the &quot;Quidditch World Cup&quot; – written for Pottermore by J. K. Rowling in 2014 – narrated by Andrew Lincoln, and the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot;″s coverage of the &quot;2014 Quidditch World Cup&quot; – also written by J. K. Rowling – narrated by Imogen Church (in the character of Ginny Potter) and Annette Badland (as Rita Skeeter).

In 2019, the American Library Association named it one of the top ten Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults.
==Fictional book==
Within the fictional world of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot; is written by Kennilworthy Whisp, a renowned Quidditch expert.

In both the fictional and real-world it is the definitive handbook on the history and intricacies of the game. It also serves as a catalogue of the many British Quidditch teams. When Severus Snape caught Harry outside the school with this book in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, he invented the rule that no library books were allowed outside the school and confiscated it.

===Kennilworthy Whisp===
In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, Kennilworthy Whisp is a Quidditch expert and fanatic who has written many books about the sport. He lives in Nottinghamshire, where he divides his time with &quot;wherever the Wigtown Wanderers are playing this week.&quot; His hobbies include backgammon, vegetarian cookery, and collecting vintage broomsticks. According to Whisp, the Firebolt/Nimbus 2000 is the best broomstick.

<text>Stalbridge () is a town and civil parish in Dorset, England, situated in the Blackmore Vale, near the border with Somerset. In the 2021 census the civil parish—which includes the hamlets of Stalbridge Weston, and Thornhill—had 1,224 households and a population of 2,668. The nearest towns are Sturminster Newton, southeast, Sherborne, west, and Shaftesbury, northeast. Stalbridge is situated on the A357 on a low limestone ridge, west of the River Stour. It officially became a town in April 1992.

Though relatively small, Stalbridge has its own independent supermarket, dispensing pharmacy, dentist and optician, as well as many other services, reflecting its catchment area of surrounding farms and hamlets. It is also home to the local free newspaper, the &quot;Blackmore Vale Magazine&quot;.

==History==

There was a settlement near Stalbridge in Roman times. The town has a 15th-century church with a 19th-century tower, dedicated to Saint Mary and restored to designs by T. H. Wyatt, in 1878, which overlooks the town from a hill. The town has had market rights since the time of King George I, though it has not held a regular market for many years. In the town centre stands a 10-metre (30 ft) tall market cross, said to be the finest in the country.

Stalbridge was home to scientist Robert Boyle (see below), and writer Douglas Adams, who wrote much of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; in the town. The town also boasts that it is home to the oldest living male twins in the world.

Artist Sir James Thornhill lived just south of the town, in Thornhill Park, which he bought in 1725. The house is believed to have been originally owned by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century. In 1727, Sir James Thornhill erected an obelisk in the park to honour the accession of King George II.

From September 1863 Stalbridge was served by Stalbridge railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, with trains to Bath and Bournemouth. During World War II a Ministry of Food depot was situated here. The last train ran on 7 March 1966, and most of the tracks, station and goods yard have been replaced, though tracks still cross the road.

=== Stalbridge House ===
In 1618 Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, who had inherited Stalbridge Park from his father, decided to build a mansion house on his Stalbridge estate. He enclosed an area used as common land to the northwest of the church, moving tenant farmers out, and built a Jacobean style mansion, the fifth largest house in Dorset.

In 1631 the earl&#x27;s eldest son James brought a case against him for &quot;unnatural practices&quot;, and he was subsequently executed.

James sold the house to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. After his father&#x27;s death, the scientist Robert Boyle became Lord of the Manor, and the house was his residence between 1644 and 1652. It was here that he conducted many of his experiments.

At some point during the house&#x27;s history a stone wall was built around the boundary of Stalbridge Park. There is some argument as to when and why the wall was built. It may have been commissioned by Castlehaven as a status symbol, work for French prisoners of war during the Napoleonic Wars, or as work for local labourers in times of high unemployment.

By 1822 the house was in poor repair and the owner, Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, had it demolished. By 1827 all that remained was the raised area where it had stood. The stone was sold off and much of it is in use elsewhere in the town, including the large farm house which now stands in the park.

There are many popular local myths and ghost stories about the demise of the house, mostly involving a fire destroying the house.

Stalbridge Park features in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex as &quot;Stapleford Park&quot;.

==Governance==
Stalbridge is part of the North Dorset parliamentary constituency.

Stalbridge is part of the Stalbridge and Marnhull electoral ward, which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

Historically, Stalbridge was in Sturminster Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and North Dorset district from 1974 to 2019.

== Demographics ==
==Geography==
Stalbridge lies in the Blackmore Vale. As an area of hills, this means that the town lies largely on a gradient. The high street through the town centre follows the contour of the landscape, before climbing up Church Hill past the parish church of St. Mary, heading towards the Somerset border and Henstridge. To the east of the high street, Station Road heads down the hill, heading towards the Stalbridge trading estates, passing the modern housing estates built in the 1970s. To the West, the town climbs Barrow Hill, with older housing, some estates dating to the 1950s, and the 1990s Pond Walk.
There are two parks in Stalbridge, the larger of which is situated on Barrow hill, and hosts a football field and a cricket pitch, as well as two tennis courts. This park also has an outdoor playset. The smaller park functions largely as an outdoor playset, with two slides, a small football pitch and other toys.

There are several footpaths and bridleways in Stalbridge. A trailway follows the route of the disused Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It passes through the Stalbridge Nature Reserve, and has a hard pack surface suitable for cycles, including hybrid bicycles, or even endurance road bicycles.

<text>Francis Asbury Tarkenton (born February 3, 1940), nicknamed &quot;the Scrambler&quot;, is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons, primarily with the Minnesota Vikings. He is widely regarded as the first great dual-threat quarterback in the NFL. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, where he was recognized as a twice first-team All-SEC, and was selected by the Vikings in the third round of the 1961 NFL draft. After retiring from football, he became a media personality and computer software executive.

Tarkenton&#x27;s tenure with the Vikings spanned thirteen non-consecutive seasons. He played for Minnesota six seasons from 1961 to 1966 when he was traded to the New York Giants for five seasons, and then traded back to Minnesota for his last seven seasons from 1972 to 1978. At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton was the all-time NFL career leader in numerous records (including career passing touchdowns, yards, and completions). He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987.

In addition to his football career, Tarkenton served as a commentator on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and a co-host of &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot;. He also founded Tarkenton Software, a computer-program generator company, and he toured the U.S. promoting CASE (computer-aided software engineering) with Albert F. Case Jr. of Nastec Corporation. Tarkenton Software later merged with KnowledgeWare (with Tarkenton as president), until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994.

==Early life and education==
Fran Tarkenton was born on February 3, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia. His father, Dallas Tarkenton, was a Methodist minister. Tarkenton went to Athens High School in Athens, Georgia, and later attended the University of Georgia, where he was the quarterback on the Bulldog football team and a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

Under head coach Wally Butts and with Tarkenton as quarterback, Georgia won the Southeastern Conference championship in 1959. Tarkenton was a first-team All-SEC selection in both 1959 and 1960.

==Professional football career==
The expansion Minnesota Vikings selected Tarkenton in the third round (29th overall) of the 1961 NFL draft, and he was picked in the fifth round of the AFL draft by the Boston Patriots. He signed with the Vikings. Tarkenton, 21, played his first NFL game in Sioux Falls, South Dakota against the Dallas Cowboys (and the Vikings&#x27; first ever game as an expansion team.) On September 17 against the Chicago Bears, he came off the bench to lead the Vikings to a 37–13 victory by passing for 250 yards and four touchdown passes and running for another. He was the only player in NFL history to pass for four touchdowns in his first NFL game, until the feat was repeated by Marcus Mariota in the Tennessee Titans&#x27; 2015 season opener versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

He played for the Vikings from 1961 through 1966. His early years with the team were plagued by the trouble expected for a newly created team, with the Vikings winning a total of 10 games combined in their first three seasons, with Tarkenton winning eight of them. He threw 18 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for 1,997 yards in his first season. He rushed for 308 yards on 56 rushes for five touchdowns. The following year, he threw 22 touchdowns and 25 interceptions for 2,595 yards. He rushed for 361 yards on 41 rushes for two touchdowns.

Tarkenton did not get along with team coach Norm Van Brocklin, who did not like his penchant for scrambling. For the Week 13 game against Atlanta in 1966, Van Brocklin went as far as benching Tarkenton to put in Bob Berry, a QB more to Van Brocklin&#x27;s preferences (the Vikings proceeded to lose 20–14 to the 1-10 expansion team). Tarkenton soon demanded a trade. In February 1967, Van Brocklin announced his resignation. On March 7, 1967, Tarkenton was traded to the New York Giants for a first and second round pick in 1967, a first-round pick in 1968 and a second-round pick in 1969. In his first year with the Giants, Tarkenton passed for a then-career high 3,088 yards and a career high 29 touchdown passes en route to a 7–7 record, a huge improvement for a team that had finished 1-12-1 the year before. Tarkenton has stated that his 1967 season remains the highlight of his career. In the 1968 season, he helped lead the team to a 7–7 record. He passed for 2,555 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions to go with 57 carries for 301 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. In the first game of the 1969 season, the Giants played the Vikings. After trailing 23–10 in the fourth quarter, Tarkenton threw two touchdown passes to secure a 24–23 comeback victory over his former team. The 24 points allowed by Minnesota&#x27;s defense were a season-worst for the unit, one more point than the Vikings allowed in losing Super Bowl IV to the Kansas City Chiefs in January.

Tarkenton enjoyed his best season with the Giants in 1970. They overcame an 0–3 start with nine wins in the next ten games and moved into position to win the NFC East division championship in week 14. However, New York was routed 31–3 by the Los Angeles Rams at Yankee Stadium to finish at 9–5, one game behind the division champion Dallas Cowboys and the wild card Detroit Lions. The 1970 season was the closest the Giants came to making the playoffs during a 17-year drought, from 1964 through 1980.

On January 27, 1972, Tarkenton was traded back to the Vikings for quarterback Norm Snead, receiver Bob Grim, running back Vince Clements, a first rounder in 1972 (24th overall: Larry Jacobson, defensive lineman) and a second rounder in 1973 (40th overall: Brad Van Pelt, linebacker). Tarkenton led the Vikings to three National Football Conference championships, but the Vikings lost each ensuing Super Bowl. In the 1974 Super Bowl, Minnesota lost to the Miami Dolphins 24–7 in Houston. They lost the 1975 Super Bowl to the Pittsburgh Steelers 16–6 in New Orleans, and (in Minnesota&#x27;s last Super Bowl to date) lost the 1977 Super Bowl to the Oakland Raiders 32–14 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.
In his 18 NFL seasons, Tarkenton completed 3,686 of 6,467 passes for 47,003 yards and 342 touchdowns, with 266 interceptions, all of which were NFL records at the time of his retirement. Tarkenton&#x27;s 47,003 career passing yards rank him 14th all time, while his 342 career passing touchdowns is 11th all time in NFL history. He also is eighth on the all-time list of regular-season wins by a starting quarterback with 124 regular season victories. He used his impressive scrambling ability to rack up 3,674 rushing yards and 32 touchdowns on 675 carries. During his career, Tarkenton ran for a touchdown in 15 different seasons, an NFL record among quarterbacks. He ranks seventh in career rushing yards among quarterbacks, behind Randall Cunningham, Lamar Jackson, Steve Young, Michael Vick, Cam Newton, and Russell Wilson. He is also one of four NFL quarterbacks ever to rush for at least 300 yards in seven different seasons; the others are Cam Newton, Michael Vick, and Tobin Rote. When he retired, Tarkenton held NFL career records in pass attempts, completions, yardage, touchdowns, rushing yards by a quarterback, and wins by a starting quarterback.

The Vikings finished the 1975 season with an NFC-best 12–2 record and Tarkenton won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award while capturing All-Pro honors in the process. He was also a second-team All-Pro in 1973 and earned All-NFC selections in 1972 and 1976. He was named second-team All-NFC in 1970 and 1974. Tarkenton was selected to play in nine Pro Bowls.

Tarkenton was indecisive on his retirement during the last seven years of his playing career. In the early months of 1979, he was offered a contract to play one more year and &quot;receive $100,000 annually for the next 10 years as a nonplayer.&quot; On May 8, 1979, he announced his retirement.

Despite not winning a Super Bowl, he won six playoff games, and in 1999 he was ranked #59 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Playing in the era of sacks not being counted by the league, Tarkenton was sacked 570 times in his career, unofficially the most in league history.

Tarkenton was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1977, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Athens, Georgia Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Books==
A biography of Tarkenton titled &quot;Better Scramble than Lose&quot; was published in 1969. This followed Tarkenton&#x27;s 1967 autobiography &quot;No Time for Losing&quot; and preceded by several years his 1977 autobiography &quot;Tarkenton&quot; co-written with Jim Klobuchar. The autobiographies chronicle not only his football career but also his personal evolution from his early football days as a preacher&#x27;s son. Tarkenton co-wrote with Brock Yates a book in 1971 titled &quot;Broken Patterns: The Education of a Quarterback&quot;, a chronicle of the 1970 New York Giants season.

In 1986, Tarkenton, with author Herb Resincow, wrote a novel titled &quot;Murder at the Super Bowl&quot;, the whodunit story of a football coach killed just before his team is to participate in the championship game.

Tarkenton wrote the self-help, motivational books &quot;Playing to Win&quot; in 1984, and &quot;How to Motivate People: The Team Strategy for Success&quot; in 1986. He also wrote the motivational self-help business book titled &quot;What Losing Taught Me About Winning&quot;, and &quot;Every Day is Game Day&quot;. In 1987, Tarkenton hosted a &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; TV infomercial that sold the book with an audio cassette version (the audio cassettes contained an introduction and conclusion by Tarkenton).

==Business ventures and investments==
Mark McCormack helped Tarkenton invest, making him wealthy enough to &quot;retire this week if [he] wanted to&quot;, as &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote in 1971. Tarkenton was a pioneer in computer software, and founder of Tarkenton Software, a program generator company. He toured the United States promoting CASE or &quot;computer-aided software engineering&quot; with Albert F. Case, Jr. of Nastec Corporation, but ultimately merged his software firm with James Martin&#x27;s KnowledgeWare, of which Tarkenton was president until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994.

Tarkenton served as a color commentator on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from 1979 to 1982.
In 1999, Tarkenton was fined by federal regulators as part of a securities fraud sweep. According to the &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, &quot;In Tarkenton&#x27;s case, the Hall of Fame quarterback and 10 other former executives of his computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were accused of inflating by millions of dollars the company&#x27;s earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. The former Minnesota Vikings quarterback agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and $54,187 in restitution. He did not admit any wrongdoing&quot;.

Since then, Tarkenton has been promoting various products and services including Tony Robbins and 1-800-BAR-NONE. He also founded GoSmallBiz, a small-business consulting website. He also operates an annuity marketing firm called Tarkenton Financial.

==Politics==
During the 2016 Republican National Convention, Tarkenton gave a speech endorsing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
Tarkenton has been married twice and has four children.

His first marriage was to Anna Elaine Merrell of Decatur, Georgia. They wed on December 22, 1960, at First Baptist Church in Decatur, and divorced in March 1982. They had three children: daughter Angela (born 1964), son Matthew (born 1968), and daughter Melissa (born 1969).

Tarkenton married his second wife, Linda Sebastian, in the mid-1980s. They have one daughter, Hayley Gray Tarkenton (born 1988), a singer-songwriter.

<doc id="272717" wikidata="Q246812" url="?curid=272717" title="Sweyn II of Denmark">
<text>Sweyn II ( – 28 April 1076), also known as Sweyn Estridsson (, ) and Sweyn Ulfsson, was King of Denmark from 1047 until his death in 1076. He was the son of Ulf Thorgilsson and Estrid Svendsdatter, and the grandson of Sweyn Forkbeard through his mother&#x27;s line. He was married at least two times, and fathered 20 children or more out of wedlock, including the five future kings Harald Hen, Saint Canute, Oluf Hunger, Eric Evergood, and Niels.

He was courageous in battle, but did not have much success as a military commander. His skeleton reveals that he was a tall, powerfully built man who walked with a limp.

==Biography==
===Accession to the throne===
Sweyn was born in England, as the son of Ulf Thorgilsson and Estrid Svendsdatter, the latter of whom was the daughter of King Sweyn I Forkbeard and sister of Kings Harald II and Canute the Great. Sweyn grew up a military leader, and served under king Anund Jacob of Sweden for a time. He pillaged the Elbe-Weser area in 1040, but was caught by the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, who released him shortly thereafter.

Svend was made a &quot;jarl&quot; under Danish king Harthacnut (the two were first cousins), and led a campaign for him against Norway, but was beaten by Magnus I of Norway. When Harthacnut died in 1042, Magnus claimed the Danish throne and made Svend the &quot;jarl&quot; of Jutland. In 1043, Sweyn fought for Magnus at the Battle of Lyrskov Heath at Hedeby, near the present-day border of Denmark and Germany. Sweyn won a great reputation at Lyrskov Heath, and had the Danish nobles crown him king in Viborg in Jutland. He was defeated by Magnus on several occasions, and had to flee to Sweden. Eventually he managed to return and establish a foothold in Scania.

The war between Magnus and Sweyn lasted until 1045, when Magnus&#x27; uncle Harald Hardrada returned to Norway from exile. Harald and Sweyn joined forces, and Magnus decided to share the Norwegian throne with Harald. In 1047 Magnus died, having stated on his deathbed that his kingdom would be divided: Harald would get the throne of Norway, while Sweyn would be king of Denmark. Upon hearing of Magnus&#x27; death Sweyn said, &quot;Now so help me God, I shall never yield Denmark&quot;.

===Feud with Harald Hardrada===
Harald, unwilling to relinquish Denmark, attacked Sweyn and fought a long war. Harald sacked Hedeby in 1050, and also sacked Aarhus. Sweyn almost captured Harald in 1050, when Harald attacked the coast of Jutland and loaded his ships with goods and captives. Sweyn&#x27;s flotilla caught up with the Norwegians and Harald ordered his men to throw out the captured goods, thinking the Danes would stop to get the goods. Sweyn ordered his men to leave the goods and go after Harald. Harald then ordered his men to throw the captives overboard. For them Sweyn was willing to let Harald slip away.
Sweyn came close to losing his life at the naval Battle of Niså off the coast of Halland in 1062. According to the sagas Harald urged Sweyn to meet him in a final and decisive battle at Elv in the spring of 1062. When Sweyn and the Danish army did not show up, Harald sent home a large part of his army, only keeping the more professional warriors in his fleet. When Sweyn finally came to meet Harald, his fleet numbered 300 ships to Harald&#x27;s 150. The fleets met at night and the battle lasted until morning, when the Danes started to flee. In the sagas the Norwegian victory is largely credited to earl Haakon Ivarsson, who disengaged his ships from the Norwegian flanks and started attacking the weakened ships on the Danish flanks. This might be the aiding Norwegian chieftain that Saxo Grammaticus refers to, as turning the tide in Norwegian favour. Sweyn managed to escape the battle, reached land and stopped at the house of a peasant to ask for something to eat. &quot;What was the terrible rumbling in the night?&quot; she asked. &quot;Didn&#x27;t you know the two kings were fighting all night?&quot; asked one of Sweyn&#x27;s men. &quot;Who won, then?&quot; the woman asked. &quot;Norwegians,&quot; came the reply. &quot;It&#x27;s a shame on us, for a king we already have. He limps and is timid.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; King Sweyn explained, &quot;Timid the king of the Danes is assuredly not,&quot; defended another of the king&#x27;s men, &quot;but luck isn&#x27;t with him and he lacks a victory.&quot; The housecarl brought the men water and a towel to wash themselves. As the king was drying his hands, the woman tore the cloth from him, &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself for using the whole towel for yourself,&quot; she scolded. &quot;The day will come when I will have your permission to use the whole cloth,&quot; was the king&#x27;s comment. Her husband gave the king a horse and Sweyn continued on his way to Zealand.

Some time later the peasant was called to Zealand and given lands there for his service to the king, but his wife had to remain behind in Halland. Sweyn had a reputation for generosity and kindness that helped him on several occasions to win the trust of his people. Harald relinquished his claims to Denmark in 1064, in exchange for Sweyn&#x27;s recognition of Harald as Harald III of Norway. Harald then sailed off to England to claim the crown of England, and was killed there.

===Consolidation of power===

Sweyn&#x27;s connection to the Danish kings was his mother Estrid Svendsdatter, and he took the matronymic surname Estridsson after her, emphasizing his link to the Danish royal house. He also minted his own coins.

Sweyn sought to consolidate his power through links to the church as well as foreign powers, and actively sought the friendship of the popes. He wanted his eldest son Knud Magnus crowned by the Pope, but Knud died on the journey to Rome. He also unsuccessfully pressed for Harald Bluetooth, the first Christian king of Denmark, to be sanctified. He was an ally of Emperor Henry III against Count Baldwin V of Flanders in 1049, and Sweyn assisted his son-in-law Gottschalk in the Liutizi Civil War of 1057.

After Harald Hardrada was killed, and William the Conqueror had conquered England, Sweyn turned his attention to England, once ruled by his uncle Canute the Great. He joined forces with Edgar Atheling, the last remaining heir of the Anglo-Saxon royal house, and sent a force to attack king William in 1069. However, after capturing York, Sweyn accepted a payment from William to desert Edgar, who then returned into exile in Scotland. Sweyn failed another attempt in 1074/1075.

===Relationship with the church===
Sweyn feared that Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg would fill the upper ranks of Denmark&#x27;s churches with Germans, so he brought Anglo-Danes over from England to keep the Danish church independent. Under the influence of Sweyn, Denmark was divided into eight dioceses around 1060. He set the dioceses up by donating large tracts of land, with the Diocese of Roskilde being the most-favoured one, as he had a good relationship with Bishop Vilhelm. When Archbishop Adalbert died in 1072, Sweyn was able to deal directly with the Holy See.

He brought scholars to Denmark to teach him and his people Latin so they could converse with the rest of Europe on equal terms. Adam of Bremen travelled to meet this learned king and came away with greater respect for the king&#x27;s patience and wisdom. Sweyn encouraged the building of churches all over Denmark, and Adam of Bremen was astounded that there were 300 churches in Scania alone, more than in all the other countries of the north put together.

===Death===
King Sweyn died at the royal estate Søderup, west of Åbenrå at the Little Belt strait. The Danish chronicles inaccurately date his death to 1074, but it is known that he received and answered letters in 1075 and died in 1076. The king&#x27;s body was carried to Roskilde Cathedral where he was interred in a pillar of the choir next to the remains of Bishop Vilhelm (who was the actual person who died in 1074). Later he was called the &quot;father of kings&quot; because five of his fifteen sons became kings of Denmark.

He was the last Viking ruler of Denmark and an ancestor of all subsequent Danish kings. The remains of other Danish kings are also entombed in Roskilde Cathedral. According to the saga, Sweyn&#x27;s mother was entombed inside a pillar across from the chapel. However, analysis of mitochondrial DNA proved that this person was not the king&#x27;s mother, as his mtDNA indicated Haplogroup H, HVR1 7028C.

==Legacy==
One of the legacies of King Sweyn was a fundamental change in Danish society which had been based on whether a person was free or a bondsman. Sweyn is often considered to be Denmark&#x27;s last Viking king as well as the first medieval one. A strengthened church in alliance with the land-owning noble families begin to pit their power against the royal family. The peasants were left to fend for themselves.

Sweyn built a strong foundation for royal power through cooperation with the church. He completed the final partition of Denmark into dioceses by corresponding directly with the pope, bypassing the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. During his reign hundreds of small wooden churches were built throughout the kingdom; many were rebuilt in stone in the 12th century. Sweyn sought to create a Nordic Archbishopric under Danish rule, a feat which his son Eric I accomplished.

Sweyn seems to have been able to read and write, and was described as an especially educated monarch by his personal friend Pope Gregory VII. He is the source of much of our current knowledge about Denmark and Sweden in the 9th and 10th centuries, having told the story of his ancestry to historian Adam of Bremen around 1070.

==Family==
Sweyn&#x27;s first marriage was to Gyda of Sweden, daughter of king Anund Jacob of Sweden. His second marriage, in 1050, was to Gunnhildr Sveinsdóttir, the stepmother of Gyda. The Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen ordered that the union be dissolved, which was effectuated by Pope Leo IX. According to Adam of Bremen, Sweyn had a certain &quot;Tora&quot; at his court. Historian Sture Bolin argues that this &quot;Tora&quot; is actually Tora Torbergsdatter, the mother of king Olaf III of Norway, linking this to a passage about a king marrying the mother of a king named Olof. He took one mistress after another during his life. Sweyn fathered at least 20 children, of whom only one was born in wedlock.

<text>Alvin Ray &quot;Pete&quot; Rozelle (; March 1, 1926 – December 6, 1996) was an American professional football executive. Rozelle served as the commissioner of the National Football League (NFL) for nearly thirty years, from January 1960 until his retirement in November 1989. He became the youngest commissioner in NFL history at the age of just 33. He is credited with making the NFL into one of the most successful sports leagues in the world.

During his tenure, Rozelle saw the NFL grow from 12 teams to 28, oversaw the creation of large television-rights deals and the creation of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in 1970, oversaw the 1970 AFL–NFL merger and the creation of the Super Bowl, and helped the NFL move from a twelve-game schedule to a sixteen-game schedule. By the time of his retirement, many people considered him the most powerful commissioner in sports. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985.

==Early life==
Born in South Gate, California, Rozelle grew up in neighboring Lynwood during the Great Depression. He graduated from Compton High School in 1944, with Duke Snider, lettering in tennis and basketball. He was drafted into the U.S. Navy in 1944 and served 18 months in the Pacific on an oil tanker.

Rozelle entered Compton Community College in 1946. While there he worked as the student athletic news director and also worked part-time for the Los Angeles Rams as a public relations assistant. Pete Newell, head coach for the University of San Francisco Dons basketball team, came to Compton in 1948 for a recruiting visit. Impressed by Rozelle, Newell helped arrange for him to get a full scholarship to work in a similar capacity at USF.

Rozelle enrolled at USF that year and worked as a student publicist for the USF Dons athletic department. In addition to promoting the school&#x27;s football team he was able to draw national attention to the Dons&#x27; 1949 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship basketball team. After graduating from USF in 1950 he was hired by the school as the full-time athletic news director.

In 1952, he re-joined the Rams as a PR specialist. Leaving after three years, he held a series of public relations jobs in southern California, including marketing the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia for a Los Angeles-based company. In 1957, he returned to the Rams, a disorganized, unprofitable team, lost in the growing L.A. market, as their general manager. In spite of continued struggles on the field, including a league-worst 2–10 record in 1959, he turned them into a business success in just three years.

==NFL commissioner==
===1960s===
After Bert Bell&#x27;s death in October , the 33-year-old Rozelle was the surprise choice for his replacement as NFL commissioner. According to Howard Cosell in his 1985 book &quot;I Never Played the Game&quot;, the owners took 23 ballots before settling on Rozelle as NFL Commissioner at a January 26, 1960, meeting.

When he took office following the season, there were twelve teams in the NFL playing a twelve-game schedule to frequently half-empty stadiums, and only a few teams had television contracts. The NFL in was following a business model that had evolved from the 1930s. One of Rozelle&#x27;s early accomplishments was helping the league adopt profit-sharing of gate and television revenues. The revenue-sharing was a major factor in stabilizing the NFL and guaranteeing the success of its small-market teams. Another important contribution was Rozelle&#x27;s success in negotiating large television contracts to broadcast every NFL game played each season. In doing so, he deftly played one television network against the other. In early 1962, Rozelle was re-elected to a five-year contract to remain as commissioner, with a salary continuing at $50,000 per year. Less than five months later, he was granted a $10,000 bonus (for ) and his annual salary was increased by $10,000 to $60,000.

====John F. Kennedy assassination====

After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Rozelle wrestled with the decision of whether to cancel that Sunday&#x27;s games. Rozelle and White House press secretary Pierre Salinger had been classmates at the University of San Francisco, so Rozelle consulted with him. Salinger urged Rozelle to play the games, so he agreed for the schedule to proceed. Rozelle felt that way, saying: &quot;It has been traditional in sports for athletes to perform in times of great personal tragedy. Football was Mr. Kennedy&#x27;s game. He thrived on competition.&quot; After their win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia, players on the Washington Redskins asked Coach Bill McPeak to send the game ball to the White House, thanking Rozelle for allowing the games to be played that weekend, saying that they were &quot;playing...for President Kennedy and in his memory.&quot; There were players and news outlets that disagreed with the decision, and Rozelle subsequently thought it might have been wiser to cancel those games. The American Football League (AFL) and most major colleges did not play games that weekend.

Citing his &quot;aptitude for conciliation&quot; with the league&#x27;s owners, his work in expanding the NFL, and his crackdown on player gambling, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Rozelle their &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; for 1963.

====The AFL====
By , the rival American Football League obtained a new NBC-TV contract and had signed a new superstar in Joe Namath. As the leagues battled to sign top talent, bonuses and salaries grew dramatically, especially after a series of &quot;raids&quot; on each other&#x27;s talent, both signed and unsigned. The leagues agreed to a merger in 1966. Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967, the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl. Rozelle led negotiations with AFL and NFL executives to merge the two leagues. In October 1966, he testified in front of Congress and convinced them to allow the merger. Rozelle played an important role in making the Super Bowl the most watched sporting event in the United States.

Due to television contracts, the AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season schedules, but they met in the preseason and in the championship game. Although Rozelle nominally remained the NFL commissioner, he was given broad authority over both leagues after AFL Commissioner Al Davis was forced to resign and ultimately replaced by an AFL &quot;President&quot; subordinate to the NFL Commissioner. During this time, the NFL Commissioner&#x27;s office came to resemble that of the Commissioner of Baseball and Rozelle unofficially became known as the &quot;Football Commissioner&quot; although that was never an official title. Meanwhile, the AFL expanded, adding the Miami Dolphins in 1966, and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1967. Also during this period, the NFL added the Atlanta Falcons in 1966, and the New Orleans Saints in 1967. In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL and the league reorganized with the ten AFL franchises along with the previous NFL teams Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers becoming part of the newly formed American Football Conference (AFC), with all of the remaining pre-merger NFL teams forming the National Football Conference (NFC). By 1970, the newly reconstituted NFL stood at 26 teams.

===1970s===
In 1970, Rozelle proposed his week-night prime time television concept, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, to Roone Arledge, then the president of ABC Sports. After selling his idea to ABC, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; premiered in September 1970 with the Cleveland Browns against the New York Jets; the Browns won the game, 31–21. The program is still broadcast today. &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; aired on ABC for 36 seasons (1970–2005). Except for the 1998 season in which games aired at 8:20 p.m. Eastern Time, games aired at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The first broadcast announcing team was Don Meredith, Howard Cosell, and Keith Jackson. In 2006, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; was moved to ABC&#x27;s sister network ESPN. The NFL expanded by two more teams in 1976, with the addition of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks; this brought the league to 28 teams, which would stand as such for the rest of Rozelle&#x27;s tenure as commissioner.

He enacted in 1963 and was the namesake of the Rozelle rule which required a team signing a free agent to compensate that player&#x27;s former ballclub with other players and/or draft selections and that he was the lone arbiter in determining the compensation package. Exercised only four times, the rule was declared a violation of antitrust laws by Judge Earl R. Larson in &quot;Mackey v. National Football League&quot; on December 30, 1975. The plaintiffs had successfully contended that the rule deterred teams from signing free agents out of fear of not knowing the compensation that would have to be surrendered.

===1980s===

In the 1980s, Al Davis, owner of the Oakland Raiders franchise, sued the NFL in order to relocate the team to Los Angeles. Rozelle represented the NFL, testifying in court to block the Raiders&#x27; move. Ultimately, the NFL lost its court case with Davis, and the Oakland franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1982. The tension between Rozelle and Davis, who had wanted to be NFL commissioner, was apparent throughout the case. In January 1981, just after the case was settled, the Oakland Raiders won Super Bowl XV and Rozelle as commissioner was tasked with handing the Super Bowl Trophy to Davis. The Raiders moved back to Oakland in 1995.

===Influence===
Under Rozelle the NFL thrived and became an American institution, despite two players&#x27; strikes and two different competing leagues. He retired as commissioner on November 5, . By the time of his resignation, the number of teams in the league had grown to 28, and team owners presided over sizable revenues from U.S. broadcasting networks.

Rozelle&#x27;s legacy of equalization has been felt not only in the NFL, but also in the Australian Football League, the major Australian-rules football competition. In 1986, The AFL Commission adopted a policy of equalization based on the method pioneered by Rozelle in the NFL. It is because of this decision that expansion clubs have been able to survive, as well as older clubs with smaller support bases. An example of this is the 1996 AFL Grand Final between North Melbourne and the Sydney Swans, two teams with small supporter bases.

===Honors===
Rozelle was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985 while still serving as its commissioner. The NFL&#x27;s annual Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award was established in 1989 to recognize &quot;longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football&quot;, and is awarded annually by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 1990, the league instituted the Pete Rozelle Trophy to honor the Super Bowl MVP, first awarded in the season at Super Bowl XXV on January 27, 1991. A month after Rozelle&#x27;s death in December 1996, the NFL honored his legacy with a decal on the back of the helmets of the teams competing in Super Bowl XXXI.

In 1990, Rozelle received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation in 1991.

For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, Rozelle was honored by Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commissioners with a &quot;Court of Honor&quot; plaque at the Coliseum.

==Personal life and death==
Rozelle married Jane Coupe, an artist, in 1949. The couple had one child, Anne Marie, born in 1958. Rozelle was awarded full custody of Anne Marie after his 1972 divorce due to Coupe&#x27;s alcoholism. Rozelle remarried in December 1973 to Carrie Cooke, a former daughter-in-law of Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Washington Redskins.

On December 6, 1996, seven years after his retirement in 1989, Rozelle died of brain cancer at the age of 70 at Rancho Santa Fe, California, and was interred at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.

<doc id="272723" wikidata="Q212284" url="?curid=272723" title="Canute IV of Denmark">
<text>Canute IV ( – 10 July 1086), later known as Canute the Holy () or Saint Canute (&quot;Sankt Knud&quot;), was King of Denmark from 1080 until 1086. Canute was an ambitious king who sought to strengthen the Danish monarchy, devotedly supported the Roman Catholic Church, and had designs on the English throne. Slain by rebels in 1086, he was the first Danish king to be canonized. He was recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as patron saint of Denmark in 1101.

==Life==
Canute was born , one of the many sons of Sweyn II Estridsson by an unknown mistress. He is first noted as a member of Sweyn&#x27;s 1069 raid on England, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Canute was one of the leaders of another raid against England in 1075. When returning from England in 1075, the Danish fleet stopped in the County of Flanders. Because of its hostility towards William I of England, Flanders was a natural ally for the Danes. He also led successful campaigns to Sember and Ester, according to skald Kálfr Mánason.

When Sweyn died, Canute&#x27;s brother Harald III was elected king, and as Canute went into exile in Sweden, he was possibly involved in the active opposition to Harald. On 17 April 1080, Harald died, and Canute succeeded him to the throne of Denmark. On his accession, he married Adela, daughter of Count Robert I of Flanders. They had one son, Charles, who was born in 1084, and twin daughters Cæcilia (who later married Erik Jarl) and Ingerid (who later married Folke the Fat), who were born shortly before his death (ca. 1085/86). Ingerid&#x27;s descendants, the House of Bjälbo, would ascend to the throne of Sweden and Norway and Canute IV&#x27;s blood returned to the Danish throne in the person of Olaf II of Denmark.

===King of Denmark===
Canute quickly proved himself to be a highly ambitious king as well as a devout one. He enhanced the authority of the church, and demanded austere observation of church holidays. He gave large gifts to the churches in Dalby, Odense, Roskilde, and Viborg, and especially to Lund. Ever a champion of the Church, he sought to enforce the collection of tithes. His aggrandizement of the church served to create a powerful ally, who in turn supported Canute&#x27;s power position.

In May 1085, Canute wrote a letter of donation to Lund Cathedral, which was under construction, granting it large tracts of land in Scania, Zealand, and Amager. He founded Lund Cathedral School at the same time. Canute had gathered the land largely as pay for the pardon of outlawed subjects. The clerics at Lund got extended prerogatives of the land, being able to tax and fine the peasantry there. However, Canute kept his universal royal rights to pardon the outlaws, impose fines on subjects who failed to answer his &quot;leding&quot; call to war, and demand transportation for his retinue.

His reign was marked by vigorous attempts to increase royal power in Denmark, by stifling the nobles and keeping them to the word of the law. Canute issued edicts arrogating to himself the ownership of common land, the right to the goods from shipwrecks, and the right to inherit the possessions of foreigners and kinless folk. He also issued laws to protect freed thralls as well as foreign clerics and merchants. These policies led to discontent among his subjects, who were unaccustomed to a king claiming such powers and interfering in their daily lives.

===Aborted attempt on England===
However, Canute&#x27;s ambitions were not purely domestic. As the grandnephew of Canute the Great, who had ruled England, Denmark and Norway until 1035, Canute considered the crown of England to be rightfully his and regarded William I of England as a usurper. In 1085, with the support of his father-in-law, Count Robert, and Olaf III of Norway, Canute planned an invasion of England and called his fleet in &quot;leding&quot; at the Limfjord. The fleet never set sail, as Canute was preoccupied in Schleswig by the potential threat of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor with whom both Denmark and Flanders were on unfriendly terms. Canute feared an invasion by Henry, whose enemy Hermann of Salm had sought refuge in Denmark.

The warriors of the fleet, mostly made up of peasants who needed to be home for the harvest season, got weary of waiting and elected Canute&#x27;s brother Olaf (the later Olaf I of Denmark) to argue their case. That raised the suspicion of Canute, who had Olaf arrested and sent to Flanders. The &quot;leding&quot; was eventually dispersed, and the peasants tended to their harvests.

===Death===
Before the fleet could reassemble, a peasant revolt broke out in Vendsyssel, where Canute was staying, in early 1086. Canute first fled to Schleswig and eventually to Odense. On 10 July 1086, Canute and his men took refuge inside the wooden St. Alban&#x27;s Priory, in Odense. The rebels stormed into the church and slew Canute, along with his brother Benedict and seventeen of their followers, before the altar. According to the chronicler Ælnoth of Canterbury, Canute died following a lance thrust in the flank. He was succeeded by Olaf as Olaf I of Denmark.

==Canonization==

Because of his martyrdom and advocacy of the Church, Canute quickly began to be considered a saint. Under the reign of Olaf, Denmark suffered from crop failure, which was seen as divine retribution for the sacrilegious killing of Canute. Miracles were soon reported as taking place at his grave, and his canonization was already being sought during the reign of Olaf.

On 19 April 1101, persuaded by the envoys from Eric I of Denmark, Pope Paschal II confirmed the &quot;cult of Canute&quot; that had arisen, and King Canute IV was canonized. He was the first Dane to be canonized. 10 July is recognised by the Catholic Church as his feast day. In Sweden and Finland he is historically, however, partially associated with St. Knut&#x27;s Day, which in reality was celebrated in the memory of the death of his nephew, Canute Lavard.

In 1300, his remains and those of his brother Benedict were interred in Saint Canute&#x27;s Cathedral, built in his honour, where his remains are on display. 

== Cult ==
Canute was viewed as a martyr following his death and there were reports of miracles received through his intercession. Many people who made pilgrimages to his tomb in Odense were cured of illnesses and maladies. As such his cult spread throughout Denmark. The English monk Aelnoth of Canterbury wrote his biography which helped spread devotion to him in England. The Benedictine monastery at Odense served as the cult centre for Canute. During the 1120s or 1130s devotion to the martyred king reached it&#x27;s pinnacle in Denmark. Among the evidence for the saints cult in Denmark he was depicted in Næstved Church with a beautiful statue and a screen with images illustrating his life, dating to the 15th century.

==Legacy==
The reign of Canute has been interpreted differently through the times; from a violent king who tyrannized his subjects, to a strict but fair ruler who devotedly supported the Roman Catholic Church and fought for justice without regard to his own person. He was never a thoroughly popular saint in Denmark, but his sainthood granted the Danish monarchy an aura of divine legitimacy. The cause of the rebellion which killed Canute is unknown, but has been speculated as originating in fines issued to the peasants breaking the &quot;leding&quot; of 1085 as specified in the Chronicon Roskildense, or as a result of his vigorous tithe policy.

The document of his donation to Lund Cathedral was the oldest comprehensive text from Denmark, and provided broad insights into Danish post-Viking Age society. The donation might have had the aim of establishing the Danish Archdiocese of Lund according to Sweyn II Estridsson&#x27;s wishes, which was finally achieved in 1104. Canute&#x27;s son Carl became Count of Flanders from 1119 to 1127, ruling as Charles the Good. Like his father, Charles was slain in a church by rebels (in Bruges, 1127), and later beatified by the Catholic church. According to Niels Lund, Lecturer in Medieval History at the University of Copenhagen, Canute&#x27;s abortive invasion of England &quot;marked the end of the Viking Age.&quot;

In 2008, an X-ray computed tomography was taken of Canute, which showed that he was right-handed and of a slender build. It also specified his cause of death as a thrust to the sacrum through the abdomen, negating Ælnoth&#x27;s account. He had no injuries indicating he fought against multiple enemies, which can be seen as supporting an account saying he faced his death without a struggle.

==Popular culture==
In parts of Spain, Canute&#x27;s feast day has reportedly become a tongue-in-cheek &quot;holiday&quot; for the marijuana legalization movement, appropriating the Spanish version of his name, &quot;Canuto&quot;, which coincidentally is also the word for a marijuana cigarette.

<doc id="272729" wikidata="Q359596" url="?curid=272729" title="Canute VI of Denmark">
<text>Canute VI (; c. 1163 – 12 November 1202) was King of Denmark from 1182 to 1202. 
Contemporary sources describe Canute as an earnest, strongly religious man.

==Background==
Canute VI was the eldest son of King Valdemar I and Sophia of Polotsk. His younger brother Valdemar was born in 1170. On 25 June 1170, at age 7, Canute was proclaimed and crowned co-king of Denmark with his father. Canute was crowned in the first coronation in Danish history by Archbishop Eskil of Lund at Ringsted.

==Reign==
Following his father&#x27;s death in 1182, Canute became sole ruler and King of Denmark in 1182. at the Urnehoved Assembly (Danish: &quot;landsting&quot;) and subsequently at the other assemblies throughout Denmark. He immediately faced a peasant uprising in Skåne. The peasants refused to pay Bishop Absalon&#x27;s tithe. They met at the Skåne Assembly and chose Harald Skreng, one of Canute’s friends to represent them to the king to plead their case. The king refused to hear Skreng out and began to gather an army to teach the peasants their place. Before the king could muster his army, the nobles of Halland and Skåne cobbled together their own army and defeated the peasants in a bloody battle at Dösjebro (&quot;Dysjebro&quot;) in Skåne. Canute arrived with his army and proceeded to teach the peasants a lesson with fire and sword. Canute was so relentless that Bishop Absalon begged the king to desist.
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa had compelled Canute&#x27;s father to acknowledge him as overlord, and in 1184 Barbarossa sent a messenger to Canute requiring him to acknowledge the emperor as his liege. Canute failed to respond, so the emperor sent a second messenger threatening the emperor&#x27;s wrath if Canute failed to acknowledge his liege lord. Bishop Absalon replied to the messenger on behalf of Canute. &quot;Canute is as free a king as the emperor. He has as much right to Denmark as the emperor has to the Holy Roman Empire, and so the emperor should expect no allegiance from this place.&quot;

The emperor flew into a rage when he received Canute&#x27;s reply, but because of troubles farther south, ordered his vassal, Bogislaw I of Pomerania to invade Denmark. Duke Bogislaw, recognizing a great opportunity quickly gathered 500 ships. The first notice of the pending invasion came from Jaromar I, Prince of Rügen who sailed to Zealand to give warning. The king was in Jutland, and so it was left to Bishop Absalon to order every available ship from Zealand, Funen and Skåne to meet him in six days. Absalon sailed for Rügen with his fleet and waited for Bugislaw to show up. When the enemy failed to appear, Absalon sent out scouts to bring word when the Pomeranian fleet arrived. He ordered his men to go ashore so he could celebrate mass on Second Easter Day. In the middle of services, one of the scouts ran into the church shouting that the enemy had been sighted through the fog. &quot;Now will I let my sword sing the mass to the praise of God!&quot; exclaimed Absalon as he set aside the altar implements.

The Danish fleet weighed anchor and sailed through the fog toward the Pomeranians. Bugislaw&#x27;s fleet saw nothing of the Danes until they were close enough to hear their war cries. Fear swept through the Pomeranians, and they tried to row away, but they were in such close quarters that the ships couldn&#x27;t turn. The men panicked and began jumping from ship to ship which caused eight ships to founder. The Danes threw themselves onto the ships to plunder them when Absalon shouted that they should leave the goods and go after the ships. Few complied and with just seven ships, Absalon routed the entire Pomeranian fleet, capturing 35 enemy ships. Absalon sent Bugislaw&#x27;s own great tent to Canute, who was still in Jutland. With Bugislaw&#x27;s defeat the emperor gave up, for a time, his attempt to rule Denmark.

Canute ordered two invasions of Pomerania and in 1185 forced Bogislaw to acknowledge Canute as his overlord. From that time until 1972 the kings of Denmark used the title &quot;King of the Wends&quot; (&quot;De Venders Koning&quot;) as part of a lengthy list of duchies, counties, and regions ruled by Danish monarchs through the centuries. Canute personally led a crusade against the pagan Estonians in 1197.

Canute&#x27;s younger brother Valdemar, Duke of Southern Jutland, was just twelve years old when his father died and Bishop Valdemar of Schleswig (1158-1236) was appointed regent until Valdemar came of age to rule. Bishop Valdemar was ambitious and began gathering support of German nobles to support him against the king. Disguising his own interests as young Valdemar&#x27;s, Bishop Valdemar plotted with Count Adolf III of Holstein (1160–1225) to overthrow King Canute and set himself up as king. When Valdemar was selected as Archbishop of Lund, he spoke openly of his plans. Young Duke Valdemar asked to meet with Bishop Valdemar at Åbenrå in 1192. When the powerful bishop arrived, young Valdemar ordered his men to arrest the bishop and sent him in chains to Søborg Tower in North Zealand for the next 13 years. In 1199 Count Adolf tried to raise opposition to Valdemar in southern Denmark, so the young Duke attacked Adolf&#x27;s new fortress at Rendsburg. Valdemar defeated Adolf&#x27;s army in the Battle of Stellau in 1201 and captured the count who spent the next three years in Søborg Tower with the archbishop. In order to buy his freedom, the count had to turn over all his lands north of the Elbe to Duke Valdemar in 1203.

==Succession==
Canute&#x27;s friend and chief advisor, Bishop Absalon died on 21 March 1201. He had been one of the most important figures in all of Danish history. Under King Canute VI, Absalon was the chief policymaker in Danish politics. Absalon was buried beside his father in Sorø church. His epitaph reads &quot;a good and brave man&quot;. Less than two years later on 12 November 1202, Canute died suddenly at age 39.

In 1177, Canute married Gertrude (ca.1155–1197), daughter of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony.
She was first married to Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia in 1166 and had become a widow in 1167. During their marriage, Canute and Gertrude had no children. King Canute was succeeded by his younger brother Valdemar II of Denmark (1170–1241) who ruled from 1202 to 1241.

<text>Tooheys is a brewery in the suburb of Lidcombe, in Sydney, Australia. It produces beer under the &quot;Tooheys&quot; and &quot;Hahn Brewery&quot; trademarks, and is part of the Lion beverages group which was acquired by the Japanese Kirin Company in 2009.

==History==

Tooheys dates from 1869, when John Thomas Toohey (an Irish immigrant to Melbourne) obtained his brewing licence. Toohey and his brother James Matthew ran pubs in Melbourne (The Limerick Arms and The Great Britain) before moving to Sydney in the 1860s. They commenced brewing Tooheys Black Old Ale in a brewery in the area of present-day Darling Harbour. By 1875, demand for their beer had soared and they established The Standard Brewery in inner-city Surry Hills. In 1902, the company went public as Tooheys Limited, and commenced brewing lager (the present-day Tooheys New) in 1930. In 1955, the brewery moved west to Lidcombe. In 1967, Tooheys bought competitor Miller&#x27;s Brewers located in Taverner&#x27;s Hill, closing that brewery in 1975.

In March 1980, Tooheys merged with Castlemaine Perkins to form Castlemaine Tooheys. Bond Corporation purchased Castlemaine Tooheys in 1985.

Castlemaine Tooheys were represented as the appellants in the landmark 1990 case of &quot;Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia&quot;, heard by the High Court of Australia. Since the brewery operated outside South Australia, but sold its products there, a South Australian Act Amendment, imposing a substantial refund value for non-refillable bottles produced in other states, was ruled to be inconsistent with section 92 of the Constitution of Australia. Due to the significant discriminatory and protectionist financial impacts that they faced, Castlemaine Tooheys successfully invalidated the law.

Lion Nathan acquired a 50% stake in Bond&#x27;s Natbrew Holdings in 1990, and took total ownership in 1992. Production of Hahn-branded beers was moved from the Camperdown Hahn Brewery to Tooheys, some time between 1993 (Lion&#x27;s acquisition of Hahn) and 1999 (when Hahn Brewery was renamed Malt Shovel Brewery). 

Products sold under the Tooheys trademark are brewed at Tooheys Brewery. Home-brew kits are distributed by Lion and produced at Canterbury Brewery.

==Sponsorships==
Tooheys is a major sponsor of the most popular sport in the state, rugby league. Tooheys New sponsors the New South Wales rugby league team in the annual State of Origin series, the biggest sporting event in the state. The Tooheys New logo appears on the Blues&#x27; sleeves. The team was previously known by the sponsored name of the Tooheys Blues. Tooheys New is also the sponsor of many Country Rugby League competitions across the state as well as being available at almost every rugby league venue in the state.

The Tooheys Challenge Cup was a rugby league competition that ran in the 1990s sponsored by the company. Tooheys remains the principal beer partner of the New South Wales Rugby League team in State of Origin, appearing on the team&#x27;s jersey sleeves and shorts. 

, the Tooheys brand also was the major sponsor of rugby union in New South Wales and Queensland. It was naming rights sponsor of the Bathurst 1000 from 1988 until 1995 and the Melbourne Cup from 2001 until 2003.

<doc id="272734" wikidata="Q935259" url="?curid=272734" title="Paul Tagliabue">
<text>Paul John Tagliabue (; born November 24, 1940) is an American lawyer who was the commissioner of the National Football League (NFL). He took the position in 1989 and served until September 1, 2006. He had previously served as a lawyer for the NFL.

During his commissionership, the NFL added four new franchises, while keeping the Saints in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, while four franchises moved cities. Tagliabue successfully postponed games following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and took a hardline stance against the state of Arizona for failing to recognize a state holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. by moving Super Bowl XXVII to California, and established the World League of American Football in 1989. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its Centennial Class of 2020, and formally enshrined on August 7, 2021.

In addition to his NFL career, Tagliabue also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Georgetown University from 2009 to 2015.

== Early life and education ==
Tagliabue was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, the third of four sons of Charles and May Tagliabue. He is of Italian descent. Raised in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, he attended St. Michael&#x27;s High School in Union City, New Jersey, where he starred in basketball. Tagliabue received an athletic scholarship to play basketball at Georgetown University and was captain of the 1961–62 team. He graduated in 1962 as president of his senior class, a Rhodes Scholar finalist and a Dean&#x27;s List graduate. In a congressional hearing in 1992, Tagliabue later revealed he had inadvertently played in a game where an opposing team would fix the outcome of the game in favor of Georgetown, which would be one factor in mind for him taking a staunch stance against gambling later on in his life. Tagliabue graduated from New York University School of Law in 1965. He has received honorary degrees from Colgate University and Northeastern University.

== Professional career ==
From 1969 to 1989, Tagliabue practiced law with the Washington, D.C. firm Covington &amp; Burling.

== National Football League ==
After serving as a lawyer for the NFL, Tagliabue was selected by NFL owners to succeed Pete Rozelle as Commissioner of the NFL in 1989.

=== Expansion of the league ===
During his tenure as commissioner, the NFL expanded from 28 teams to 32. New franchises were announced in 1993 to begin play in 1995 in Charlotte and Jacksonville. Subsequent moves by other teams resulted in a 31st team being added in Cleveland in 1999; this team, though technically an expansion team, inherited the name, colors and history (including all team and individual records) from the Cleveland Browns, who had relocated to Baltimore in 1996 and been renamed the Baltimore Ravens. The 32nd franchise was the Houston Texans, added in 2002.

=== NFL in Europe ===
The NFL continued to play pre-season games in Europe with the American Bowl series. Paul Tagliabue started a spring developmental league, the World League of American Football (WLAF), with seven teams in North America, plus three in Europe. The European teams dominated in 1991, the first season. After the second season, 1992, in which US-based teams played in the World Bowl, the World League was shut down as it was unsuccessful in the US. In 1995, the spring league returned as the NFL Europe with six teams in Europe. When Tagliabue retired, five teams were based in Germany. Tagliabue&#x27;s successor Roger Goodell shut down the NFL Europe after the 2007 season. but replaced it with the NFL International Series in October 2007 with regular season games in London.
In 2022 the NFL played its first ever Regular Season Game in mainland Europe. The game was played in Munich, Germany on November 13, 2022.

=== Team movements ===
In 1995, Los Angeles lost both its franchises, as the Los Angeles Rams relocated to St. Louis, and the Raiders returned to Oakland. In 1996, the Browns moved to Baltimore, under a new name, as indicated above. In 1997, the Houston Oilers relocated to Tennessee, for one year in Memphis and another year using Vanderbilt Stadium as their home field. (The team changed its name from the Oilers to the Titans upon moving to their permanent stadium in Nashville.)

=== Response to September 11 attacks ===
Two days after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Tagliabue announced that the games scheduled for the upcoming weekend were cancelled, citing the magnitude of the events and security concerns. It was the first time the league canceled an entire week&#x27;s slate of games since the 1987 NFL strike.

A week later, it was announced that the postponed games would be added to the end of the regular season, pushing the Super Bowl into February for the first time.

=== Legacy ===
Tagliabue has been praised for these politically related actions taken as NFL commissioner:
* He took a stand against the State of Arizona for refusing to establish a state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., as other states had done. In 1993, Super Bowl XXVII was to be held for the first time in Arizona, but after an election, Arizona rejected establishment of a Martin Luther King state holiday. Subsequently, Tagliabue moved the Super Bowl to Pasadena; Arizona would finally host Super Bowl XXX in 1996.
* Forcefully and successfully promoting the return of the Saints to New Orleans after the disruption of their 2005 season in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Tagliabue is credited with convincing Saints owner Tom Benson to abandon any effort to move the team to San Antonio and with making the Saints&#x27; return to Louisiana a league priority.

== Post-NFL career ==
Tagliabue returned to Covington &amp; Burling where he serves as senior counsel.

In 2008, Tagliabue was selected to serve a three-year term as chairman of Georgetown University&#x27;s board of directors.

<doc id="272737" wikidata="Q350226" url="?curid=272737" title="Eric IV of Denmark">
<text>Eric IV ( – 10 August 1250), also known as Eric Ploughpenny or Eric Plowpenny (), was King of Denmark from 1241 until his death in 1250. 
His reign was marked by conflict and civil wars against his brothers.

==Early life==
Eric was the son of Valdemar II of Denmark and brother of King Abel of Denmark and King Christopher I of Denmark. He was born ca. 1216 as the second legitimate son of King Valdemar II by his second wife Berengária of Portugal.

In 1218, when his older half-brother Valdemar the Young was crowned king as their father&#x27;s co-ruler and designated heir, he was created Duke of Schleswig. After the premature death of Valdemar in 1231, Eric was crowned king at Lund Cathedral 30 May 1232 as his father&#x27;s co-ruler and heir. Subsequently, he ceded the Duchy of Schleswig to his younger brother Abel. When his father died in 1241, he ascended to the throne.

==Rule==
His rule was marked by bitter conflicts, especially against his brother, Duke Abel of Schleswig who seems to have wanted an independent position and who was supported by the counts of Holstein. Eric also fought the Scanian peasants, who rebelled because of his hard taxes on ploughs, among other things. The number of ploughs a man owned was used as a measure of his wealth. This gave the king the epithet &quot;plough-penny&quot; (Danish: &quot;Plovpenning&quot;).

Eric had only been king for about a year when he first came into conflict with his brother, Duke Abel of Schleswig, in 1242. The conflict lasted for three years before the brothers agreed on a truce in 1244 and made plans for a joint crusade to Estonia.
At the same time Eric faced trouble from the religious orders who insisted that they were immune from taxes that Eric might assess. Eric wanted the church lands taxed as any other land holder would be. The Pope sent a nuncio to negotiate between the king and the bishops at Odense in 1245. Excommunication was threatened for anyone, great or small who trespassed upon the ancient rights and privileges of the church. It was a clear warning to Eric that the church would not tolerate his continued insistence at assessing church property for tax purposes.

Infuriated, in 1249 King Eric directed his rage at Niels Stigsen, Bishop of the Diocese of Roskilde who fled Denmark the same year. Eric confiscated the bishopric&#x27;s properties in Zealand, including the emerging city of Copenhagen. In spite of intervention from Pope Innocent IV who advocated the reinstatement of the bishop and the return of the properties to the diocese, the dispute could not be resolved. Niels Stigsen died in 1249 at Clairvaux Abbey. The properties were not restored to the diocese until after the death of King Eric in 1250.

The conflict between King Eric and his brothers had broken out again in 1246. The conflict started when Eric invaded Holstein in an attempt to restore his father&#x27;s control of the county. Duke Abel of Schleswig, married to a daughter of Adolf IV, Count of Holstein and former guardian of his brothers-in-law, the two young counts of Holstein John I and Gerhard I, forced King Eric to abandon his conquest. The following year, Abel and the Holsteiners stormed into Jutland and Funen, burning and pillaging as far north as Randers and Odense. Abel was supported by the Hanseatic League city of Lübeck, as well as by his brothers Christopher, Lord of Lolland and Falster and Canute, Duke of Blekinge.

King Eric retaliated immediately, reconquering the city of Ribe and occupying Abel&#x27;s patrimonial city of Svendborg the same year. In 1247, he captured Arreskov Castle (&quot;Arreskov Slot&quot;) on Funen, as well as taking Christopher and Canute prisoners.
A truce was arranged by Eric&#x27;s sister Sophie of Denmark (ca 1217–1247) who was the wife of Johann I, Margrave of Brandenburg (c. 1213–1266). The terms of the accord left Eric in firm control of all of Denmark.
In 1249 the peasants in Scania rose in rebellion against the plough tax. The king restored order with help from Zealand, but the church, Duke Abel, and the German counts in southern Jutland were pushed into an erstwhile alliance against the king.

==Regicide==
Erik raised an army and sailed to Estonia to secure his base there in 1249. On his way home in 1250 he took his army to Holstein to prevent the capture of the border fortress of Rendsburg and to teach the German counts who was still king. His brother, Duke Abel of Schleswig offered him hospitality at his house at Gottorp in Schleswig. That evening as the king gambled with one of the German knights, the duke&#x27;s chamberlain and a group of other men rushed in and took the king prisoner. They bound him and dragged him out of the duke&#x27;s house and down to a boat and rowed out into the Schlien. They were followed out onto the water by a second boat. When King Erik heard the voice of his sworn enemy, Lave Gudmundsen (ca. 1195–1252), he realized he was to be killed. One of the captors was paid to deliver the king&#x27;s death blow with an ax. Erik was beheaded and his body dumped into the Schlien. The next morning two fishermen dragged the king&#x27;s headless body up in their net. They carried the body to the Dominican Abbey in Schleswig; his body was later transferred to St. Bendt&#x27;s Church, Ringsted in 1257.

Eric&#x27;s brother Abel was sworn in as the successor king. Abel contended he had nothing to do with the murder. Within a year and a half, Abel himself was killed. He was succeeded as king of Denmark by his younger brother Christopher.

==Marriage and issue==
Eric was married on 17 November 1239 with Jutta of Saxony daughter of Albert I, Duke of Saxony (c. 1175–1260). They were the parents of:

*Canute, died young.
*Christopher, died young.
*Sophia (1241–1286), married to King Valdemar of Sweden. Their descendants included Christian I of Denmark.
*Ingeborg (1244–1287), married to King Magnus VI of Norway.
*Jutta (1246–1284), Abbess of St. Agnes&#x27; Priory, Roskilde.
*Agnes (1249–1288/95), Abbess of St. Agnes&#x27; Priory, Roskilde; reputedly married to Eric Longbone, Lord of Langeland.

<doc id="272749" wikidata="Q359588" url="?curid=272749" title="Eric V of Denmark">
<text>Eric V Klipping (1249 – 22 November 1286) was King of Denmark from 1259 to 1286. After his father Christopher I died, his mother Margaret Sambiria ruled Denmark in his name until 1266, proving to be a competent regent. Between 1261 and 1262, the young King Eric was a prisoner in Holstein following a military defeat. Afterwards, he lived in Brandenburg, where he was initially held captive by John I, Margrave of Brandenburg (c. 1213–1266). During his reign, he enforced his power successfully over the church but failed to do so on the nobility, he offended the nobles and was thereby forced to accept a charter (&quot;Håndfæstning&quot;) which limited his authority while confirming the rights of the nobles.

==Nickname==
The king&#x27;s nickname &quot;Klipping&quot; or &quot;Glipping&quot; refers to a medieval coin that has become &quot;clipped&quot; (a &quot;clipped penny&quot;) or cut in order to indicate devaluation. The nickname is an unkind reference to his lack of trustworthiness. He &quot;short-changed&quot; his people and the monarchy.

== Regency ==

When his father King Christopher I died in 1259, Eric was too young to rule in his own right. The Danish court appointed his mother, Queen Margaret, to rule as regent. She was the daughter of Duke Sambor II of Pomerania and Matilda of Mecklenburg, and was an intelligent woman. Immediately, she had to fight to keep her son on the throne from two powerful enemies; Archbishop Jacob Erlandsen (ca. 1220–1274) and Erik Abelsøn who was Duke of Schleswig from 1260 until his death in 1272. Archbishop Jacob had excommunicated the bishop who had anointed young Eric as king. Duke Eric was a nephew of King Christopher and had been in frequent conflict with the king.

Taking advantage of the situation, Chief Jaromar II of Rügen (c. 1218–1260) gathered an army of Wends and invaded Zealand. Queen Margaret raised an army, but was soundly defeated in 1259 near Ringsted. Jaromar went on to attack and pillage Copenhagen later that year. He shipped his army to Skåne in order to continue his campaign. Unfortunately for him, he encountered the wrath of a farmer&#x27;s wife, who killed him outright. The Wends fled back to Rűgen.

Believing the Wendish incursion showed the queen was weak, Duke Eric rebelled. The queen was forced to raise another army and march to Jutland to put the Duke in his place. She defeated the duke, and while he negotiated a truce with her, he gathered allies in northern Germany to help him attack. The combined forces defeated Queen Margaret in 1261 at the Battle of Lohede south of Danevirke in Schleswig-Holstein. She and her son were captured and were forced to cede royal properties in southern Jutland to secure their release.

In 1260, Queen Margaret had released Archbishop Jacob from prison thinking he would be grateful, but he subsequently issued an interdict over all of Denmark trying to force her and Eric off the throne. In 1263, acting as regent of Denmark, the queen wrote to Pope Urban IV asking him to intervene with Archbishop Jacob. After several years of quibbling, the pope agreed to several items that the queen wanted. He issued a dispensation to alter the terms of the Danish succession that would permit women to inherit the Danish throne. This would make it possible for one of King Eric&#x27;s sisters to become queen in the event of his death, because he had no children. Although Pope Urban IV gave his consent, it never became an issue. King Eric&#x27;s son Eric Menved eventually succeeded to the Danish throne.

==Reign==
As an adult ruler, King Eric V tried to enforce his power over the church and nobility. In the 1270s, the King attacked Småland. His conflict with the church was brought to a satisfying result, with the help of the Pope. By 1282, he had so offended the nobles throughout Denmark that he was forced to accept a charter (Danish: &quot;håndfæstning&quot; – a kind of a Danish Magna Carta) which limited his authority and guaranteed the ancient rights and customs that preserved the power of the nobles. The King signed the charter at Nyborg Castle, recognized as Denmark&#x27;s first-ever constitution in existence. However at the time of King Eric&#x27;s death, the rights and guarantees of the 1282 charter would lose their effectiveness, since the next king would not be bound by the same agreement.

==Mysterious death==

Legend has it that several nobles swore an oath that they would murder Eric in revenge for personal slights or policies the king enforced that they did not like. Chief among the conspirators was marshal (Danish: &quot;marsk&quot;) Stig Andersen Hvide and Jacob Nielsen, Count of Halland. They paid Rane Jonsen (1254–1294) one of the king&#x27;s companions, to keep them informed as to the king&#x27;s activities, in order to fulfill their oath.

November 1286 found the king at Viborg, in central Jutland. After a long day&#x27;s hunt in the countryside led by Rane Jonsen, the king and a few attendants could not find their way back to the king&#x27;s farm at Viborg. Rane suggested that they take shelter for the night of 22 November 1286 in the church barn in the village of Finderup (&quot;Finderup Lade&quot;). The assassins, dressed as Franciscan friars, were kept informed as to the king’s whereabouts and waited for everyone to settle down for the night. Once the king fell asleep, they rushed from their hiding places and stabbed and hacked the king to death.

Tradition has it that he received 56 stab wounds. The folktale that grew up around this event has Stig Andersen personally striking the first blows in revenge for King Eric&#x27;s seduction of Stig&#x27;s wife, while Stig himself was off serving with the king&#x27;s army. Eric&#x27;s bloody corpse was discovered the next morning.

The court immediately blamed the nation&#x27;s most powerful noblemen Stig Andersen Hvide and Count Jacob of Halland and outlawed them and seven others. Only one was accused of killing the king, the others were accused of involvement. Whether they actually had anything to do with the murder remains a mystery. Stig Hvide fled the country to take up piracy. Certainly, Stig Hvide was not the only person who had a reason to want to see King Eric eliminated. Valdemar IV, who King Eric was forced to accept as Duke of Schleswig in 1283, as well as many of Archbishop Jakob Erlandsen&#x27;s appointments to bishoprics, remained bitter enemies of the king until his death. These banished nobles had also raided the Danish countryside for 20 years with the support of Haakon V of Norway.

==Issue==
King Eric V married Agnes of Brandenburg (c. 1257–1304) on 11 November 1273 at Schleswig. She was the daughter of John I, Margrave of Brandenburg (d. 1266) and Brigitte of Saxony. The marriage was probably agreed upon during King Eric&#x27;s captivity in Brandenburg by Agnes&#x27; father from 1262 to 1264. Tradition claims that the King was released from captivity on his promise to marry Agnes without a dowry.

They had the following issue: 
*Richeza (c. 1272 – 27 October 1308), married Lord Nicholas II of Werle
*Eric VI (1274–1319)
*Christopher II (1276–1332)
*Martha (1278–1341), married King Birger of Sweden
*Katharine (c. 1281 – 1283), died young
*Valdemar
*Elisabeth

<doc id="272755" wikidata="Q1770312" url="?curid=272755" title="Tom O'Higgins">
<text>Thomas Francis O&#x27;Higgins (23 July 1916 – 25 February 2003) was an Irish Fine Gael politician, barrister and judge who served as Chief Justice of Ireland and a Judge of the Supreme Court from 1974 to 1985, a Judge of the European Court of Justice from 1985 to 1991, a Judge of the High Court from 1973 to 1974, Deputy leader of Fine Gael from 1972 to 1977 and Minister for Health from 1954 to 1957. He also served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1948 to 1969.

Part of a new generation of Fine Gael leaders who emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, O&#x27;Higgins worked alongside Declan Costello and Garret FitzGerald to liberalise the conservative Fine Gael. In the late 1960s, and early 1970s, O&#x27;Higgins twice contested the presidency of Ireland for his party; in his first attempt in 1966, he lost by 1% of the vote against incumbent President Éamon de Valera. In the aftermath, his image was greatly enhanced and he was catapulted into the position of deputy leader of Fine Gael. Despite being the initial favourite to win, O&#x27;Higgins lost the 1973 Irish presidential election to Erskine H. Childers.

In 1973, O&#x27;Higgins became a High Court judge and the following year was named Chief Justice of Ireland and a Supreme Court judge. Although a liberal politician, O&#x27;Higgins was considered by many a conservative judge, given his rulings on matters such as contraceptives and homosexuality. In 1985, O&#x27;Higgins became a member of the European Court of Justice following his nomination by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald and his government. He served on the court in Luxembourg until his retirement in 1991.

==Early life and education==

O&#x27;Higgins was born in Cork in 1916, and came from an influential Irish political family: his father was Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins and his uncle was Kevin O&#x27;Higgins. Both had been ministers during their political careers and were highly influential on the Cumann na nGaedheal political party which governed Ireland immediately upon independence from the United Kingdom. In 1923, Dr Thomas Higgins (Tom&#x27;s grandfather) was killed by members of the Anti-Treaty IRA during a raid and in 1927, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins was assassinated by Irish republicans in a revenge killing; Kevin O&#x27;Higgins had been the Minister for Justice during the Irish Civil War who signed the death warrants of 77 members of the IRA. As a result of these murders, TF O&#x27;Higgins (Tom&#x27;s father) was radicalised and would become a member of the Blueshirts, a radical right-wing paramilitary explicitly opposed to the IRA which eventually merged into Fine Gael, the political successor of Cumann na nGaedheal.
Despite this background, O&#x27;Higgins never embraced bitterness or anti-republicanism, and instead espoused a forward-looking politics which sought to advance Irish politics beyond the wounds of the Irish Civil War. Nonetheless, he would always defend his father&#x27;s membership of the Blueshirts as a requirement for upholding free speech and democracy in Ireland.

O&#x27;Higgins was educated at St Mary&#x27;s College, Dublin, Clongowes Wood College and University College Dublin, where he became auditor of the Literary and Historical Society. He later attended King&#x27;s Inns. In 1938, he qualified as a barrister and was called to the Bar. In 1954, he was called to the Inner Bar.

==Political career==
O&#x27;Higgins&#x27;s political career began during the 1943 Irish general election when he unsuccessfully stood on behalf of Fine Gael in the Dublin City South constituency. O&#x27;Higgins did not stand in the snap general election of 1944, instead choosing to campaign on behalf of his father. However, at this time he founded the &quot;Central Branch&quot; of Fine Gael which gathered younger members of the party together. Additionally, O&#x27;Higgins also began to write for the policy review magazine &quot;The Forum&quot;.

O&#x27;Higgins first&#x27;s successful campaign saw him securing the Leix–Offaly constituency at the 1948 general election, an area once previously represented by his father. On the same day his brother, Michael O&#x27;Higgins, was also elected a TD.

In 1950, O&#x27;Higgins was one of eight members of the Oireachtas chosen to represent Ireland on the Council of Europe; it was the start of a lifetime interest in European politics.

===Minister for Health===
In the Second Inter-Party Government (1954–57), O&#x27;Higgins was appointed Minister for Health. He inherited a department mired by the aftermath of the failed Mother and Child Scheme and was now tasked with implementing the 1953 Health Act, which had been introduced by Fianna Fáil. Doing so required O&#x27;Higgins to carefully manage both the Irish Medical Association and Fine Gael&#x27;s coalition partners the Labour Party. 

During his period as Minister for Health, he introduced the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (VHI), which brought state-controlled health insurance to Ireland.

===Ideological reformer===
In 1956, O&#x27;Higgins began to advocate internally in Fine Gael that the party needed to move away from the fiscal conservatism of the minister for finance, Gerard Sweetman, and managed to secure significant initial support. However, his plans were scuppered by the Suez crisis which began in October 1956 and caused economic slumps around the world. His manoeuvring was further damaged when Clann na Poblachta left the government coalition.

Nonetheless, in the years afterwards, O&#x27;Higgins began closely working with fellow second-generation Fine Gael members Garret FitzGerald and Declan Costello to shift Fine Gael ideologically leftwards. 
The culmination of this was Costello producing a document entitled &quot;Towards a Just Society&quot; which advocated that Fine Gael adopt social democratic policies. Fine Gael adopted the document as the basis for their election manifesto for the 1965 Irish general election. O&#x27;Higgins supported this move; additionally, O&#x27;Higgins attempted to win over fellow party members to this move. He also attempted to build bridges with members of the Labour Party.

When Liam Cosgrave succeeded James Dillon as leader of Fine Gael in April 1965, O&#x27;Higgins was promoted to party spokesman on finance and economic affairs, replacing the conservative Sweetman. Although the left-wing of the party was not in control of the party, O&#x27;Higgins move up the ranks represented that their influence was growing.

===Presidential candidate===
====1966 presidential election====

In 1966, Ireland was due to hold a presidential election. The election was due to be one of significance, as 1966 marked the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising of 1916. The incumbent, an ageing Éamon de Valera, himself a veteran of the Easter Rising, was initially widely expected to either win easily or, more probably, stand unopposed. O&#x27;Higgins, however, was not content with this and attempted to rally Fine Gael to support the Irish republican Seán MacBride in a presidential bid. Predictably, this idea did not gain much traction, particularly with the more conservative elements of Fine Gael. However, O&#x27;Higgins did not give up on the idea that de Valera should be challenged. His next venture was to petition former Taoiseach and Fine Gael stalwart John A. Costello to stand in the election. O&#x27;Higgins, however, was not able to convince Costello, who was now nearing the end of his political career, to run.

Having campaigned so hard on the idea that someone must challenge de Valera, eventually party members turned the question back on O&#x27;Higgins and suggested he run. He eventually agreed.

O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; campaign was met with immediate difficulty when, at the outset, de Valera declared that he would not conduct a campaign himself, believing that the office of President should be above party politics. In response, RTÉ decided it could not (or would not), cover O&#x27;Higgins campaigning as this would be unbalanced in their view. Fine Gael leader Liam Cosgrove responded by arguing that this was unjust, as although de Valera was not formally campaigning, he regularly appeared on RTÉ radio and television in his capacity as president. RTÉ, however, did not change its position.

O&#x27;Higgins carried out a grassroots campaign that saw him attend over 130 public meetings across the Republic of Ireland, covering an estimated 22,000 miles around the country over 5 weeks, reportedly attending as many as 3 rallies a night. O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; campaign manager was his erstwhile political rival Gerald Sweetman, who despite their differences, helped O&#x27;Higgins construct a modern strategy. Fine Gael presented O&#x27;Higgins and his wife Terry as Irish analogues of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his wife Jackie Kennedy, emphasising their comparative youth to the elderly de Valera. Campaign ads for O&#x27;Higgins prominently featured images of O&#x27;Higgins surrounded by Terry and their 7 children in shots designed to evoke the spirit of Camelot that had earned the Kennedys much popularity earlier in the decade. The general thrust of the O&#x27;Higgins campaign was that O&#x27;Higgins represented the future in contrast to the nostalgia of de Valera. Sweetman described the O&#x27;Higgins campaign as expressing &quot;the need for a youthful, forward looking president to personify the real Ireland and what it can best contribute to modern civilisation&quot;.

An example of the O&#x27;Higgins attempting to emulate modern American politics could be seen on 28 May 1966, when a small light aircraft dropped ballons with Fine Gael slogans on them down onto the city of Limerick during an O&#x27;Higgins motorcade procession. Observing these new tactics, the journalist John Healy of the Irish Times observed &quot;The Fine Gael tail is up. It is running as it has not run for a long time. It will be an interesting finish indeed&quot;.

Polling was not yet a feature of Irish politics in 1966; instead parties still generally relied on their constituency branches to provide a sense of grassroots sentiment. When Fianna Fáil received feedback from their branches about the O&#x27;Higgins campaign, they became highly concerned. Although de Valera remained officially committed to not campaigning, he began to make several public appearances on the pretence of commemorating 1916. De Valera&#x27;s campaign manager was then Minister for Agriculture and future leader of Fianna Fáil Charles Haughey. Responding to the momentum of the O&#x27;Higgins campaign, Haughey announced £5.5 million in spending targeted at farmers just five days before voting began.

The results of the election were agonisingly close; by a margin of just 10,718 votes (1% of the total vote), de Valera managed to etch out a victory. Years later, O&#x27;Higgins would remark in his autobiography that he felt he had conducted himself well in the race and was glad he was able to maintain his dignity and that of his family. Paraphrasing the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s remarks about the battle of Waterloo, O&#x27;Higgins described the race as &quot;a close run thing&quot;. , the result of the 1966 contest remains the tightest margin of any Irish presidential election.

====Deputy leader of Fine Gael====
Although not victorious in the 1966 election, O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; image had been greatly enhanced by the contest; at the 1969 Irish general election O&#x27;Higgins moved from the Laois-Offaly constituency to the newly created Dublin County South, where he topped the poll. In April 1972, O&#x27;Higgins was named the first-ever deputy leader of Fine Gael. In this role, O&#x27;Higgins was looked at by some in Fine Gael as an intermediary between the liberal and conservative wings of the party. As deputy leader, O&#x27;Higgins made several trips to Northern Ireland in the face of the emerging Troubles and was one of the Fine Gael representatives at the funerals of those killed on Bloody Sunday in 1972.

Anticipating running for president again in May 1973, O&#x27;Higgins did not contest the earlier 1973 Irish general election that February. In the aftermath of the general election, his diplomatic skills were once again called upon, as he looked to as a broker between Fine Gael and the Labour Party as they attempted to form a governing coalition, which was ultimately successful.

====1973 presidential election====

In 1973, O&#x27;Higgins was again chosen once again as the Fine Gael candidate in the presidential election. This time he faced former Fianna Fáil Tánaiste and Minister, Erskine H. Childers. Childers was elected by 52% to 48%.

==Judicial career==

Shortly afterwards O&#x27;Higgins was appointed a Judge of the High Court. In 1974, after the sudden death of Chief Justice William FitzGerald, O&#x27;Higgins, although the most junior High Court judge, was chosen to replace him as Chief Justice of Ireland in the Supreme Court and a judge of the Supreme Court.

After the sudden death of Erskine H. Childers, O&#x27;Higgins, in his role as Chief Justice swore in Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh as President of Ireland. He was Chief Justice until 1985 when he was appointed a Judge of the European Court of Justice. He remained there until 1991.

O&#x27;Higgins died on 25 February 2003, at the age of 86.

<doc id="272770" wikidata="Q2607648" url="?curid=272770" title="Hot reading">
<text>Hot reading is a technique used when giving a psychic reading in stage magic performances, or in other contexts. In hot reading, the reader uses information about the person receiving the reading (for example, from background research or overhearing a conversation) which the receiver is not aware that the reader already knows. Hot reading is commonly used in conjunction with cold reading (where no previously gathered information is used) and can explain how a psychic reader can get a specific claimed &quot;hit&quot; of accurate information. The psychics may have clients schedule their appearance ahead of time, and then collect information using collaborators who pose as religious missionaries, magazine sales people, or similar roles. Such visitors can gain a wide understanding of a person from examining their home, where tickets for the show may have been sent in advance. The &quot;psychic&quot; may then be briefed on the information, and told where the person will sit in the audience.

==History==

There are many methods that involve hot reading. In 1938, the magician John Mulholland wrote:

Where do the mediums get the information? It is very easy. Look the person up in a telephone book. Talk to the corner grocer. Go to the house and try to sell a magazine subscription. Talk to the neighbours. Talk to the servants if there are any. If it is a small city go to the cemetery and look at the tombstones. It has to be done carefully but it is very easy.

Commenting on mediums from the early 20th century, historian Ruth Brandon noted:

There were a number of recognized methods in use. Some were very down-to-earth. When a medium visited a new town, he was advised to visit the local cemetery and make a note of names, dates, and any other information to be obtained from the tombstones. He might also consult the &quot;Blue Book&quot; for the area, a compilation circulated among mediums listing, for an increasing number of places, the names of leading spiritualists likely to attend seances, with descriptions, family histories, and details (deceased spouses, children, parents, etc.) and other information likely to be of use.

Skeptical activist Susan Gerbic lists hot reading as one of a number of methods used by psychics to achieve their effects. She points out it can be done with nothing more than a name, location, and access to Facebook.

Notable mediums from the past who were exposed as utilizing hot reading methods have included Rosina Thompson and George Valiantine.

==Modern examples of hot reading==
Televangelist Peter Popoff&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, was seen canvassing the crowd before a show, and it was later noticed that Popoff was wearing a hearing aid. In 1986, James Randi and his associate Steve Shaw, an illusionist known professionally as Banachek, organized Project Beta with technical assistance from the crime scene analyst and electronics expert Alexander Jason. Using computerized radio scanners, Jason was able to demonstrate that Popoff&#x27;s wife was using a wireless radio transmitter to broadcast information that she and her aides had culled from prayer request cards filled out by audience members. Popoff received the transmissions via an in-ear receiver and repeated the information to astonished audience members. Jason produced video segments interspersing the intercepted radio transmissions with Popoff&#x27;s &quot;miraculous&quot; pronouncements.

Independent Investigation Group IIG director James Underdown writes that in one of the live shows of &quot;Beyond&quot; they witnessed, James Van Praagh was observed signing books and chatting with a woman he learned was from Italy. During the taping he asked that same section if there was &quot;someone from another country&quot;. To the TV audience this would have looked impressive when she raised her hand, however he had used the hot reading technique of gaining foreknowledge.

A 2001 &quot;Time&quot; article reported that psychic John Edward allegedly used hot reading on his television show, &quot;Crossing Over&quot;, where an audience member who received a reading was suspicious of prior behaviour from Edward&#x27;s aides, who had struck up conversations with audience members and asked them to fill out cards detailing their family trees. In December 2001, Edward was alleged to have used foreknowledge to hot read in an interview on the television show &quot;Dateline&quot;, where a reading for a cameraman was based on knowledge gained in conversation some hours previously, yet presented as if he were unaware of the cameraman&#x27;s background. In his 2001 book, John Edward denied ever using foreknowledge, cold or hot reading.

In March 2017, alleged psychic Thomas John Flanagan was found to have used information posted on social media by people coming to his shows, in order to accurately guess details about their lives while pretending to be communicating with the dead. He unknowingly used backstories from fake Facebook profiles previously prepared by a group of skeptics led by Susan Gerbic and Mark Edward. When Flanagan used that information while pretending to hear Gerbic&#x27;s and Edward&#x27;s dead relatives, the only possible way he could be aware of these details is if he or members of his team read the fake profiles while preparing for their performance, since even Gerbic and Edward themselves were not aware of the specific information placed on the profiles that matched the aliases they were using when attending the show. In 2021 Flanagan held an online meeting for children aged 5-12. Two of the supposed children had fake identities and one was much older than claimed (which Flanagan failed to detect). In his readings Flanagan gave information he had previously been given in e-mails. Flanagan also used actors on his television show &quot;Seatbelt Psychic&quot;, whose lives were well documented and easily discoverable on social media.

John Oliver speculated in a February 2019 segment of &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; that Tyler Henry may use hot reading in addition to cold reading. As an example, Oliver dissected Henry&#x27;s reading of Matt Lauer concerning the father-son fishing trip that was part of the reading. Oliver showed examples of publicly available information about Lauer&#x27;s love of fishing with his father, including Lauer stating this on his own show several times. Oliver summarized &quot;Look, maybe Tyler Henry genuinely accessed the afterlife, an action which would fundamentally change our understanding of everything on Earth. Or maybe he just googled &#x27;Matt Lauer Dad&#x27; and hit the fucking jackpot.&quot;

<text>A shipwreck is the wreckage of a ship that is located either beached on land or sunken to the bottom of a body of water. Shipwrecking may be intentional or unintentional. There were approximately three million shipwrecks worldwide as of January 1999, according to Angela Croome, a science writer and author who specialized in the history of underwater archaeology (an estimate rapidly endorsed by UNESCO and other organizations).

When a ship&#x27;s crew has died or abandoned the ship, and the ship has remained adrift but unsunk, they are instead referred to as ghost ships.

== Types ==
Historic wrecks are attractive to maritime archaeologists because they preserve historical information: for example, studying the wreck of revealed information about seafaring, warfare, and life in the 16th century. Military wrecks, caused by a skirmish at sea, are studied to find details about the historic event; they reveal much about the battle that occurred. Discoveries of treasure ships, often from the period of European colonisation, which sank in remote locations leaving few living witnesses, such as , do occur as well. 
Some contemporary wrecks, such as the oil tanker &quot;Prestige&quot; or , are of interest primarily because of their potential harm to the environment. Other contemporary wrecks are scuttled in order to spur reef growth, such as and &quot;Ocean Freeze&quot;. Many contemporary and historic wrecks, such as , are of interest to recreational divers that dive to shipwrecks because they are interesting to explore, provide large habitats for many types of marine life, and have an interesting history.

Well-known shipwrecks include the catastrophic &quot;Titanic&quot;, MV Doña Paz, , , , , , or . There are also thousands of wrecks that were not lost at sea but have been abandoned or sunk. These abandoned, or derelict ships are typically smaller craft, such as fishing vessels. They may pose a hazard to navigation and may be removed by port authorities.

== Causes ==
Poor design, improperly stowed cargo, navigation and other human errors leading to collisions (with another ship, the shoreline, an iceberg, etc.), inadequate maintenance, bad weather, fire, and other causes can lead to accidental sinking. Intentional reasons for sinking a ship include: intending to form an artificial reef; destruction due to warfare, piracy, mutiny or sabotage; using the vessel for target practice; or removing a menace to navigation. A ship can be also used as breakwater structure.

== State of preservation ==
Many factors determine the state of preservation of a wreck:
* the ship&#x27;s construction materials
* the wreck becoming covered in sand or silt
* the salinity of the water the wreck is in
* the level of destruction involved in the ship&#x27;s loss
* whether the components or cargo of the wreck were salvaged
* whether the wreck was demolished to clear a navigable channel
* the depth of water at the wreck site
* the strength of tidal currents or wave action at the wreck site
* the exposure to surface weather conditions at the wreck site
* the presence of marine life that consume the ship&#x27;s fabric
* temperature
* the acidity (or pH), and other chemical characteristics of the water at the site

The above - especially the stratification (silt/sand sediments piled up on the shipwrecks) and the damages caused by marine creatures - is better described as &quot;stratification and contamination&quot; of shipwrecks. The stratification not only creates another challenge for marine archaeology, but also a challenge to determine its primary state, i.e. the state that it was in when it sank.

Stratification includes several different types of sand and silt, as well as tumulus and encrustations. These &quot;sediments&quot; are tightly linked to the type of currents, depth, and the type of water (salinity, pH, etc.), which implies any chemical reactions that would affect potential cargo (such as wine, olive oil, spices, etc.).

Besides this geological phenomenon, wrecks also face the damage of marine creatures that create a home out of them, primarily octopuses and crustaceans. These creatures affect the primary state because they move, or break, any parts of the shipwreck that are in their way, thereby affecting the original condition of amphorae, for example, or any other hollow places. Finally, in addition to the slight or severe destruction marine animals can create, there are also &quot;external&quot; contaminants, such as the artifacts on and around the wreck at Pickles Reef and the over-lapping wrecks at the Molasses Reef Wreck, or contemporary pollution in bodies of water, that severely affect shipwrecks by changing the chemical structures, or further damaging what is left of a specific ship.

Despite these challenges, if the information retrieved does not appear to be sufficient, or a poor preservation is achieved, authors like J.A. Parker claim that it is the historical value of the shipwreck that counts as well as any slight piece of information or evidence that is acquired.

=== Construction materials ===

Exposed wooden components decay quickly. Often the only wooden parts of ships that remain after a century are those that were buried in silt or sand soon after the sinking. An example of this is &quot;Mary Rose&quot;.

Steel and iron, depending on their thickness, may retain the ship&#x27;s structure for decades. As corrosion takes place, sometimes helped by tides and weather, the structure collapses. Thick ferrous objects such as cannons, steam boilers or the pressure vessel of a submarine often survive well underwater in spite of corrosion.

Propellers, condensers, hinges and port holes were often made from non-ferrous metals such as brass and phosphor bronze, which do not corrode easily.

=== Salinity of water ===

====Freshwater and low saline====
Shipwrecks in some freshwater lakes, such as the Great Lakes of North America, have remained intact with little degradation. In some sea areas, most notably in Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland, salinity is very low, and centuries-old wrecks have been preserved in reasonable condition. However, bacteria found in fresh water cause the wood on ships to rot more quickly than in seawater unless it is deprived of oxygen. Two shipwrecks, and , have been at the bottom of Lake Ontario since they sunk during a violent storm on August 8, 1813, during the War of 1812. They are in &quot;remarkably good&quot; condition.

====Seawater====
Wrecks typically decay rapidly when in seawater. There are several reasons for this:
* Iron-based metals corrode much more quickly in seawater because of the dissolved salt present; the sodium and chloride ions chemically accelerate the process of metal oxidation which, in the case of ferrous metals, leads to rust. Such cases are prominent on deep-water shipwrecks, such as RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; (sank 1912), (sank 1915), and (sank 1941). However, there are some exceptions; &quot;RMS Empress of Ireland&quot; (sank 1914) lies in the saltwater portion of the St. Lawrence River, but is still in remarkably good condition.
* Unprotected wood in seawater is rapidly consumed by shipworms and small wood-boring sea creatures. Shipworms found in higher salinity waters, such as the Caribbean, are notorious for boring into wooden structures that are immersed in sea water and can completely destroy the hull of a wooden shipwreck.

=== Loss, salvage, and demolition ===

An important factor in the condition of the wreck is the level of destruction at the time of the loss or shortly afterwards due to the nature of the loss, salvage or later demolition.

Examples of severe destruction at the time of loss are:
* Being blown onto a beach, reef, or rocks during a storm, termed &quot;grounding&quot; (e.g., )
* Collision with another ship (e.g., )
* Catastrophic explosion (e.g., ), steamship boilers often explode when water covers them during the process of sinking
* Fire that burns for a long time before the ship sinks (e.g., )
* Foundering, i.e., taking in so much water that buoyancy is lost and the ship sinks (e.g., RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; and HMHS &quot;Britannic&quot;); some ships with a dense cargo (e.g., iron ore) may break up when sinking quickly and hitting a rocky seabed
* Enemy action from aerial bombs or torpedoes that may cause destruction before sinking (e.g., the and )

After the loss, the vessel&#x27;s owners may attempt to salvage valuable parts of the ship and its cargo. This operation can cause further damage.

Shipwrecks in shallow water near busy shipping lanes are often demolished or removed to reduce the danger to other vessels. On charts, some wreck symbols have a line under the symbol with a depth mark, which indicates the water depth above the wreck.

=== Depth, tide and weather ===
On the seabed, wrecks are slowly broken up by the forces of wave action caused by the weather and currents caused by tides. Also, more highly oxygenated water, which promotes corrosion, reduces the strength of ferrous structural materials of the ship. Deeper wrecks are likely to be protected by less exposure to water movement and by lower levels of oxygen in water.

=== Temperature ===
Extreme cold (such as in a glacial-fed lake, Arctic waters, the Great Lakes, etc.) slows the degradation of organic ship materials. Decay, corrosion and marine encrustation are inhibited or largely absent in cold waters.

==Marine pollution==
Many modern shipwrecks contribute to marine pollution, mainly as sources of significant oil spills. A 2005 survey of shipwrecks since 1890 found that over 8,500 of the submerged wrecks may still contain oil. Oil spills can have devastating effects on marine and coastal environments as well as fisheries. In addition to being toxic to marine life, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), found in crude oil, are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment.

Shipwreck pollution may also originate with a ship&#x27;s cargo or munitions, such as unexploded ordnance or chemical weapons canisters. German trawler V 1302 &quot;John Mahn&quot;, sunk in the North Sea in 1942, has multiple unexploded depth charges on board which render the wreck hazardous. Samples taken from the wreck and nearby sediment show the presence of heavy metals like nickel and copper, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic and explosive compounds into surrounding waters, which have changed the local microbial ecology.

==Natural deterioration process==

Iron and steel wrecks are subject to corrosion, which is most rapid in shallow sea water where the salinity induces galvanic corrosion, oxygen content is high and water movement replenishes the oxygen rapidly. In deeper water and in still water the corrosion rates can be greatly reduced. Corrosion rates of iron and steel are also reduced when concretions, solid layers of rust, or layers of marine organisms separate the metal from the ambient water, and encourage the development of a layer of relatively stable black oxide in the hypoxic layers.

Ships that sink upright onto a sand bottom tend to settle into the sand to a similar level to that at which they would normally float at the surface. The thinner materials of the upper works tend to break up first, followed by the decks and deck beams, and the hull sides unsupported by bulkheads. The bow and stern may remain relatively intact for longer as they are usually more heavily constructed. Heavy machinery like boilers, engines, pumps, winches, propellers, propeller shafts, steering gear, anchors and other heavy fittings also last longer and can provide support to the remaining hull, or cause it to collapse more rapidly. Vessels that come to rest upside down on a yielding seabed can be relatively stable, although the upper decks usually collapse under the load and machinery and fittings fall. Wrecks that rest on their side tend to deteriorate quickly, as the loads are not what they were designed to support, and poorly supported hull sides give way fairly soon and the wreckage collapses. Wrecks supported by a rocky seabed tend to collapse over and around the rocks relatively rapidly. Submarines tend to last longer as they are built much more strongly to withstand the working loads of external pressure, and may last for centuries.

==Value==
A shipwreck may have value in several forms:
*Cultural heritage,
*Recreational diving and other tourism attraction
*scientific, educational and monetary values 
**Artificial reefs
**Monetary value of salvageable cargo and components
== Salvage ==

Often, attempts are made to salvage shipwrecks, particularly those recently wrecked, to recover the whole or part of the ship, its cargo, or its equipment. An example was the salvage of the scuttled German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow in the 1920s and 1930s. The unauthorized salvage of wrecks is called wrecking.

=== Legal aspects ===

Shipwreck law determines important legal questions regarding wrecks, perhaps the most important question being the question of ownership. Legally wrecks are divided into &quot;wreccum maris&quot; (material washed ashore after a shipwreck) and &quot;adventurae maris&quot; (material still at sea), which are treated differently by some, but not all, legal systems.

Wrecks are often considered separately from their cargo. For example, in the British case of &quot;Lusitania&quot; [1986] QB 384 it was accepted that the remains of the vessel itself were owned by the insurance underwriters who had paid out on the vessel as a total loss by virtue of the law of subrogation (who subsequently sold their rights), but that the property aboard the wreck still belonged to its original owners or their heirs.

Military wrecks, however, remain under the jurisdictionand hence protectionof the government that lost the ship, or that government&#x27;s successor. Hence, a German U-boat from World War II still technically belongs to the German government, although Nazi Germany (the government at the time) is long-defunct. Many military wrecks are also protected by virtue of being war graves.

However, many legal systems allow the rights of salvors to override the rights of the original owners of a wreck or its cargo. As a general rule, non-historic civilian shipwrecks are considered fair game for salvage. Under international maritime law, for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a salvage operation (see Finders, keepers). The State of North Carolina questionably claims &quot;all photographs, video recordings, or other documentary materials of a derelict vessel or shipwreck or its contents, relics, artifacts, or historic materials in the custody of any agency of North Carolina government or its subdivisions&quot; to be its property.

Some countries assert claims to all wrecks within their territorial waters, irrespective of the interest of the original owner or the salvor.
Some legal systems regard a wreck and its cargo to be abandoned if no attempt is made to salvage them within a certain period of time. English law has usually resisted this notion (encouraged by an extremely large maritime insurance industry, which asserts claims in respect of shipwrecks which it has paid claims on), but it has been accepted to a greater or lesser degree in an Australian case and in a Norwegian case.

The American courts have been inconsistent between states and at federal level. Under Danish law, all shipwrecks over 150 years old belong to the state if no owner can be found. In Spain, wrecks vest in the state if not salvaged within 3 years. In Finland, all property on board shipwrecks over 100 years old vests in the state.

The British Protection of Wrecks Act, enacted to protect historic wrecks, controls access to wrecks such as Cattewater Wreck which can only be visited or investigated under licence. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access to wrecks which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other wrecks divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the wreck. In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.

Following the beaching of , as a result of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies (diapers). The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck. Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding. After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. A similar situation occurred after the wreck of in 1997.

Historic wrecks (often but not always defined as being more than 50 years of age) are often protected from pillaging and looting through national laws protecting cultural heritage. Internationally they may be protected by a State ratifying the Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. In this case pillaging is not allowed. One such example is which is undergoing archaeological recovery by the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources near Beaufort Inlet, NC.

An important international convention aiming at the protection of underwater cultural heritage (including shipwrecks) is the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.
The 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage represents the international community&#x27;s response to the increasing looting and destruction of underwater cultural heritage. It forms part of a group of UNESCO standard setting instruments regarding the domain of cultural heritage, encompassing seven conventions adopted by UNESCO Member States, which constitute a coherent and complementary body guaranteeing a complete protection of all forms of cultural heritage.

The UNESCO 2001 Convention is an international treaty aimed exclusively at the protection of underwater cultural heritage and the facilitation of international cooperation in this regard. It does not change sovereignty rights of States or regulate the ownership of wrecks or submerged ruins.

=== Notable salvages ===
In 2011, the most valuable cargo of a sunken shipwreck was identified near the western edge of the Celtic Sea. This World War II era sinking of led to a treasure almost deep.

A U.S. federal court and a panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit have upheld the Spanish claim to the contents of the ship ; Spain took control of the treasure in February 2012. A very small number of coins and effects recovered from the ship were deposited in Gibraltar, because they showed clear signs coherent with an internal explosion on the ship and thus confirmed Spanish claims to the wreck being that of the &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes&quot;. They were not returned to Spain until 2013, when a court finally ordered Odyssey Marine to return the missing pieces.

Archaeologist Valerios Stais discovered one of the most notable instruments of time keeping and prediction of celestial events off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera on May 17, 1902. The device, known as the Antikythera Mechanism, is perhaps the earliest example of what would be known as today as an analog computer, and the technology it encompasses predates any other recorded description by hundreds or thousands of years.

<text>Johnathan Southworth Ritter (September 17, 1948 – September 11, 2003) was an American actor. He was a son of the singing cowboy star Tex Ritter and the father of actors Jason and Tyler Ritter. He is best known for playing Jack Tripper on the ABC sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (1977–1984), and received a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1984. Ritter briefly reprised the role on the spin-off &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, which aired for one season, producing 22 episodes before its cancellation in 1985.

He appeared in over 100 films and television series combined and performed on Broadway, with roles including adult Ben Hanscom in &quot;It&quot; (1990), &quot;Problem Child&quot; (1990), &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; (1991), a dramatic turn in &quot;Sling Blade&quot; (1996), and &quot;Bad Santa&quot; in 2003 (his final live action film, which was dedicated to his memory). In 2002, Don Knotts called Ritter the &quot;greatest physical comedian on the planet&quot;. His final roles include voicing the title character on the PBS children&#x27;s program &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot; (2000–2003), for which he received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations, and as Paul Hennessy on the ABC sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; (2002–2003).

==Early life==
Johnathan Southworth Ritter was born on September 17, 1948, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California.His father, Tex Ritter (1905–1974), was a singing cowboy and film star, and his mother, Dorothy Fay (née Southworth; 1915–2003), was an actress. He had an older brother, Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Ritter. Ritter attended Hollywood High School, where he was student body president. While a teenager, Ritter&#x27;s right eye was permanently injured by a projectile flying into the car in which he was riding. This resulted in his right pupil having a strange appearance and only having peripheral vision in that eye for the rest of his life.
Ritter attended the University of Southern California and majored in psychology with plans to have a career in politics. He later changed his major to theater arts and attended the USC School of Dramatic Arts (formerly School of Theatre). Ritter was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity at USC. While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.

==Career==

===Film and television===
Ritter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first television acting experience was as a campus revolutionary in the television series &quot;Dan August&quot; starring Burt Reynolds and future &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; co-star Norman Fell. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film &quot;The Barefoot Executive&quot;. He made guest appearances on the television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series &quot;The Waltons&quot; from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (the Americanized version of the 1970s British Thames Television series &quot;Man About the House&quot;) in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played Ringo Starr&#x27;s manager on the television special &quot;Ringo&quot;. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in the animated film &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot;.

Ritter became a household name on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, portraying struggling culinary student Jack Tripper with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers, and then later Jenilee Harrison and Priscilla Barnes. Much of the comedy centered around Jack&#x27;s pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the co-ed living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the ratings in the United States before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off, &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, Ritter appeared in the films &quot;Hero at Large&quot;, &quot;Americathon&quot;, and &quot;They All Laughed&quot;. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for Graham Nash&#x27;s song &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; from the album of the same name. 

&quot;Hooperman&quot; was Ritter&#x27;s first regular television role after &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith (Debrah Farentino) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his work on &quot;Hooperman&quot;. Ritter won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator, in &quot;Hearts Afire&quot;. This series starred Markie Post as Georgie Anne Lahti and Billy Bob Thornton as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production &quot;Noises Off&quot; in 1992.

After his time on television, he appeared in a number of films, most notably &quot;Problem Child&quot; and its first sequel. He co-starred with Jim Belushi in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Real Men&quot; and played the lead role in Blake Edwards&#x27; 1989 film &quot;Skin Deep.&quot; He appeared in the film version of &quot;Noises Off&quot;, rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the Oscar-winning &quot;Sling Blade&quot; (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with Olivier Gruner in the 1996 action film &quot;Mercenary&quot;. 

Ritter starred in many television films, including &quot;Gramps&quot; (1995), co-starring with Andy Griffith, Rob Hedden&#x27;s &quot;The Colony&quot; (1995) with Hal Linden, Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Danielle Steel&#x27;s Heartbeat&quot; with Polly Draper, and &quot;It Came from the Sky&quot; in 1999 with Yasmine Bleeth. Ritter also made guest appearances on television shows, such as &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; &quot;Scrubs,&quot; &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. He also provided the voice of the title character in the animated children&#x27;s show &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot; and its animated film adaptation &quot;Clifford&#x27;s Really Big Movie&quot; (2004), a role for which he received four Emmy nominations. His final film was &quot;Stanley&#x27;s Dinosaur Round-Up&quot; (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory. At the time of his death, he was starring in &quot;8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter.&quot;

===Theater===
In 2000, Ritter co-starred with Henry Winkler in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway, portraying Claude Pichon. It ran for 364 performances. Ritter won the Theatre World Award in 2001 for his performance in that work. In 2003, Ritter made his final stage appearance in &quot;All About Eve&quot; at the Ahmanson Theatre.

J For J at LA&#x27;s Court Theatre March 14-April 21, 2002. Starring John Ritter, Jeff Kober and Jenny Sullivan. Directed by Joseph Fuqua. Written by Jenny Sullivan.

==Personal life==
On October 16, 1977, Ritter married actress Nancy Morgan, with whom he had three children: Jason Carly, and Tyler. They divorced on September 1, 1996. He married actress Amy Yasbeck on September 18, 1999, at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio. They had a child born in 1998. Yasbeck played his love interest in the first two &quot;Problem Child&quot; films, though as two different characters. Yasbeck also played Ritter&#x27;s wife in two sitcom appearances. In 1991, both were guest stars on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, in which Yasbeck played the in-labor wife of Ritter&#x27;s basketball coach character. In 1996, Ritter guest-starred on Yasbeck&#x27;s sitcom, &quot;Wings&quot;, as the estranged husband of Yasbeck&#x27;s character, Casey.

==Death==

On September 11, 2003, Ritter was rehearsing for &quot;8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California when he suddenly fell ill: sweating profusely, vomiting, and complaining of chest pain. He was taken across the street to the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center (the same hospital where he had been born) at 6:00 pm. Ritter was initially treated by emergency room physicians for an assumed heart attack; however, his condition quickly worsened. Ritter was then diagnosed with aortic dissection and taken into surgery, but was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m., at the age of 54.

A private funeral for Ritter was held in Los Angeles on September 15, 2003, after which he was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.

In 2008, Ritter&#x27;s widow Amy Yasbeck, on behalf of herself and Ritter&#x27;s children, filed lawsuits against doctors involved in Ritter&#x27;s treatment and Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. A number of those lawsuits were settled out of court, for a total of $14 million, including a settlement for $9.4 million with Providence St. Joseph. A $67 million wrongful-death lawsuit against two of the physicians, radiologist Matthew Lotysch and cardiologist Joseph Lee, went to trial in 2008. Yasbeck accused Lee, who treated Ritter on the day of his death, of misdiagnosing his condition as a heart attack and Lotysch, who had given him a full-body scan two years earlier, of failing at that time to detect an enlargement of Ritter&#x27;s aorta. In 2008, at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the jury concluded that the doctors who treated Ritter the day he died were not negligent and thus were not responsible for his death.

=== Response and legacy ===
Many of Ritter&#x27;s colleagues expressed sorrow following the news of his death. Zach Braff, who worked with Ritter on &quot;Scrubs&quot;, called Ritter a &quot;comic hero&quot; of his and said he had approached series creator Bill Lawrence to get Ritter to play his character J.D.&#x27;s father (which Ritter did for two episodes and was slated to return for a third the week following his death). Katey Sagal testified in the wrongful death lawsuit, calling Ritter a &quot;funny man who was funny like nobody&#x27;s business&quot;. His &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; co-star Joyce DeWitt remarked he was &quot;Impossible to forget. Impossible not to love.&quot; 

&quot;8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; was later retitled &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; following Ritter&#x27;s death and continued for one and a half more seasons before its cancellation in 2005. Ritter&#x27;s character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show&#x27;s second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul&#x27;s death. New male characters, played by James Garner and David Spade, were later added to the main cast as Ritter&#x27;s replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by Henry Winkler, the executive producer of the show and a very close friend of Ritter&#x27;s. Four days after Ritter&#x27;s death, Nick at Nite ran an all-night &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; marathon dedicated to his memory.

In 2004, Ritter was posthumously given an Emmy nomination for playing Paul Hennessy in &quot;8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; but lost to Kelsey Grammer for his performances as the title character of &quot;Frasier&quot;. Upon accepting his trophy, Grammer&#x27;s remarks included comments made in tribute and remembrance of Ritter. Ritter&#x27;s final films, &quot;Bad Santa&quot; and &quot;Clifford&#x27;s Really Big Movie&quot;, along with a Season 4 episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot; (his character in this series died, as well), the Season 8 &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Stressed for Success&quot; (in which he played music teacher Eugene Grandy) and &quot;Stanley&#x27;s Dinosaur Round-Up&quot; (in which he played Great Uncle Stew) were all dedicated to his memory.

On June 6, 2008, Hollywood High School dedicated a mural of Ritter painted by Eloy Torrez. In March 2010, the Thoracic Aortic Disease (TAD) Coalition, in partnership with Yasbeck and the John Ritter Foundation (JRF), announced the creation of the &quot;Ritter Rules&quot; which are life-saving reminders to recognize, treat and prevent thoracic aortic dissection. The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.

<text>The European Graduate School (EGS) is a private graduate school that operates in two locations: Saas-Fee, Switzerland, and Valletta, Malta.

==History==

It was founded in 1994 in Saas-Fee, Switzerland by the Swiss scientist, artist, and therapist, Paolo Knill. It was co-founded by the Swiss Canton of Valais, which is represented in its board.

The school initially offered programs in Expressive Arts Therapy, as part of a broader initiative to develop a network of training institutes in Expressive Arts Therapy. A division of Media and Communication (later renamed Philosophy, Art and Critical Thought) was established in 1998 by Wolfgang Schirmacher.

EGS is licensed as a university in Malta and is recognized in the Swiss canton where it operates, but is not recognized by the Swiss University Conference, the main regulatory body for universities in Switzerland.

Teaching is mostly remote, with required attendance for short periods at the school; ad hoc meetings in various cities also take place.

Notable faculty members have included Giorgio Agamben, Chantal Akerman, Pierre Alféri, Judith Butler, Achille Mbembe, Avital Ronell, Slavoj Žižek, Alain Badiou, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy, Paul Virilio, Donna Haraway, Alenka Zupančič, Jacques Rancière, Bracha Ettinger, Jean Baudrillard, Catherine Malabou, Achille Mbembe, Sha Xin Wei, and Sandy Stone.

Notable alumni and attendees have included Lara Khaldi, John Maus, Gael García Bernal, Ariana Reines, Micah White, Pablo Iglesias Turrión, Bruce Barber, and Duane Rousselle.

<text>Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations are methods used to find numerical approximations to the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Their use is also known as &quot;numerical integration&quot;, although this term can also refer to the computation of integrals.

Many differential equations cannot be solved exactly. For practical purposes, however – such as in engineering – a numeric approximation to the solution is often sufficient. The algorithms studied here can be used to compute such an approximation. An alternative method is to use techniques from calculus to obtain a series expansion of the solution.

Ordinary differential equations occur in many scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, and economics. In addition, some methods in numerical partial differential equations convert the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation, which must then be solved.

== The problem ==

A first-order differential equation is an Initial value problem (IVP) of the form,

where formula_1 is a function formula_2, and the initial condition formula_3 is a given vector. &quot;First-order&quot; means that only the first derivative of &quot;y&quot; appears in the equation, and higher derivatives are absent.

Without loss of generality to higher-order systems, we restrict ourselves to &quot;first-order&quot; differential equations, because a higher-order ODE can be converted into a larger system of first-order equations by introducing extra variables. For example, the second-order equation can be rewritten as two first-order equations: and 

In this section, we describe numerical methods for IVPs, and remark that &quot;boundary value problems&quot; (BVPs) require a different set of tools. In a BVP, one defines values, or components of the solution &quot;y&quot; at more than one point. Because of this, different methods need to be used to solve BVPs. For example, the shooting method (and its variants) or global methods like finite differences, Galerkin methods, or collocation methods are appropriate for that class of problems.

The Picard–Lindelöf theorem states that there is a unique solution, provided &quot;f&quot; is Lipschitz-continuous.

== Methods ==

Numerical methods for solving first-order IVPs often fall into one of two large categories: linear multistep methods, or Runge–Kutta methods. A further division can be realized by dividing methods into those that are explicit and those that are implicit. For example, implicit linear multistep methods include Adams-Moulton methods, and backward differentiation methods (BDF), whereas implicit Runge–Kutta methods include diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (DIRK), singly diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (SDIRK), and Gauss–Radau (based on Gaussian quadrature) numerical methods. Explicit examples from the linear multistep family include the Adams–Bashforth methods, and any Runge–Kutta method with a lower diagonal Butcher tableau is explicit. A loose rule of thumb dictates that stiff differential equations require the use of implicit schemes, whereas non-stiff problems can be solved more efficiently with explicit schemes.

The so-called general linear methods (GLMs) are a generalization of the above two large classes of methods.

===Euler method===
From any point on a curve, you can find an approximation of a nearby point on the curve by moving a short distance along a line tangent to the curve.

Starting with the differential equation (), we replace the derivative &quot;y&quot;′ by the finite difference approximation

which when re-arranged yields the following formula
:formula_4
and using () gives:

This formula is usually applied in the following way. We choose a step size &quot;h&quot;, and we construct the sequence formula_5 We denote by formula_6 a numerical estimate of the exact solution formula_7. Motivated by (), we compute these estimates by the following recursive scheme 

This is the &quot;Euler method&quot; (or &quot;forward Euler method&quot;, in contrast with the &quot;backward Euler method&quot;, to be described below). The method is named after Leonhard Euler who described it in 1768.

The Euler method is an example of an &quot;explicit&quot; method. This means that the new value &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 is defined in terms of things that are already known, like &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

===Backward Euler method===

If, instead of (), we use the approximation

we get the &quot;backward Euler method&quot;:

The backward Euler method is an &quot;implicit&quot; method, meaning that we have to solve an equation to find &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1. One often uses fixed-point iteration or (some modification of) the Newton–Raphson method to achieve this.

It costs more time to solve this equation than explicit methods; this cost must be taken into consideration when one selects the method to use. The advantage of implicit methods such as () is that they are usually more stable for solving a stiff equation, meaning that a larger step size &quot;h&quot; can be used.

===First-order exponential integrator method===

Exponential integrators describe a large class of integrators that have recently seen a lot of development. They date back to at least the 1960s.

In place of (), we assume the differential equation is either of the form

or it has been locally linearized about a background state to produce a linear term formula_8 and a nonlinear term formula_9.

Exponential integrators are constructed by multiplying () by formula_10, and exactly integrating the result over
a time interval formula_11:
:formula_12
This integral equation is exact, but it doesn&#x27;t define the integral.

The first-order exponential integrator can be realized by holding formula_13 constant over the full interval:
===Generalizations===
The Euler method is often not accurate enough. In more precise terms, it only has order one (the concept of &quot;order&quot; is explained below). This caused mathematicians to look for higher-order methods.

One possibility is to use not only the previously computed value &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; to determine &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1, but to make the solution depend on more past values. This yields a so-called &quot;multistep method&quot;. Perhaps the simplest is the leapfrog method which is second order and (roughly speaking) relies on two time values.

Almost all practical multistep methods fall within the family of linear multistep methods, which have the form
formula_14

Another possibility is to use more points in the interval formula_15. This leads to the family of Runge–Kutta methods, named after Carl Runge and Martin Kutta. One of their fourth-order methods is especially popular.

===Advanced features===
A good implementation of one of these methods for solving an ODE entails more than the time-stepping formula.

It is often inefficient to use the same step size all the time, so &quot;variable step-size methods&quot; have been developed. Usually, the step size is chosen such that the (local) error per step is below some tolerance level. This means that the methods must also compute an &quot;error indicator&quot;, an estimate of the local error.

An extension of this idea is to choose dynamically between different methods of different orders (this is called a &quot;variable order method&quot;). Methods based on Richardson extrapolation, such as the Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm, are often used to construct various methods of different orders.

Other desirable features include: 
* &quot;dense output&quot;: cheap numerical approximations for the whole integration interval, and not only at the points &quot;t&quot;0, &quot;t&quot;1, &quot;t&quot;2, ...
* &quot;event location&quot;: finding the times where, say, a particular function vanishes. This typically requires the use of a root-finding algorithm.
* support for parallel computing.
* when used for integrating with respect to time, time reversibility

===Alternative methods===
Many methods do not fall within the framework discussed here. Some classes of alternative methods are:
* &quot;multiderivative methods&quot;, which use not only the function &quot;f&quot; but also its derivatives. This class includes &quot;Hermite–Obreschkoff methods&quot; and &quot;Fehlberg methods&quot;, as well as methods like the Parker–Sochacki method or Bychkov–Scherbakov method, which compute the coefficients of the Taylor series of the solution &quot;y&quot; recursively.
* &quot;methods for second order ODEs&quot;. We said that all higher-order ODEs can be transformed to first-order ODEs of the form (1). While this is certainly true, it may not be the best way to proceed. In particular, &quot;Nyström methods&quot; work directly with second-order equations.
* &quot;geometric integration methods&quot; are especially designed for special classes of ODEs (for example, symplectic integrators for the solution of Hamiltonian equations). They take care that the numerical solution respects the underlying structure or geometry of these classes.
* &quot;Quantized state systems methods&quot; are a family of ODE integration methods based on the idea of state quantization. They are efficient when simulating sparse systems with frequent discontinuities.

===Parallel-in-time methods===
Some IVPs require integration at such high temporal resolution and/or over such long time intervals that classical serial time-stepping methods become computationally infeasible to run in real-time (e.g. IVPs in numerical weather prediction, plasma modelling, and molecular dynamics). Parallel-in-time (PinT) methods have been developed in response to these issues in order to reduce simulation runtimes through the use of parallel computing.

Early PinT methods (the earliest being proposed in the 1960s) were initially overlooked by researchers due to the fact that the parallel computing architectures that they required were not yet widely available. With more computing power available, interest was renewed in the early 2000s with the development of Parareal, a flexible, easy-to-use PinT algorithm that is suitable for solving a wide variety of IVPs. The advent of exascale computing has meant that PinT algorithms are attracting increasing research attention and are being developed in such a way that they can harness the world&#x27;s most powerful supercomputers. The most popular methods as of 2023 include Parareal, PFASST, ParaDiag, and MGRIT.

== Analysis ==

Numerical analysis is not only the design of numerical methods, but also their analysis. Three central concepts in this analysis are:
* &quot;convergence&quot;: whether the method approximates the solution,
* &quot;order&quot;: how well it approximates the solution, and
* &quot;stability&quot;: whether errors are damped out.

===Convergence===

A numerical method is said to be &quot;convergent&quot; if the numerical solution approaches the exact solution as the step size &quot;h&quot; goes to 0. More precisely, we require that for every ODE (1) with a Lipschitz function &quot;f&quot; and every &quot;t&quot;* &gt; 0,

:formula_16

All the methods mentioned above are convergent.

===Consistency and order===

Suppose the numerical method is

:formula_17

The &quot;local (truncation) error&quot; of the method is the error committed by one step of the method. That is, it is the difference between the result given by the method, assuming that no error was made in earlier steps, and the exact solution:

:formula_18

The method is said to be &quot;consistent&quot; if 
:formula_19
The method has &quot;order&quot; formula_20 if
:formula_21
Hence a method is consistent if it has an order greater than 0. The (forward) Euler method (4) and the backward Euler method (6) introduced above both have order 1, so they are consistent. Most methods being used in practice attain higher order. Consistency is a necessary condition for convergence, but not sufficient; for a method to be convergent, it must be both consistent and zero-stable.

A related concept is the &quot;global (truncation) error&quot;, the error sustained in all the steps one needs to reach a fixed time formula_22. Explicitly, the global error at time formula_22&quot; is formula_24 where formula_25. The global error of a formula_20&quot;th order one-step method is formula_27; in particular, such a method is convergent. This statement is not necessarily true for multi-step methods.

===Stability and stiffness===

For some differential equations, application of standard methods—such as the Euler method, explicit Runge–Kutta methods, or multistep methods (for example, Adams–Bashforth methods)—exhibit instability in the solutions, though other methods may produce stable solutions. This &quot;difficult behaviour&quot; in the equation (which may not necessarily be complex itself) is described as &quot;stiffness&quot;, and is often caused by the presence of different time scales in the underlying problem. For example, a collision in a mechanical system like in an impact oscillator typically occurs at much smaller time scale than the time for the motion of objects; this discrepancy makes for very &quot;sharp turns&quot; in the curves of the state parameters.

Stiff problems are ubiquitous in chemical kinetics, control theory, solid mechanics, weather forecasting, biology, plasma physics, and electronics. One way to overcome stiffness is to extend the notion of differential equation to that of differential inclusion, which allows for and models non-smoothness.

== History ==

Below is a timeline of some important developments in this field.

* 1768 - Leonhard Euler publishes his method.
* 1824 - Augustin Louis Cauchy proves convergence of the Euler method. In this proof, Cauchy uses the implicit Euler method.
* 1855 - First mention of the multistep methods of John Couch Adams in a letter written by Francis Bashforth.
* 1895 - Carl Runge publishes the first Runge–Kutta method.
* 1901 - Martin Kutta describes the popular fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.
* 1910 - Lewis Fry Richardson announces his extrapolation method, Richardson extrapolation.
* 1952 - Charles F. Curtiss and Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder coin the term &quot;stiff equations&quot;.
* 1963 - Germund Dahlquist introduces &quot;A-stability&quot; of integration methods.

== Numerical solutions to second-order one-dimensional boundary value problems ==

Boundary value problems (BVPs) are usually solved numerically by solving an approximately equivalent matrix problem obtained by discretizing the original BVP. The most commonly used method for numerically solving BVPs in one dimension is called the Finite Difference Method. This method takes advantage of linear combinations of point values to construct finite difference coefficients that describe derivatives of the function. For example, the second-order central difference approximation to the first derivative is given by:

: formula_28

and the second-order central difference for the second derivative is given by:

: formula_29

In both of these formulae, formula_30 is the distance between neighbouring &quot;x&quot; values on the discretized domain. One then constructs a linear system that can then be solved by standard matrix methods. For example, suppose the equation to be solved is:

: formula_31

The next step would be to discretize the problem and use linear derivative approximations such as

: formula_32

and solve the resulting system of linear equations. This would lead to equations such as:

: formula_33

On first viewing, this system of equations appears to have difficulty associated with the fact that the equation involves no terms that are not multiplied by variables, but in fact this is false. At &quot;i&quot; = 1 and &quot;n&quot; − 1 there is a term involving the boundary values formula_34 and formula_35 and since these two values are known, one can simply substitute them into this equation and as a result have a non-homogeneous system of linear equations that has non-trivial solutions.

<text>A libation is a ritual pouring of a liquid as an offering to a deity or spirit, or in memory of the dead. It was common in many religions of antiquity and continues to be offered in cultures today.

Various substances have been used for libations, most commonly wine or other alcoholic drinks, olive oil, honey, and in India, ghee. The vessels used in the ritual, including the patera, often had a significant form which differentiated them from secular vessels. The libation could be poured onto something of religious significance, such as an altar, or into the earth. On the other hand, one or more libations began most meals and occasions when wine was drunk in Greco-Roman and other ancient societies, mostly using normal cups or jugs.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;libation&quot; derives from the Latin &#x27;, an act of pouring, from the verb &#x27;, &quot;to taste, sip; pour out, make a libation&quot; (Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, &quot;pour, make a libation&quot;).

==Religious practice==
===Antiquity===
==== Ancient Sumer ====
The Sumerian afterlife was a dark, dreary cavern located deep below the ground. This bleak domain was known as Kur, where the souls were believed to eat nothing but dry dust and family members of the deceased would ritually pour libations into the grave through a clay pipe, thereby allowing the dead to drink.
==== Ancient Egypt ====
Libation was part of ancient Egyptian society where it was a drink offering to honor and please the various divinities, sacred ancestors, humans present and humans who are alive but not physically present, as well as the environment. It is suggested that libation originated somewhere in the upper Nile Valley and spread out to other regions of Africa and the world. According to Ayi Kwei Armah, &quot;[t]his legend explains the rise of a propitiatory custom found everywhere on the African continent: libation, the pouring of alcohol or other drinks as offerings to ancestors and divinities.&quot;

Milk libations for Osiris may have originated at Philae and spread southwards into Meroe. It is also possible the reverse occurred; as milk libation was already known to Nubians, they may have introduced it to Philae.
==== Ancient Greece ====

Libation (, , ) was a central and vital aspect of ancient Greek religion, and one of the simplest and most common forms of religious practice. It is one of the basic religious acts that define piety in ancient Greece, dating back to the Bronze Age and even prehistoric Greece. Libations were a part of daily life, and the pious might perform them every day in the morning and evening, as well as to begin meals. A libation most often consisted of mixed wine and water, but could also be unmixed wine, honey, oil, water, or milk.

The typical form of libation, &quot;,&quot; is the ritualized pouring of wine from a jug or bowl held in the hand. The most common ritual was to pour the liquid from an &quot;oinochoē&quot; (wine jug) into a &quot;phiale&quot;, a shallow bowl designed for the purpose. After wine was poured from the &quot;phiale&quot;, the remainder of the &quot;oinochoē&#x27;s&quot; contents was drunk by the celebrant. A libation is poured any time wine is to be drunk, a practice that is recorded as early as the Homeric epics. The etiquette of the symposium required that when the first bowl &quot;(krater)&quot; of wine was served, a libation was made to Zeus and the Olympian gods. Heroes received a libation from the second &quot;krater&quot; served, and (, &quot;Zeus who Finishes&quot;) from the third, which was supposed to be the last. An alternative was to offer a libation from the first bowl to the Agathos Daimon and from the third bowl to Hermes. An individual at the symposium could also make an invocation of and libation to a god of his choice.

Libation generally accompanied prayer. The Greeks stood when they prayed, either with their arms uplifted, or in the act of libation with the right arm extended to hold the &quot;phiale&quot;. 
In conducting animal sacrifice, wine is poured onto the offering as part of its ritual slaughter and preparation, and then afterwards onto the ash and flames. This scene is commonly depicted in Greek art, which also often shows sacrificers or the gods themselves holding the &quot;phiale&quot;.

The Greek verb &#x27; (σπένδω), &quot;pour a libation&quot;, also &quot;conclude a pact&quot;, derives from the Indo-European root &#x27;, &quot;make an offering, perform a rite, engage oneself by a ritual act&quot;. The noun is &quot; (&quot;plural &quot;)&quot;, &quot;libation.&quot; In the middle voice, the verb means &quot;enter into an agreement&quot;, in the sense that the gods are called to guarantee an action. Blood sacrifice was performed to begin a war; &#x27; marked the conclusion of hostilities, and is often thus used in the sense of &quot;armistice, treaty.&quot; The formula &quot;We the polis have made libation&quot; was a declaration of peace or the &quot;Truce of God&quot;, which was observed also when the various city-states came together for the Panhellenic Games, the Olympic Games, or the festivals of the Eleusinian Mysteries: this form of libation is &quot;bloodless, gentle, irrevocable, and final&quot;.

Libations poured onto the earth are meant for the dead and for the chthonic gods. In the Book of the Dead in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus digs an offering pit around which he pours in order honey, wine, and water. For the form of libation called &#x27; (&quot;, &quot;, &quot;that which is poured&quot;; from IE &#x27;), a larger vessel is tipped over and emptied onto the ground for the chthonic gods, who may also receive &quot;spondai&quot;. Heroes, who were divinized mortals, might receive blood libations if they had participated in the bloodshed of war, as for instance Brasidas the Spartan. In rituals of caring for the dead at their tombs, libations would include milk and honey.

&quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; is the English title of the center tragedy from the &quot;Orestes Trilogy&quot; of Aeschylus, in reference to the offerings Electra brings to the tomb of her dead father Agamemnon. Sophocles gives one of the most detailed descriptions of libation in Greek literature in &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, performed as atonement in the grove of the Eumenides:
First, water is fetched from a freshly flowing spring; cauldrons which stand in the sanctuary are garlanded with wool and filled with water and honey; turning towards the east, the sacrificer tips the vessels towards the west; the olive branches which he has been holding in his hand he now strews on the ground at the place where the earth has drunk in the libation; and with a silent prayer he departs, not looking back.

Hero of Alexandria described a mechanism for automating the process by using altar fires to force oil from the cups of two statues.

====Ancient Rome====
In ancient Roman religion, the libation was a religious act in the form of a liquid offering, most often unmixed wine and perfumed oil. The Roman god &quot;Liber Pater&quot; (&quot;Father Liber&quot;), later identified with the Greek Dionysus or Bacchus, was the divinity of &quot;libamina&quot;, &quot;libations,&quot; and &quot;liba&quot;, sacrificial cakes drizzled with honey.

In Roman art, the libation is shown performed at a &quot;mensa&quot; (sacrificial meal table), or tripod. It was the simplest form of sacrifice, and could be a sufficient offering by itself. The introductory rite &quot;()&quot; to an animal sacrifice included an incense and wine libation onto a burning altar. Both emperors and divinities are frequently depicted, especially on coins, pouring libations. Scenes of libation commonly signify the quality of &quot;&quot;, religious duty or reverence.

The libation was part of Roman funeral rites, and may have been the only sacrificial offering at humble funerals. Libations were poured in rituals of caring for the dead (see and ), and some tombs were equipped with tubes through which the offerings could be directed to the underground dead.

Milk was unusual as a libation at Rome, but was regularly offered to a few deities, particularly those of an archaic nature or those for whom it was a natural complement, such as , a goddess of birth and childrearing who promoted the flow of breast milk, and Cunina, a tutelary of the cradle. It was offered also to Mercurius Sobrius (the &quot;sober&quot; Mercury), whose cult is well attested in Roman Africa and may have been imported to the city of Rome by an African community.

==== Ancient Judaism ====

Libations were part of ancient Judaism and are mentioned in the Bible:
In Isaiah 53:12, Isaiah uses libation as a metaphor when describing the end of the Suffering Servant figure who &quot;poured out his life unto death&quot;.

Libations of wine were offered at the Jerusalem temple, and a double libation of wine and water was offered during Sukkot, possibly as a rain making ritual.

Idolatrous libations were forbidden, along with the Torah&#x27;s prohibitions on idolatrous sacrifice and worship generally.

==== Early Christianity ====
Libation is present and in Christianity appears in the New Testament and is the practice of Jesus and other biblical figures.

This phrasing in Luke refers to the act of libation as the new covenant, to the blood of Jesus to be poured out in death.

Libations were normally conducted in a spirit of peace, the Greek term for libation, σπονδή (&quot;spondȇ&quot;), became synonymous with &quot;peace treaty&quot;.

===Africa===
Libation was part of ancient Egyptian society where it was a drink offering to honor and please the various divinities, sacred ancestors, humans present and humans who are alive but not physically present, as well as the environment. It is suggested that libation originated somewhere in the upper Nile Valley and spread out to other regions of Africa and the world. According to Ayi Kwei Armah, &quot;[t]his legend explains the rise of a propitiatory custom found everywhere on the African continent: libation, the pouring of alcohol or other drinks as offerings to ancestors and divinities.&quot;
In African cultures and African traditional religions the ritual of pouring libation is an essential ceremonial tradition and a way of giving homage to the ancestors. Ancestors are not only respected in such cultures, but also invited to participate in all public functions (as are also the gods and God). A prayer is offered in the form of libations, calling the ancestors to attend. The ritual is generally performed by an elder. Although water may be used, the drink is typically some traditional wine (e.g. palm wine), and the libation ritual is accompanied by an invitation (and invocation) to the ancestors, gods and God. In the Volta region of Ghana, water with a mixture of corn flour is also used to pour libation.

Libation is also commonly recognized as the break within the famous performance of Agbekor, a ritual dance performed in West African cultures. It is also poured during traditional marriage ceremony, when a child is born and funeral ceremony. Traditional Festivals like Asafotu and Homowo of the Ga Adangbe people of Ghana and Togo. Also during installment of kings, queens, and chiefs, libation is poured.

As recently as the 1920s, it was a custom in Lower Nubia for women to go to the graves of relatives every Friday and pour a libation of water into a red bowl at the head of the grave. For widows, it was also once a custom for them to pour a libation of milk on their husband&#x27;s grave the second day after his death.

Similarly, it has been Coptic tradition for women to visit graves and make water libations, both in intervals during the first 40 days after a death, and during a few annual occasions, such as Nayrouz.

===Americas===
In the Quechua and Aymara cultures of the South American Andes, it is common to pour a small amount of one&#x27;s beverage on the ground before drinking as an offering to the Pachamama, or Mother Earth. This especially holds true when drinking Chicha, an alcoholic beverage unique to this part of the world. The libation ritual is commonly called &quot;challa&quot; and is performed quite often, usually before meals and during celebrations. The sixteenth century writer Bernardino de Sahagún records the Aztec ceremony associated with drinking &quot;octli&quot;:
Libation was done in this manner: when &quot;octli&quot; was drunk, when they tasted the new &quot;octli&quot;, when someone had just made &quot;octli&quot;...he summoned people. He set it out in a vessel before the hearth, along with small cups for drinking. Before having anyone drink, he took up &quot;octli&quot; with a cup and then poured it before the hearth; he poured the &quot;octli&quot; in the four directions. And when he had poured the &quot;octli&quot; then everyone drank it.

===Asia===
====Hinduism====

In Hinduism libation rituals most often involve pouring the offered liquid over a murti or sacred image. Many temple images receive libations from the priests daily. Libations are part of &quot;Tarpan&quot; and also performed during Pitru Paksha (Fortnight of the ancestors) following the Bhadrapada month of the Hindu calendar, (September–October).
In India and Nepal, Lord Shiva (also Vishnu and other deities) is offered abhisheka with water by devotees at many temples when they go visit the temple, and on special occasions elaborately with water, milk, yogurt, ghee, honey, and sugar.

==== Burmese Buddhism ====

In Burmese Buddhism, the water libation ceremony, called &quot;yay zet cha&quot; (), which involves the ceremonial pouring of water from a vessel of water into a vase, drop by drop, concludes most Buddhist ceremonies, including donation celebrations, shinbyu, and feasts. This ceremonial libation is done to share the accrued merit with all other living beings in all 31 planes of existence. The ceremony has three primary prayers: the confession of faith, the pouring of water, and the sharing of merits. While the water is poured, a confession of faith, called the &quot;&quot; (), is recited and led by the monks.

Then, the merit is distributed by the donors (called &quot;ahmya wei&quot; ) by thrice saying the following:


Afterward, in unison, the participants repeat thrice a declaration of affirmation: &#x27; (, &#x27;), Pali for &quot;well done&quot;, akin to the Christian use of amen. Afterward, the libated water is poured on soil outside, to return the water to Vasudhara. The earth goddess Vasudhara is invoked to witness these meritorious deeds.

Prior to colonial rule, the water libation ceremony was also performed during the crowning of Burmese kings, as part of procedures written in the &quot;Raza Thewaka Dipani Kyan&quot;, an 1849 text that outlines proper conduct of Burmese kings.

Although the offering of water to Vasudhara may have pre-Buddhist roots, this ceremony is believed to have been started by King Bimbisara, who poured the libation of water, to share his merit with his ancestors who had become pretas.

This ceremony is also practiced at the end of Thai and Laotian Buddhist rituals to transfer merit, where it is called &quot;kruat nam&quot; (กรวดน้ำ) and &quot;yaat nam&quot; respectively.

====China====
The most traditional Chinese ritual bronze vessel for libations, the jue, has a large pouring lip, and may be regarded as a type of jug rather than a cup. In modern Chinese customs, rice wine or tea is poured in front of an altar or tombstone horizontally from right to left with both hands as an offering to gods and in honour of the deceased. The offering is usually placed on the altar for a while before being offered in libation. In more elaborate ceremonies honouring deities, the libation may be done over the burning paper offerings; whereas for the deceased, the wine is only poured onto the ground.

==== Japan ====

Japanese libations leave the liquid offering on the altar in a suitable vessel, while other portions are drunk by the participants. In Shinto, the practice of libation and the drink offered is called &quot;Miki&quot; (神酒), lit. &quot;The Liquor of the Gods&quot;. At a ceremony at a Shinto shrine, it is usually done with sake, but at a household shrine, one may substitute fresh water which can be changed every morning. It is served in a white porcelain or metal cup without any decoration.

Among the Ainu, libations are offered by means of the &quot;ikupasuy&quot;, a carved wooden implement with a &quot;tongue,&quot; the pointed end from which millet beer or sake is dripped upon the venerated object.

=== Siberian shamanism ===
Shamanism among Siberian peoples exhibits the great diversity characteristic of shamanism in general. Among several peoples near the Altai Mountains, the new drum of a shaman must go through a special ritual. This is regarded as &quot;enlivening the drum&quot;: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and skin for the new drum narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a libation: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials &quot;come to life&quot; and speak with the voice of the shaman in the name of the tree and the deer. Among the Tubalar, moreover, the shaman imitates the voice of the animal, and its behaviour as well.

== Modern customs ==

In Cuba, a widespread custom is to spill a drop or two of rum from one&#x27;s glass while saying &quot; (‘for the Saints’). An identical practice is found in Brazil when cachaça is drunk, with the drops being offered &quot; or &quot;. These customs are similar to the practice among Visayans of Mindanao, the Philippines, where rum is spilled upon opening of the bottle, accompanied by &quot;para sa yawa&quot;&quot; (&#x27;for the Devil&#x27;).

In Russia and some parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States, there is a tradition of pouring vodka onto a grave, an act possibly connected with &quot;dziady&quot; custom. In Georgia, where wine plays a more culturally significant role, it is common to pour a glass of wine on graves, especially around Easter in commemoration of all deceased.

In the contemporary United States, libations are occasionally offered in the name of a deceased person on various occasions, usually when drinking socially among friends in a private setting. There is also a tradition of pouring libations of malt liquor before drinking, which is particularly associated with African American rappers. This is referred to as &quot;tipping&quot; to one&#x27;s deceased friends, or &quot;pouring one out&quot;. This practice has been recorded in film, such as &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, and referenced in various songs, such as the 1993 &quot;Gangsta Lean (This Is For My Homies)&quot; by DRS (&quot;I tip my 40 to your memory&quot;) and the 1994 &quot;Pour Out a Little Liquor&quot; by 2Pac. As with similar practices worldwide, various symbolic sayings accompany the pouring.

In Rabbinic Judaism, drops of wine are taken from one&#x27;s glass at the Passover Seder by pouring them out or dipping one&#x27;s finger into the glass, either 10 for each plague, or 16; ten for the ten plagues, three for &quot;Blood, Fire and Columns of Smoke&quot;, and three for &quot;Detzach, Adash, B’achav&quot;. Explanations vary, but the common one is regret that the freeing of the Jewish people came at the cost of many Egyptians suffering and dying, and out of respect to &quot;not rejoice the downfall of an enemy&quot;. However, this is a more modern interpretation originally created by Rabbi Yirmiyahu Löw&#x27;s grandfather, sometime in the late 18th or early 19th century, though with precedent from Sanhendrin 39b:5.

<doc id="272859" wikidata="Q313780" url="?curid=272859" title="Mehdi Mahdavikia">
<text>Mehdi Mahdavikia (; born 24 July 1977) is an Iranian professional football coach and former player usually played as a right winger or right back.

He was at Hamburger SV as a youth coach, and also managed his own youth academy, FC KIA. He is currently head coach of Al Jazeera Al Hamra F.C. in UAE League 2.

Mahdavikia currently represents Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in the Football Advisory Panel of International Football Association Board (IFAB), joining the body in 2019. On 15 May 2013, Mahdavikia was appointed as AFC Grassroots Ambassador.

During his playing career, Mahdavikia internationally represented Iranian national team, which he captained from 2006 to 2009, and currently is the fourth most capped player of all-time. He played for Iranian clubs Bank Melli, Persepolis, Steel Azin and Damash Gilan, as well as German clubs VfL Bochum, Hamburger SV and Eintracht Frankfurt, spending 12 consecutive seasons in Bundesliga.

He won the Asian Young Footballer of the Year award in 1997 as well as the Asian Footballer of the Year award in 2003. He was known for his crossing, speed and dribbling.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Mahdavikia first played for Persepolis in his native Iran before moving to VfL Bochum in Germany. After Bochum&#x27;s relegation, he signed for Bundesliga side Hamburg where he stayed for the next eight seasons.

===Hamburger SV===
&quot;Hamburger Morgenpost&quot; estimated market value of Mahdavikia in 1999 as DM6.5 million.

His initial position for HSV was right fullback, from which he was known for his attacking runs, as he has previous experience as a right winger and at times has played as a striker. He also played some matches for Pas in Asian games as help for the club. Under coach Frank Pagelsdorf Mahdavikia used to play wide striker. For the 2006–07 Bundesliga season he moved back to his natural position of right wing, in support of Central Midfielder Rafael van der Vaart. He was awarded Hamburg Player of the Year in 2003 and 2004 by the fans, and also attained the title of the top assister of goals in the Bundesliga.

In 2003, &quot;Die Welt&quot; wrote that Mahdavikia is worth €8–10 million.

However, compared to his previous season, he had a poor season in 2004–05 and was benched. In the 2005–06 season he gained his old form back and was able to regain his spot as a starter, being influential in many of Hamburg&#x27;s victories, such as scoring the winning goal against then Bundesliga heavyweights Schalke.

Mahdavikia&#x27;s strongest points were his vision, passing skills, fast-paced runs (his nickname in Iran is &quot;The Rocket&quot;), and set-pieces such as corners, spotkicks and free kicks. He usually was the right-footed alternative to Van der Vaart&#x27;s well known left foot. Apart from being a total professional on the pitch, he is also known as a perfect gentleman off the pitch, always finding the time for fans and reporters to answer questions or sign autographs.

His nickname in Hamburg is &quot;The Carpet&quot; (der Teppich) for his ability to &quot;magically glide past&quot; his opponents like the enchanted carpet.

===Eintracht Frankfurt===
On 8 June 2007, Mahdavikia signed a three-year contract with Eintracht Frankfurt.

In his first season, he had two bad injuries that forced him to miss many matches. In the second season he was mostly benched and not used in many matches which showed that the club did not want him anymore. After 255 Games (26 goals, 55 assists) in the Bundesliga for HSV, Bochum and Eintracht Frankfurt, left Germany to sign for Steel Azin in January 2010.

===Return to Iran===

On 4 July 2011, Mahdavikia signed a contract with Amir Abedini, President of the Damash Gilan to join to the club for one year but he was joined to his beloved club, Persepolis in mid-season to play for club in his last year of playing football. He extended his contract with Persepolis for another season on 19 June 2012.

===Retirement===

On 2 March 2013, Mahdavikia announced that he would retire at the end of the 2012–13 season. Persepolis also announced that Mahdavikia&#x27;s farewell match would be in a pre-season friendly match against A.C. Milan in June 2013, played in the Azadi Stadium, but it was later announced that Mahdavikia&#x27;s last match would be against his former side, Hamburger SV in June 2013 in the same stadium.

Mahdavikia confirmed on 14 March 2013 that he ended his active football career. He played his last match as a football player in the 2013 Hazfi Cup Final, coming on extra time as a substitute. On 28 November 2013, he played a farewell match at Azadi Stadium between Persepolis XI and A.C. Milan XI. Participants in the match included former teams&#x27; legends like Hamid Derakhshan, Mohammad Panjali, Farshad Pious, Karim Bagheri, Hamid Estili, Nasser Mohammadkhani, Pejman Jamshidi, Edmond Bezik which played for Persepolis and Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Daniele Massaro, Gennaro Gattuso and Alberigo Evani for A.C. Milan. Persepolis were managed by the club&#x27;s most successful manager Ali Parvin. When Mahdavikia came on as a substitute in the 32nd minute, Pious gave his shirt to Mahdavikia, in a remarkable replay after seventeen years that Pious did so in Mahdavikia&#x27;s first match for Persepolis. The match was won by A.C. Milan XI 3–1 with Mahdavikia assisting the only goal.

==International career==

Having been awarded the Asian Young Footballer of the Year award in 1997, Mahdavikia was considered Iran&#x27;s best player in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and was named in the list from which the team of the tournament was chosen. In 2003, he was awarded Asian Player of the Year by the Asian Football Confederation. He was also the top assister in the 2004 Asian Cup, exhibiting stunning form to steer Iran&#x27;s attack to superb attacking football. He played in four Asian Cups (1996, 2000, 2004, 2007) and two World Cups (1998, 2006).

Mahdavikia was one of the influential players that played in Iran&#x27;s crucial 1–0 victory over Bahrain to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup held in Germany. Following the FIFA World Cup in Germany, 2006, Mahdavikia was expected to assume the role of Captain in the Iranian national side, replacing Ali Daei and Yahya Golmohammadi who had publicly announced their intention to retire after the tournament. Mahdavikia was given the captain&#x27;s band on 16 August 2006 in an Asian Cup qualifier versus Syria.

Mahdavikia has reportedly been forced to &quot;retire&quot; from international football after wearing a green bracelet in the final World Cup 2010 qualification match against the Republic of Korea. The green bracelet was a sign of support for those protesting the highly contested Iranian presidential election.
He was forced to retire from Team Melli after 13 years and playing in two World Cups (1998, 2006), four Asian Cups (1996, 2000, 2004, 2007), one Asian Games tournament (1998), four World Cup qualifying campaigns (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010), three Asian Cup qualifying campaigns (2000, 2004, 2007) and one AFC/OFC Cup.

==Managerial career==
Mahdavikia was the manager of the Iranian youth teams. In 2015, he founded the KIA Football Academy with Ali Doustimehr. He currently has a role as a youth coach with Hamburger SV.

In May 2019, Mahdavikia obtained UEFA A Licence and plans to enter DFB&#x27;s &quot;Fußballlehrer&quot; course.

==Famous matches==
Mahdavikia&#x27;s most prolific club match was Hamburger SV&#x27;s match against Juventus in the Champions League. He was the impetus that rallied Hamburg back after being down 3–1 by scoring once, assisting one and winning a penalty for Hamburg that saw Hamburg take a 4–3 lead; Juve managed to equalise with an Inzaghi penalty.

Another famous game in the HSV shirt came in week 30 of the 2002–03 season. Mahdavikia scored one and assisted another two goals in Hamburg&#x27;s 4–0 win over 1. FC Nuremberg. Kicker gave him a much rare perfect note of 1.0.

Mehdi&#x27;s greatest national team match, arguably, was against South Korea in the 2004 Asia Cup where he assisted three goals in Iran&#x27;s 4–3 win. Many also point to his dynamic game against the United States in World Cup 1998 that saw him score Iran&#x27;s second and winning goal, as his best ever. Another excellent match where he scored two great goals was against China in the qualification round for the 1998 World Cup when he was just 20 years old.

==Personal life==

Mahdavikia played several sports as a youngster and was exceptionally talented at handball, even being named captain of Iran&#x27;s under 14 team.

Mahdavikia is married to Sepideh and has a daughter, Asal.

In April 2006, Mahdavikia caused a stir when it came out he married a second wife named, Samira Samii, while being in his native Iran in December 2005, thus practising bigamy. He himself stated that he made a &quot;big mistake&quot;, and they divorced after a short while.

Mahdavikia&#x27;s younger brother, Hadi played for Homa F.C. and Persepolis F.C., and now is the head coach of KIA Football Academy. Mahdavikia&#x27;s nephew Mostafa is also a football player in Iran.

<text>Aristides ( ; , ; 530–468 BC) was an ancient Athenian statesman. Nicknamed &quot;the Just&quot; (δίκαιος, &quot;díkaios&quot;), he flourished at the beginning of Athens&#x27; Classical period and is remembered for his generalship in the Persian War. The ancient historian Herodotus cited him as &quot;the best and most honourable man in Athens&quot;, and he received similarly reverent treatment in Plato&#x27;s Socratic dialogues.

==Biography==
Aristides was a member of a family of moderate fortune; his father&#x27;s name was Lysimachus. Early in life he became a follower of the statesman Cleisthenes. He probably first came to notice as &quot;strategos&quot; in command of his native tribe Antiochis at the Battle of Marathon of 490 BC. In consequence of the distinction which he then achieved he is said to have won the election as &quot;archon eponymos&quot; for the ensuing year (489488). Pursuing a conservative policy to maintain Athens as a land power, he was one of the chief opponents of the naval policy proposed by Themistocles.

According to Plutarch, citing the philosopher Ariston of Ceos, the rivalry between Aristides and Themistocles began in their youth when they competed over the love of a boy: &quot;... they were rivals for the affection of the beautiful Stesilaus of Ceos, and were passionate beyond all moderation.&quot; The conflict between the two leaders ended in the ostracism of Aristides at a date variously given between 485 and 482 BC. It is said that, on this occasion, an illiterate voter who did not recognise Aristides approached the statesman and requested that he write the name of Aristides on his voting shard to ostracize him. The latter asked if Aristides had wronged him. &quot;No,&quot; was the reply, &quot;and I do not even know him, but it irritates me to hear him everywhere called &#x27;the Just&#x27;.&quot; Aristides then wrote his own name on the ballot.

Early in 480, Aristides profited by the decree recalling exiles to help in the defence of Athens against Persian invaders, and was elected &quot;strategos&quot; for the year 480–479 BC. In the Battle of Salamis of September 480 BC, he gave loyal support to Themistocles, and crowned the victory by landing Athenian infantry on the island of Psyttaleia and annihilating the Persian garrison stationed there.
In 479 BC, he was re-elected &quot;strategos&quot;, and given special powers as commander of the Athenian forces at the Battle of Plataea of August 479 BC; he is also said to have suppressed a conspiracy among some in the army. He so won the confidence of the Ionian allies that, after they had revolted from the Spartan admiral Pausanias,
they gave him the chief command and left him with absolute discretion in fixing the contributions of the newly formed (478 BC) confederacy, the Delian League. His assessment, universally accepted as equitable, continued as the basis of taxation for the greater part of the League&#x27;s duration. He continued to hold a predominant position in Athens. At first he seems to have remained on good terms with Themistocles, whom he allegedly helped in outwitting the Spartans over the rebuilding of the walls of Athens.

Some authorities state that Aristides died at Athens, others that he perished on a journey to the Black Sea; the date of his death is given by Nepos as 468 BC. He lived to witness the ostracism of Themistocles, towards whom he always displayed generosity, but he died before the rise of Pericles. His estate seems to have suffered severely from the Persian invasions, for apparently he did not leave enough money to defray the expenses of his burial, and it is known that his descendants – even in the 4th century – received state pensions.

==Authorities==

Herodotus is not the only ancient author to evaluate Aristides&#x27; life. He is also the subject of one of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, although Plutarch, writing during the Roman Empire, was several centuries removed. Aristides is praised by Socrates in Plato&#x27;s dialogues &quot;Gorgias&quot; and &quot;Meno&quot; as an exceptional instance of good leadership.

In Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, Socrates refers to Aristides, the grandson of the famous Aristides, less positively, bringing him as an example of a student who leaves his care too soon and realizes later that he is a fool.

==Memorials and representations==
There is a statue of Aristides in Louisburg Square in the American city of Boston. An 1806 painting of Aristides by is at the Musée des Augustins in the French City of Toulouse.

<text>The green heron (Butorides virescens) is a small heron of North and Central America. &quot;Butorides&quot; is from Middle English &quot;butor&quot; &quot;bittern&quot; and Ancient Greek &quot;-oides&quot;, &quot;resembling&quot;, and &quot;virescens&quot; is Latin for &quot;greenish&quot;.

It was long considered conspecific with its sister species the striated heron (&quot;Butorides striata&quot;), and together they were called &quot;green-backed heron&quot;. Birds of the nominate subspecies (no matter which taxonomic arrangement is preferred) are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe—for example, a sighting in Pembrokeshire in 2018 was only the second recorded sighting in Wales; individuals from the Pacific coast of North America may similarly stray as far as Hawaii.

==Description==

The green heron is relatively small; adult body length is about . The neck is often pulled in tight against the body. Adults have a glossy, greenish-black cap, a greenish back and wings that are grey-black grading into green or blue, a chestnut neck with a white line down the front, grey underparts and short yellow legs. The bill is dark with a long, sharp point. Female adults tend to be smaller than males, and have duller and lighter plumage, particularly in the breeding season. Juveniles are duller, with the head sides, neck and underparts streaked brown and white, tan-splotched back and wing coverts, and greenish-yellow legs and bill. Hatchlings are covered in down feathers, light grey above, and white on the belly.

The green heron&#x27;s call is a loud and sudden &#x27;; it also makes a series of more subdued &#x27; calls. During courtship, the male gives a &#x27; call with wide-open bill, makes noisy wingbeats and &#x27; calls in flight, and sometimes calls &#x27; to the female before landing again. While sitting, an &#x27; courtship call is also given.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Taxonomy==
As noted above, this species was formerly included in &quot;B. striata&quot;, which at that time was erroneously known as &quot;B. striatus&quot;. The Early Pleistocene &quot;B. validipes&quot;, whose fossil remains were discovered in Florida, might have been the ancestor of the green heron as the living species seems to replace the extinct relative in the fossil record.

Subspecies distinction is uncertain at best. The color variation between populations is less pronounced than between birds of the same population. Migratory populations are longer-winged than those resident year-round, but this cannot be used to delimit subspecies as it is quite obviously a consequence of differing habits and can be expected to undergo convergent evolution in unrelated populations of this species that just share the same habits. Thus, thorough molecular phylogenetic studies would be required to resolve the question of subspecies delimitation.

The following subspecies are commonly listed, though the validity of most of them is seriously disputed:
* &quot;Butorides virescens anthonyi&quot; 
:Breeds in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, south to northern Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Some resident, most migrate to western Mexico in winter.
* &quot;Butorides virescens bahamensis&quot; 
:Bahamas. Resident.
* &quot;Butorides virescens frazari&quot; 
:Southern Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Resident.
* &quot;Butorides virescens maculata&quot; – formerly &quot;maculatus&quot;
:Southernmost US through Central America to central Panama, Caribbean. Resident.
* &quot;Butorides virescens virescens&quot; 
:Breeds from southeastern Canada to central and southern US east of the Rocky Mountains. Winters from southernmost US to northern South America.

Much of the dispute hinges upon the distinctness of the Caribbean and Central American populations, the second taxon in this species to be described. To describe the two most extreme views, some authors assemble the bulk of the mainland population in the nominate subspecies but treat the parapatric populations as distinct subspecies, while others place all resident populations in &quot;maculata&quot; and all migratory ones in &quot;virescens&quot;.

==Ecology==

The habitat and foraging area of the green heron includes riparian zones, wetlands, ponds, and lakes, as well as human-made canals and ditches. Green herons do not exhibit a particular preference for diurnal or nocturnal foraging, often engaging in both. Shore-living individuals adapt to the rhythm of the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches, earthworms, dragonflies, damselflies, waterbugs, grasshoppers, spiders, crayfish, prawns, mice, other rodents, lizards, tadpoles and snakes. Some of the many fish eaten are: minnows, sunfish, catfish, perch, eels and, in urban areas, goldfish. Green herons are intolerant of other birds – including conspecifics – when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey. Green herons have been observed using captured prey (e.g. mayflies) or other objects (bread, feathers) to &quot;bait-fish&quot; – using a lure on the water&#x27;s surface to attract fish. This bait-fishing behavior is common among herons.

The northern population moves to its breeding ranges during March and April; near the northernmost limit of the green heron&#x27;s range, breeding is well underway by the end of May. The migration to the winter quarters starts in September; by late October, the birds are absent from regions where they do not stay all year. At least the northward migration does not seem to be affected by global warming; birds appear in their breeding ranges at the same time they did 100 years ago.

Individuals of non-migratory populations abandon their territories after breeding season to roam about the region. They may or may not return to the previous year&#x27;s breeding location, depending on whether they found better habitat during these wanderings. In these populations, the breeding season is determined by rainfall and consequent prey availability.

Green herons are seasonally monogamous. The pairs form in the breeding range, after an intense courtship display by the males, who select the nesting sites and fly in front of the female noisily and with puffed-up head and neck plumage. They nest in forest and swamp patches, over water or in plants near water. Nests are a platform of sticks, often in shrubs or trees, sometimes on the ground. Locations in trees are preferred, with some nests built up to off the ground although heights of several meters are more common. Rarely, large numbers of these birds congregate in heronries for nesting.

The clutch is usually 2–6 pale green eggs, which are laid in two-day intervals (though the second egg may be laid up to six days later than the first). After the last egg has been laid, both parents incubate for about 19–21 days until hatching, and feed the young birds. The frequency of feedings decreases as the offspring near fledging. The young sometimes start to leave the nest at 16 days of age, but are not fully fledged and able to fend for themselves until 30–35 days old. Sometimes – particularly in the tropical parts of its range – the green heron breeds twice a year.

==Tool use==
Green herons are one of the few species of bird known to use tools. In particular, they commonly use bread crusts, insects, or other items as bait. The bait is dropped onto the surface of a body of water to lure fish. When a fish takes the bait, the green heron then grabs and eats the fish.

<text>Smithfield ham is a specific form of country ham finish-cured in the town of Smithfield in Isle of Wight County in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia, U.S.

==History==
The first record of the commercial sale of cured &quot;Smithfield Ham&quot; is a receipt to Ellerston and John Perot on the Dutch Caribbean Island of St Eustatius, dating from 1779.

The Commonwealth of Virginia first regulated usage of the term &quot;Smithfield Ham&quot; in a 1926 Statute passed by its General Assembly stating:

The &quot;peanut-fed&quot; and &quot;peanut-belt&quot; stipulations were removed in 1966. The present statute reads:
While it is unclear whether the green pork (the raw product of the cured ham) may come from hogs raised and slaughtered in other than Smithfield, Virginia, the statute stipulates that the six-month (minimum duration) curing clock is to begin when the green pork is &quot;introduced to dry salt&quot;, and that through the entire duration of the process, the ham and its processing must occur within Smithfield, Virginia. The statute also commands that any richer or more intense cure, obtained from an aging that is in excess of six months, must also be done within Smithfield, Virginia.

Production of Genuine Smithfield ham was discontinued in early 2024, due to reduced demand.

<doc id="272865" wikidata="Q184602" url="?curid=272865" title="Iran national football team">
<text>The Iran national football team (), recognised as IR Iran by FIFA, represents Iran in men&#x27;s international senior football and is governed by the Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI).

At the continental level, Iran has won three AFC Asian Cup championships in 1968, 1972, and 1976. They have also won three Asian Games in 1974, 1990, and 1998. The nation&#x27;s best performance at the world level was reaching the quarterfinals at the 1976 Summer Olympics. At the FIFA World Cup, Iran have qualified six times (1978, 1998, 2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022) but have never progressed beyond the group stages; they have however, won three matches: against the United States in 1998, Morocco in 2018, and Wales in 2022. At the regional level, Iran has won four WAFF Championships and one CAFA Nations Cup. The team also won intercontinental AFC–OFC Challenge Cup in 2003.

==History==

===Early years===

The Iranian Football Federation was founded in 1920. In 1926, Tehran XI (selected players from Tehran Club, Toofan F.C. and Armenian Sports Club) traveled across the border to Baku, USSR, this was the first away football match for an Iranian team. This Tehran Select team is the predecessor of Iran&#x27;s national football team.

The first match that &quot;Team Melli&quot; played was on 23 August 1941, away at Kabul in a 1–0 win against British India while Iran&#x27;s first FIFA international match was on 25 August 1941, away at Afghanistan. Iran won the Asian Cup three consecutive times (1968, 1972, 1976) to which the team has not been able to add since.
In 1978, Iran made its first appearance in the World Cup after defeating Australia in Tehran. Iran lost two of three group stage matches against the Netherlands and Peru. Team Melli managed to surprise some in the footballing community by securing one point in its first ever World Cup appearance against Scotland which saw Iraj Danaeifard cancel out an own goal scored by Andranik Eskandarian for the 1–1 draw.

=== After the Iranian Revolution ===
After the Iranian Revolution, football was somewhat neglected. During the 1980s, the Iranian national team did not feature in World Cup competitions due to the Iran–Iraq War (1980–88) and domestic football embraced the inevitable effects of conflict. The national team withdrew from the Asian qualifiers for the 1982 World Cup and refused to participate in the qualifiers for the 1986 World Cup because of having to play on neutral ground. The war and political upheavals left Iran without major club competitions until 1989 when the Qods League was established. A year later, the Qods League was renamed the Azadegan League. Despite failing to qualify for both the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, it was said that during this period, a number of quality players burst onto the Iranian football scene laying the foundation for third place in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup (victories in that tournament included a 3–0 victory against Saudi Arabia and a 6–2 victory against South Korea) and their second stab at World Cup glory in 1998.

===1998–2006===

In November 1997, Iran qualified for the 1998 World Cup after eliminating Australia in a close playoff series. After being tied 3–3 on aggregate, Iran advanced due to the away goals rule; Iran held Australia to a 1–1 draw at home, and a 2–2 draw in Melbourne.

At their first game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup against Yugoslavia, Iran lost 1–0 to a free kick by Siniša Mihajlović. Iran recorded their first World Cup victory in the second game beating and eliminating the United States 2–1 with Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia scoring goals for Iran. The Iran-US World Cup match was preheated with certain excitement because of each country&#x27;s political stance after the Iranian revolution and the Iran hostage crisis. However, in an act of defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and took ceremonial pictures before the match kickoff.

Iran played against Germany in the third game, losing 2–0 courtesy of goals from Oliver Bierhoff and Jürgen Klinsmann, finishing third in the group.

Iran finished first in the group stage of the 2000 Asia Cup but lost to South Korea in the quarter-finals. They failed to qualify for World Cup 2002, held in Asia for the first time, after an aggregate defeat to the Republic of Ireland, losing 2–0 in Dublin and winning 1–0 in Tehran. The elimination saw manager Miroslav Blažević step down from the top spot to be replaced by his assistant Branko Ivanković who stepped up from assistant coach.

After qualifying to the Asian Cup 2004, Iran was drawn with Thailand, Oman and Japan in the tournament. Iran finished second in the group. In the quarter-final clash against South Korea, Iran won 4–3. They then lost to host China on penalty kicks, and won against Bahrain 4–2 to finish third place in the tournament.

On 8 June 2005, Iran and Japan became the first countries other than hosts Germany to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.

The Iran-Japan leg of the 2006 World Cup qualifiers in Tehran, played on 24 March 2005, was the highest attended qualifying match among all confederations. The match ended with five fans dead and several others injured as they left the Azadi Stadium at the end of the match.

Iran started their Germany 2006 appearance with a match against North America&#x27;s Mexico in Group D. Being 1–1 at half-time, defensive mistakes led to a Mexican 3–1 win, with goals from Omar Bravo and Sinha. Yahya Golmohammadi scored the only Iranian goal.

Iran played against Portugal in the second game, losing 2–0. The goals were scored by Deco and a penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo. Iran were eliminated from the competition before their third and final game against Angola, a 1–1 draw.

===Temporary suspension===
In November 2006, Iran was suspended by FIFA from all participation in international football on the grounds of governmental interference in the national football association. The ban lasted less than a month and as a dispensation was given to allow the Iran under-23 team to participate in the football competition of the 2006 Asian Games, fixtures were unaffected.

===2007–14===

The IRIFF appointed Amir Ghalenoei as manager of Iran on 17 July 2006 to succeed Branko Ivanković. After finishing first in the 2007 Asian Cup qualifying round two points ahead of South Korea, Iran placed first in the group stage of the final tournament in Malaysia, eventually losing to their qualifying opponents in a penalty shoot-out in the quarterfinals. His contract was not renewed and Team Melli was left with a caretaker manager for several months.

Then-leading international goalscorer Ali Daei was chosen to become the new manager after Spanish coach Javier Clemente had been closer to signing on as Iran&#x27;s national team manager, when talks collapsed when he refused to live full-time in the country. Iran was placed with Kuwait, Syria and United Arab Emirates in the third round of 2010 World Cup qualifying. Ali Daei resigned from his position as the Iranian national coach on 29 March 2009, replaced by Afshin Ghotbi. Iran failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup after finishing fourth overall in its group.

During the final game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against South Korea in Seoul on 17 June 2009, seven members of the team wore green wristbands in support of the Iranian Green Movement during the 2009 Iranian election protests. Initial rumors and false reports were that all seven players were banned for life by the Iranian Football Federation, however, state-run media claimed that all seven had &quot;retired&quot;. On 24 June 2009, FIFA wrote to Iran&#x27;s Football Federation asking for clarification on the situation. The Iranian Football Federation replied that no disciplinary action has been taken against any player.
Iran renewed the contract with Afshin Ghotbi until the end of 2011 AFC Asian Cup and the team qualified to the tournament with 13 points as the group winners.

During the final qualification match against South Korea, several Iranian players started the match wearing green armbands or wristbands, a symbol of protest at the outcome of the Iranian presidential election. Most removed them at half-time. The newspaper &quot;Iran&quot; reported that Ali Karimi, Mehdi Mahdavikia, Hosein Kaebi and Vahid Hashemian had received life bans from the Iranian FA for the gesture. However, the Iranian FA denied this claim in a response to FIFA&#x27;s inquiry saying that &quot;the comments in foreign media are nothing but lies and a mischievous act.&quot; Head coach Afshin Ghotbi also confirmed that it was a rumour and Iranian FA &quot;has not taken any official stand on this issue.&quot;

Afshin Ghotbi qualified Iran for the 2011 Asian Cup and finished second in the West Asian Football Federation Championship 2010 just a few months before the Asian Cup. Iran were able to gain all nine possible points in the group stage of the Asian Cup but after an extra time goal from South Korea, Iran were yet again eliminated from the quarter-finals.

On 4 April 2011, former Real Madrid manager Carlos Queiroz agreed to a two-and-a-half-year deal to coach the Iranian national team until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Under Queiroz, Iran began their World Cup qualification campaign successfully, defeating the Maldives 4–0 in the first leg of their second round of qualifiers. After winning 5–0 on aggregate, Iran advanced to the third round of qualifiers where they were drawn with Indonesia, Qatar and Bahrain.

Iran highlighted their position at the top of their group by defeating Bahrain 6–0 at home in the Azadi Stadium as well as inviting former German youth international Ashkan Dejagah who scored twice on his debut against Qatar. After a 4–1 win at Indonesia, Iran qualified for the final round of direct qualifiers, the fourth round. In the fourth round, Iran played South Korea, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Lebanon in their group. Queiroz made new foreign-based additions to his squad, adding players such as Reza Ghoochannejhad.

Iran started their fourth round of Asian qualifiers with a 1–0 win in Uzbekistan. &quot;Team Melli&quot; then drew Qatar and lost in Lebanon before defeating South Korea at the Azadi on 16 October with a goal from captain Javad Nekounam. After a 1–0 loss in Tehran against Uzbekistan, Iran defeated Qatar 1–0 in Doha and Lebanon 4–0 at home. In their last qualification match, Iran defeated South Korea 1–0 in Ulsan Munsu with a goal from Ghoochannejhad, clinching their ticket to Brazil as group winners with 16 points. Thus, Iran became the third team that Queiroz has managed to qualify for the World Cup, having reached the 2002 edition with South Africa and the 2010 edition with Portugal, leading the latter to a knockout stage finish. Iran continued their winning streak, securing qualification to the 2015 Asian Cup months later as well.

Since Queiroz&#x27;s role as manager of the Iranian national team, he has introduced players from the Iranian diaspora to the national squad. These players include German-Iranians Daniel Davari and Ashkan Dejagah, Dutch-Iranian Reza Ghoochannejhad, Swedish-Iranians Omid Nazari and Saman Ghoddos, and Iranian-American Steven Beitashour among others.

Iran competed in Group F alongside Argentina, Nigeria and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Prior to the tournament, they founded the Central Asian Football Association.

In the opening match of the tournament on 16 June, Iran drew Nigeria 0–0 making it their first clean sheet in the World Cup. In their next match, Iran was defeated by Argentina 1–0 with a late goal from Lionel Messi and received praise after holding Argentina for 90 minutes while creating some attacking opportunities of their own. Iran was eliminated from the tournament in their next game, a 3–1 defeat to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Iran&#x27;s lone goal was scored by Reza Ghoochannejhad. After the tournament, Queiroz declared he would resign as manager of Iran but later switched and extended his contract until the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

===Late 2010s===
Iran qualified for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup as group winners where Team Melli were the highest ranked seed. Iran faced Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE in Group C. With the second highest number of fans in the tournament after hosts Australia, the Iranians defeated Bahrain 2–0 with limited preparations. A defensive-minded Iran then defeated Qatar 1–0 thanks to a Sardar Azmoun goal before defeating UAE by the same scoreline to reach the top of their group. In the quarter-finals Iran faced Iraq who they had beaten weeks prior in a friendly match. Having received a controversial red card in the first half, Iran competed with ten men, managing to score goals late in extra time to draw the match 3–3. In the ensuing penalty shootout, Iran lost 7–6.

Iran began their 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with friendly matches against Chile and Sweden in March 2015. Queiroz resigned from his managerial post thereafter due to disagreements with the Iranian Football Federation. On 14 April 2015, Iran were drawn with Oman, India, Turkmenistan and Guam in the second round of qualifiers. On 26 April, Queiroz announced that he would continue as the manager of Iran for their 2018 World Cup campaign. Iran became the second team to qualify for the 2018 World Cup after a 2–0 win at home over Uzbekistan on 12 June 2017. They also clinched first place in their qualification group after South Korea&#x27;s defeat to Qatar.

Iran won the first match against Morocco after Aziz Bouhaddouz scoring an own goal. They then lost against Spain with a goal scored by Diego Costa, with video assistant referees denying an Iranian equalizer. The third match against Portugal ended in a draw after a penalty scored by Karim Ansarifard and because Morocco could only manage a 2–2 draw to Spain, Iran were eliminated. Iran&#x27;s four points is the most received in any World Cup appearance.


Having qualified for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup earlier, Iran was drawn into group D, where they shared fate with Iraq, Vietnam and Yemen. Iran opened their tournament against Yemen slower and almost conceded a goal but after 10 minutes, Iran regained the ground and proved more dominant in certain aspects, thrashing Yemen 5–0. A 2–0 win over the Vietnamese side gave Iran direct qualification to the knockout stage. Iran ended their group stage with a goalless draw over neighbor Iraq and took first place. After the group stage, Iran encountered Oman, with a defending mistake almost costing Iran&#x27;s chances but Ahmed Mubarak Al-Mahaijri&#x27;s penalty was saved by Alireza Beiranvand. Iran then defeated Oman 2–0 to reach the last eight. In the quarter-finals against a defensive China, Iran outclassed the Chinese 3–0 to meet Japan in the semi-finals. Iran missed the opportunity to reach the final once again when they fell 3–0 with all three goals scored in second half.

===Early 2020s===
Iran was the highest-ranked team to be seeded in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. Iran was drawn into the second round where they would have to deal with two Arab countries, Iraq and Bahrain, along with Cambodia and Hong Kong. Iran, under new Belgian manager Marc Wilmots, began with a 2–0 win over Hong Kong away. After the death of Sahar Khodayari, the 14–0 win over Cambodia allowed select Iranian women to enter the stadium for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Their next away encounters against Bahrain and Iraq went on to be consecutive defeats which Iran lost 0–1 and 1–2, respectively. Following two consecutive draws between Iraq and Bahrain, Iran was left with the possibility of being eliminated from the World Cup outright in the second round, leading to the sacking of Marc Wilmots.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Iran forced the remaining fixtures to be played without spectators in June 2021, forcing Iran to play their remaining games in Bahrain under new coach Dragan Skočić; but with Bahrain losing its home support as an advantage, and Iraq assured a place in the final phase, Iran was able to stage a comeback, occupying first place and, together with Iraq, progressed to the final phase.

Iran became the thirteenth team to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup after a 1–0 win at home over Iraq on 27 January 2022. In March 2022, Iranian women were again banned from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier. Iran&#x27;s World Cup preparation friendly match against Canada at BC Place in June 2022 was cancelled by the Canadian Soccer Association amid opposition and mounting criticism, namely in regards to the Iranian government&#x27;s role in shooting down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752.

By the start of the World Cup in Qatar, Iran was the highest ranked team from Asia. In October 2022, calls were made to ban the Iranian national team from the World Cup for the Iranian government&#x27;s blocking of Iranian women from their stadiums, their supplying of weapons to Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, and the treatment towards protesters during the Mahsa Amini protests. However, Iran started its World Cup campaign with a nightmare, losing 2–6 to England in the opening game as Iran suffered the worst ever loss in its FIFA World Cup history. The Iranian team notably made headlines in their opening match against England after refusing to sing the national anthem in solidarity with the Mahsa Amini protests, with some Iranian supporters cheering against their own team or boycotting their team amidst the ongoing protests as they felt the team was representing the government.

In the following match against Wales, amidst the boos and whistles from some of the Iranian supporters during the playing of the national anthem, the Iranian players were filmed singing the national anthem before defeating Wales 2–0 for their first-ever win over a European nation at the World Cup, with some protestors having their pre-revolutionary Lion and Sun flags and Women, Life, Freedom banners snatched from them by pro-government fans and stadium security at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. Protesters were harassed by government supporters with some protesters being detained by Qatari police, while stadium security confirmed they were given orders to confiscate anything but the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Documents obtained by Iran International showed Iran was coordinating secret efforts with Qatar to control who attends the World Cup and restrict any signs of dissent.

Ahead of Iran&#x27;s final group stage match against the United States, the Iranian players were allegedly called in to a meeting with members of the IRGC and were threatened with violence and torture for their families if they did not sing the national anthem or joined the protests against the Iranian regime. During the match, the Iranian players sang the national anthem again before losing to the United States 1–0 for the first time in their history and thereby being knocked out of the tournament. Some Iranians celebrated the defeat and one Iranian man was killed by security forces in Bandar-e Anzali after honking his car horn in celebration. Another Iranian fan was also arrested by Qatari police after he was wearing a shirt with the Woman, Life, Freedom slogan.

During the World Cup as well as the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, the Iranian government reportedly sent paid members of the Basij and IRGC to cheer for the team in the stands. Iran were eventually knocked out in the semi-final of the Asian Cup by hosts Qatar. After the game, Iranian officials reportedly arrested ten teenagers in the city of Javanrud for celebrating the team&#x27;s elimination from the tournament.

===Nicknames===
The Iranian national team has received several nicknames by supporters and media. The most common one used is &quot;Team Melli&quot; (), meaning &quot;The National Team&quot; in Persian language. Although the Iranian supporters have popularized &quot;Team Melli&quot;, other nicknames for the team include &quot;Persian Stars&quot; (entitled since the World Cup 2006) &quot;Shiran e Iran&quot;, meaning &quot;The Iranian Lions&quot; or &quot;The Lions of Persia&quot;, &quot;Shir Dilan&quot;, &quot;Lion Hearts&quot; and &quot;Princes of Persia&quot; (used since AFC Asian Cup 2011). Iran&#x27;s slogan for the 2014 FIFA World Cup was &quot;Honour of Persia&quot;, selected in an internet poll held by FIFA. A more recently used nickname, due to the presence of the Asiatic cheetah on the 2014 World Cup jersey, is &quot;Youzpalangan&quot; which means &quot;The Cheetahs&quot;. The team mascot &quot;Yupa&quot; is also a cheetah.

===Kits and crests===

Traditionally, Iran national football team&#x27;s home kit is white, and the away kit is red. Sometimes, green shirts with white shorts and red socks are used.

====Kit suppliers====

===Sponsorship===

On 1 February 2014, Iran announced the addition of the endangered Asiatic cheetah on their 2014 FIFA World Cup kits to bring attention to its conservation efforts.

===Rivalries===
Iran and Iraq are neighboring rivals, sharing a history. According to the &quot;Malay Mail&quot;, &quot;Emotions are always high when Iran and Iraq meet on the football pitch&quot;. In the contemporary era, especially during the reign of Saddam Hussein, the two countries had worsened relations and fought the Iran–Iraq War for 8 years. In 2001, for the first time in decades, an Iran-Iraq match was not held at a neutral venue. The rivalry was escalated after Iraq knocked Iran out of the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in controversial circumstances. Iran leads the series with 17 wins, 7 draws and 6 losses.

Iran and Saudi Arabia are ideological rivals. The game was ranked eighth in &quot;Goal.com&#x27;s&quot; 2010 list of &quot;Football&#x27;s 10 Greatest International Rivalries&quot;. and ninth in &quot;Bleacher Report&#x27;s&quot; 2014 list of &quot;International Football&#x27;s 10 Most Politically-Charged Football Rivalries&quot; All of their matches have been competitive; none of them were friendlies. The first match was played on 24 August 1975, with Iran defeating Saudi Arabia 3–0. Iran leads the series with 5 wins, 6 draws and 4 losses.

Outside of the Middle East and Central Asia area, Team Melli has some fierce rivalries with East Asian powerhouses South Korea and Japan. Uniquely, Australia, despite also a major team in Asia, haven&#x27;t met Iran since joining the AFC in 2006.

===Stadiums===
Since 1972, Iran&#x27;s national stadium has been Tehran&#x27;s Azadi Stadium with a nominal capacity of 78,116 spectators. Azadi Stadium is the 28th largest association football stadium in the world, seventh in Asia and first in West Asia. A record was set in Azadi for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Australia with over 128,000 in attendance. Since 1979, the government restricts Iranian women from entering the stadiums. However, FIFA condemned the move and wrote to Iranian Football Federation in June 2019. The federation in their letter gave deadline to uplift the restrictions and let women enter the stadiums. On 25 August 2019, deputy Sports Minister Jamshid Taghizadeh stated: &quot;Women can go to Tehran&#x27;s Azadi stadium to watch the match between Iran&#x27;s national team and Cambodia in October for the Qatar World Cup qualifier.” After the death of Sahar Khodayari, select Iranian women were allowed to attend the match against Cambodia in October 2019. However, in March 2022, Iranian women were again blocked from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier.

From 1942 to 1972, Amjadieh Stadium was Iran&#x27;s national stadium. The other stadiums that Iran has been played international games are Bagh Shomal and Yadegar Emam Stadium (Tabriz), Takhti Stadium (Tehran), Enghelab Stadium (Karaj), Hafezieh Stadium (Shiraz), Takhti Stadium and Imam Reza Stadium (Mashhad).

The Iran National Football Camp is the team&#x27;s training ground.

<text>Alan Cedric Page (born August 7, 1945) is an American former Minnesota Supreme Court judge and professional football player for the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears. He was the NFL&#x27;s MVP in 1971. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018.

Playing college football at the University of Notre Dame, Page gained national recognition as a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) during 15 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears. Following his retirement, he then embarked on a legal career. Page earned a B.A. in political science from the University of Notre Dame in 1967 and a J.D. from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1978. Page served as an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1993 until he reached the court&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 70 in 2015.

Page was the first defensive player in NFL history to win the MVP Award and only Lawrence Taylor has done it since. He is a member of both the College Football Hall of Fame (1993) and the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1988), and is considered one of the greatest defensive linemen ever to play the game.

In 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Page the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life==
Page was born and raised in Canton, Ohio. His parents stressed the importance of education and of doing his best regardless of what others did. His mother died when he was 13. Page said he wanted to become a lawyer when he was a child.

Page graduated from Canton Central Catholic High School in 1963, where he starred in several sports and excelled in football. He worked on a construction team that erected the Pro Football Hall of Fame, laying the groundwork for the building in which he would one day be enshrined.

==College football==
After high school, Page played college football at the University of Notre Dame. As a senior, he led the Fighting Irish to a national championship in 1966, and was a consensus 

Page was presented with one of the 1992 Silver Anniversary Awards (NCAA) for achieving personal distinction since his graduation. In 1993, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was awarded the National Football Foundation Distinguished American Award.

In 1967, Page participated in the East-West Shrine Game and 25 years later received the &quot;Babe Hollingbery&quot; Award for his performance as he was inducted to that game&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Page was named to the Academic All-American Hall of Fame in 2001 and as such received the Dick Enberg Award. Page also won the Walter Camp Alumni of the Year award in 1988.

==Professional football==

Page was a first round selection (15th overall) in the by the Minnesota Vikings, for whom he played for 11 seasons, through 1977. He is one of 11 Vikings to have played in all four Super Bowls (IV, VIII, IX, XI) in which the team appeared. Page joined the Chicago Bears in 1978 and played there for four seasons and amassed an additional 40 sacks.

As a right defensive tackle, Page had an unusual 3-point stance, placing his left rather than his right hand on the ground. During his 15-year career, the Vikings won four conference titles and one league championship. Page was a member of the Vikings&#x27; &quot;Purple People Eaters,&quot; a defensive line adept at sacking or hurrying the quarterback. Page played in 218 consecutive games without an absence (215 consecutive in the starting line-up), during which he recovered 22 fumbles, made 148½ sacks (Vikings-108½, Bears-40), and scored three touchdowns (two on fumble recoveries and one on an interception return). He also recorded three safeties, the second most in NFL history, and blocked 23 kicks. He set a career-high with 18 sacks in 1976 and is unofficially credited with five other seasons of 10 sacks or more.

While in the NFL, Page earned All-Pro honors six times and made second-team all-league three additional times. He was voted to nine consecutive Pro Bowls. He was voted All-Conference 10 times, in 1968 and 1969 as All-Western Conference and in 1970 through 1977 and 1980 as an All-National Football Conference.

In 1971 Page was named both the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year (the first player to be named such) and the AP&#x27;s NFL Most Valuable Player. Page was the first defensive player to be named MVP since the award&#x27;s inception. Only one other defensive player, Lawrence Taylor, has ever received the award. Page was also voted the NEA NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1973. In 2019 Page was chosen as a member of the NFL&#x27;s 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

===NFL player representative===
Page was National Football League Players Association player representative from 1970 to 1974 and in 1976–1977, and a member of the NFLPA Association Executive Committee from 1972 to 1975. He was one of the fifteen plaintiffs in &quot;Mackey v. National Football League&quot; in which Judge Earl R. Larson declared that the Rozelle rule was a violation of antitrust laws on December 30, 1975. He was named to the Vikings&#x27; 40th Anniversary Team in 2000. Along the way, Page was named the Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Week three times: Week 9, 1967; Week 8, 1968; Week 13, 1971. In 1988 Page was further honored by his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 1999, he was ranked number 34 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking Viking player. He received the NFL Alumni Career Achievement Award in 1995 for attaining success in his post-NFL career.

== Post-career ==

===Broadcasting===
After his playing career he dabbled in the media, first as a commentator on Turner Broadcasting System covering the &quot;College Football Game of the Week&quot; series during the Fall of 1982 and then as a commentator on National Public Radio in 1982–1983.

===Legal career===
Long before Page&#x27;s football career came to a close, he was laying the groundwork for his future role as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. While still playing for the Vikings, Page attended the University of Minnesota Law School, from which he received a Juris Doctor in 1978. After graduating, he worked at the Minneapolis law firm Lindquist and Vennum from 1979 to 1984 outside the football season. Page was appointed Special Assistant Attorney General in 1985, and soon thereafter promoted to Assistant Attorney General.

In 1992, Page was elected to an open seat as an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, becoming the first African-American to serve on that court. He was reelected in 1998 (becoming the biggest vote-getter in Minnesota history), again in 2004, and for a final time in 2010: Minnesota has mandatory retirement for judges at the end of the month in which they turn 70.

On January 7, 2009, Page was appointed by Chief Justice Eric Magnuson to select the three-judge panel that heard the election contest brought by Norm Coleman in the 2008 U.S. Senate election.

== Personal life, community work and other activities ==

Alan and Diane Sims Page were married from 1973 until her death in 2018. They met while she was working for General Mills and he was playing for the Minnesota Vikings. Page is a Catholic.

In 1988, the Pages founded the Page Education Foundation. It provides financial and mentoring assistance to students of color in exchange for those students&#x27; commitment to further volunteer service in the community, an idea suggested by their daughter Georgi. The Page Education Foundation has awarded grants to more than 7,500 students, who in turn have given more than 475,000 hours of their time to young children. Upon his retirement from the bench, Page plans to continue the foundation&#x27;s work and find other ways to encourage students of color to be successful in school, especially by developing critical thinking skills.

Page and his daughter Kamie Page have written four children&#x27;s books: &quot;Alan and His Perfectly Pointy Impossibly Perpendicular Pinky&quot; (2013), &quot;The Invisible You&quot; (2014), &quot;Grandpa Alan&#x27;s Sugar Shack&quot; (2017), and &quot;Bee Love (Can Be Hard)&quot; (2020). Proceeds from the sales of these books support the Page Education Foundation. Page is the subject of the authorized biography &quot;All Rise: The Remarkable Journey of Alan Page&quot; (2010).

Page has a passion for running and runs on a regular basis. In 1979, he became the first active NFL player to complete a marathon. His running routine, which he took up while helping his wife quit smoking, is believed to have contributed to his dismissal from the Minnesota Vikings. His running schedule of 35–40 miles per week during the season, and 55 miles per week in the offseason, caused his weight to drop below that dictated by the Vikings.

The Pages, instigated by Diane Page, also created the Diane and Alan Page Collection, an extensive collection of Americana and Jim Crow-related memorabilia. In 2012 Page appeared in a Minnesota-filmed episode of PBS&#x27;s Antiques Roadshow with an 1865 banner commemorating Abraham Lincoln. In 2018 the banner and select items from the Diane and Alan Page Collection were exhibited at the Minneapolis Central Library in an exhibit called &#x27;Testify&#x27;, which coincided with Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis. The Testify exhibit, directed and produced by Georgi Page, returned to the library in 2023 with additional Testify photographic displays appearing throughout the state at various regional libraries.

In June 2017, after a campaign initiated by students at Alexander Ramsey Middle School in Minneapolis, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Justice Page Middle School.

In 2018, Page contributed $1,000 to Democrat Dean Phillips, who beat Republican US Representative Erik Paulsen to win Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District seat.

In November 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Page the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In January 2020, Page and Neel Kashkari proposed amending a portion of the Minnesota State Constitution to read, &quot;All children have a fundamental right to a quality education that fully prepares them with the skills necessary for participation in the economy, our democracy, and society, as measured against uniform achievement standards set forth by the state. It is a paramount duty of the state to ensure quality public schools that fulfill this fundamental right.&quot;

On October 30, 2020, the North St. Paul/Maplewood/Oakdale School District (ISD 622) announced a new elementary school to be built at 2410 Holloway Avenue in Maplewood will be named Justice Alan Page Elementary School, scheduled to open in September 2022.

<doc id="272874" wikidata="Q115347" url="?curid=272874" title="Lex Luger">
<text>Lawrence Wendell Pfohl (born June 2, 1958), better known by the ring name Lex Luger, is an American retired professional wrestler, bodybuilder, and football player. He is best known for his work with Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE).

Luger is a two-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion and one-time WWA World Heavyweight Champion. He is also a five-time NWA/WCW United States Heavyweight Champion who holds the records for consecutive days and total days as champion. He is the second WCW Triple Crown Champion. Although he never won a championship in the WWF, he challenged for every title in the organization, including WWF World Heavyweight Championship matches at SummerSlam in 1993, which he also main evented alongside Yokozuna, and WrestleMania X in 1994. He also was notably the 1994 Royal Rumble co-winner with Bret Hart. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers voted Luger the Most Popular Wrestler of the Year in 1993.

== Football career ==
Luger attended high school and played football in Orchard Park, New York. He then attended Penn State University on a football scholarship, but transferred to the University of Miami after his freshman year when the Penn State coaches thought he should move to linebacker or defensive end. Luger was an avid basketball player in his youth, and though he rarely played soccer, is a fan of English soccer club Manchester United. He eventually decided his skills would be better suited to football. He sat out the 1977 season as a redshirt transfer student in Coral Gables.

In 1978, Luger played for the Miami Hurricanes, which featured future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly, Jim Burt, Mitch Guittar, Fred Marion, and Mark Richt. He was kicked off the team for what Luger referred to as &quot;off-the-field incidents&quot;. On the team&#x27;s road trip to Atlanta to play Georgia Tech, Luger, who was suffering from cabin fever and disappointed at not being named a starter by coach Lou Saban by the 5th game of the season, snapped and trashed his hotel room.

Upon leaving Miami, he played professional football for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League where he played in the 67th Grey Cup against the Edmonton Eskimos. He then signed with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League, but never played in a game and thus is not listed on their all-time roster, though he did spend the entire 1982 season on the team&#x27;s injured reserve list with a groin problem incurred during training camp. He returned to the Packers training camp in 1983, but he was released before the regular season began. Luger wore number 66 for the Packers, the last player to do so before it was retired for Ray Nitschke. Luger said in a 2018 interview with the Green Bay Press-Gazette his wrestling career might have never happened had it worked out with the Packers. &quot;I would have loved to have had a long-term career with the Packers; are you kidding me?&quot; Pfohl said. &quot;If I did, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have become a wrestler. So, in the big picture, it worked out for me in that regard ... Had it worked out in Green Bay, I seriously doubt I would have become a pro wrestler.&quot;

In 1984, Luger finished his football career playing in the United States Football League for the Tampa Bay Bandits, Memphis Showboats and Jacksonville Bulls. He was a teammate of future WCW rival Ron Simmons while playing for the Tampa Bay Bandits.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== NWA Championship Wrestling from Florida (1985–1987) ===
In 1985, Luger walked into the Championship Wrestling From Florida office where he met Hiro Matsuda, who had previously trained Hulk Hogan and &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff. Luger adopted the ring name &quot;Lex Luger&quot;, being a fan of the comic book villain Lex Luthor, which helped cast himself as a typical wrestling heel which he would continue to be throughout most of his early years in wrestling. Luger made his in-ring debut in September 1985. He was featured alongside other notorious heels, Percy Pringle and Rick Rude.

Luger began wrestling for CWF, gaining his first victory on October 31, 1985, against Cocoa Samoa and later won the Southern Heavyweight Championship from Wahoo McDaniel the next month. For a short time, he feuded with Barry Windham before they began teaming up against Sir Oliver Humperdink and his team of Ed &quot;The Bull&quot; Gantner, Kareem Muhammed, and The White Ninja. On September 1, 1986, he fought NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair for the title at a show &quot;Battle of the Belts III&quot;, which resulted in a 60-minute draw. As a result, Flair retained the title. Towards the end of his run in Florida, Luger was involved in angles with Kevin Sullivan and Bad News Allen. He was also in a steel cage match with Bruiser Brody, where Brody stopped cooperating, leading to Luger climbing over the cage and leaving the match.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1987–1992) ===
==== The Four Horsemen (1987–1989) ====
In 1987, Luger went to work for Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which was under the NWA banner, with the nickname &quot;The Total Package&quot; and began using &quot;The Human Torture Rack&quot;, an Argentine backbreaker rack, as his finisher. He was first booked as an associate to Ric Flair&#x27;s &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; stable until Ole Anderson was kicked out and he became an official member of the group. His first big feud was with Nikita Koloff, whom he defeated for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship on July 11, 1987. Manager J. J. Dillon threw a chair over the top of the cage while the referee, Earl Hebner, was down. Luger knocked Koloff unconscious with it and then lifted up Koloff in the Torture Rack. A revived Hebner then dropped Koloff&#x27;s arm three times with no response and awarded Luger a submission victory.

It was during this time that the Horsemen debuted the WarGames match.

He held the title until JCP&#x27;s first pay-per-view event Starrcade in November, when he dropped it to Dusty Rhodes in a steel cage. This loss set the stage for Luger leaving the Four Horsemen, as manager Dillon&#x27;s interference cost Luger the match. A steel chair thrown in by Dillon was dropped by Luger and Rhodes DDT&#x27;d Luger on it prior to pinning him for the win. Luger left the Four Horsemen on December 2, 1987, at the Knight Centre in Miami, Florida, after he and his stablemates (Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, and Dillon) were the sole wrestlers left in a Bunkhouse Stampede battle royal and Dillon asked the other wrestlers to eliminate themselves so he could win. Although Blanchard and Anderson complied, Luger refused and eliminated Dillon, leaving the Horsemen in the process.

Luger then befriended Barry Windham, his former Florida ally, and together they formed a tag team, dubbed The Twin Towers. Their first match as a team was on February 3, 1988, at a TV taping at WTBS Studios in Atlanta. On March 27, 1988, at &quot;Clash of the Champions I&quot; they defeated Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Only a few weeks after the title win, Windham suddenly turned on Luger during a title defense (against Blanchard and Anderson, who regained the title as a result) and joining Luger&#x27;s former stable, The Four Horsemen. Days later, the Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament was held with its first night in Greenville, South Carolina. A partner-less Luger was teamed with Sting (whose partner Ronnie Garvin had been kayfabe injured) and the impromptu team won the entire tournament, defeating Blanchard and Anderson in the finals.
Luger continued his feud with the Four Horsemen and Windham. At the June 8 &quot;Clash of the Champions II: Miami Mayhem&quot;, it was announced that Luger would challenge Horsemen leader Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at The Great American Bash on July 10 in Baltimore. As Luger arrived at &quot;The Clash&quot; in a limousine he was attacked by The Four Horsemen, leaving him (kayfabe) injured and bleeding in the parking lot on live television. While Luger had Flair in the &quot;Torture Rack&quot; and Flair was about to submit, the match was abruptly stopped by the referee who cited (kayfabe) &quot;Maryland State Athletic Commission&quot; rules about a cut that had opened up on Luger&#x27;s forehead &quot;bleeding excessively&quot;. In November 1988, Jim Crockett Jr. sold JCP to Turner Broadcasting System, ultimately the promotion was renamed to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The feud with Flair came to an end after December&#x27;s Starrcade 1988: True Gritt where Flair pinned Luger in a rematch main event for the NWA title by illegally using the ropes.

==== United States Heavyweight Champion (1989–1990) ====
He was then matched up against old foe Barry Windham at Chi-Town Rumble winning his second NWA United States Heavyweight Championship from him. He teamed up with Michael P.S. Hayes against Barry and Kendall Windham in a match, televised on March 18, 1989, which saw Hayes turn on Luger, setting himself as a contender to the U.S. Title. Hayes defeated Luger for the US title at WrestleWar 1989: Music City Showdown when a surprise appearance by Hayes&#x27;s ex-Freebird teammate Terry Gordy helped cost Luger the match. Luger regained the U.S. Title from Hayes in a rematch a couple of weeks later when he broke the rules by pulling Hayes&#x27;s tights while pinning Hayes to win the match. On the June 14 &quot;Clash of the Champions VII: Guts and Glory&quot;, Luger attacked the popular Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat after Steamboat had defeated Terry Funk by disqualification. Luger and Steamboat faced each other at The Great American Bash in July with Luger winning by disqualification after Luger refused to wrestle Steamboat until the match&#x27;s no-disqualification clause had been waived.

Flyin&#x27; Brian Pillman challenged Luger at Halloween Havoc 1989: Settling the Score for the US Title, which Luger won. He also defeated Pillman in a rematch on the November 15 &quot;Clash of the Champions IX: New York Knockout&quot; to retain the title and end the feud. After the main event of the card, which saw Ric Flair and Terry Funk in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match, Luger made a surprise run in, attacking both Flair and Sting, who had come out to save Flair from a post match attack by The Great Muta. December&#x27;s Starrcade featured an &quot;Ironman&quot; tournament between Flair, Sting, Luger, and Muta.

Though Sting eventually won the tournament, Luger was the only participant to go undefeated (Sting got pinfall victories over Muta and Flair, giving him the most points to win the tournament). This elevated Sting to the status of No. 1 contender for Flair&#x27;s world title. With Sting and Flair set to square off at WrestleWar in February, Luger was booked to defend the U.S. Title against &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams on the card. A legitimate injury to Sting, however, caused the entire booking of the card to get changed. Luger was elevated to face Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. An injured Sting appeared in Luger&#x27;s corner during the match, eventually being attacked by Ole and Arn Anderson. When Luger left the ring to help Sting he was counted out, giving the match to Flair. The idea here was to build Luger up as a &quot;changed man&quot; who had &quot;gained self-respect&quot; by saving Sting. In the final match of the feud, a few months later at the Capital Combat event in Washington, D.C., Luger won by disqualification against Flair in a steel cage match when the cage rose up from the ground and outside interference marred the match.

Luger eventually dropped the title to Stan Hansen at Halloween Havoc, though he won it back at Starrcade 1990: Collision Course beginning his fourth NWA United States Heavyweight Championship reign. Luger&#x27;s third title reign lasted a total of 523 days, making him the longest reigning United States Champion in history. During this reign, WCW rebranded the championships they owned and controlled, and the title was renamed the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Luger started a feud with Dan Spivey, whom he defeated at WrestleWar to retain the U.S. Title. Following their match, Nikita Koloff was due to present a new championship belt to Luger, but during the ceremony he suddenly attacked the champion, reigniting their feud from 1987. It did not last long, however, as Koloff found himself being pushed into an angle with Sting instead of Luger, which began at SuperBrawl I: Return of the Rising Sun when Sting and Luger challenged The Steiner Brothers for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. During the match, Koloff interfered and hit Sting with a chain, which was intended for Luger.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (1991–1992) ====
Luger again began to challenge Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship after becoming No.1 contender by defeating The Great Muta on the June 14, 1991 &quot;Clash of the Champions XV: Knocksville USA&quot;. Luger&#x27;s title match against Flair was set to be contested at The Great American Bash in a steel cage match with the added stipulation that, should Flair get disqualified he would lose the title. The match never occurred, however, as Flair began to have disagreements with Jim Herd, the head of WCW, over his future and salary. He eventually quit the company (being &quot;stripped&quot; of the title in the process) and took the world title belt with him.

With the WCW World Heavyweight Championship now vacant, Barry Windham was declared the No. 2 contender and was set to face Luger in the cage match at The Great American Bash. During the match, Harley Race and Mr. Hughes came to ringside. While Hughes kept Windham&#x27;s attention, Race told Luger that &quot;now is the time&quot; to perform a piledriver on the distracted Windham. Luger did so and won the match, thereby winning his first WCW World Heavyweight Championship. As Flair still had the original championship belt and the new belt was not ready in time, Luger initially wore the NWA Western States Heritage Championship, which had been altered to resemble the world title.

After Luger won the world title, his first major challenge came from Ron Simmons. At a signing ceremony for their title match at Halloween Havoc in a two out of three falls match, there was a controversial angle where Luger invited Simmons, once his challenge had been turned back, to join his entourage, but as a chauffeur. Luger went on to retain the championship in the match by two falls to one. Eventually, Luger began to have his own issues with WCW, and the contract he had seemed to have him wrestling less and less while still collecting money. After ending his feud with Simmons, Luger had a brief feud with Rick Steiner, defeating him on the November 19 &quot;Clash of the Champions XVII&quot;. Luger&#x27;s contract only required him to work a specific number of dates, and having fulfilled them he &quot;sat out&quot; the end of 1991 and beginning of 1992. Aside from one title defense against Masahiro Chono at WCW/New Japan Supershow II (Starrcade in Tokyo Dome), Luger did not wrestle a match until SuperBrawl II, where he lost his WCW title to Sting.

=== World Bodybuilding Federation (1992) ===
After losing to Sting at SuperBrawl, Luger negotiated a departure from WCW and joined Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Bodybuilding Federation (WBF), appearing regularly as a co-host on its Saturday morning program, &quot;WBF BodyStars&quot;. He also made an appearance at WrestleMania VIII, taking part in an on-air interview with Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan and Gorilla Monsoon. Heenan and Luger formed an alliance in the WBF (similar to Heenan&#x27;s alliance with Ric Flair in the WWF). He was slated to guest pose at a WBF pay-per-view event, but was injured in a motorcycle accident. By the time he recovered, the WBF was out of business.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1993–1995) ===
==== The Narcissist (1993) ====
After his accident and the closure of the WBF, Luger joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan unveiled him with the persona of &quot;Narcissus&quot; at Royal Rumble 1993. Shortly thereafter, his name was altered slightly to &quot;The Narcissist&quot;. Luger posed before full-length mirrors before every match. In his debut, he defeated jobber Larry Lunden on January 25 on &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; (aired February 13). The WWF also incorporated his motorcycle accident into his gimmick, capitalizing on the fact that he had a &quot;metal plate&quot; inserted into his forearm which was said to cause more damage when it struck an opponent, often allowing Luger to pin them with only his little finger placed on their chest. This caused a number of his opponents to demand that he wear a cover over it during matches when he had a streak of knocking people out. This eventually led to WWF officials demanding that Luger wear an elbow pad, though he would often remove it. The Narcissist&#x27;s one major feud was with Mr. Perfect. The feud was based on Heenan, his advisor, referring to him as being &quot;Beyond Perfection&quot;, in a slight at Mr. Perfect, his former managerial client. The rivalry ended at WrestleMania IX when Luger defeated Perfect and then after the match Perfect ran backstage and then was attacked by Luger and Shawn Michaels outside a storage garage.

==== The All-American (1993–1994) ====

In mid-1993, after Hulk Hogan&#x27;s departure from the company, Luger was transformed into a fan-favorite character with the nicknames &quot;Made in the USA&quot; and &quot;The All-American&quot; also &quot;American Original&quot;. On July 4, he took part in an event where he arrived by helicopter on the deck of the &quot;USS Intrepid&quot; and body slammed the near 600 pound (270 kg) WWF World Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna after a number of WWF wrestlers as well as other athletes from the NBA and NFL attempted and failed. Following this, he began the &quot;Lex Express&quot; tour, traveling the country in a red, white, and blue painted bus to greet fans in preparation for his shot at the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993. The match had the stipulation that this would be Luger&#x27;s only shot at the title. Luger, with the use of the metal plate in his forearm, eventually won the match by knocking out Yokozuna, who failed to return to the ring by the count of 10. As WWF titles could only change hands by submission or pinning, Yokozuna kept the belt. According to Bruce Prichard, Vince McMahon didn&#x27;t give the title to Luger despite his push because Luger wasn&#x27;t getting over with audiences as expected.

In late 1993, Luger began a feud with Ludvig Borga, another anti-American foreigner from Finland. At Survivor Series 1993, Luger captained a team dubbed &quot;All-Americans&quot; (Luger, The Undertaker, and The Steiner Brothers) against Yokozuna&#x27;s team &quot;Foreign Fanatics&quot; (Crush, Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, and Quebecer Jacques) in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match. Luger&#x27;s team won the match after he pinned Borga. At the Royal Rumble, Luger participated in the Royal Rumble match where he and Bret Hart were declared co-winners after both men went over the top rope and had their feet hit the ground simultaneously. As such, both received shots at the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his title match against Yokozuna, becoming the first man to win the Rumble but not win their title match, and later that night Hart won the title from Yokozuna. After WrestleMania X, Luger was to start another feud with Mr. Perfect, but Hennig was injured, so Luger instead feuded with Crush.

Luger then began feuding with his friend Tatanka due to a lack of trust between them, and a match between the two took place at SummerSlam. At the event, Tatanka defeated Luger and joined Ted DiBiase&#x27;s Million Dollar Corporation. At Survivor Series, he was in a Survivor Series team &quot;Guts &amp; Glory&quot; (himself, Mabel, Adam Bomb, and The Smoking Gunns) losing to the Corporate team of Tatanka, King Kong Bundy, Bam Bam Bigelow, and The Heavenly Bodies – with only King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow surviving.

==== Allied Powers (1995) ====
In the beginning of 1995, Luger took part in Royal Rumble 1995 main event. He eliminated Mabel, Bob Backlund, Mantaur, and Henry Godwinn and became one of the final four remaining participants in the contest. However, he was pushed out of the ring by Shawn Michaels from behind while attacking Crush.

Luger then formed a tag team with British Bulldog dubbed the Allied Powers. They made their pay-per-view debut as a tag team at WrestleMania XI, defeating the Blu Brothers. They defeated jobbers on &quot;Raw&quot; and, after a victory over Men on a Mission (King Mabel and Sir Mo) in June 1995, earned a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship against Owen Hart and Yokozuna at In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks, but failed to win the titles. Shortly after SummerSlam, Luger, whose contract had expired, left the WWF without letting McMahon know beforehand. Luger&#x27;s last official WWF match was on September 3 in Saint John, New Brunswick, at a house show teaming with Shawn Michaels defeating Owen Hart and Yokozuna by disqualification.

=== Return to WCW (1995–2001) ===
==== Alliance to End Hulkamania (1995–1996) ====

In late August 1995, after expressing to Sting that he wanted to leave the WWF, Luger got a call from WCW Vice-President Eric Bischoff to set up a meeting about a contract and Luger possibly &quot;jumping ship&quot;. Bischoff was initially reluctant to make the offer, as he did not care for Luger personally or professionally, but relented due to both Sting&#x27;s urging, and the idea that his appearance would make a big splash. Bischoff offered Luger only $150,000 a year, 20% of what he was making when he left WCW three years earlier, in a deliberate attempt to have him turn down the offer (and, according to Bischoff, &quot;at least tell Sting that I tried&quot;), only to be surprised to see that Luger accepted the offer. Luger himself would later state that he had planned on re-signing with the WWF on a two to three-year extension but saw it as an opportunity to prove doubters wrong about his ability to be a top star.

Eight days after his appearance at SummerSlam and only one night after competing at a WWF house show in Saint John, New Brunswick, Luger made his return to WCW on the premiere of &quot;Nitro&quot;, coming out during the match for the United States Heavyweight Championship between champion Sting and Ric Flair. After Luger&#x27;s return, he did not make his allegiances known acting as a tweener, except for that he still did have a long-time friendship with Sting. He merely claimed that he wanted to stake his claim at Hogan&#x27;s WCW World Heavyweight Title, facing him on the September 11, 1995, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, which Hogan won by disqualification. At Halloween Havoc, Luger attacked Hogan after his match with The Giant and joined Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s Dungeon of Doom stable.

At Starrcade, Luger participated in a WCW vs NJPW World Cup of Wrestling where he represented WCW in a winning effort against NJPW representative Masa Chono. Later that night, he participated in a triangle match with Sting and Ric Flair, with the winner to face Randy Savage for the WCW World Championship; Flair won after both Sting and Luger were counted out. The two men teamed up to defeat Harlem Heat for their first World Tag Team Championship on the January 22, 1996, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, with Luger constantly threatening dissent due to his allegiance to the Dungeon of Doom, but always seeming to stay on the same path as his friend. He lost to Eddie Guerrero by disqualification on the February 3 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Luger also defeated Johnny B. Badd for the WCW World Television Championship on February 17, losing it back to him the next night. He regained the television title from Badd by beating him on March 6.

The Dungeon of Doom aligned with the Four Horsemen to form the Alliance to End Hulkamania, which feuded with Hulk Hogan and Luger&#x27;s former WWF ally, Randy Savage. At Uncensored, nine members from the Alliance participated in a &quot;Tower of Doom Steel Cage match&quot;, but were unsuccessful in defeating the team of Hogan and Savage. Luger was blamed for the loss because he accidentally punched teammate Ric Flair and was kicked out of the stable.

==== Feud with the New World Order (1996–1999) ====

During the summer, Luger began a feud with The Giant for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, unsuccessfully challenging him at The Great American Bash. During this time, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, both former WWF superstars, began appearing on WCW television and claimed they were &quot;taking over&quot; the company. Randy Savage spearheaded the WCW wrestlers against them, with Luger and Sting by his side. Luger, along with Savage and Sting, took on Nash and Hall (who called themselves The Outsiders) and a third, mystery, partner that they claimed was an &quot;insider&quot; at Bash at the Beach. In the first few minutes of the match, Luger went down to a kayfabe injury, leaving Sting and Savage on their own when the mystery partner revealed himself to be Hulk Hogan. With Luger no longer around, Savage and Sting were &quot;easy prey&quot; for the three who announced themselves as the New World Order (nWo).

Luger continued to be one of the leaders for the WCW&#x27;s siege against the nWo, wrestling and feuding with a number of their members. At SuperBrawl VII, Luger and The Giant defeated the Outsiders to win the World Tag Team Championship. The title was returned to the Outsiders by nWo member and WCW President Eric Bischoff. Luger won a Four Corners match to become the No.1 contender for Hogan&#x27;s WCW Title at Spring Stampede, and teamed with his new ally, The Giant, to defeat Hogan and basketball star Dennis Rodman at Bash at the Beach. On the August 4, 1997, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Luger defeated Hogan to win his second World Heavyweight Championship in an impromptu match, before dropping the title back to Hogan just five days later at Road Wild. His victory, however, marked the first time in a year that WCW had &quot;won their world title back&quot; from the nWo.

Luger began a program with Hall after both men pinned each other in tag team matches (Luger&#x27;s partner was Diamond Dallas Page and Hall&#x27;s partner was Randy Savage) before facing each other in a 1-on-1 match at Halloween Havoc which Luger won. He had a short feud with Buff Bagwell in the fall of 1997, culminating in a match at Starrcade, which Bagwell won. In the first half of 1998, Luger feuded with Savage and defeated him at Souled Out and SuperBrawl VIII. His final feud with the nWo was against Scott Steiner, whom Luger defeated at Uncensored. At Spring Stampede, he teamed with Scott&#x27;s brother and former tag team partner Rick to defeat Scott and Bagwell.
After a long war with the nWo, Luger joined nWo Wolfpac on May 25, 1998. Luger played a central role in the group&#x27;s war with Hogan&#x27;s nWo Hollywood, and even convinced the long-standing anti-nWo Sting to join. On the August 10, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he defeated Bret Hart to win his record-tying fifth, and final, United States Heavyweight Championship in an impromptu title match, before dropping the title back to Hart just one day later on &quot;Thunder&quot;. He also took part in the incident in which both nWo factions united against the dominant Bill Goldberg in early 1999. He remained a member of the new nWo until he was sidelined with a (legitimate) biceps injury.

==== The Total Package and Totally Buff (1999–2001) ====
In August 1999, Luger returned to &quot;Nitro&quot; during a Sting/Hogan angle for the World Heavyweight Championship. He eventually helped Sting win the World Title at Fall Brawl in September 1999. After Fall Brawl, Luger claimed that Lex Luger was now &quot;dead&quot; and he was going by the name &quot;The Total Package&quot;. He debuted this gimmick on the September 27, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; with a Terminator-style entrance symbolizing his &quot;rebirth&quot; and by bringing back Miss Elizabeth as his manager. During late November and into December 1999, The Total Package began to have some disagreements with Sting. He also began treating Elizabeth badly that prompted Sting to intervene. At Starrcade in December 1999, Sting and The Total Package had a match with Elizabeth eventually turning on Sting.

Luger continued his Total Package angle with Elizabeth through January 2000. He began a storyline where he would break the arms of his opponents by placing the arm inside a closed steel chair and stomping on it. In February 2000, he formed an alliance with Ric Flair to take out Hulk Hogan. They later formed a tag team under the name Team Package. The team feuded with Sting and Hogan until April 2000 when Vince Russo formed the New Blood causing Luger to join the Millionaires Club. He faced Booker T on the November 20, 2000, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and Goldberg at Mayhem and again at Starrcade 2000 with Goldberg&#x27;s career on the line. He also formed a tag team with Buff Bagwell named &quot;Totally Buff&quot;. They defeated Goldberg and DeWayne Bruce in a tag team match at Sin in January 2001. Luger stayed with the team until the WWF purchased WCW in March 2001. After WCW closed down, Bagwell went to the WWF although the company was not interested in Luger. He took a hiatus from wrestling.

=== World Wrestling All-Stars (2002) ===
In November 2002, Luger returned to wrestling for the first time since the closure of WCW. He joined the European tour of World Wrestling All-Stars and debuted in Dublin, Ireland, teaming with Sting to defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At Retribution, Luger defeated Sting to win the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship after Jeff Jarrett interfered on his behalf. In Manchester, England on December 7, Luger and Sting faced Bagwell and Jarrett in a match in which both Luger&#x27;s WWA World Heavyweight Championship and Jarrett&#x27;s NWA World Heavyweight Championship were on the line, though neither title changed hands, as Sting pinned Bagwell. Luger made his final appearance with WWA on December 13, in Zürich, Switzerland, when he lost the WWA World Heavyweight Championship to Sting in a three-way dance that also featured Malice.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2004, 2006, 2012) ===
In late 2003, Luger began working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA); he teamed with TNA co-founder Jeff Jarrett on November 12 in a loss to A.J. Styles and Sting. He returned on February 25, 2004, putting AJ Styles through a table during a tables match against Abyss.

Luger returned to TNA in 2006, first appearing during the April 27 &quot;Impact!&quot; as the second of Sting&#x27;s potential tag team partners for Sacrifice. Throughout September and October, he appeared on &quot;Impact!&quot; as one of the people (along with Buff Bagwell) helping Sting to &quot;prepare&quot; for his upcoming match against Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory.

On October 13, 2012, Luger inducted Sting to the TNA Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in Phoenix, Arizona, prior to the Bound for Glory pay-per-view.

=== Later career (2003–2007) ===
Throughout 2004 and 2005, Luger made sporadic appearances on the independent circuit. Luger&#x27;s final match took place on August 26, 2006, in the main event of a United Wrestling Federation event in Oklahoma, in which Luger teamed with Buff Bagwell to defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner. On September 22, 2007, Luger was inducted into the XWF (later Legend&#x27;s Pro Wrestling)&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

=== Return to WWE (2011–present) ===
In 2011, Luger began working again with WWE on their Wellness Policy. In regards to this role he stated:

On March 3, 2024, Luger was in attendance for Sting&#x27;s retirement match at &quot;AEW&#x27;s&quot; Revolution alongside Magnum T.A., Scotty Riggs, and Nikita Koloff, however was not shown or acknowledged during the broadcast.

==Personal life==
Luger is of German and Scottish heritage. Luger is divorced from Peggy and has two children, a son, Brian (born January 1, 1986), and a daughter, Lauren Ashley (born September 24, 1990). His then family was featured in a 30 second video clip shown at the beginning of Survivor Series 1993. Luger is a reformed Christian, even after his below noted matters (which mention alcohol use and drug use). Luger is a fan of Scottish football club Rangers F.C and also English football club Manchester United F.C..

=== Legal problems ===
On April 19, 2003, Luger was involved in a domestic dispute with Miss Elizabeth (Elizabeth Hulette), then his live-in girlfriend, in the garage of their townhouse in Marietta, Georgia, during which Luger allegedly struck her. Cobb County police found Hulette with two bruised eyes, a bump on her head, and a cut lip. Luger was charged with a misdemeanor count of battery and released on $2,500 bond. Two days later on April 21, Luger was arrested for driving under the influence after rear-ending another car. According to the police report, Luger had slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, and could not locate his driver&#x27;s license. Hulette was a passenger in the vehicle and was sent home in a taxi. Luger was also driving with a suspended license for not appearing in court on March 5, 2003, for a hearing on a previous offense of driving with expired tags and having no proof of insurance.

On May 1, 2003, Hulette died in the Marietta townhouse she shared with Luger after mixing pills of hydrocodone and Alprazolam (Xanax) with vodka. Luger was arrested after a search of the residence revealed a number of illicit controlled substances, including anabolic steroids, oxycodone, synthetic growth hormone, testosterone, and alprazolam. He was charged with 13 felony counts of drug possession. He was released the following day on $27,500 bail. Hulette&#x27;s death was eventually ruled accidental. Luger pleaded guilty to the charges and was fined $1,000, sentenced to five years probation, and ordered to undergo periodic drug tests.

In December 2005, Luger and fellow wrestlers Scott Steiner and Buff Bagwell were removed from a flight to Winnipeg, Manitoba, after committing acts of disturbance on board the plane, and were detained for several hours. Although Steiner and Bagwell were freed to resume their trip, Luger was charged with violating his probation by failing to obtain permission to leave the country. Luger was initially detained in the Hennepin County jail. He was tried in Georgia and sentenced to four months in Cobb County Jail, with a one-month credit for time served.

=== Spinal infarction ===
On October 19, 2007, Luger suffered a nerve impingement in his neck that led to temporary paralysis. In an unconfirmed report it was stated that he underwent an intravenous antibiotic treatment and was expected to make a full recovery, though that was never an official prognosis. Nearly a month after his spinal stroke, Luger was still in a quadriplegic state, having no movement in either his arms or legs. In June 2008, Luger was said to be able to stand on his own for short periods and walk using a walker. In 2010, Luger stated in an interview that he was able to walk more comfortably, and was now able to drive. By 2014, Luger was using a wheelchair on a regular basis, though he was still able to walk short distances, and by 2021 became completely reliant on a wheelchair for mobility. However, by February 2025, after working with longtime friend Dallas Page in yoga rehabilitation, Luger was again able to stand from his wheelchair on his own.

== Other media ==
On September 28, 2006, Luger appeared on &quot;Praise the Lord&quot;, the flagship talk program of the Trinity Broadcasting Network and declared himself a born-again Christian. In an interview conducted by guest host, one-time wrestling tag-team partner, and longtime friend Sting, Luger emotionally discussed the downward turn of his career and personal life—including the events surrounding Miss Elizabeth&#x27;s death—and how it led to his Christian conversion. Luger credits Steve Baskin, the pastor of Western Hills Baptist Church in Kennesaw, Georgia, with pulling him from a terminal tailspin. The jail chaplain met Luger in early 2006.

In 1990, Luger was a featured guest-star in Season 3 of the &quot;Superboy&quot; series in the episode &quot;Mindscape&quot;.

On November 20, 2012, Luger appeared on season 6, episode 15 of &quot;Hardcore Pawn&quot;, selling his ring robe for $3500 to Les Gold with the cash going to a charity. The Robe was later purchased by super fan Dave &quot;Super Dave&quot; Plaza.

On August 13, 2013, Luger&#x27;s memoir &quot;Wrestling with the Devil: The True Story of a World Champion Professional Wrestler – His Reign, Ruin, and Redemption&quot;, was released with the foreword written by Sting.

On August 7, 2022, Luger was the subject of an episode of &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="272882" wikidata="Q1755089" url="?curid=272882" title="Qualitative marketing research">
<text>Qualitative marketing research involves a natural or observational examination of the philosophies that govern consumer behavior. The direction and framework of the research is often revised as new information is gained, allowing the researcher to evaluate issues and subjects in an in-depth manner. The quality of the research produced is heavily dependent on the skills of the researcher and is influenced by researcher bias.

== Data collection ==
Qualitative marketing researchers collect data ranging from focus group, case study, participation observation, innovation game and in-depth interviews.

=== Focus group ===
The focus group is marketing research technique for qualitative data that involves a small group of people (6–10) that share a common set characteristics (demographics, attitudes, etc.) and participate in a discussion of predetermined topics led by a moderator. There are opportunities to conduct focus groups with the use of focus group software. There are many types of focus group as well, but they always involve discussion among the group(s). The problem of the focus group is the issue of observer dependency: the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his own reading of the group&#x27;s discussion, raising questions of validity. Non-verbal cues, which may contradict the views participants articulate, are important and can easily be missed if the researcher is not familiar with visual cues, body language and other non verbal cues. In cross-cultural focus groups, researchers must take into account cultural norms of communication and interaction patterns.

=== Qualitative case study ===
Qualitative case study methodology provides tools for researchers to study complex phenomena within their contexts. Because it only studies one case, so it is very up-close, in-depth. It contains high levels of internal validity (the extent to which one is able to say that no other variables except the one being studied caused the result), but the external validity is low. Customer behaviour is a good example for qualitative market research.

=== Participation observation ===
Participation observation is watching participants&#x27; behavior in real world settings without trying to manipulate their actions. This method is high in external validity but low in internal validity.

=== Innovation game ===
Innovation game refers to a form of primary market research developed by Luke Hohmann where customers play a set of directed games as a means of generating feedback about a product or service. A facilitator explains the game(s) to be played and controls the paces, monitors the participants&#x27; levels and manages the time. There are many types of innovation games, such as 20/20 vision, me and my shadow, and buy a feature.

=== In-depth interviews ===
In-depth interviews, also called IDIs, have been an integral component of market research since its inception in the 1920s. This method is useful when you want detailed information about a person&#x27;s thoughts and behaviors or want to explore new issues in depth. One can get unique points from each respondent, and their answers will not be influenced by other people as in a focus group. In-depth interviews are typically held one-on-one between the respondent and the interview via a telephone, conducted in person, by email, or through an online platform (increasingly common). 

The primary advantage of in-depth interviews is the amount of detailed information provided as compared to other data collection methods, such as surveys. Another advantage is reaching respondents that are geographically dispersed, which cannot occur in a focus group. This method is often used to refine future research or provide context to future studies. The primary disadvantage of in-depth interviews is the time to conduct, transcribe, and analyze. As such, this method could have higher costs associated with it than other methods.

== Uses ==
Qualitative market research is often part of survey methodology, including telephone surveys and consumer satisfaction surveys. We apply the qualitative market research when:
* New product idea generation and development
* Investigating current or potential product/service/brand positioning and marketing strategy
* Strengths and weaknesses of products/brands
* Understanding dynamics of purchase decision dynamics
* Studying reactions to advertising and public relations campaigns, other marketing communications, graphic identity/branding, package design, etc.
* Exploring market segments, such as demographic and customer groups
* Assessing the usability of websites or other interactive products or services
* Understanding perceptions of a company, brand, category and product
* Mitigating implicit and unconscious bias in market research surveys

== Differences between consumer and B2B qualitative research ==
Qualitative research is used in both consumer research and business-to-business (B2B) research. However, qualitative research methods are used depending on whether consumers or business decision-makers are being inter-viewed. In consumer research, a range of qualitative methods are used, particularly in-depth interviews, focus groups and ethnographic observation.
In B2B research, focus groups and ethnographic observation are used far less frequently due to the nature of business decision-makers, and in-depth interviews are most frequently used in B2B research:
* Time-poor business decision-makers often don&#x27;t have time to attend in-person focus groups, or for observation techniques that require a lot of time to set-up.
* Many B2B decision-makers work within offices that have strict security/privacy regulations. Also, many are par-ticipating in the research in their own time, and don&#x27;t necessarily want colleagues to know they are taking part in the study. As a result, face-to-face techniques which require interviewers to attend their offices (e.g., face-to-face interviews or observation) are often not realistic.
* The target audience for a study is often small and spread across multiple locations – getting respondents in one place for a face-to-face focus group can often be unrealistic.
* Decision-makers can often be unwilling to share confidential information in front of potential competitors, so group activities that require multiple people from the same sector don&#x27;t work.

== Typical general procedure ==
# Setting the question
# Deciding the objectives
# Planning research design
# Select data collection techniques
# Sample design
# Data collection
# Analysis
# Do the report

== Advantages ==
* More detailed and in-depth questions
* Reduced cost, since the scale of this kind of research is small
* Discovering the &quot;why&quot; behind certain behaviors
* Quick turnaround: the direction of the research can be changed easily

== Disadvantages ==
* Issues on confidentiality and anonymity can pose problems during presentation of findings.
* If researcher does not have enough skills such as communication skill, the quality of research is likely to be low.
* The sample size is relatively small, the result may not be very accurate.
* Qualitative research produces large amounts of data which requires a tremendous amount of work and labor on the part of the researcher.

== Vs. quantitative marketing research ==

=== Objective ===
Qualitative research is usually aimed to have an inside look about opinions or motivations, while quantitative research uses data to simplify the result.

=== Sample ===
Qualitative research usually has a smaller sample size than quantitative research due to the complexity of its data.

=== Data collection ===
Qualitative research usually uses unstructured or semi-structured techniques to collect data, e.g. in-depth interviews or group discussions, while quantitative research only uses structured techniques such as online questionnaires, on-street or telephone interviews.

=== Outcome ===
The outcomes of qualitative marketing research are usually not conclusive and cannot be used to make generalizations about the population of interest, instead developing an initial understanding and sound base for further decision making. The findings of quantitative marketing research are conclusive and usually descriptive in nature.

== Data analysis ==

=== Coding ===
Coding is an interpretive technique that both organizes the data and provides a means to introduce the interpretations of it into certain quantitative methods.

=== Cross tabulation ===
Cross tabulation divides raw data into subgroups, showing how each dependent variable changes when represented in each subgroup. This is typically the most used data analysis tool due to its ability to clarify how data variables relate to each other.

<doc id="272884" wikidata="Q294826" url="?curid=272884" title="Umberto Giordano">
<text>Umberto Menotti Maria Giordano (28 August 186712 November 1948) was an Italian composer, mainly of operas. His best-known work in that genre was Andrea Chénier (1896).

He was born in Foggia in Apulia, southern Italy, and studied under Paolo Serrao at the Conservatoire of Naples. His first opera, &quot;Marina&quot;, was written for a competition promoted by the music publishers Casa Sonzogno for the best one-act opera, remembered today because it marked the beginning of Italian &quot;verismo&quot;. The winner was Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. Giordano, the youngest contestant, was placed sixth among seventy-three entries with his &quot;Marina&quot;, a work which generated enough interest for Sonzogno to commission the staging of an opera based on it in the 1891–92 season.

The result was &quot;Mala vita&quot;, a gritty &quot;verismo&quot; opera about a labourer who vows to reform a prostitute if he is cured of his tuberculosis. This work caused something of a scandal when performed at the Teatro Argentina, Rome, in February 1892. It played successfully in Vienna, Prague and Berlin and was re-written as &quot;Il Voto&quot; a few years later, in an attempt to raise interest in the work again.

Giordano tried a more romantic topic with his next opera, &quot;Regina Diaz&quot;, with a libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci (1894), but this was a failure, taken off the stage after just two performances.
Giordano then moved to Milan and returned to &quot;verismo&quot; with his best-known work, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; (1896), based on the life of the French poet André Chénier. &quot;Fedora&quot; (1898), based on Victorien Sardou&#x27;s play, featured the rising young tenor Enrico Caruso. It was also a success and is still performed today. His later works are much less known, but occasionally revived and in the case of &quot;La cena delle beffe&quot; (based on the play of the same title by Sem Benelli) recognised by musicologists and critics with some respect. He died in Milan at the age of 81.

The most important theater in his home town of Foggia has been dedicated to Umberto Giordano. A square in Foggia is also named after him and contains several statues representing his most famous works.

<text>León () is the second largest city in Nicaragua, after Managua. Founded by the Spanish as Santiago de los Caballeros de León, it is the capital and largest city of León Department. , the municipality of León has an estimated population of 213,718.

León is located along the &quot;Río Chiquito&quot; (Chiquito River), some northwest of Managua, and some east of the Pacific Ocean coast. León has long been the political and intellectual center of the nation and its National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN) was founded in 1813, making it the second oldest university in Central America. León is also an important industrial, agricultural, and commercial center for Nicaragua, exporting sugar cane, cattle, peanut, plantain, and sorghum. The city has been home to many of Nicaragua&#x27;s most noteworthy poets including Rubén Darío, Alfonso Cortés and Salomón de la Selva.

==History==
The first city named León in Nicaragua was founded in 1524 by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba about east of the present site. The city was abandoned in 1610 after a series of earthquakes spawned by a volcanic eruption. The ruins of that city are known as León Viejo and were excavated in 1960. In the year 2000, León Viejo was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

León had been the capital of Nicaragua since colonial times. So naturally, when Nicaragua withdrew from the United Provinces of Central America in 1839, León became the capital of the new nation. For some years, the capital shifted back and forth between León and the city of Granada. Liberal administrations preferred León while Conservative administrations preferred Granada, until as a compromise proposed by the then Supreme Director of Nicaragua, Fulgencio Vega, Managua was agreed upon to be the permanent capital in 1852.

In 1950, the city of León had a population of 31,000 people. Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza García was shot and mortally wounded in León on September 21, 1956.

== Heritage ==



León is rich in both monuments and historical places. Some architectural monuments include:

* Cárcel la 21 (Prison 21) was a jail located in the San Sebastian neighborhood of Leon. It was a detention center which housed political prisoners and was a symbol of torture. Construction began in 1910 and it was first occupied in 1921. The National Heroine Blanca Aráuz was incarcerated in the facility during the guerrilla insurgency following the Constitutionalist War. During the Somoza regime, it housed political prisoners and those who were &quot;disappeared&quot; by the Guardia Nacional. The façade of the building was destroyed during fighting between the National Guard and Sandinistas in 1979. Since 2000 the jail has served as an art museum, which also attracts visitors interested in the macabre.
* Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of León, a typical colonial baroque building built between 1747 and 1814. Because of its solid, anti-seismic construction, its walls have endured earthquakes, eruptions of the Cerro Negro volcano, and bombings during civil wars. Several cannons were placed on the roof both during the siege of the city by conservative forces in 1824 and during the revolution of 1979 against president Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

:The Assumption is the largest cathedral in Central America and has been the first episcopal seat of Nicaragua since 1531, making it one of the oldest dioceses in the Americas. In the cathedral&#x27;s crypts are buried several illustrious figures, such as poet and diplomat Rubén Darío at the foot of the statue of St. Paul. Darío was the leading figure of the Modernism Poetic Movement of the late 1800s to early 1900s, and was declared the &quot;Prince of Spanish Letters&quot; by literary figures of the Spanish-speaking world. Other illustrious figures buried in the cathedral are the poets Salomón de la Selva and Alfonso Cortés, the father of Nicaragua&#x27;s independence Miguel Larreynaga, classical composer and musician José de la Cruz Mena, and several bishops.

:There are a number of tunnels that connect the cathedral with other temples that were used as hideouts or escape routes during attacks by British, Dutch, and French pirates. However, the tunnels are not accessible to the public, as some have been converted to the sewer system service. In the early 20th century, the first bishop of Leon and the last in Nicaragua, Archbishop Simeón Pereira y Castellón (the same who presided over the funeral of Darío on February 13, 1916) commissioned Granadan sculptor Jorge Navas Cordonero to make a statue of the Virgin Mary to crown the top the façade, and two pairs of Atlantean figures to support the beams that connect the central gable to the flanking bell towers. Navas also sculpted the statues of the twelve apostles inside, along with the columns of the central nave, and the lion at the tomb of Dario, which resembles the &quot;Lion of Lucerne&quot; in Switzerland. He also created several moldings in the interior walls and built the Tabernacle Chapel.
* Church of Sutiava is the oldest intact church in Leon considered the main temple after the cathedral. Its construction began in 1698, during magistrate Diego Rodríguez Menéndez&#x27;s administration, and was completed August 24, 1710. In 1844, during a war with El Salvador, the tower dome was destroyed but it was rebuilt in the early 20th century. The name of the church was formerly spelled &quot;Subtiava&quot; or &quot;Subtiaba&quot;, but the neighborhood officially changed the spelling to &quot;Sutiava&quot; since people believed &quot;sub&quot; meant it was inferior.
* Church of San Francisco is part of the convent of San Francisco, one of the oldest in Nicaragua, founded in 1639 by Friar Pedro de Zúñiga. In the interior remain two good examples of plateresque altars. However, its main attraction is the courtyard. Built in pure, Leonese colonial style, this is a grassy expanse with an ashlar fountain at the center from which four radiating walkways, flanked by manicured lemon trees, lead to the surrounding porticoes where some of the columns are covered in red bougainvilleas. Towards the south, a line of royal palms shade the roof and complete the peaceful ensemble.
* Church of la Recolección, construction began on December 5, 1786, by Bishop Juan Félix de Villegas thanks to contributions made by parishioners. Its Mexican baroque façade is considered one of the most important in the city. The interior also contains one of the best baroque altarpieces in the city highlighted with paintings and silver engravings.
* Church of la Merced, in 1762 the Mercedarian fathers built the first convent and church, but these were later demolished. In the 18th century, the present Church of la Merced was erected with drawings attributed to Mercedario Friar Pedro de Ávila and conducted by master builder Pascual Somarriba. Adjacent to the north side of la Merced is the Paraninfo (former Mercedarion convent) built in beautifully delicate baroque style, which is now UNAN&#x27;s main administrative building.
* Church of el Calvario, a fantasy of textures and colors of pure Leonese baroque. The façade consists of a central body, painted off-yellow with white trimming supported by white, half columns. The gable contains high reliefs of the passion of Christ. The two flanking bell towers painted Burgundy red and highlighted with white grooving, are made up of reliefs representing bricks. The central body contains a central Roman arch door flanked by two smaller, flat ones. They are all separated by columns, topped by a frieze covered in white garlands. The interiors are a pleasant soft white to keep them cool during the long, hot, and dry Leonese summers. The ceiling, also white, is highlighted by red and yellow outlining in the shape of crosses, leaves, and flowers. Built by the illustrious Mayorga family, el Calvario dates from the first half of the 18th century and it is one of Leon&#x27;s architectural jewels at the east end of calle Real or &quot;Main Street&quot;.
* Ruins of the Church of San Sebastián, built in the late 17th century as a chapel of the Cathedral, San Sebastián&#x27;s was one of the first religious buildings in the city. Rebuilt in the late 18th century by Colonel Joaquín Arrechavala, it was bombed during the revolution in 1979. Since it was built with adobe bricks, San Sebastián was easily destroyed, unlike other churches built of brick or stone which endured shootings and bombings.
* Church of Guadalupe, built in the late 19th century under the auspices of father Villamil replacing an 18th-century hermitage, it is of simple construction, in keeping with the sobriety of the Franciscans.
* Church of Zaragoza, with an atrium and lateral corridor, its construction began in the late 19th century and ended in the mid-20th century by Bishop Salmerón; the façade was designed by Dr. Francisco Mateo.
* Church of San Felipe, a large building that occupies an entire block, it was built in 1685 for blacks and mulatto worshipers. In 1859, it underwent an extensive expansion that gave it its present form, whereas the tower was restored in 1983.
* Church Hermitage of San Pedro, a small building with typical late, colonial architecture of the 18th century. It was built between 1706 and 1718 by mayor Bartolomé González Fitoria, replacing the original church of San Pedro that was part of a set of four primitive hermitages in Subtiava.
* Church of San Nicolás Tolentino del Laborío, Philip III of Spain ordered its construction in 1618. It was built in very light, Colonial baroque style.
* Chapel of la Asunción, part of the school of the same name, it was built in 1679 by Bishop Andrés de las Navas y Quevedo, and used as an episcopal palace. Later it was occupied by the Mothers of the Assumption. In 1935 it underwent deep alterations that led to its current appearance: a mix of early colonial baroque for the side wings, and neo-Gothic for the central chapel.
* Hotel Esfinge building designed by Nicaraguan architect José María Ibarra as an upscale hotel.
* Esquivel House, built in the 19th century, it belonged to Father Mariano Dubón. Architectural details and decorations around the house makes it a unique structure in the city. It now belongs to the Esquivel Family and it is categorized as a high-class residence.
* Colegio de San Ramón, of symmetrical façade and Renaissance influences, it has been rebuilt several times after being damaged by earthquakes. Although historically a seminary college since the 1600s, it has now been incorporated to UNAN.
* City Hall, built in 1935, it was damaged during the revolution of 1979. The building was designed in Art Deco style by architect Marcelo Targa, and was built during the administration of then president Juan Bautista Sacasa. It is a building of important architectural value.

Other remarkable buildings and places include: the walls of Guadalupe Cemetery, Guadalupe Bridge, the Debayle Museum, the Diocesan Archives, the Mena Theater, the Posada Colonial (a baroque structure in business since 1823), the old Train Station, the San Vicente Hospital, and the Subtiava Rural House.
* León Viejo, the ruins of the original city of León which was buried by an eruption of the Momotombo volcano in 1610. It was founded in 1524 by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, and is situated from the actual city of León. It is a World Heritage Site and its founder is buried there, in a crypt beneath his statue, along with other figures including Pedrarias Dávila who had ordered his assassination.
==Geography==
