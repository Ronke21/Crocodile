<text>In archaeology, geophysical survey is ground-based physical sensing techniques used for archaeological imaging or mapping. Remote sensing and marine surveys are also used in archaeology, but are generally considered separate disciplines. Other terms, such as &quot;geophysical prospection&quot; and &quot;archaeological geophysics&quot; are generally synonymous.

== Overview ==

Geophysical survey is used to create maps of subsurface archaeological features. Features are the non-portable part of the archaeological record, whether standing structures or traces of human activities left in the soil. Geophysical instruments can detect buried features when their physical properties contrast measurably with their surroundings. In some cases individual artifacts, especially metal, may be detected as well. Readings taken in a systematic pattern become a data set that can be rendered as image maps. Survey results can be used to guide excavation and to give archaeologists insight into the patterning of non-excavated parts of the site. Unlike other archaeological methods, geophysical survey is neither invasive nor destructive. For this reason, it is often used where preservation (rather than excavation) is the goal, and to avoid disturbance of culturally sensitive sites such as cemeteries.

Although geophysical survey has been used in the past with intermittent success, good results are very likely when it is applied appropriately. It is most useful when it is used in a well-integrated research design where interpretations can be tested and refined. Both survey design and interpretation require a knowledge of the archaeological record and how it is expressed geophysically. Appropriate instrumentation, survey design, and data processing are essential for success, and must be adapted to the unique geology and archaeological record of each site. In the field, control of data quality and spatial accuracy are critical.

== Methods ==

Geophysical methods used in archaeology are largely adapted from those used in mineral exploration, engineering, and geology. Archaeological mapping presents unique challenges, however, which have spurred a separate development of methods and equipment. In general, geological applications are concerned with detecting relatively large structures, often as deeply as possible. In contrast, most archaeological sites are relatively near the surface, often within the top meter of earth. Instruments are often configured to limit the depth of response to better resolve the near-surface phenomena that are likely to be of interest. Another challenge is to detect subtle and often very small features – which may be as ephemeral as organic staining from decayed wooden posts - and distinguish them from rocks, roots, and other natural &quot;clutter&quot;. To accomplish this requires not only sensitivity, but also high density of data points, usually at least one and sometimes dozens of readings per square meter.

Most commonly applied to archaeology are magnetometers, electrical resistance meters, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic (EM) conductivity meters. These methods can resolve many types of archaeological features, are capable of high sample density surveys of very large areas, and of operating under a wide range of conditions. While common metal detectors are geophysical sensors, they are not capable of generating high-resolution imagery. Other established and emerging technologies are also finding use in archaeological applications.

Electrical resistance meters can be thought of as similar to the Ohmmeters used to test electrical circuits. In most systems, metal probes are inserted into the ground to obtain a reading of the local electrical resistance. A variety of probe configurations are used, most having four probes, often mounted on a rigid frame. Capacitively coupled systems that do not require direct physical contact with the soil have also been developed. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see Electrical resistivity tomography).

Electromagnetic (EM) conductivity instruments have a response that is comparable to that of resistance meters (conductivity is the inverse of resistance). Underground archaeological features are detected by creating a magnetic field underground by applying an electric current that has a known frequency and magnitude through a sending coil. The currents spur a secondary current in underground conductors that is picked up by a receiving coil. Changes in the underground conductivity can indicate buried features. Although EM conductivity instruments are generally less sensitive than resistance meters to the same phenomena, they do have a number of unique properties. One advantage is that they do not require direct contact with the ground, and can be used in conditions unfavorable to resistance meters. Another advantage is relatively greater speed than resistance instruments. Unlike resistance instruments, conductivity meters respond strongly to metal. This can be a disadvantage when the metal is extraneous to the archaeological record, but can be useful when the metal is of archaeological interest. Some EM conductivity instruments are also capable of measuring magnetic susceptibility, a property that is becoming increasingly important in archaeological studies.
Magnetometers used in geophysical survey may use a single sensor to measure the total magnetic field strength, or may use two (sometimes more) spatially separated sensors to measure the gradient of the magnetic field (the difference between the sensors). In most archaeological applications the latter (gradiometer) configuration is preferred because it provides better resolution of small, near-surface phenomena. Magnetometers may also use a variety of different sensor types. Proton precession magnetometers have largely been superseded by faster and more sensitive fluxgate and caesium instruments.

Every kind of material has unique magnetic properties, even those that we do not think of as being &quot;magnetic&quot;. Different materials below the ground can cause local disturbances in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field that are detectable with sensitive magnetometers. Magnetometers react very strongly to iron and steel, brick, burned soil, and many types of rock, and archaeological features composed of these materials are very detectable. Where these highly magnetic materials do not occur, it is often possible to detect very subtle anomalies caused by disturbed soils or decayed organic materials. The chief limitation of magnetometer survey is that subtle features of interest may be obscured by highly magnetic geologic or modern materials.
Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is perhaps the best known of these methods (although it is not the most widely applied in archaeology). The concept of radar is familiar to most people. In this instance, the radar signal – an electromagnetic pulse – is directed into the ground. Subsurface objects and stratigraphy (layering) will cause reflections that are picked up by a receiver. The travel time of the reflected signal indicates the depth. Data may be plotted as profiles, or as planview maps isolating specific depths.

GPR can be a powerful tool in favorable conditions (uniform sandy soils are ideal). It is unique both in its ability to detect some spatially small objects at relatively great depths and in its ability to distinguish the depth of anomaly sources. The principal disadvantage of GPR is that it is severely limited by less-than-ideal conditions. The high electrical conductivity of fine-grained sediments (clays and silts) causes conductive losses of signal strength; rocky or heterogeneous sediments scatter the GPR signal.

Metal detectors use electromagnetic induction to detect metal. Although other types of instruments (notably magnetometers and electromagnetic conductivity meters) have some sensitivity to metal, specialized metal detectors are much more effective. Metal detectors are available in different configurations, varying in sophistication and sensitivity. Most have some capacity to discriminate between different types of metallic targets.

Common hand-held metal detectors are widely used by archaeologists. Most of these instruments do not create a logged data set and thus cannot be used for directly creating maps, but used in a systematic manner they can be a useful tool in archaeological research. Sometimes external data loggers are attached to such detectors which collect information about detected materials and corresponding gps coordinates for further processing. Misuse of these instruments on archaeological sites by treasure hunters and artifact collectors has been a serious problem in archaeological preservation however cooperative efforts between skilled amateur operators and academic teams are emerging in the field.

Although not as commonly used in archaeology, sophisticated metal detectors are available having much greater sensitivity than hand-held models. These instruments are capable of data logging and sophisticated target discrimination. They can be mounted on wheeled carts for survey data collection.

Lidar (LIght raDAR) is an optical remote sensing technology that can measure the distance to a target by illuminating the target with light, often using pulses from a laser. Lidar has many applications in the field of archaeology including aiding in the planning of field campaigns, mapping features beneath forest canopy, and providing an overview of broad, continuous features that may be indistinguishable on the ground. Lidar can also provide archaeologists with the ability to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that are otherwise hidden by vegetation. Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.

Data collection is broadly similar regardless of the particular sensing instrument. Survey usually involves walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, the area to be surveyed is staked into a series of square or rectangular survey &quot;grids&quot; (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked ropes as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Survey systems with integrated global positioning systems (GPS) have been developed, but under field conditions, currently available systems lack sufficient precision for high-resolution archaeological mapping. Geophysical instruments (notably metal detectors) may also used for less formally &quot;scanning&quot; areas of interest.

Data processing and imaging convert raw numeric data into interpretable maps. Data processing usually involves the removal of statistical outliers and noise, and interpolation of data points. Statistical filters may be designed to enhance features of interest (based on size, strength, orientation, or other criteria), or suppress obscuring modern or natural phenomena. Inverse modeling of archaeological features from observed data is becoming increasingly important. Processed data are typically rendered as images, as contour maps, or in false relief. When geophysical data are rendered graphically, the interpreter can more intuitively recognize cultural and natural patterns and visualize the physical phenomena causing the detected anomalies.

== Development ==
The use of geophysical surveys is well established in European archaeology, especially in Great Britain, where it was pioneered in the 1940s and 1950s. It is increasingly employed in other parts of the world and with increasing success as techniques are adapted to unique regional conditions.

In early surveys, measurements were recorded individually and plotted by hand. Although beneficial results were sometimes obtained, practical applications were limited by the enormous amount of labor required. Data processing was minimal, and sample densities were necessarily low.

Although sensor sensitivity has improved and new methods have been developed, the most important developments have been automated data logging and computers that can handle and process large amounts of data. Increases in survey equipment performance and automation have made it possible to survey large areas rapidly. Rapid data collection has also made achieving the high sample densities necessary to resolve small or subtle features practical. Advances in processing and imaging software have made it possible to detect, display, and interpret subtle archaeological patterning within the geophysical data.

<text>Tirant lo Blanch (; modern spelling: &quot;Tirant lo Blanc&quot;), in English &quot;Tirant the White&quot;, is a chivalric romance written by the Valencian knight Joanot Martorell, finished posthumously by his friend Martí Joan de Galba and published in the city of Valencia in 1490 as an incunabulum edition. The title means &quot;Tirant the White&quot; and is the name of the romance&#x27;s main character who saves the Byzantine Empire.

It is one of the best known medieval works of literature in Valencian language. It is considered a masterpiece in the Valencian literature and in the literature in Catalan language as a whole, and it played an important role in the evolution of the Western novel through its influence on the author Miguel de Cervantes. The book has been noted for its use of many Valencian proverbs.

==Plot==
&quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot; tells the story of a knight Tirant from Brittany who has a series of adventures across Europe in his quest. He joins in knightly competitions in England and France until the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire asks him to help in the war against the Ottoman Turks, Islamic invaders threatening Constantinople, the capital and seat of the Empire. Tirant accepts and is made Megaduke of the Byzantine Empire and the captain of an army. He defeats the invaders and saves the Empire from destruction. Afterwards, he fights the Turks in many regions of the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, but he dies just before he can marry the pretty heiress of the Byzantine Empire.

==Themes==
Compared to books of the same time period, it lacks the bucolic, platonic, and contemplative love commonly portrayed in the chivalric heroes. Instead the main character is full of life and sensuous love, sarcasm, and human feelings. The work is filled with down to earth descriptions of daily life, prosaic and even bitter in nature.

==Influence==
&quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot; is one of the most important books written in Valencian. Written by Joanot Martorell in the 15th century, the &quot;Tirant&quot; is an unusual chivalric novel in its naturalistic and satirical character, which also appears to have a strong autobiographic component. It tells the feats and adventures of Knight Tirant lo Blanc from Brittany. At times, it parallels the life and adventures of Roger de Flor, main leader of the mercenary Company of Almogàvers, which fought in Asia Minor and Greece, both for and against the Emperor of Byzantium. This historical resemblance is evident in the description of events occurring around Constantinople and the defeat of Sultan Mehmed II &quot;the conqueror&quot;. While Roger de Flor&#x27;s almogàvers had the upper hand in the region, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 was a huge shock to Christian Europe, marking an end to the Byzantine Empire that Martorell&#x27;s contemporaries wished to change. In writing his novel, Martorell perhaps rewrote history to fit what he wanted it to be - which in a way makes it a precursor of the present-day genre of alternate history.

The Spanish text of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; praises the book, in Chapter 6 of Part I, because of certain characteristics of &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot; – characters with unlikely or funny names such as Kirieleison de Montalbán, the presence of a merry widow, the fact that in the book knights eat, sleep, and die in their beds having made a will, and the title can be understood as &quot;Tirant the Blank&quot;, lacking a major victory to put on his shield – the book is quite different from the typical chivalric romance. These aspects make the book exceptional, and made Cervantes state that &quot;por su estilo&quot;, which can be translated &quot;because of its style&quot; but more likely means &quot;in its own way&quot;, the book is &quot;a treasure of enjoyment and a gold mine of recreation&quot; (&quot;un tesoro de contento y una mina de pasatiempos&quot;), the &quot;best book in the world.&quot; It is an (unintentionally) funny book, and Cervantes liked funny books, believed the world needed more of them, and wrote his own in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Cervantes saw this 100-year-old book as the crown jewel of his library.

==Translations and adaptations==

===Translations===
The book has been translated into several languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Finnish, German, Dutch, Swedish and Chinese. Modern translations of the book into English include &quot;Tirant lo Blanc&quot;, translated by David H. Rosenthal (1983, 1996), &quot;Tirant lo Blanc: The Complete Translation (Catalan Studies, Vol 1)&quot;, translated by Ray La Fontaine (1994) and &quot;The White Knight: Tirant lo Blanc&quot; (Project Gutenberg), translated by Robert S. Rudder (1995). There&#x27;s also an adaptation in modern Catalan

===Film adaptation===
The plot of the 2006 film adaptation is based on the later part of the adventures of Tirant and events leading to his involvement in Constantinople and afterwards.

<text>Brock Peters (born George Fisher; July 2, 1927 – August 23, 2005) was an American actor and singer, best known for playing the villainous &quot;Crown&quot; in the 1959 film version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, and Tom Robinson in the 1962 film &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in the 1965 Norman Rosten play &quot;Mister Johnson&quot;. He was nominated for a Tony Award and won a Drama Desk Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award for his lead role as Rev. Stephen Kumalo in the 1972 Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;. He received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1991 and a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1992.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Peters voiced the role of Darth Vader in the serial radio drama adaptations of the original trilogy of &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, and played two recurring roles in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise: Starfleet Admiral Cartwright in two of the original-cast feature films, and Joseph Sisko (father of station commander Benjamin Sisko) in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

Peters notable film roles include &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954), &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964), &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973) and &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996).

==Early life==
Peters was born George Fisher in New York City, the son of Alma A. (&quot;née&quot; Norford) and Sonnie Fisher, a sailor. Peters set his sights on a show business career early on, at the age of 10. Avidly encouraged by his mother Alma to pursue a musical career, he studied the violin from 10 to 14 years of age, but he found out that his singing talents were more prodigious and upon enrolling at New York&#x27;s famed High School of Music &amp; Art, he immediately signed up for several productions in its musical theatre program. Upon graduation, Peters initially fielded more odd jobs than acting jobs, often working as a hospital orderly at night while he worked his way through physical education studies at the City College of New York (CCNY), but he still stayed connected to the burgeoning theatre and creative community in New York, occasionally doing background parts in musical plays like &quot;Black Aida&quot;.

==Career==
After auditioning and landing a spot touring with the Leonard DePaur Infantry Chorus (of which he was a civilian member from 1945 to 1947), however, he officially quit CCNY. Peters often joked that he &quot;grew up&quot; in the chorus, because his vocal range changed from baritone to bass baritone during his years with them. DePaur subsequently gave him the lead in the Chorus&#x27; popular rendition of &quot;John Henry&quot; (which became a repertoire mainstay of Peters in later years, singing the work on one of his two solo albums which was produced by United Artists Records in the 1960s).

At the suggestion of his agent, he adopted a more memorable stage name, reversing the order of the names of childhood friend Peter Brock.

After auditioning and landing a stage role in the touring company of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1949 on contralto Etta Moten Barnett&#x27;s suggestion, he went on tour with the opera, where William Warfield commended his performances and requested that Peters be his understudy as Porgy. It was during this time while he was touring in Europe with the opera that Paul Robeson saw him in his career-defining role as &quot;Crown&quot; and purportedly declared that he was &quot;a young Paul Robeson&quot;.

 Peters made his film debut in &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; in 1954, but began to make a name for himself in such films as &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot;. He received a Tony nomination for his starring stint in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;.

Peters sang background vocals on the 1956 hit &quot;Day-O&quot; by Harry Belafonte, as well as on Belafonte&#x27;s 1957 hit, &quot;Mama Look at Bubu&quot;. He led the chorus at recording sessions for Belafonte&#x27;s iconic 1956 album &quot;Calypso&quot;. He also sang on the song &quot;Where&quot; from Randy Weston&#x27;s 1959 album &quot;Live at the Five Spot&quot; and shared vocal duties with Martha Flowers on Weston&#x27;s album of the following year, &quot;Uhuru Afrika&quot;. During this time, Peters and Belafonte became close friends, sharing similar political views and approaches to their careers. In 1963, he played Matthew Robinson in &quot;Heavens Above!&quot;, a British satirical-comedy film starring Peter Sellers, directed by John and Roy Boulting. He played a supporting role as the gangster Rodriguez in the 1964 film, &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;, one of the first confirmed homosexual characters in an American film. He played “Jesse” in a 1972 episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He was a special guest star in the third season of &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, playing the character &quot;Jacob&quot; in the episode called &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1974).

In the film &quot;Abe Lincoln, Freedom Fighter&quot; (1978), Peters plays Henry, a freed black slave who is falsely accused of robbery but, defended by Abraham Lincoln, is found not guilty due to the fact he has a damaged hand and could not have committed the crime. In &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, Peters plays Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, a crime Atticus Finch shows he could not have committed because his left hand and arm were damaged. In 1970 Peters portrayed the voice of African-American boxer Jack Johnson in Bill Cayton&#x27;s film of the same name, and it is in this role that he can be heard at the end of Miles Davis&#x27; soundtrack album, &quot;Jack Johnson&quot;, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m Jack Johnson. Heavyweight champion of the world. I&#x27;m black. They never let me forget it. I&#x27;m black, all right. I&#x27;ll never let them forget it.&quot;

Between 1981 and 1996, Peters voiced Darth Vader in the radio adaptations of the first three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films for National Public Radio. He also played the role of a Colonial prosecutor trying to make a murder case against Starbuck in an episode of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

Peters appeared in the films &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; as Fleet Admiral Cartwright of Starfleet Command. Peters portrayed Joseph Sisko, father of Deep Space Nine&#x27;s commanding officer, Benjamin Sisko, on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. In 1993, he was a member of the jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. In early 2005, six months before his death, Peters guest-starred in an episode of &quot;JAG&quot; during its final season, &quot;Bridging the Gulf&quot;, season 10 episode 15. Peters worked with Charlton Heston on several theater productions in the 1940s and 1950s. The two became friends and subsequently worked together on several films, including &quot;Major Dundee&quot;, &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, and &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot;. He voiced Lucius Fox in several episodes of &quot;&quot; and had a guest role as Morris Grant/Soul Power in the &quot;Static Shock&quot; episode &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; (2003).

He was involved in many community projects, including being chairman and a co-founder of the Dance Theatre of Harlem.

==Recognition==
Brock was awarded the 26th Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1990 for his acting career and humanitarian contributions. He was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live theater category in 1992.

==Personal life and death==
Peters was once romantically involved with actress Ja&#x27;net Dubois. Peters was married to Dolores &#x27;DiDi&#x27; Daniels from 1961 until her death in 1989. Their daughter, Lisa Jo Peters, was born November 3, 1962. Peters delivered the eulogy at Gregory Peck&#x27;s funeral in 2003. His character, Tom Robinson, was defended by Peck&#x27;s Atticus Finch in 1962&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

<text>The Roxie Theater, also known as the Roxie Cinema or just The Roxie, is a historic movie theater, founded in 1912, at 3117 16th Street in the Mission District of San Francisco. It is a non-profit community arthouse cinema.

==History==
The Roxie is one of the oldest continuously operating movie theaters in the US, with its history tracing back to the early 1900s.

The 300-seat theater was renovated in 1933, changed its name to the Roxie, and added its unusual marquee with neon sign but no place for movie titles. In 2003, a 49-seat theater dubbed the Little Roxie opened two doors from the main theater.

Other names for the theater:
*The Poppy 1912–1916
*The New 16th Street 1916–1920
*The Rex 1920–1926
*The Gem 1926–1930
*The Gaiety 1930–1933
*The Roxie 1933–present

In the late 1960s with the decline of its neighborhood, The Roxie became a pornography theater. In March 1976, film lovers Robert Christopher Evans, Dick Gaikowski, Peter Moore, and Tom Mayer bought the Roxie, remodeled it, and turned it into an art and independent film center.

Between November 1–15, 1979, the Roxie hosted the U.S. premiere of Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Âge d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930), a film that had been banned for almost 50 years. 

Over the years, the Roxie has been home to many film festivals such as the Frameline Film Festival, San Francisco IndieFest, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, the Arab Film Festival, San Francisco Transgender Film Festival, and many others.

In December 2005, an agreement was announced under which the Roxie was acquired by New College of California, a small liberal arts college also based in the Mission District. It became part of New College&#x27;s Media Studies Program on January 1, 2006, and was renamed the &quot;Roxie Film Center at New College&quot;. An anonymous benefactor paid off the theater&#x27;s debts, and the college registered it as a non-profit corporation.

On February 26, 2008, New College announced it was closing, thus ending its support of the Roxie. New College Board member Rod Holt and his son Alan subsequently took over the theater’s lease.

In 2010 Alan Holt transitioned from Executive Director to a seat on the Board and community activist and philanthropist Christopher Statton joined the Roxie as Executive Director and member of the Board. Megan Wilson, who began working for the Roxie as a development consultant, became a co-Executive Director; neither received a salary. Over his four-year tenure, Statton established the Roxie as a community-based non-profit, including the creation of the Roxie&#x27;s &quot;Lights. Camera. Action! Awards&quot; to honor Bay Area social justice documentary filmmakers. The inaugural awards honored the filmmaking team of Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman and filmmaker Hima B for their significant contributions in raising awareness of the challenges of living with HIV/AIDS. Statton also raised over $400,000 in contributions to help support the Roxie&#x27;s programming and operations. In 2013 Statton was awarded the Marlon Riggs Award by the San Francisco Film Critics Circle for &quot;his significant contribution to San Francisco’s film community through the Roxie Theater over the past four years&quot;. Statton resigned from the Roxie in 2013 due to health concerns.

In December 2013, the Roxie announced Isabel Fondevila, former Board President of Artists&#x27; Television Access, as the new director. She further expanded the theater&#x27;s film festivals and developed RoxCine, an ongoing series of Spanish-language films.

In 2015, Dave Cowen came aboard as executive director, while Fondevila remained at the Roxie in the role of Director of Programming. Over the next two years, Cowen led the theater to profitability with projection and facilities improvements, an increased social media presence, and a successful focus on showing repertory film in 35mm. During this time, the Roxie&#x27;s classic neon marquee was fully restored, and the Roxie was honored by the California State Assembly in 2017 as Small Business of the Year.

In August 2017, Sundance veteran Elizabeth O&#x27;Malley replaced Cowen as executive director, with Operations Director Lex Sloan promoted to general manager. Cowen remains on the Roxie Board of Directors and is now working with Milwaukee Film on their acquisition of the historic Oriental Theatre.

==Roxie Releasing==
The theatre also is home to Roxie Releasing, an independent film distributor most notably responsible for the 30th anniversary re-release of George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. Roxie Releasing specializes in documentaries.

<text>L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez () is a ski resort in Southeastern France at . It is a mountain pasture in the central French Western Alps, in the commune of Huez, which is part of the Isère department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

It is part of the Grandes Rousses massif, over the Oisans, and is from Grenoble. The Alpe d&#x27;Huez resort is accessible from Grenoble by the , which runs along the Romanche Valley passing through the communes of Livet-et-Gavet and Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans as well as Haut-Oisans via the Col de Sarenne.

Alpe d&#x27;Huez is known internationally as an iconic cycling venue, as it is used regularly in the Tour de France cycle race, including twice on the same day in 2013. In 2019, it became the site of the first Tomorrowland Winter festival.

==History==
The site of the Alpe has been permanently occupied since the Middle Ages. East of &quot;L&#x27;Alpe veti&quot;, a medieval agglomeration had grown from the end of the 11th to the 14th century under the name of Brandes. It was composed of a castle, a parish church with a cemetery, a village with about 80 homes, surface and underground mine workings, as well as several industrial districts. Its occupants operated a silver mine on behalf of the Dauphin. It is currently the only medieval known and preserved in its entirety, making it a unique site in Europe and classified as historical monuments by a decree of 6 August 1995.

Excavated and studied continuously since 1977 by a team of the CNRS, this site is registered as an historic monument. The medieval mining operation stretched from Gua (the Valley) to the Lac Blanc [White Lake] (Massif des Rousses). The massif was also the subject of mining operations, including copper, from the Bronze Age.

It is also at Alpe d&#x27;Huez where botanist Gaston Bonnier began his study of flora of France in 1871.

The station was developed from the 1920s. This is where the first platter lift for skiers was opened in 1936 with perches by , creator of the Poma company.

==Climate==

On average, Alpe d&#x27;Huez experiences 159.9 days per year with a minimum temperature below , 22.7 days per year with a minimum temperature below , and 42.4 days per year with a maximum temperature below . The record high temperature was on 18 July 2023, while the record low temperature was on 5 February 2012.

==Economy==
Each year, the Alpe d&#x27;Huez Film Festival is held in January.

Alpe d&#x27;Huez also has an altiport, the Alpe d&#x27;Huez Airport, built for the 10th Winter Olympics held at Grenoble in 1968. It was named for on 15 April 2000, in memory of the famous mountain pilot. The altiport hosts helicopters including those of civil security, and the Dauphiné flying club. A gourmet restaurant is located on the edge of the platform.

==Local culture and heritage==

===Sites and monuments===

====The church====

Alpe d&#x27;Huez has a modern and original church, the appearance of which recalls a silhouette of the Virgin Mary. Under the leadership of Father Jaap Reuten, head of the parish from 1964 to 1992, it was designed by the architect Jean Marol in the 1960s (completed in 1970), and decorated with colour-rich stained-glass windows by the artist Arcabas.

This church houses a pipe organ which is unique in the world. The organ takes the form of a hand drawn up towards the sky, designed by composer Jean Guillou and the German organ builder Detlef Kleuker. Each year, concerts are held around this instrument on Thursday night, winter and summer, as well as organ, pan flute and choral courses during the summer.

===Cultural heritage===
* The (or &quot;Musée d&#x27;Huez et de Oisans&quot;), of the Musée de France.

==Winter sports==
Alpe d&#x27;Huez is primarily used for downhill, or Alpine skiing.

===Skiing at Alpe d&#x27;Huez===

Alpe d&#x27;Huez is one of Europe&#x27;s premier skiing venues. The site of the Pomagalski&#x27;s first surface lift in the mid thirties, the resort gained popularity when it hosted the bobsleigh events of the 1968 Winter Olympics. At that time the resort was seen as a competitor to Courchevel as France&#x27;s most upmarket purpose built resort but the development of Les Trois Vallées, Val d&#x27;Isère, Tignes, La Plagne and Les Arcs saw Alpe D&#x27;Huez fall from favour in the 1970s and early 1980s.

With of piste and 84 ski lifts, the resort is now one of the world&#x27;s largest. Extensive snowmaking facilities helped combat the ski area&#x27;s largely south-facing orientation and helped Alpe d&#x27;Huez appeal to beginner skiers, with very easy slopes. The expansion of the skiing above the linked resorts of Vaujany, Oz-en-Oisans, Villard Reculas and Auris boosted the quantity and quality of intermediate grade slopes but the resort is mostly known for freeskiing, drawing many steep skiing enthusiasts to its high altitude terrain.

Aside from the Tunnel and Sarenne black runs, many Off-piste opportunities exist both from the summit of the Pic Blanc and the Dome des Petites Rousses. These include the 50-degree Cheminees du Mascle couloirs, the open powder field of Le Grand Sablat, the Couloir Fleur and the Perrins bowl. Up to of vertical descent are available with heli drops back to the resort&#x27;s altiport. The proximity to the exclusively off-piste resort of La Grave as well as tree skiing at Serre Chevalier and the glacier and terrain parks of Les Deux Alpes have made Alpe d&#x27;Huez a popular base for skiers looking to explore the Oisans region.

===1968 Winter Olympics===
Alpe d&#x27;Huez hosted the bobsleigh events at the 1968 Winter Olympics based at Grenoble away. The track, built in spring 1966 for FRF 5.5 million, hosted the World Championships in 1967. The cooling could not keep the ice solid in bright daylight – not least because the track faced south. The four-man event was cancelled because of thawing ice, and modifications were made that spring to prepare for the Games. The refrigeration system was strengthened in turns 6, 9, 12, and 13; turn 12 was covered with stone and earthwork to prevent concrete coming up, turn 12 was cooled with liquid nitrogen, and shades were built on turns 6, 9, 12, and 13 to minimise direct sunlight. Thawing remained a problem and Olympic bobsleigh events had to be scheduled before sunrise. The track closed in 1972 due to high operating costs; the structure remains as demolition was not economical.
:No turn names were given for the track.

==Cycle racing==
===Details===
The climb to the summit starts at Le Bourg d&#x27;Oisans in the Romanche valley. The climb goes via the D211 from where the distance to the summit (at ) is , with an average gradient of 8.1%, with 21 hairpin bends and a maximum gradient of 13%. Despite its notoriety, Alpe d&#x27;Huez is only the 56th hardest bike climb in France.

===Tour de France===
L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez is climbed regularly in the Tour de France. It was first included in the race in 1952 and has been a stage finish regularly since 1976. The race was brought to the mountain by Élie Wermelinger, the chief commissaire or referee. He drove his Panhard Dyna car between snow banks that lined the road in March 1952, invited by a consortium of businesses who had opened hotels at the summit. Their leader was Georges Rajon, who ran the Hotel Christina. The ski station there opened in 1936. Wermelinger reported to the organiser, Jacques Goddet, and the Tour signed a contract with the businessmen to include the Alpe. It cost them the modern equivalent of €3,250.

That first Alpe d&#x27;Huez stage was won in 1952 by Fausto Coppi. Coppi attacked from the summit to rid himself of the French rider Jean Robic. This was the year that motorcycle television crews first came to the Tour. It was also the Tour&#x27;s first mountain-top finish. The veteran reporter, Jacques Augendre, said:

:&quot;The Tourmalet, the Galibier and the Izoard were the mythical mountains of the race. These three cols were supplanted by the Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Why? Because it&#x27;s the col of modernity. Coppi&#x27;s victory in 1952 was the symbol of a golden age of cycling, that of champions [such as] Coppi, Bartali, Kubler, Koblet, Bobet. But only Coppi and Armstrong and Carlos Sastre have been able to take the maillot jaune on the Alpe and to keep it to Paris. That&#x27;s not by chance. From the first edition, shown on live television, the Alpe d&#x27;Huez definitively transformed the way the &quot;Grande Boucle&quot; ran. No other stage has had such drama. With its 21 bends, its gradient and the number of spectators, it is a climb in the style of Hollywood.&quot;

Augendre omitted Laurent Fignon, who, along with Coppi and Armstrong, took yellow on the Alpe without winning the stage in 1983, 1984, and 1989. He held it into Paris in 1983 and 1984 but in 1989 he lost it on the final stage to Paris, a time trial, to Greg LeMond to finish second by 8&quot;, the closest finish in men&#x27;s tour history.

After Coppi&#x27;s win, the Alpe was dropped until 1964, when it was included as a mid-stage climb, and then again until 1976, both times at Rajon&#x27;s instigation. The hairpin bends are named after the winners of stages. All hairpins had been named by the 22nd climb in 2001 so naming restarted at the bottom with Lance Armstrong&#x27;s name added to Coppi&#x27;s.

Stage 18 of the 2013 Tour de France included a double ascent of the climb, reaching on the first passage, and continuing to the traditional finish on the second.

Only one rider has won the Alpe stage while in yellow, Geraint Thomas in the second of two back to back Alpine stage wins in 2018. He also held on to win the overall Tour.

French journalist and &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; sportswriter Jean-Paul Vespini wrote a book about Alpe d&#x27;Huez and its role in the Tour de France: &quot;The Tour Is Won on the Alpe: Alpe d&#x27;Huez and the Classic Battles of the Tour de France&quot;.

====Spectators====
The Alpe has chaotic crowds of spectators. In 1999, Giuseppe Guerini won despite being knocked off by a spectator who stepped into his path to take a photograph. The 2004 individual time trial became chaotic when fans pushed riders toward the top. Attendance figures on the mountain have to be treated with caution. A million spectators were claimed for 1997. Eric Muller, the mayor of Alpe d&#x27;Huez, however, said there were 350,000 in 2001, four years later despite acceptance that the number rises every year. &quot;We expect more than 400,000 for the centenary race in 2003&quot;, he said. The author Tim Moore wrote:

As a variant on a sporting theme, Alpe d&#x27;Huez annoys the purists but enthrals the broader public, like 20/20 cricket or beach volleyball. Last year, a full-blown tent-stamping riot had required heavy police intervention. During this year&#x27;s clean-up operation, down in a ravine with the bottle shards and dented emulsion tins, a body turned up. He&#x27;d fallen off the mountain and no one had noticed. When the Tour goes up Alpe d&#x27;Huez, it&#x27;s a squalid, manic and sometimes lethal shambles, and that&#x27;s just the way they like it. It&#x27;s the Glastonbury Festival for cycling fans.

Alpe d&#x27;Huez has been nicknamed the &quot;Dutch Mountain&quot;, since Dutchmen won eight of the first 14 finishes in le Tour De France. British author Geoffrey Nicholson wrote:

The attraction of opposites draws [Dutch spectators] from the Low Countries to the Alps each summer in any case. But all winter in the Netherlands coach companies offer two or three nights at Alpe d&#x27;Huez as a special feature of their alpine tours. And those Dutch families who don&#x27;t come by coach, park their campers and pitch their tents along the narrow ledges beside the road like sea-birds nesting at St Kilda. The Dutch haven&#x27;t adopted the Alpe d&#x27;Huez simply because it is sunny and agreeable, or even because the modern, funnel-shaped church, Notre Dame des Neiges, has a Dutch priest, Father Reuten (until a few years ago, it was used as a press room and was probably the only church in France where, for one day at least, there were ashtrays in the nave and a bar in the vestry, or where an organist was once asked to leave because he was disturbing the writers&#x27; concentration). No, what draws the Dutch to Alpe d&#x27;Huez is the remarkable run of success their riders have had there&quot;.

====Significant stages====
1952: Jean Robic attacked at the start of the climb and only Fausto Coppi could stay with him. The two climbed together until Coppi attacked at bend five, from the top. He won the stage, the lead in the general classification, and kept it till the end of the race.

1977: Lucien Van Impe, a Belgian rider leading the climbers&#x27; competition, broke clear on the Col du Glandon. He gained enough time to threaten the leader, Bernard Thévenet. He was still clear on the Alpe when a car drove into him. The time that Van Impe lost waiting for another wheel may have been enough to cost him the Yellow Jersey, as Thévenet and Hennie Kuiper charged on to the finish with Thévenet remaining in the lead by eight seconds over Kuiper.

1978: Another Belgian leading the mountains race also came close to taking the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Michel Pollentier also finished alone, but he was caught soon afterwards defrauding a drugs control and was disqualified. Due to this disqualification Dutch rider Joop Zoetemelk, who finished 3rd on the stage and would have climbed to 2nd in the General Classification, took over the yellow jersey, but would lose it on the final time trial to Bernard Hinault. Zoetemelk has his name on two of the hairpin turns at Alp d&#x27;Huez being one of the select few riders to win this stage twice; once in 1976 and once in 1979.

1984: The Tour invited amateurs to take part in the 1980s. The best was Luis Herrera, who lived at altitude in Colombia. None of the professionals could follow him. He won alone to the cacophony of broadcasters who had arrived to report his progress.

1986: Bernard Hinault said he would help Greg LeMond win the Tour but appeared to ride otherwise. The two crossed the line arm in arm in an apparent sign of truce creating a moment that has become one of the most iconic photographs in Tour history.

1997: Marco Pantani, who won on the Alpe two years earlier, attacked three times and only Jan Ullrich could match him. He lasted until from the summit and Pantani rode on alone to win in what is often quoted as record speed (see below).

1999: Giuseppe Guerini, who broke away on his own, collided with a spectator but got up and went on to win the stage.

2001: Lance Armstrong feigned vulnerability earlier in the stage, appearing to be having an off-day. At the bottom of the Alpe d&#x27;Huez climb, Armstrong moved to the front of the lead group of riders and then looked back at Jan Ullrich. Armstrong later commented that he wasn&#x27;t looking back at Ullrich but was actually looking back to see the position of his teammate Chechu Rubiera. Seeing no response from Ullrich, Armstrong accelerated away from the field to claim the victory, 1:59 ahead of Ullrich. Armstrong would later be stripped of this achievement and his tour win by his conviction for doping in 2012. His name however, is still honored on one of the 21 signs of previous winners, lining the hairpin turns of Alpe d&#x27;Huez.

2013: Christophe Riblon won the stage at the summit of Alpe d&#x27;Huez during the 100th edition of the Tour. For the first time ever, riders rode up the climb twice with the descent over the Col de Sarenne in between.

2018: Geraint Thomas, Tom Dumoulin, Chris Froome, Romain Bardet and Mikel Landa were able to catch Steven Kruijswijk, who had been on a 70 km solo attack, about 2/3 of the way up the climb and with about 500 meters to go Thomas dropped the remaining elite riders to become the first rider to win the Alpe d’Huez stage while wearing the yellow jersey.

2022: World cyclo-cross and Olympic mountain-bike champion Tom Pidcock, riding his first Tour, broke away on the Galibier descent, before going solo from a break including four-time Tour winner Chris Froome with around 8 km to go and won on the Alpe, the youngest winner on the Alpe in Tour de France history.

====Winners====

*In 1979 there were two stages at Alpe d&#x27;Huez.&lt;br&gt;
† Stage 18 of the 2013 Tour climbed to Alpe d&#x27;Huez twice. Moreno Moser was the leader at the first time over the summit.

====Fastest ascents====

The climb has been timed since 1994 so earlier times are subject to discussion. From 1994 to 1997 the climb was timed from from the finish. Since 1999 photo-finish has been used from . Other times have been taken from the summit, which is the start of the climb. Others have been taken from the junction from the start.

These variations have led to a debate. Pantani&#x27;s 37m 35s has been cited by &quot;Procycling&quot; and World Cycling Productions, publisher of Tour de France DVDs, and by &quot;Cycle Sport&quot;. In a biography of Pantani, Matt Rendell notes Pantani at: 1994 – 38m 0s; 1995 – 38m 4s; 1997 – 37m 35s. The Alpe tourist association describes the climb as and lists Pantani&#x27;s 37m 35s (23.08 km/h) as the record.

Other sources give Pantani&#x27;s times from 1994, 1995 and 1997 as the fastest, based on timings adjusted for the . Such sources list Pantani&#x27;s time in 1995 as the record at 36m 40s. In &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, Rendell has changed his view and listed it as 36m 50s as does CyclingNews. Second, third, and fourth fastest are Pantani in 1997 (36m 55s), Pantani in 1994 (37m 15s) and Lance Armstrong in 2004 (37m 36s). Jan Ullrich&#x27;s time in 1997 (37m 41s) makes him the fifth fastest, highlighting how the 1990s had faster ascents than other eras.

A number of cycling publications cite times prior to 1994, although distances are typically not included, making comparisons difficult. Coppi has been listed with 45m 22s for 1952.

In the 1980s Gert-Jan Theunisse, Pedro Delgado, Luis Herrera, and Laurent Fignon rode in times stated to be faster than Coppi&#x27;s, but still not breaking 40m. Greg LeMond and Bernard Hinault have been reported as having the times of 48m 0s in 1986.

It was not until Gianni Bugno and Miguel Indurain in 1991, that times faster than 40m were reported, including in the 39m range for Bjarne Riis in 1995 and Richard Virenque in 1997.

====Ascent times====
Some times based on 14.454 km according to Matt Rendell&#x27;s first book, other times based on 13.8 km.

* The 2004 stage was an individual time trial.

†Lance Armstrong, and Floyd Landis admitted to doping and had the Tour de France titles withdrawn. Jan Ullrich also admitted to doping and Virenque was implicated in what, at the time, was the biggest doping scandal in Tour history.

Based on 13.8 km
===Other cycle races===
The peak is also the finish of La Marmotte, a one-day, ride with of climbing.
Stage 8 of the 2024 Tour de France Femmes will end there.

===Mountain biking===
The resort caters for mountain bikers during the summer months, the pinnacle of which is the Megavalanche, a &#x27;Downhill Enduro&#x27; Event that takes riders from lift station at the highest peak, Pic Blanc, to Allemont in the valley floor.

===Triathlon===
Since 2006 Cyrille Neveu has organized the Triathlon EDF Alpe d&#x27;Huez, which has become a major summer attraction.

=== Zwift ===
In 2018, the virtual cycling training and racing program Zwift released a recreation of the Alpe d&#x27;Huez climb called Alpe du Zwift. This virtual version of the climb was created using GPS data from the original route to copy it perfectly in both gradient and distance.

<text>The USS &quot;Defiant&quot; is the name of two starships in the Star Trek media franchise, most notably featured in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999) and the film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996). Introduced in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s third season, it is a warship attached to the show&#x27;s eponymous space station. The original &quot;Defiant&quot; is destroyed during the Dominion War in the seventh season and replaced with a largely identical ship.

The &quot;Defiant&quot; was designed by Jim Martin, Gary Hutzel and Tony Meinger.

==Design and development==
For the first two seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, stories requiring characters to travel off-station typically involved small runabout vessels. Producer Ira Steven Behr and writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe believed runabouts would be insufficient to confront the adversarial Dominion introduced in the second season, and they convinced executive producer Rick Berman of the need for a new ship. Additionally, the &quot;Defiant&quot; was intended to solve the problem of cramped runabout sets.

The &quot;Defiant&quot; was initially designed by art illustrator Jim Martin, with contributions from visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel and modelmaker Tony Meininger. Original designs called for a &quot;beefed-up&quot; runabout-type ship, but this gave way to a full-fledged starship design initially called &quot;Valiant&quot;. This name was dropped out of fear that it would conflict with &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;&#x27;s titular starship, also beginning with a &quot;V&quot;.

An early screenplay for &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996) called for the &quot;Defiant&quot; to be destroyed, but Behr objected and the idea was dropped.

Following the &quot;Defiant&quot;&#x27;s destruction in &quot;The Changing Face of Evil&quot;, the writers had wanted a new type of successor ship but the budget wasn&#x27;t available. As a result, they replaced the &quot;Defiant&quot; with the same spacecraft design for the USS &quot;São Paulo&quot; in &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;. Ron Moore said in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion&quot; that the new ship was intended to be designated &quot;&quot;Defiant&quot;-A&quot;, but it would have been too costly to redo the CG model for one episode because stock shots from earlier episodes had to be used as well for budgetary reasons.

==Depiction==
Benjamin Sisko helped design the &quot;Defiant&quot;, which was conceived as a prototype vessel to counter the Borg. Sisko receives command of the &quot;Defiant&quot; in 2370 to make contact with the Dominion in the show&#x27;s third-season premier. Unlike most Starfleet ships, the &quot;Defiant&quot; is built for combat rather than science and exploration. The &quot;Defiant&quot; remains attached to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; under Sisko&#x27;s command for the remainder of the series, carrying the crew on missions beyond the space station. It appears briefly in &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; under the command of Worf where it&#x27;s left badly damaged and the crew has to evacuate to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E after life support fails. The Breen destroy the &quot;Defiant&quot; during the show&#x27;s finale arc. Starfleet gives Sisko command of a new ship of the same class, the USS &quot;Sao Paulo&quot;, which he is given special dispensation to change the ships name and registry to the same as the previous &quot;Defiant&quot;. The &quot;Defiant&quot; is seen briefly in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; third season episode &quot;The Bounty&quot;, out of commission and docked at Starfleet&#x27;s Fleet Museum. It&#x27;s also amongst the ships that fall under the control of the living construct in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&#x27;s&quot; two-part season one finale &quot;Supernova.&quot;

The &quot;Defiant&quot; also appears in numerous spin-off books, comics, and video games.

==Reception==
The &quot;USS Defiant&quot; is noted as a powerful spacecraft vessel of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe in the late 24th century. CBR compared the maneuverable and powerful &quot;Defiant&quot; to the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. Space.com also noted the &quot;Defiant&quot; as one of the more agile science fiction spacecraft, compared to some of the slower, almost-nautical movement of larger spacecraft of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

The moment when Sisko decloaks the &quot;Defiant&quot; spacecraft for the first time in &quot;The Search&quot; was rated by Geek.com in 2015 as one of the top 35 moments in &quot;Star Trek&quot;; they said it marked a &quot;great start&quot; to the third season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The addition of the &quot;Defiant&quot; helped the show dig deeper into stories set in the Gamma Quadrant, as well as the long war-saga arc of the show&#x27;s later seasons.

A miniature model of the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; sold for 106,000 USD in 2006 at auction.

<text>Palliative care (from Latin root &quot;to cloak&quot;) is an interdisciplinary medical caregiving approach aimed at optimising quality of life and mitigating or reducing suffering among people with serious, complex, and often terminal illnesses. Many definitions of palliative care exist. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes palliative care as:&quot;an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual&quot;. In the past, palliative care involved a disease-specific approach, but today the WHO takes a broader patient-centered approach that suggests that the principles of palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and ultimately fatal illness. This shift was important because if a disease-oriented approach is followed, the needs and preferences of the patient are not fully met and aspects of care, such as pain, quality of life, and social support, as well as spiritual and emotional needs, fail to be addressed. Rather, a patient-centered model prioritises relief of suffering and tailors care to increase the quality of life for terminally ill patients.

Palliative care is appropriate for individuals with serious illnesses across the age spectrum and can be provided as the main goal of care or in tandem with curative treatment. It is ideally provided by interdisciplinary teams which can include physicians, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, chaplains, and dietitians. Palliative care can be provided in a variety of contexts, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, skilled nursing, and home settings. Although an important part of end-of-life care, palliative care is not limited to individuals near the end of life. 

Palliative care focuses primarily on improving the quality of life for those with chronic illnesses and this is supported by evidence. It is commonly the case that palliative care is provided at the end of life, but it can be helpful for a person of any stage of illness that is critical or at any age.

==Scope==

Palliative care is able to improve healthcare quality in three sectors: Physical and emotional relief, strengthening of patient-physician communication and decision-making, and coordinated continuity of care across various healthcare settings, including hospital, home, and hospice. The overall goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life of individuals with serious illness, any life-threatening condition which either reduces an individual&#x27;s daily function or quality of life or increases caregiver burden, through pain and symptom management, identification and support of caregiver needs, and care coordination. Palliative care can be delivered at any stage of illness alongside other treatments with curative or life-prolonging intent and is not restricted to people receiving end-of-life care. Historically, palliative care services were focused on individuals with incurable cancer, but this framework is now applied to other diseases, including severe heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. Forty million people each year are expected to need palliative care, with approximately 78% of this population living in low and middle income countries. However, only 14% of this population is able to receive this kind of care, with a majority in high-income countries, making this an important sector to pay attention to.

Palliative care can be initiated in a variety of care settings, including emergency rooms, hospitals, hospice facilities, or at home. For some severe disease processes, medical specialty professional organizations recommend initiating palliative care at the time of diagnosis or when disease-directed options would not improve a patient&#x27;s prognosis. For example, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that patients with advanced cancer should be &quot;referred to interdisciplinary palliative care teams that provide inpatient and outpatient care early in the course of disease, alongside active treatment of their cancer&quot; within eight weeks of diagnosis.

Appropriately engaging palliative care providers as a part of patient care improves overall symptom control, quality of life, and family satisfaction of care while reducing overall healthcare costs.

=== Palliative care vis-à-vis hospice care ===
The distinction between palliative care and hospice differs depending on global context. In the United States, the term &quot;hospice&quot; refers specifically to a benefit provided by the federal government since 1982. Hospice care services and palliative care programs share similar goals of mitigating unpleasant symptoms, controlling pain, optimizing comfort, and addressing psychological distress. Hospice care focuses on comfort and psychological support and curative therapies are not pursued. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, individuals certified by two physicians to have less than six months to live (assuming a typical course) have access to specialized hospice services through various insurance programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and most health maintenance organizations and private insurers). An individual&#x27;s hospice benefits are not revoked if that individual lives beyond a six-month period. In the United States, in order to be eligible for hospice, patients usually forego treatments aimed at cure, unless they are minors. This is to avoid what is called concurrent care, where two different clinicians are billing for the same service. In 2016 a movement began to extend the reach of concurrent care to adults who were eligible for hospice but not yet emotionally prepared to forego curative treatments.

Outside the United States, the term hospice usually refers to a building or institution that specializes in palliative care. These institutions provide care to patients with end of life and palliative care needs. In the common vernacular outside the United States, hospice care and palliative care are synonymous and are not contingent on different avenues of funding. Over 40% of all dying patients in the United States currently undergo hospice care. Most of the hospice care occurs at a home environment during the last weeks/months of their lives. Of those patients, 86.6% believe their care is &quot;excellent&quot;. Hospice&#x27;s philosophy is that death is a part of life, so it is personal and unique. Caregivers are encouraged to discuss death with the patients and encourage spiritual exploration (if they so wish).

== History ==

The field of palliative care grew out of the hospice movement, which is commonly associated with Dame Cicely Saunders, who founded St. Christopher&#x27;s Hospice for the terminally ill in 1967, and Elisabeth Kübler-Ross who published her seminal work &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; in 1969. In 1974, Balfour Mount coined the term &quot;palliative care&quot;. and Paul Henteleff became the director of a new &quot;terminal care&quot; unit at Saint Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg. In 1987, Declan Walsh established a palliative medicine service at the Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center in Ohio which later expanded to become the training site of the first palliative care clinical and research fellowship as well as the first acute pain and palliative care inpatient unit in the United States. The program evolved into The Harry R. Horvitz Center for Palliative Medicine which was designated as an international demonstration project by the World Health Organization and accredited by the European Society for Medical Oncology as an Integrated Center of Oncology and Palliative Care.

Advances in palliative care have since inspired a dramatic increase in hospital-based palliative care programs. Notable research outcomes forwarding the implementation of palliative care programs include:

* Evidence that hospital palliative care consult teams are associated with significant hospital and overall health system cost savings.
* Evidence that palliative care services increase the likelihood of dying at home and reduce symptom burden without impacting on caregiver grief among the vast majority of Americans who prefer to die at home.
* Evidence that providing palliative care in tandem with standard oncologic care among patients with advanced cancer is associated with lower rates of depression, increased quality of life, and increased length of survival compared to those receiving standard oncologic care and may even prolong survival.

Over 90% of US hospitals with more than 300 beds have palliative care teams, yet only 17% of rural hospitals with 50 or more beds have palliative care teams. Hospice and palliative medicine has been a board certified sub-specialty of medicine in the United States since 2006. Additionally, in 2011, The Joint Commission began an Advanced Certification Program for Palliative Care that recognizes hospital inpatient programs demonstrating outstanding care and enhancement of the quality of life for people with serious illness.

== Practice of palliative care ==
Medications used in palliative care can be common medications but used for a different indication based on established practices with varying degrees of evidence. Examples include the use of antipsychotic medications, anticonvulsants, and morphine. Routes of administration may differ from acute or chronic care, as many people in palliative care lose the ability to swallow. A common alternative route of administration is subcutaneous, as it is less traumatic and less difficult to maintain than intravenous medications. Other routes of administration include sublingual, intramuscular and transdermal. Medications are often managed at home by family or nursing support.

Palliative care interventions in care homes may contribute to lower discomfort for residents with dementia and to improve family members&#x27; views of the quality of care. However, higher quality research is needed to support the benefits of these interventions for older people dying in these facilities.

High-certainty evidence supports the finding that implementation of home-based end-of-life care programs may increase the number of adults who will die at home and slightly improve patient satisfaction at a one-month follow-up. The impact of home-based end-of-life care on caregivers, healthcare staff, and health service costs are uncertain.

=== Pain, distress, and anxiety ===
For many patients, end of life care can cause emotional and psychological distress, contributing to their total suffering. An interdisciplinary palliative care team consisting of a mental health professional, social worker, counselor, as well as spiritual support such as a chaplain, can play important roles in helping people and their families cope using various methods such as counseling, visualization, cognitive methods, drug therapy and relaxation therapy to address their needs. Palliative pets can play a role in this last category.

Total pain

In the 1960s, hospice pioneer Cicely Saunders first introduced the term &quot;total pain&quot; to describe the heterogenous nature of pain. This is the idea that a patient&#x27;s experience of total pain has distinctive roots in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual realm but that they are all still closely linked to one another. Identifying the cause of pain can help guide care for some patients, and impact their quality of life overall.

==== Physical pain ====

Physical pain can be managed using pain medications as long as they do not put the patient at further risk for developing or increasing medical diagnoses such as heart problems or difficulty breathing. Patients at the end of life can exhibit many physical symptoms that can cause extreme pain such as dyspnea (or difficulty breathing), coughing, xerostomia (dry mouth), nausea and vomiting, constipation, fever, delirium, and excessive oral and pharyngeal secretions (&quot;Death Rattle&quot;).
Radiation is commonly used with palliative intent to alleviate pain in patients with cancer. As an effect from radiation may take days to weeks to occur, patients dying a short time following their treatment are unlikely to receive benefit.

==== Psychosocial pain and anxiety ====

Once the immediate physical pain has been dealt with, it is important to remember to be a compassionate and empathetic caregiver that is there to listen and be there for their patients. Being able to identify the distressing factors in their life other than the pain can help them be more comfortable. When a patient has their needs met then they are more likely to be open to the idea of hospice or treatments outside comfort care. Having a psychosocial assessment allows the medical team to help facilitate a healthy patient-family understanding of adjustment, coping and support. This communication between the medical team and the patients and family can also help facilitate discussions on the process of maintaining and enhancing relationships, finding meaning in the dying process, and achieving a sense of control while confronting and preparing for death. For adults with anxiety, medical evidence in the form of high-quality randomized trials is insufficient to determine the most effective treatment approach to reduce the symptoms of anxiety.

==== Spirituality ====

Among spiritual persons, spirituality is typically considered a fundamental component of palliative care. Hospice facilities where palliative care is administered usually have available chaplains.

According to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care, spirituality is a &quot;dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity&quot; and has been associated with &quot;an improved quality of life for those with chronic and serious illness&quot;, especially for patients who are living with incurable and advanced illnesses of a chronic nature. Spiritual beliefs and practices can influence perceptions of pain and distress, as well as quality of life among advanced cancer patients. Spiritual needs are often described in literature as including loving/being loved, forgiveness, and deciphering the meaning of life.

Most spiritual interventions are subjective and complex. Many have not been well evaluated for their effectiveness, however tools can be used to measure and implement effective spiritual care.

==== Nausea and vomiting ====

Nausea and vomiting are common in people who have advanced terminal illness and can cause distress. Several antiemetic pharmacologic options are suggested to help alleviate these symptoms. For people who do not respond to first-line medications, levomepromazine may be used, however there have been insufficient clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of this medication. Haloperidol and droperidol are other medications that are sometimes prescribed to help alleviate nausea and vomiting, however further research is also required to understand how effective these medications may be.

==== Hydration and nutrition ====

Many terminally ill people cannot consume adequate food or drink. Providing medically assisted food or drink to prolong their life and improve the quality of their life is common, however there have been few high quality studies to determine best practices and the effectiveness of these approaches.

==== Symptom assessment ====

One instrument used in palliative care is the &quot;Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale&quot; (ESAS), which consists of eight visual analog scales (VAS) ranging from 0–10, indicating the levels of pain, activity, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sensation of well-being, and sometimes shortness of breath. A score of 0 indicates absence of the symptom, and a score of 10 indicates the worst possible severity. The instrument can be completed by the patient, with or without assistance, or by nurses and relatives.

=== Pediatric palliative care ===

Pediatric palliative care is family-centered, specialized medical care for children with serious illnesses that focuses on mitigating the physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering associated with illness to ultimately optimize quality of life.

Pediatric palliative care practitioners receive specialized training in family-centered, developmental and age-appropriate skills in communication and facilitation of shared decision making; assessment and management of pain and distressing symptoms; advanced knowledge in care coordination of multidisciplinary pediatric caregiving medical teams; referral to hospital and ambulatory resources available to patients and families; and psychologically supporting children and families through illness and bereavement.

==== Symptoms assessment and management of children ====
As with palliative care for adults, symptom assessment and management is a critical component of pediatric palliative care as it improves quality of life, gives children and families a sense of control, and prolongs life in some cases. The general approach to assessment and management of distressing symptoms in children by a palliative care team is as follows:

* Identify and assess symptoms through history taking (focusing on location, quality, time course, as well as exacerbating and mitigating stimuli). Symptoms assessment in children is uniquely challenging due to communication barriers depending on the child&#x27;s ability to identify and communicate about symptoms. Thus, both the child and caregivers should provide the clinical history. With this said, children as young as four years of age can indicate the location and severity of pain through visual mapping techniques and metaphors.
* Perform a thorough exam of the child. Special attention to the child&#x27;s behavioral response to exam components, particularly in regards to potentially painful stimuli. A commonly held myth is that premature and neonatal infants do not experience pain due to their immature pain pathways, but research demonstrates pain perception in these age groups is equal or greater than that of adults. With this said, some children experiencing intolerable pain present with &#x27;psychomotor inertia&#x27;, a phenomenon where a child in severe chronic pain presents overly well behaved or depressed. These patients demonstrate behavioral responses consistent with pain relief when titrated with morphine. Finally, because children behaviorally respond to pain atypically, a playing or sleeping child should not be assumed to be without pain.
* Identify the place of treatment (tertiary versus local hospital, intensive care unit, home, hospice, etc.).
* Anticipate symptoms based on the typical disease course of the hypothesized diagnosis.
* Present treatment options to the family proactively, based on care options and resources available in each of the aforementioned care settings. Ensuing management should anticipate transitions of palliative care settings to afford seamless continuity of service provision across health, education, and social care settings.
* Consider both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment modalities (education and mental health support, administration of hot and cold packs, massage, play therapy, distraction therapy, hypnotherapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and complementary therapies) when addressing distressing symptoms. Respite care is an additional practice that can further aid alleviating the physical and mental pain from the child and their family. By allowing the caregiving to ensue by other qualified individuals, it allows the family time to rest and renew themselves
* Assess how the child perceives their symptoms (based on personal views) to create individualized care plans.
* After the implementation of therapeutic interventions, involve both the child and family in the reassessment of symptoms.

The most common symptoms in children with severe chronic disease appropriate for palliative care consultation are weakness, fatigue, pain, poor appetite, weight loss, agitation, lack of mobility, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, constipation, sadness or depression, drowsiness, difficulty with speech, headache, excess secretions, anemia, pressure area problems, anxiety, fever, and mouth sores. The most common end of life symptoms in children include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, agitation and anxiety, poor concentration, skin lesions, swelling of the extremities, seizures, poor appetite, difficulty with feeding, and diarrhea. In older children with neurologic and neuromuscular manifestations of disease, there is a high burden of anxiety and depression that correlates with disease progression, increasing disability, and greater dependence on carers. From the caregiver&#x27;s perspective, families find changes in behavior, reported pain, lack of appetite, changes in appearance, talking to God or angels, breathing changes, weakness, and fatigue to be the most distressing symptoms to witness in their loved ones.

As discussed above, within the field of adult palliative medicine, validated symptoms assessment tools are frequently utilized by providers, but these tools lack essential aspects of children&#x27;s symptom experience. Within pediatrics, there is not a comprehensive symptoms assessment widely employed. A few symptoms assessment tools trialed among older children receiving palliative care include the Symptom Distress Scale, and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and Childhood Cancer Stressors Inventory. Quality of life considerations within pediatrics are unique and an important component of symptoms assessment. The Pediatric Cancer Quality of Life Inventory-32 (PCQL-32) is a standardized parent-proxy report which assesses cancer treatment-related symptoms (focusing mainly on pain and nausea). But again, this tool does not comprehensively assess all palliative are symptoms issues. Symptom assessment tools for younger age groups are rarely utilized as they have limited value, especially for infants and young children who are not at a developmental stage where they can articulate symptoms.

==== Communication with children and families ====
Within the realm of pediatric medical care, the palliative care team is tasked with facilitating family-centered communication with children and their families, as well as multidisciplinary pediatric caregiving medical teams to forward coordinated medical management and the child&#x27;s quality of life. Strategies for communication are complex as the pediatric palliative care practitioners must facilitate a shared understanding of and consensus for goals of care and therapies available to the sick child amongst multiple medical teams who often have different areas of expertise. Additionally, pediatric palliative care practitioners must assess both the sick child and their family&#x27;s understanding of complex illness and options for care, and provide accessible, thoughtful education to address knowledge gaps and allow for informed decision making. Finally, practitioners are supporting children and families in the queries, emotional distress, and decision making that ensues from the child&#x27;s illness.

Many frameworks for communication have been established within the medical literature, but the field of pediatric palliative care is still in relative infancy. Communication considerations and strategies employed in a palliative setting include:

* Developing supportive relationships with patients and families. An essential component of a provider&#x27;s ability to provide individualized palliative care is their ability to obtain an intimate understanding of the child and family&#x27;s preferences and overall character. On initial consultation, palliative care providers often focus on affirming a caring relationship with the pediatric patient and their family by first asking the child how they would describe themself and what is important to them, communicating in an age and developmentally cognizant fashion. The provider may then gather similar information from the child&#x27;s caregivers. Questions practitioners may ask include &#x27;What does the child enjoy doing? What do they most dislike doing? What does a typical day look like for the child?&#x27; Other topics potentially addressed by the palliative care provider may also include familial rituals as well as spiritual and religious beliefs, life goals for the child, and the meaning of illness within the broader context of the child and their family&#x27;s life.
* Developing a shared understanding of the child&#x27;s condition with the patient and their family. The establishment of shared knowledge between medical providers, patients, and families is essential when determining palliative goals of care for pediatric patients. Initially, practitioners often elicit information from the patient &quot;and&quot; child to ascertain these parties&#x27; baseline understanding of the child&#x27;s situation. Assessing for baseline knowledge allows the palliative care provider to identify knowledge gaps and provide education on those topics. Through this process, families can pursue informed, shared medical decision making regarding their child&#x27;s care. A framework often employed by pediatric palliative care providers is &#x27;ask, tell, ask&#x27; where the provider asks the patient and their family for a question to identify their level of comprehension of the situation, and then subsequently supplements the family&#x27;s knowledge with additional expert knowledge. This information is often conveyed without jargon or euphemism to maintain trust and ensure understanding. Providers iteratively check for comprehension of this knowledge supplementation by asking questions related to previous explanations, as information retention can be challenging when undergoing a stressful experience.
* Establishing meaning and dignity regarding the child&#x27;s illness. As part of developing a shared understanding of a child&#x27;s illness and character, palliative providers will assess both the child and their family&#x27;s symbolic and emotional relationship to disease. As both the somatic and psychologic implications of illness can be distressing to children, palliative care practitioners look for opportunities to establish meaning and dignity regarding the child&#x27;s illness by contextualizing disease within a broader framework of the child&#x27;s life. Derived from the fields of dignity therapy and meaning-centered psychotherapy, the palliative care provider may explore the following questions with the sick child and their family:
** What gives your life meaning, worth, or purpose?
** Where do you find strength and support?
** What inspires you?
** How do you like to be thought of?
** What are you most proud of?
** What are the particular things you would like your family to know or remember about you?
** When was the last time you laughed really hard?
** Are you frightened by all of this? What, in particular, are you most frightened of?
** What is the meaning of this (illness) experience for you? Do you ever think about why this happened to you?
* Assessing preferences for decision making. Medical decision making in a pediatric setting is unique in that it is often the child&#x27;s legal guardians, not the patient, who ultimately consent for most medical treatments. Yet within a palliative care setting, it is particularly consequential to incorporate the child&#x27;s preferences within the ultimate goals of care. Equally important to consider, families may vary in the level of responsibility they want in this decision-making process. Their preference may range from wanting to be the child&#x27;s sole decision makers, to partnering with the medical team in a shared decision making model, to advocating for full deferral of decision-making responsibility to the clinician. Palliative care providers clarify a family&#x27;s preferences and support needs for medical decision making by providing context, information, and options for treatment and medical palliation. In the case of critically ill babies, parents are able to participate more in decision making if they are presented with options to be discussed rather than recommendations by the doctor. Utilizing this style of communication also leads to less conflict with doctors and might help the parents cope better with the eventual outcomes.
* Optimizing the environment for effective conversations around prognosis and goals of care. Essential to facilitating supportive, clear communication around potentially distressing topics such as prognosis and goals of care for seriously ill pediatric patients is optimizing the setting where this communication will take place and developing informed consensus among the child&#x27;s caregiving team regarding goals and options for care. Often, these conversations occur within the context of family meetings, which are formal meetings between families and the child&#x27;s multidisciplinary medical team. Prior to the family meeting, providers often meet to discuss the child&#x27;s overall case, reasonably expected prognosis, and options for care, in addition to clarifying specific roles each provider will take on during the family meeting. During this meeting, the multidisciplinary medical team may also discuss any legal or ethical considerations related to the case. Palliative care providers often facilitate this meeting and help synthesize its outcome for children and their families. Experts in optimized communication, palliative care providers may opt to hold the family meeting in a quiet space where the providers and family can sit and address concerns during a time when all parties are not constrained. Additionally, parents&#x27; preferences regarding information exchange with the sick child present should be clarified. If the child&#x27;s guardians are resistant to disclosing information in front of their child, the child&#x27;s provider may explore parental concerns on the topic. When excluded from family meetings and moments of challenging information exchange, adolescents, in particular, may have challenges with trusting their medical providers if they feel critical information is being withheld. It is important to follow the child&#x27;s lead when deciding whether to disclose difficult information. Additionally, including them in these conversations can help the child fully participate in their care and medical decision making. Finally, it is important to prioritize the family&#x27;s agenda while additionally considering any urgent medical decisions needed to advance the child&#x27;s care.
* Supporting emotional distress. A significant role of the pediatric palliative care provider is to help support children, their families, and their caregiving teams through the emotional stress of illness. Communication strategies the palliative care provider may employ in this role are asking for permission when engaging with potentially distressing conversations, naming emotions witnessed to create opportunities to discuss complex emotional responses to illness, actively listening, and allowing for invitational silence. The palliative care provider may iteratively assess the child and family&#x27;s emotional responses and needs during challenging conversations. At times, the medical team may be hesitant to discuss a child&#x27;s prognosis out of fear of increasing distress. This sentiment is not supported by the literature; among adults, end of life discussions are not associated with increased rates of anxiety or depression. Though this topic is not well studied in pediatric populations, conversations about prognosis have the potential to increase in parental hope and peace of mind.
* SPIKE framework. This is a framework that is designed to assist healthcare workers deliver bad news. The acronym stands for: setting, perception, invitation, knowledge, empathy, and summarize/strategy. When giving bad news it is important to consider the setting, which considers the environment in which the healthcare provider is delivering the news including privacy, sitting, time, and the inclusion of family members. What to say should also be considered, as well as rehearsed. It is important to understand how a patient is receiving the information by asking open ended questions and asking them to repeat what they learned in their own words, which is perception aspect of the framework. The healthcare provider should seek an invitation from the patient to disclose additional information before doing so in order to prevent overwhelming or distressing the patient further. In order to ensure the patient understands what is being told, knowledge must be used. This includes speaking in a way that the patient will understand, using simple words, not being excessively blunt, giving information in small chunks and checking in with the patient to confirm that they understand, and not providing poor information that may not be completely true. In order to alleviate some of a patient&#x27;s distress it is crucial to be empathetic in the sense of understanding how a patient is feeling and the reactions they are having. This can allow one to change how they are delivering information, allow the patient to have time to process the information, or console them if needed. Connecting with patients is an important step in delivering bad news; maintaining eye contact proves that the healthcare provider is present and the patient and family has their full attention. Furthermore, the provider may make a connection by touching the patients shoulder or hand, giving them a physical connection to know that they are not alone. Finally, it is important to summarize all the information given in order to ensure the patient fully understands and takes away the major points. Additionally, patients who have a clear plan for the future are less likely to feel anxious and uncertain, but it is important to ask people if they are ready for that information before providing them with it.

=== Geriatric palliative care ===

With the transition in the population toward lower child mortality and lower death rates, countries around the world are seeing larger elderly populations. In some countries, this means a growing burden on national resources in the shape of social security and health care payments. As aging populations put increasing pressure on existing resources, long-term palliative care for patients&#x27; non-communicable, chronic conditions has emerged as a necessary approach to increase these patient&#x27;s quality of life, through prevention and relief by identifying, assessing, and treating the source of pain and other psychosocial and spiritual problems.

== In religions ==
Doctrine of Catholic Church, as a traditional reference, accepts and supports the use of palliative care. Most of the main religions in the world (and the biggest in amount of believers) are concordant with this point of view.

== In society ==

=== Certification and training for services ===

In most countries, hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, nursing assistants, social workers, chaplains, and caregivers. In some countries, additional members of the team may include certified nursing assistants and home healthcare aides, as well as volunteers from the community (largely untrained but some being skilled medical personnel), and housekeepers.

In the United Kingdom, Palliative Medicine specialist training is delivered alongside Internal Medicine stage two training over an indicative four years. Entry into Palliative medicine training is possible following successful completion of both a foundation programme and a core training programme. There are two core training programmes for Palliative Medicine training:

* Internal Medical Training (IMT)
* Acute Care Common Stem - Internal Medicine (ACCS-IM)

In the United States, the physician sub-specialty of hospice and palliative medicine was established in 2006 to provide expertise in the care of people with life-limiting, advanced disease, and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end of life care.

Caregivers, both family and volunteers, are crucial to the palliative care system. Caregivers and people being treated often form lasting friendships over the course of care. As a consequence caregivers may find themselves under severe emotional and physical strain. Opportunities for caregiver respite are some of the services hospices provide to promote caregiver well-being. Respite may last a few hours up to several days (the latter being done by placing the primary person being cared for in a nursing home or inpatient hospice unit for several days).

In the US, board certification for physicians in palliative care was through the American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine; recently this was changed to be done through any of 11 different speciality boards through an American Board of Medical Specialties-approved procedure. Additionally, board certification is available to osteopathic physicians (D.O.) in the United States through four medical specialty boards through an American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists-approved procedure. More than 50 fellowship programs provide one to two years of specialty training following a primary residency. In the United Kingdom palliative care has been a full specialty of medicine since 1989 and training is governed by the same regulations through the Royal College of Physicians as with any other medical speciality. Nurses, in the United States and internationally, can receive continuing education credits through Palliative Care specific trainings, such as those offered by End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC).

The Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai has offered a physician&#x27;s course in palliative medicine since 2012, the first one of its kind in the country.

=== Regional variation in services ===

In the United States, hospice and palliative care represent two different aspects of care with similar philosophies, but with different payment systems and location of services. Palliative care services are most often provided in acute care hospitals organized around an interdisciplinary consultation service, with or without an acute inpatient palliative care unit. Palliative care may also be provided in the dying person&#x27;s home as a &quot;bridge&quot; program between traditional US home care services and hospice care or provided in long-term care facilities. In contrast over 80% of hospice care in the US is provided at home with the remainder provided to people in long-term care facilities or in free standing hospice residential facilities. In the UK hospice is seen as one part of the speciality of palliative care and no differentiation is made between &#x27;hospice&#x27; and &#x27;palliative care&#x27;.

In the UK palliative care services offer inpatient care, home care, day care and outpatient services, and work in close partnership with mainstream services. Hospices often house a full range of services and professionals for children and adults. In 2015 the UK&#x27;s palliative care was ranked as the best in the world &quot;due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the &quot;National Health Service&quot;, a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue&quot;.

In 2021 the UK&#x27;s National Palliative and End of Life Care Partnership published their six ambitions for 2021–26. These include fair access to end of life care for everyone regardless of who they are, where they live or their circumstances, and the need to maximise comfort and wellbeing. Informed and timely conversations are also highlighted.

=== Acceptance and access ===

The focus on a person&#x27;s quality of life has increased greatly since the 1990s. In the United States today, 55% of hospitals with more than 100 beds offer a palliative-care program, and nearly one-fifth of community hospitals have palliative-care programs. A relatively recent development is the palliative-care team, a dedicated health care team that is entirely geared toward palliative treatment.

Physicians practicing palliative care do not always receive support from the people they are treating, family members, healthcare professionals or their social peers. More than half of physicians in one survey reported that they have had at least one experience where a patient&#x27;s family members, another physician or another health care professional had characterized their work as being &quot;euthanasia, murder or killing&quot; during the last five years. A quarter of them had received similar comments from their own friends or family member, or from a patient.

Despite significant progress that has been made to increase access to palliative care within the United States and other countries, many countries have not yet considered palliative care as a public health problem, and therefore do not include it in their public health agenda. Resources and cultural attitudes both play significant roles in the acceptance and implementation of palliative care in the health care agenda. A study identified the current gaps in palliative care for people with severe mental illness (SMI&#x27;s). They found that due to the lack of resources within both mental health and end of life services people with SMI&#x27;s faced a number of barriers to accessing timely and appropriate palliative care. They called for a multidisciplinary team approach, including advocacy, with a point of contact co-ordinating the appropriate support for the individual. They also state that end of life and mental health care needs to be included in the training for professionals.

A review states that by restricting referrals to palliative care only when patients have a definitive time line for death, something that the study found to often be inaccurate, can have negative implications for the patient both when accessing end of life care, or being unable to access services due to not receiving a time line from medical professionals. The authors call for a less rigid approach to referrals to palliative care services in order to better support the individual, improve quality of life remaining and provide more holistic care.

Many people with chronic pain are stigmatized and treated as opioid addicts. Patients can build a tolerance to drugs and have to take more and more to manage their pain. The symptoms of chronic pain patients do not show up on scans, so the doctor must go off trust alone. This is the reason that some wait to consult their doctor and endure sometimes years of pain before seeking help.

==== Disparities in Access ====
Access to palliative care is not distributed equally across populations, with disparities observed based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Research has shown that marginalized groups are less likely to receive timely and comprehensive palliative care services, leading to differences in end-of-life experiences. These disparities stem from systemic healthcare inequities, financial barriers, cultural differences, and structural racism within medical institutions.

===== Racial and Ethnic Disparities =====
Studies have found that racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous populations, have lower access to palliative care compared to White patients. Non-Hispanic Black individuals, for example, are significantly less likely to enroll in hospice services or complete advance care planning documents, which can lead to more aggressive medical interventions at the end of life rather than comfort-focused care. Contributing factors include mistrust of the medical system, differences in communication about end-of-life care, and provider biases that may affect the type of recommendations given to minority patients.

===== Socioeconomic Disparities =====
Lower-income individuals are less likely to receive palliative care services, often facing greater barriers due to financial constraints, lack of insurance coverage, and limited healthcare infrastructure in low-income and rural areas. Those living in poverty have higher rates of unmanaged symptoms and may be more likely to receive care in emergency settings rather than through specialized palliative care programs. Economic disparities in healthcare access contribute to differing end-of-life experiences, with wealthier individuals more likely to receive personalized, home-based palliative care services.

== In media ==
Palliative care was the subject of the 2018 Netflix short documentary, &quot;End Game&quot; by directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman about terminally ill patients in a San Francisco hospital and features the work of palliative care physician, BJ Miller. The film&#x27;s executive producers were Steven Ungerleider, David C. Ulich and Shoshana R. Ungerleider.

In 2016, an open letter to the singer David Bowie written by a palliative care doctor, Professor Mark Taubert, talked about the importance of good palliative care, being able to express wishes about the last months of life, and good tuition (nutrition?) and education about end of life care generally. The letter went viral after David Bowie&#x27;s son Duncan Jones shared it. The letter was subsequently read out by the actor Benedict Cumberbatch and the singer Jarvis Cocker at public events.

== Research ==

Research funded by the UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) has addressed these areas of need. Examples highlight inequalities faced by several groups and offers recommendations. These include the need for close partnership between services caring for people with severe mental illness, improved understanding of barriers faced by Gypsy, Traveller and Roma communities, the provision of flexible palliative care services for children from ethnic minorities or deprived areas.

Other research suggests that giving nurses and pharmacists easier access to electronic patient records about prescribing could help people manage their symptoms at home. A named professional to support and guide patients and carers through the healthcare system could also improve the experience of care at home at the end of life. A synthesised review looking at palliative care in the UK created a resource showing which services were available and grouped them according to their intended purpose and benefit to the patient. They also stated that currently in the UK palliative services are only available to patients with a timeline to death, usually 12 months or less. They found these timelines to often be inaccurate and created barriers to patients accessing appropriate services. They call for a more holistic approach to end of life care which is not restricted by arbitrary timelines.

<doc id="275510" wikidata="Q1064959" url="?curid=275510" title="Beer pong">
<text>Beer pong, also known as Beirut, is a drinking game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side. Each team then takes turns attempting to throw ping-pong balls into the opponent&#x27;s cups. If the team &quot;makes&quot; a cup - that is, the ball lands in it, and stays in it - the contents of the cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent&#x27;s cups is the winner.

==Venues==

Beer pong is played at parties, bars, and at colleges and universities, along with other venues such as tailgating at sporting events.

==Origin and name==
The game was originally believed to have evolved from the original beer pong played with paddles which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of Dartmouth College in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual ping pong game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names &quot;Beer Pong&quot; and &quot;Beirut&quot; were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s. In some places, &quot;Beer Pong&quot; refers to the version of the game with paddles, and &quot;Beirut&quot; to the version without.

Bucknell University&#x27;s student-run newspaper, &quot;The Bucknellian&quot;, claims Delta Upsilon fraternity members at Bucknell created &quot;Throw Pong&quot;, a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s, and that &quot;Throw Pong&quot; was then brought to Lehigh University by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.

The origin of the name &quot;Beirut&quot; is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, the student newspaper at Princeton University, suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the Lebanese Civil War. Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly mortar fire.

==Setup==
===Teams===
Beer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.

===Playing field===
Although the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables. However, the game can be played on any flat surface.

===Equipment===
The most common cups used are disposable plastic cups (such as red Solo cups) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team. Games typically use ten cups. Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.

===Alcohol===
An inexpensive pale lager or light beer of 3.2–5% ABV is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games. Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at Utah State University, where alcohol is not allowed on campus; root beer is used instead. For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.

==Gameplay==
Traditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth &quot;official&quot; rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of &quot;house rules&quot; which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. &quot;West Coast rules&quot;) or may vary on a &quot;house-by-house&quot; basis. Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.

The order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth. A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for &quot;&quot;re-racking&quot; (also known as &quot;reforming&quot;, &quot;rearranging&quot;, &quot;consolidation&quot;&quot;, and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team&#x27;s remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to &quot;re-rack&quot; the cups into a single triangle formation.

Common house rules allow players to &#x27;finger&#x27; or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a &#x27;rollback&#x27; occurs allowing each player on that team to shoot again. In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball &#x27;rollback&#x27; occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.

Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot;. As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.

===Shot techniques===
The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.

Some players throw &quot;fastball&quot; style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup. A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.

A bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.

===Winning the game===
If a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption. If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.

Another &#x27;house rule&#x27; can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a shutout. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going streaking (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.

Also depending on &#x27;house rules&#x27;, there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.

==Health concerns==
The game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become drunken or even intoxicated enough to suffer alcohol poisoning. Some writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to &quot;out of control&quot; college drinking.

The supposed cleaning effects of the water &quot;dunk&quot; cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of young people in Denmark were thought to have contracted the virus as a result of playing a version of the game where they held the table tennis balls in their mouths and spat them into the cups.

==Legal restrictions==
Some municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong from bars or in general because of the belief that it encourages binge drinking (see Health effects above). In Oxford, Ohio, where Miami University is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors. In Arlington, Virginia and Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments. In the fall of 2007, Georgetown University officially banned all beer pong paraphernalia such as custom-built tables and the possession of many ping-pong balls.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine ran an article on July 31, 2008, &quot;The War Against Beer Pong&quot;, which noted legal restrictions and bans on the game in colleges and elsewhere.

In many states, players have taken to placing water in cups to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

==Tournaments and leagues==
Beer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.

The World Series of Beer Pong (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada. WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.

In Belgium, the official Belgian Beer Pong Championship, also known as the Belgian Series of Beer Pong, stands as the nation’s recognized championship event for the sport of beer pong. Held annually since 2014 at the Beats n&#x27; Bots festival in Lichtervelde, this event is widely regarded as Belgium’s national tournament, with official rules and significant media coverage each year. In the beer-loving culture of Belgium, the national championship has established itself as a sporting event, drawing top teams from across the country and a growing, diverse audience.

A more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level. Ordinarily, a group of pong enthusiasts will create teams (partnerships) and play weekly against each other. Sometimes, the leagues have websites, rankings and statistics, while others have been started by college students with the goal of intramural competition such as at University of California, Santa Barbara with the &quot;Isla Vista Beer Pong League&quot;, and at New York University.

==Media==
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and other media outlets have reported on the increase in businesses selling beer pong paraphernalia, such as tables, mats, cups, or clothes. &quot;Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong&quot; is a documentary which follows some competitive players as they prepare for the WSOBP II and ultimately compete against one another for the $20,000 grand prize. This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the CineVegas film festival on June 13, 2008. Rick Reilly wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;.

The Associated Press cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong and posted a video on their website. In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to billiards and darts.

The game has been a recurring segment on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as Betty White, Serena Williams, Anna Kournikova, Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba.

&quot;The Colbert Report&quot; featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.

&quot;Road Trip: Beer Pong&quot;, a sequel to the 2000 comedy &quot;Road Trip&quot;, featured the game prominently. Agnes Scott College, where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.

===Publishing===
On August 29, 2009, Chronicle Books published &quot;The Book of Beer Pong&quot;, a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.

===Bud pong===
Bud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer Anheuser-Busch said involved the drinking of water, not Budweiser or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing &quot;bud pong&quot; kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted a bartender at a club near Clemson University as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had &quot;never seen anyone playing with water. It&#x27;s always beer. It&#x27;s just like any other beer pong.&quot;

Some expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: &quot;Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It&#x27;s preposterous,&quot; while advertising news site Adjab opined that &quot;someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the rolling paper he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco.&quot;

However, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to hygienic concerns of sharing cups with previous players. Using water in game cups also prevents players from needing to drink each scored cup. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This addresses concerns about binge drinking being part of the game. This can also help when there isn&#x27;t enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.

===Video games===

In July 2008, JV Games Inc. released a downloadable video game for the Wii console called &quot;Frat Party Games: Beer Pong&quot;. The ESRB rated it suitable for ages 13 and up, but after this was questioned by Connecticut&#x27;s attorney general, the game was renamed &quot;Frat Party Games: Pong Toss&quot; and all references to alcohol were removed.

In 2013, a &quot;Beer Pong Master&quot; arcade machine was launched by Bay Tek Games, where players throw balls into empty plastic cups at the far end of the machine, attempting to extinguish their electric lights. The next year, Bay Tek released a family entertainment variant called Sink It, where it shares the same purpose, but awards tickets after the game session.

<doc id="275514" wikidata="Q131523" url="?curid=275514" title="Paphiopedilum">
<text>Paphiopedilum, often called the Venus slipper, is a genus of the lady slipper orchid subfamily &quot;Cypripedioideae&quot; of the flowering plant family Orchidaceae. The genus comprises some 80 accepted taxa including several natural hybrids. The genus is native to Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, southern China, New Guinea and the Solomon and Bismarck Islands. The type species of this genus is &quot;Paphiopedilum insigne&quot;.

The species and their hybrids are extensively cultivated, and are known as either paphiopedilums, or by the abbreviation paphs in horticulture.

Due to their popularity, Paphiopedilums have been ruthlessly gathered and poached from the wild, making them very rare or extinct there. As soon as a new species or population is discovered, poachers will take the plants for orchid collectors who pay large sums of money. Habitat destruction is an additional factor contributing to their rarity.

== Description ==

&quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; species naturally occur among humus layers as terrestrials on the forest floor, while a few are true epiphytes and some are lithophytes. These sympodial orchids lack pseudobulbs. Instead, they grow robust shoots, each with several leaves; some are hemicryptophytes. The leaves can be short and rounded or long and narrow and typically have a mottled pattern. When older shoots die, newer ones take over. Each new shoot only blooms once when it is fully grown, producing a raceme between the fleshy, succulent leaves. The roots are thick and fleshy. Potted plants form a tight lump of roots that, when untangled, can be up to 1 m long.

Members of this genus are considered highly collectible by orchid fanciers due to the curious and unusual form of their flowers. Along with &quot;Cypripedium&quot;, &quot;Mexipedium&quot;, &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; and &quot;Selenipedium&quot;, the genus is a member of the subfamily Cypripedioideae, commonly referred to as the &quot;lady&#x27;s-slippers&quot; or &quot;slipper orchids&quot; due to the unusual shape of the pouch-like labellum of the flower. The pouch traps insects seeking nectar, and to leave again they have to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia. Orchids of this genus are notoriously difficult to propagate by tissue culture; as of 2016, commercial cultivation is almost exclusively seed-based. This means every plant is unique.

Members of this genus have unusual stomata. Whereas most land plants&#x27; stomata have guard cells with chloroplasts in their cytoplasm (including those of closely related &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; slipper orchids), &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; stomata do not. This difference results in simpler, but weaker control of stomatal function. For example, most plants close their stomata in response to either blue or red light, but &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; guard cells only respond to blue light. The fact that they lack chloroplasts has made them valuable to researchers investigating stomatal function. For example, it enabled the discovery of intracellular events that precede stomatal closure.

== In horticulture ==
The paphiopedilums are among the most widely cultivated and hybridized of orchid genera. Spectacular new species are being discovered every now and then; for example the golden slipper orchid (&quot;P. armeniacum&quot;), discovered in 1979 and described in 1982, amazed growers of orchids by the extraordinary beauty of its golden flowers. In addition, growers have bred thousands of interspecific hybrids and registered them with the Royal Horticultural Society in London over the years.

&quot;Paphiopedilums&quot; are terrestrial and evergreen in growth habit, and by careful selection of species and hybrids, it is possible to have a flowering period extending over nine months of the year. They can be grown indoors, as long as conditions that mimic their natural habitats are created. Most species thrive in moderate to high humidity (50–70%), moderate temperatures ranging from 13 to 35 degrees Celsius and low light of 12,000 to 20,000 lux. Modern hybrids are typically easier to grow in artificial conditions than their parent species.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==






The genus name &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; was established by Ernst Hugo Heinrich Pfitzer in 1886; it is derived from Paphos (a city in Cyprus, a place sacred to Aphrodite. It was said she landed at the site when rose from the sea as her birth.) and Ancient Greek &quot;pedilon&quot; &quot;slipper&quot;. No paphiopedilum occurs on Cyprus – at least not as the genus is understood today. But it was long mixed up with its Holarctic relative &quot;Cypripedium&quot;, which grows in the Mediterranean region. &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; was made a valid taxon in 1959, but its use has become restricted to eastern Asian species in our time.

<text>Mont-Saint-Michel (; Norman: &quot;Mont Saint Miché&quot;; ) is a tidal island and mainland commune in Normandy, France.

The island lies approximately off France&#x27;s north-western coast, at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches and is in area. The mainland part of the commune is in area so that the total surface of the commune is . , the island had a population of 29.

The commune&#x27;s position—on an island just a few hundred metres from land—made it accessible at low tide to the many pilgrims to its abbey, and defensible as the incoming tide stranded, drove off, or drowned would-be assailants. The island remained unconquered during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. A small garrison fended off a full attack by the English in 1433. Louis XI recognised the benefits of its natural defence and turned it into a prison. The abbey was used regularly as a prison during the Ancien Régime.

Mont-Saint-Michel and its surrounding bay were inscribed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979 for its unique aesthetic and importance as a Catholic site. It is visited by more than three million people each year, and is the most-visited tourist attraction in France outside of Paris. Over 60 buildings within the commune are protected as historical monuments.

==Geography==

===Formation===
Now a rocky tidal island, the mount occupied dry land in prehistoric times. As sea levels rose, erosion reshaped the coastal landscape, and several outcrops of granite emerged in the bay, having resisted the wear and tear of the ocean better than the surrounding rocks. These included Lillemer, Mont Dol, Tombelaine (the island just to the north), and Mont Tombe, later called Mont-Saint-Michel.

Mont-Saint-Michel consists of leucogranite which solidified from an underground intrusion of molten magma about , during the Cambrian period, as one of the younger parts of the Mancellian granitic batholith. Early studies of Mont-Saint-Michel by French geologists sometimes describe the leucogranite of the Mont as &quot;granulite&quot;, but this granitic meaning of granulite is now obsolete.

The mount has a circumference of about and its highest point is above sea level.

===Tides===
The tides vary greatly, at roughly between highest and lowest water marks. Popularly nicknamed &quot;St. Michael in peril of the sea&quot; by medieval pilgrims making their way across the flats, the mount can still pose dangers for visitors who avoid the causeway and attempt the hazardous walk across the sands from the neighbouring coast.

Polderisation and occasional flooding have created salt marsh meadows that were found to be ideally suited to grazing sheep. The well-flavoured meat that results from the diet of the sheep in the (salt meadow) makes (), a local specialty that may be found on the menus of restaurants that depend on income from the many visitors to the mount.

===Tidal island===
The connection between Mont-Saint-Michel and the mainland has changed over the centuries. Previously connected by a tidal causeway uncovered only at low tide, this was converted into a raised causeway in 1879, preventing the tide from scouring the silt around the mount. The coastal flats have been polderised to create pastureland, decreasing the distance between the shore and the island, and the Couesnon river has been canalised, reducing the dispersion of the flow of water. These factors have all encouraged silting-up of the bay.

In June 2006, French prime minister Dominique de Villepin and regional authorities announced a project () to build a hydraulic dam using the waters of the Couesnon and the tides to help remove the accumulated silt, and to make Mont-Saint-Michel an island again. The construction of the dam began in 2009. The project included the removal of the causeway and its visitor car park. Since April 2012, the new car park on the mainland has been located from the island. Visitors can walk or use shuttles to cross the causeway.

In July 2014, the new bridge, by architect Dietmar Feichtinger, was opened to the public. The light bridge allows waters to flow freely around the island and improves the efficiency of the now-operational dam. The bridge, which cost , was opened by President François Hollande.

On rare occasions, tidal circumstances produce an extremely high &quot;supertide&quot;. The new bridge was completely submerged on 21 March 2015 by the highest sea level, a once-in-18-years occurrence, as crowds gathered to snap photos.

==History==
===From the 8th century onward===
Before the construction of the first monastic establishment in the 8th century, the island was called &quot;Mont Tombe&quot; (). According to a legend, the archangel Michael appeared in 708 to Aubert of Avranches, the bishop of Avranches, and instructed him to build a church on the rocky islet.

Unable to defend his kingdom against the assaults of the Vikings, the king of the Franks agreed to grant the Cotentin Peninsula and the Avranchin, including Mont-Saint-Michel traditionally linked to the city of Avranches, to the Bretons in the Treaty of Compiègne. This marked the beginning of a brief period of Breton possession of the Mont. In fact, these lands and Mont-Saint-Michel were never really included in the duchy of Brittany. Around 989–990 these traditional bishoprics, dependent of the archbishopric of Rouen and that had been left vacant during the time of the Viking raids, regained their bishops.

The mount gained strategic significance again in 933 when William I Longsword annexed the Cotentin Peninsula from the weakened Duchy of Brittany. This made the mount definitively part of Normandy, and is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which commemorates the Norman Conquest. Harold Godwinson is pictured on the tapestry rescuing two Norman knights from the quicksand in the tidal flats during the Breton–Norman war. Norman ducal patronage financed the spectacular Norman architecture of the abbey in subsequent centuries.

In 1067, the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel gave its support to William the Conqueror in his claim to the English throne. This he rewarded with properties and grounds on the English side of the Channel, including a small island off the southwestern coast of Cornwall which was modelled after Mont-Saint-Michel and became a Norman priory named St Michael&#x27;s Mount of Penzance.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, English forces unsuccessfully besieged Mont-Saint-Michel (which was under French control) twice. The first siege started in 1423, and was lifted the next year. In 1433, an English force equipped with wrought-iron bombards and under the command of Thomas Scales, 7th Baron Scales again besieged the island. It was likewise lifted the next year. Scales&#x27;s men abandoned two bombards they had used during the siege on 17 June 1434; they were recovered by the French and are currently on display.

When Louis XI of France founded the Order of Saint Michael in 1469, he intended that the abbey church of Mont-Saint-Michel become the chapel for the order, but because of its great distance from Paris, his intention could never be realized.

The wealth and influence of the abbey extended to many daughter foundations, including St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall. Its popularity and prestige as a centre of pilgrimage waned with the Reformation, and by the time of the French Revolution there were scarcely any monks in residence. The abbey was closed and converted into a prison, initially to hold clerical opponents of the republican regime. High-profile political prisoners followed. By 1836, influential figures—including Victor Hugo—had launched a campaign to restore what was seen as a national architectural treasure. The prison was closed in 1863.

In 1872, French architect of historic monuments Édouard Corroyer was responsible for assessing the condition of Mont-Saint-Michel. It took him about two years to convince his minister to classify it as a historic monument, and it was officially declared as such in 1874. From then on Corroyer, a member of the Academy of Fine Arts, devoted fifteen years of his life to the restoration of &quot;&quot;. Under his direction, gigantic works were undertaken, starting with the most urgent. He wrote four works on the building.

During the occupation of France in World War II, German soldiers occupied Mont-Saint-Michel, where they used St. Aubert church as a lookout post. The island was a major attraction for German tourists and soldiers, with around 325,000 German tourists from July 18, 1940, to the end of the occupation of France.

After the Allies&#x27; initial D-Day invasion of Normandy that began on June 6, 1944, many exhausted German soldiers retreated to strongholds like Mont-Saint-Michel. On August 1, 1944, a single American soldier – Private Freeman Brougher of Pennsylvania and the 72nd Publicity Service Battalion – reached and liberated Mont-Saint-Michel accompanied by two British reporters, Gault MacGowan of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and Paul Holt with the &quot;London Daily Express&quot;. Jubilant crowds of locals greeted Brougher, Holt and MacGowan, and Brougher signed the Golden Book, the island&#x27;s record of visiting nobility, at the mayor&#x27;s invitation. The abbey was also used as a prison for the first time since the French Revolution when male collaborators with the Germans were jailed there.

Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979, listed with criteria such as cultural, historical, and architectural significance, as well as human-created and natural beauty.

In June 2023, President Emmanuel Macron visited Mont-Saint-Michel to mark the 1,000-year anniversary of the abbey. He stated that the changes since the hydraulic dam and the new bridge opened have lessened the silting, making it an island again.

===Abbey design===


In the 11th century, William of Volpiano, the Italian architect who had built Fécamp Abbey in Normandy, was chosen by Richard II, Duke of Normandy, to be the building contractor. He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey, daringly placing the transept crossing at the top of the mount. Many underground crypts and chapels had to be built to compensate for this weight. These formed the basis for the supportive upward structure that can be seen today. Today Mont-Saint-Michel is seen as a building of Romanesque architecture.

Robert de Thorigny, a great supporter of Henry II of England, who was also Duke of Normandy, reinforced the structure of the buildings and built the main façade of the church in the 12th century. In 1204, Guy of Thouars, regent for the Duchess of Brittany, as vassal of the King of France, undertook a siege of the Mount. After setting fire to the village and massacring the population, he beat a retreat under the powerful walls of the abbey. The fire which he lit extended to the buildings, and the roofs fell prey to the flames. Horrified by the cruelty of his Breton ally, Philip Augustus offered Abbot Jordan a grant for the reconstruction of the abbey in the new Gothic architectural style.

Charles VI is credited with adding major fortifications to the abbey-mount, building towers, successive courtyards, and strengthening the ramparts.

===Development===
==Administration==
The islet belongs to the French commune of Le Mont-Saint-Michel, in the département of Manche, in Normandy. The nearest significant town, with an SNCF train station, is Pontorson, with a population of slightly over 4,000. Mont-Saint-Michel belongs to the Organization of World Heritage Cities.

==Population==


==The Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem==
Since June 2001, following the appeal addressed to them in 2000 by Jacques Fihey, Bishop of Coutances and Avranches, a community of monks and nuns of the Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem, sent from the mother-house of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais in Paris, have been living as a community on Mont-Saint-Michel. They replaced the Benedictine monks who returned to the mount in 1966. They are tenants of the centre for national monuments and are not involved in the management of the abbey.

The community has seven sisters and four brothers. Their life revolves around prayer, work and fraternal life. The community meets four times a day to recite the liturgical office in the abbey, or in the crypt of Notre-Dame des Trente Cierges in winter. In 2012, the community undertook the renovation of a house on the mount, the Logis Saint-Abraham, which is used as a guest house for pilgrims on retreat.

==People and places of note==
* Robert of Torigni, famous abbot of the mount;
* The Duke of Chartres (later Louis-Philippe I) came to demolish the &quot;iron cage&quot;;

==Economy==
The Mont-Saint-Michel has long &quot;belonged&quot; to some families who shared the businesses in the town and ran the village administration. Tourism is almost the sole source of income of the commune, bringing US$63 million to the small island in 2014. There are about 50 shops for three million tourists. About 25 people sleep every night on the mount, monks included, except for those in hotels. There are 132 hotel rooms within the island&#x27;s walls. The main institutions are shared by:
* Eric Vannier, owner of the group Mère Poulard (holding half of restaurants, shops, hotels and three museums);
* Jean-Yves Vételé, CEO of Sodetour (five hotels, a supermarket and shops—all extramural—including Mercury Barracks);

Overtourism is a problem for Mont-Saint-Michel, exacerbated by tourists mostly visiting on day-trips, which causes overcrowding from 10:00 to 16:00, especially in the summer. The Mont-Saint-Michel foundation has introduced measures to change this pattern and reduce daytime overcrowding, including by introducing free parking after 18:30, except during July and August.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
* Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima, Japan, where Itsukushima Shrine, another UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located.

Historically, Mont-Saint-Michel was the Norman counterpart of St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall, UK, which was given to the Benedictines, the religious order of Mont-Saint-Michel, by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The two mounts share the same tidal island characteristics and a similar conical shape, though Mont-Saint-Michel is much taller.

==Modern pilgrimage==

During the medieval period, pilgrims walked from Italy, Germany and England, as well as other parts of France. Such devotees were known as Miquelots. Modern pilgrims can follow the same routes. Ten hiking trails have been created that enable pilgrims from various European countries to retrace the path their ancestors may have taken during a medieval pilgrimage.

==In popular culture==

=== Cinema ===
Part of the action in Helen MacInnes&#x27;s 1943 film thriller &quot;Assignment in Brittany&quot; takes place at the Mont, including a dramatic nighttime chase across the sands. Peter Jackson is said to have taken inspiration from Mont-Saint-Michel in designing Gondor&#x27;s capital city, Minas Tirith, in his 2003 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

The town and castle in the 2010 Disney hit film &quot;Tangled&quot; are based on Mont-Saint-Michel.

=== Video games ===
Mont-Saint-Michel is a World Wonder in &quot;Civilization VI&quot;. Mont-Saint-Michel is featured in &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot; in which the abbey is overrun by demons in both the 16th and 21st centuries and subsequently destroyed.

A fictionalized version of the island, Beaumont-Saint-Denis, serves as the location for &quot;Sniper Elite 5&quot;&#x27;s third mission. The castle is also the inspiration for the site of the climactic final battle in the air combat video game &quot;The Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces&quot;, in which it is an abandoned enemy fortress with still-operational anti-air turrets; It also inspires the castle that appears on the cover art of the 1997 video game: Castlevania Symphony of the Night and &quot;Dark Souls&#x27;&quot; New Londo Ruins.

=== Television ===
The Mont-Saint-Michel–inspired village and castle from &quot;Tangled&quot; return in &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Tangled Adventure&quot; and &quot;.&quot;

<text>Edwin Muir CBE (15 May 1887 – 3 January 1959) was a Scottish poet, novelist and translator. Born on a farm in Deerness, a parish of Orkney, Scotland, he is remembered for his deeply felt and vivid poetry written in plain language and with few stylistic preoccupations.

==Biography==
Muir was born at the farm of Folly in Deerness, the same parish in which his mother was born. The family then moved to the island of Wyre, followed by a return to the Mainland, Orkney. In 1901, when he was 14, his father lost his farm, and the family moved to Glasgow. In his autobiography he wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m an Orkneyman, a good Scandinavian&quot;. His parents and two brothers died within a few years. As a young man he worked in unpleasant jobs in factories and offices, including working in a factory that turned bones into charcoal. &quot;He suffered psychologically in a most destructive way, although perhaps the poet of later years benefitted from these experiences as much as from his Orkney &#x27;Eden&#x27;.&quot;

In 1919, Muir married Willa Anderson, and the couple moved to London. About this, Muir wrote simply &#x27;My marriage was the most fortunate event in my life&#x27;. Edwin and Willa worked together on many translations; these were issued under their joint names. Notable among them were their translation of works by Franz Kafka. They had translated &quot;The Castle&quot; within six years of Kafka&#x27;s death. In &quot;Belonging&quot;, her memoir of Edwin Muir, Willa describes the method of translation they adopted in their Kafka translations:

Willa was the more able linguist and the major contributor. Willa recorded in her journal that &quot;It was ME&quot; and that Edwin &quot;only helped&quot;. Between 1924 and the start of the Second World War their translations financed their life together. They produced acclaimed English translations of Kafka, Lion Feuchtwanger, Gerhart Hauptmann, Sholem Asch, Heinrich Mann, and Hermann Broch. In 1958, Edwin and Willa were granted the first Johann-Heinrich-Voss Translation Award. Many of their translations of German novels are still in print.

Between 1921 and 1923, Muir lived in Prague, Dresden, Italy, Salzburg and Vienna; he returned to the UK in 1924. Between 1925 and 1956, Muir published seven volumes of poetry which were collected after his death and published in 1991 as &quot;The Complete Poems of Edwin Muir&quot;. From 1927 to 1932 he published three novels, and in 1935 he came to St Andrews, where he produced his controversial &quot;Scott and Scotland&quot; (1936). In 1939 in St Andrews, Muir had a religious experience and from then onwards thought of himself as Christian, seeing Christianity as being as revolutionary as socialism. From 1946 to 1949 he was Director of the British Council in Prague and Rome. 1950 saw his appointment as Warden of Newbattle Abbey College (a college for working-class men) in Midlothian, where he met fellow Orcadian poet, George Mackay Brown. He was awarded a CBE in the 1953 Coronation Honours. In 1955 he was made Norton Professor of English at Harvard University. He returned to Britain in 1956 and died in 1959 in Cambridge. He was buried in Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire.
A memorial bench was erected in 1962 to Muir in Swanston, Edinburgh, where he spent time during the 1950s. His wife wrote a memoir of their life together in 1967. She lived for another eleven years and died on the Isle of Bute.

==Work==
His childhood in remote and unspoiled Orkney represented an idyllic Eden to Muir, while his family&#x27;s move to the city corresponded in his mind to a deeply disturbing encounter with the &quot;fallen&quot; world. Muir came to regard his family&#x27;s movement from Orkney to Glasgow as a movement from Eden to Hell. The emotional tensions of that dichotomy shaped much of his work and deeply influenced his life. The following quotation expresses the basic existential dilemma of Muir&#x27;s life:

&quot;I was born before the Industrial Revolution, and am now about two hundred years old. But I have skipped a hundred and fifty of them. I was really born in 1737, and till I was fourteen no time-accidents happened to me. Then in 1751 I set out from Orkney for Glasgow. When I arrived I found that it was not 1751, but 1901, and that a hundred and fifty years had been burned up in my two-days&#x27; journey. But I myself was still in 1751, and remained there for a long time. All my life since I have been trying to overhaul that invisible leeway. No wonder I am obsessed with Time.&quot; (Extract from Diary 1937–39.)

His psychological distress led him to undergo Jungian analysis in London. A vision in which he witnessed the creation strengthened the Edenic myth in his mind, leading him to see his life and career as the working-out of an archetypal fable. In his &quot;Autobiography&quot; he wrote, &quot;the life of every man is an endlessly repeated performance of the life of man...&quot;. He also expressed his feeling that our deeds on Earth constitute &quot;a myth which we act almost without knowing it&quot;. Alienation, paradox, the existential dyads of good and evil, life and death, love and hate, and images of journeys and labyrinths are key elements in his work.

His &quot;Scott and Scotland&quot; advanced the claim that Scotland can create a national literature only by writing in English, an opinion that placed him in direct opposition to the Lallans movement of Hugh MacDiarmid. He had little sympathy for Scottish nationalism.

In 1965 a volume of his selected poetry was edited and introduced by T. S. Eliot.

==Legacy==

In an appreciation of Muir&#x27;s poetry in &quot;Texas Quarterly&quot;, the critic Kathleen Raine wrote in 1961: &quot;Time does not fade [Muir&#x27;s poems], and it becomes clear that their excellence owes nothing to the accidental circumstances of the moment at which the poet wrote, or we read, his poems; they survive, as it were, a change of background, and we begin to see that whereas the &#x27;new&#x27; movements of this or that decade lose their significance when the scene changes and retain only a historical interest, Edwin Muir, a poet who never followed fashion, has in fact given more permanent expression to his world than other poets who deliberately set out to be the mouth-pieces of their generation.&quot;

Similarly, Joseph H. Summers, in a retrospective assessment in the &quot;Massachusetts Review&quot;, called Muir&#x27;s achievement in poetry and prose &quot;larger than the merely literary. He did not share in the modern attempts to deify poetry, or language, or even the human imagination. Implicit in all of his works is the recognition that there are things more important than literature—life and love, the physical world, the individual spirit within its body: those things in which the religious man recognizes the immediate work of God. Muir&#x27;s triumph was less in the technological realm of communication than in the vastly more difficult realm of sensitivity, perception, wisdom, the things which he communicated. It was a triumph made possible only, in the familiar paradox, by humility.&quot;

<doc id="275519" wikidata="Q1374" url="?curid=275519" title="Matterhorn">
<text>The (, ; ; ; or ) is a mountain of the Alps, straddling the main watershed and border between Italy and Switzerland. It is a large, near-symmetric pyramidal peak in the extended Monte Rosa area of the Pennine Alps, whose summit is above sea level, making it one of the highest summits in the Alps and Europe. The four steep faces, rising above the surrounding glaciers, face the four compass points and are split by the &quot;Hörnli&quot;, &quot;Furggen&quot;, &quot;Leone&quot;/&quot;Lion&quot;, and &quot;Zmutt&quot; ridges. The mountain overlooks the Swiss town of Zermatt, in the canton of Valais, to the northeast; and the Italian town of Breuil-Cervinia in the Aosta Valley to the south. Just east of the Matterhorn is Theodul Pass, the main passage between the two valleys on its north and south sides, which has been a trade route since the Roman Era.

The Matterhorn was studied by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in the late eighteenth century, and was followed by other renowned naturalists and artists, such as John Ruskin, in the 19th century. It remained unclimbed after most of the other great Alpine peaks had been attained and became the subject of an international competition for the summit. The first ascent of the Matterhorn was in 1865 from Zermatt by a party led by Edward Whymper, but during the descent, a sudden fall claimed the lives of four of the seven climbers. This disaster, later portrayed in several films, marked the end of the golden age of alpinism. The north face was not climbed until 1931 and is among the three biggest north faces of the Alps, known as &quot;The Trilogy&quot;. The west face, the highest of the Matterhorn&#x27;s four faces, was completely climbed only in 1962. It is estimated that over 500 alpinists have died on the Matterhorn, making it one of the deadliest peaks in the world.

The Matterhorn is mainly composed of gneisses (originally fragments of the African Plate before the Alpine orogeny) from the Dent Blanche nappe, lying over ophiolites and sedimentary rocks of the Penninic nappes. The mountain&#x27;s current shape is the result of cirque erosion due to multiple glaciers diverging from the peak, such as the Matterhorn Glacier at the base of the north face. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mountain of Mountains&quot; (), it has become an indelible emblem of the Alps in general. Since the end of the 19th century, when railways were built in the area, the mountain has attracted increasing numbers of visitors and climbers. Each year, numerous mountaineers try to climb the Matterhorn from the Hörnli Hut via the northeast Hörnli ridge, the most popular route to the summit. Many trekkers also undertake the 10-day-long circuit around the mountain. The Matterhorn has been part of the Swiss Federal Inventory of Natural Monuments since 1983.
== Names ==
The name &quot;Matterhorn&quot; derives from the German words &quot;Matte&quot; (&quot;meadow&quot;) and &quot;Horn&quot; (&quot;horn&quot;), and is often translated as &quot;the peak of the meadows&quot;.

In the Schalbetter map, printed by Sebastian Münster in 1545, the valley is labelled &quot;Mattertal&quot;, but the mountain has the Latin name &quot;Mons Silvius&quot; as well as the German name &quot;Augstalberg&quot;, in concord with the Aosta Valley (German &quot;Augstal&quot;). The 1548 map by Johannes Stumpf gives only &quot;Mons Silvius&quot;.

The French name &quot;Cervin&quot;, from which the Italian term &quot;Cervino&quot; derives, stems from the Latin (or &quot;Mons Sylvanus&quot;), where &quot;silva&quot; means &quot;forest&quot;; this was corrupted to &quot;Selvin&quot; and then &quot;Servin&quot;. The change of the first letter &quot;s&quot; to &quot;c&quot; is attributed to Horace Bénédict de Saussure, who thought the word was related to &quot;deer&quot; (French: &quot;cerf&quot; and Italian: &quot;cervo&quot;).
Josias Simler hypothesized in &quot;De Alpibus Commentarius&quot; (1574) that the name Mons Silvius was readopted by T. G. Farinetti: &quot;Silvius was probably a Roman leader who sojourned with his legions in the land of the Salassi and the Seduni, and perhaps crossed the Theodul Pass between these two places. This Silvius may have been that same Servius Galba whom Caesar charged with the opening up of the Alpine passes, which from that time onward traders have been wanting to cross with great danger and grave difficulty. Servius Galba, in order to carry out Caesar&#x27;s orders, came with his legions from Allobroges (Savoy) to Octodurum (Martigny) in the Valais, and pitched his camp there. The passes which he had orders to open from there could be no other than the St. Bernard, the Simplon, the Theodul, and the Moro; it therefore seems likely that the name of Servius, whence Silvius and later Servin, or Cervin, was given in his honour to the famous pyramid.&quot; It is unknown when the new name of Servin, or Cervin, replaced the old, from which it seems to be derived.

The Matterhorn is also named &quot;Gran Bècca&quot; (&quot;big mountain&quot;) by the Valdôtains and &quot;Horu&quot; by the local Walliser German speaking people.

Because of its recognizable shape, many other similar mountains around the world were named or nicknamed &#x27;the Matterhorn of&#x27; their respective countries or mountain ranges.

== Height ==
The Matterhorn has two distinct summits, situated at either end of a exposed rocky crest which forms the Italian/Swiss border. In August 1792, the Genevan geologist and explorer Horace Bénédict de Saussure made the first measurement of the Matterhorn&#x27;s height, using a sextant and a chain spread out on the Theodul glacier. He calculated its height as . In 1868 the Italian engineer Felice Giordano measured a height of by means of a mercury barometer, which he had taken to the summit. The Dufour map, which was afterwards followed by the Italian surveyors, gave as the height of the Swiss summit.

In 1999, the summit height was precisely determined to be at above sea level by using Global Positioning System technology as part of the TOWER Project (Top of the World Elevations Remeasurement) and to an accuracy of less than one centimetre, which allows future changes to be tracked.

The topographic prominence of the Matterhorn is as the ridge connecting it with a higher summit (in this case the Weisshorn, which is the culminating point of the range west of the Mattertal valley) sinks to a height of at the Col Durand, a saddle between the Pointe de Zinal and the Mont Durand. The topographic isolation is , as the nearest point of higher elevation is the higher Western Liskamm.
Considering mountains with a topographic prominence of at least , the Matterhorn is the sixth-highest summit in the Alps and Europe outside the Caucasus Mountains. It is the fifth-highest summit of Valais and Switzerland and the third highest summit of the Aosta Valley and Italy. Locally, it is the third-highest summit in the municipality of Zermatt and the highest summit in the municipality of Valtournenche. On the official International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation list of Alpine four-thousanders, which also includes subsidiary summits of higher mountains such as the nearby Monte Rosa, the Matterhorn is the 12th highest summit in the Alps. 

==Geography==

The Matterhorn has a pyramidal shape with four faces nearly facing the four compass points. Three of them (north, east and west) are on the Swiss side of the border and watershed (Mattertal valley) and one of them (south) is on the Italian side of the border (Valtournenche valley). The north face overlooks the Ober Gabelhorn (7 km away) across the Zmutt Glacier and valley (above Zermatt), the east face overlooks the Gorner Glacier system between the Gornergrat and Monte Rosa (respectively 10 and 17 km away) across the Theodul Pass, the west face overlooks the upper basin of the Zmutt Glacier between the Dent Blanche and the Dent d&#x27;Hérens (respectively 7 and 4 km away) and the south face fronts the resort town of Breuil-Cervinia and overlooks a good portion of the Valtournenche. The Matterhorn does not form a perfect square pyramid, as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces. Moreover, the latter faces do not actually meet on the summit but are connected by a 100-metre-long horizontal west–east ridge between the north and south faces.

The Matterhorn&#x27;s faces are steep, and only small patches of snow and ice cling to them; regular avalanches send the snow down to accumulate on the glaciers at the base of each face, the largest of which are the Tiefmattengletscher to the west, part of the Zmutt Glacier, and the Matterhorn Glacier to the north. Smaller glaciers lie at the base of the south face (the Lower Matterhorn Glacier) and the east face (unnamed). In this area, the border between Switzerland and Italy coincides with the main Alpine watershed, separating the drainage basin of the Rhone on the north (Mediterranean Sea) and that of the Po on the south (Adriatic Sea). The north side is drained by the Zmuttbach (west and north faces) and the Gornera through the Furggbach (east face), tributaries of the Rhone through the (Matter) Vispa. The south side and face is drained by the Marmore torrent, a tributary of the Po through the Dora Baltea (or &quot;Doire baltée&quot;). The Theodul Pass, located on the watershed between the Matterhorn and the Breithorn, at 3,295 metres, is the easiest passage between the two valleys and countries (the slightly lower Furggjoch not being used as a pass). The pass was used as a crossover and trade route for the Romans and the Romanised Celtic population &quot;Salassi&quot; between 100 BCE and 400 CE. The area is now heavily glaciated and covered on the north side by the Theodul Glacier.

Well-known faces are the east and north, visible from the area of Zermatt, although mostly hidden from the Mattertal by the chain of the Weisshorn. The east face is 1,000 metres high and, because it is &quot;a long, monotonous slope of rotten rocks&quot;, presents a high risk of rockfall, making its ascent dangerous. The north face is 1,200 metres high and is one of the most dangerous north faces in the Alps, in particular for its risk of rockfall and storms. The south face, well visible from the Valtournenche, is 1,350 metres high and offers many different routes. The west face, the highest at 1,400 metres, has the fewest ascent routes and lies in a more remote area than the other faces.
The four main ridges separating the four faces are the main climbing routes. The least difficult technical climb and the usual climbing route, the Hörnli ridge (&quot;Hörnligrat&quot;), lies between the east and north faces and is aligned towards the Oberrothorn above Zermatt. To its west lies the Zmutt ridge (&quot;Zmuttgrat&quot;), between the north and west faces and aligned towards the Wandfluehorn; this is, according to Collomb, &quot;the classic route up the mountain, its longest ridge, also the most disjointed.&quot; The &quot;Lion&quot; ridge (&quot;Cresta del Leone&quot; / &quot;Arête du lion&quot;), lying between the south and west faces and aligned towards the Dent d&#x27;Hérens is the Italian normal route and goes across Pic Tyndall; Collomb comments, &quot;A superb rock ridge, the shortest on the mountain, now draped with many fixed ropes, but a far superior climb compared with the Hörnli.&quot; Finally the south side is separated from the east side by the Furggen ridge (&quot;Furggengrat&quot;), which is aligned towards the Klein Matterhorn. It is, according to Collomb, &quot;the hardest of the ridges [...] the ridge still has an awesome reputation but is not too difficult in good conditions by the indirect finish&quot;.

While the Matterhorn is the culminating point of the Valtournenche on the south, it is only one of the many 4000 metres summits of the Mattertal valley on the north. Its height is exceeded by four major summits: the Weisshorn (4,505 m), the Dom (4,545 m), the Liskamm (4,527 m) and the second-highest in the Alps, Monte Rosa (4,634 m). This section of the Pennine Alps, including the Matterhorn, the Zinalrothorn, the Dent Blanche, the Dent d&#x27;Hérens, the Breithorn, the Strahlhorn, the Rimpfischhorn and the Alphubel, concentrates most of western Europe&#x27;s highest mountains and forms a crown of peaks around Zermatt. The deeply glaciated region between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa (named &quot;Dent Blanche-Matterhorn-Monte Rosa&quot;) is listed in the Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments since 1983.

==Weather==
The Matterhorn is an isolated mountain. Because of its position on the main Alpine watershed and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes. In addition, the steep faces of the mountain and its isolated location make it prone to banner clouds formation, with the air flowing around the mountain producing condensation of the air on the lee side and also creating vortices.

==Geology==

The Matterhorn&#x27;s pyramid is composed of Paleozoic rocks, which were thrusted over the Matterhorn&#x27;s Mesozoic base during the Cenozoic. Quaternary glaciation and weathering give the mountain its current shape.

Apart from the base of the mountain, the Matterhorn is composed of gneiss belonging to the Dent Blanche klippe, an isolated part of the Austroalpine nappes, lying over the Penninic nappes. The Austroalpine nappes are part of the Apulian plate, a small continent that broke up from Africa before the Alpine orogeny. For this reason, the Matterhorn has been popularized as an African mountain. The Austroalpine nappes are mostly common in the Eastern Alps.

The Swiss explorer and geologist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, inspired by the view of the Matterhorn, anticipated modern theories of geology:

===Formation===
The formation of the Matterhorn (and the whole Alpine range) started with the break-up of the Pangaea continent 200 million years ago into Laurasia (containing Europe) and Gondwana (containing Africa). While the rocks constituting the nearby Monte Rosa remained in Laurasia, the rocks constituting the Matterhorn found themselves in Gondwana, separated by the newly formed Tethys Ocean.

100 million years ago the extension of the Tethys Ocean stopped and the Apulian plate broke from Gondwana and moved toward the European continent. This resulted in the closure of the western Tethys by subduction under the Apulian plate (with the Piemont-Liguria Ocean first and Valais Ocean later). The subduction of the oceanic crust left traces still visible today at the base of the Matterhorn (accretionary prism). The orogeny itself began after the end of the oceanic subduction when the European continental crust collided with the Apulian continent, resulting in the formation of nappes.

The Matterhorn acquired its characteristic pyramidal shape in much more recent times as it was caused by natural erosion over the past million years. At the beginning of alpine orogeny, the Matterhorn was only a rounded mountain like a hill. Because its height is above the snowline, its flanks are covered by ice, resulting from the accumulation and compaction of snow. During the warmer period of summer, part of the ice melts and seeps into the bedrock. When it freezes again, it fractures pieces of rock because of its dilatation (freeze-thaw), forming a cirque. Four cirques led to the shape of the mountain.

===Rocks===
Most of the base of the mountain lies in the Tsaté nappe, a remnant of the Piedmont-Liguria oceanic crust (ophiolites) and its sedimentary rocks. Up to 3,400 metres the mountain is composed of successive layers of ophiolites and sedimentary rocks. From 3,400 metres to the top, the rocks are gneisses from the Dent Blanche nappe (Austroalpine nappes). They are divided into the Arolla series (below 4,200 m) and the Valpelline zone (the summit). Other mountains in the region (Weisshorn, Zinalrothorn, Dent Blanche, Mont Collon) also belong to the Dent Blanche nappe.

== Tourism and trekking ==
Since the eighteenth century, the Alps have attracted more and more people and fascinated generations of explorers and climbers. The Matterhorn remained relatively little known until 1865, but the successful ascent followed by the tragic accident of the expedition led by Edward Whymper caused a rush on the mountains surrounding Zermatt.

The construction of the railway linking the village of Zermatt from the town of Visp started in 1888. The first train reached Zermatt on 18 July 1891 and the entire line was electrified in 1930. Since 1930 the village is directly connected to St. Moritz by the Glacier Express panoramic train. However, there is no connection with the village of Breuil-Cervinia on the Italian side. Travellers have to hire mountain guides to cross the 3,300-metre-high glaciated Theodul Pass, separating the two resorts. The town of Zermatt remains almost completely free of internal combustion vehicles and can be reached by train only. (Apart from the local police service which uses a Volkswagen car, and the refuse collection lorry, only electric vehicles are used locally).

Rail and cable-car facilities have been built to make some of the summits in the area more accessible. The Gornergrat railway, reaching a record altitude of 3,100 metres, was inaugurated in 1898. Areas served by cable car are the Unterrothorn and the Klein Matterhorn (&quot;Little Matterhorn&quot;) (3,883 m, highest transportation system in Europe). The Hörnli Hut (3,260 m), which is the start of the normal route via the Hörnli ridge, is easily accessible from Schwarzsee (2,600 m) and is also frequented by hikers. The Zermatt and Breuil-Cervinia resorts function as separate ski resort all year round and are connected by skilifts over the Theodul Pass. In 2023, a cable car link between Testa Grigia (or &quot;Tête grise&quot;) and the Klein Matterhorn opened. It finally provided a direct link between the Swiss and Italian side of the Matterhorn.

The Matterhorn Museum (Zermatt) relates the general history of the region from alpinism to tourism. In the museum, which is in the form of a reconstituted mountain village, the visitors can relive the first and tragic ascent of the Matterhorn and see the objects that belonged to the protagonists.

The Tour of the Matterhorn can be effected by trekkers in about 10 days. Considered by some as one of the most beautiful treks in the Alps, it follows many ancient trails that have linked the Swiss and Italian valleys for centuries. The circuit includes alpine meadows, balcony trails, larch forests and glacial crossings. It connects six valleys embracing three different cultures: the German-speaking high Valais, the French-speaking central Valais and the bilingual French/Italian-speaking Aosta Valley. Good conditions are necessary to circumnavigate the peak. After reaching Zinal from Zermatt by the Augstbord and Meiden passes, the trekker crosses the Col de Sorebois and the Col de Torrent before arriving at Arolla. Then the Arolla Glacier and the Col Collon must be crossed on the way to Prarayer, followed by the Col de Valcournera to Breuil-Cervinia. In the last and highest section, the Theodul Pass must be crossed before returning to Zermatt. In total, seven passes between 2,800 and 3,300 metres must be crossed on relatively difficult terrain.

As of 2015, almost two million visitors arrive at Zermatt annually. An average of around twelve people per year have died on Matterhorn in the ten years from 2005 to 2015.

==Climbing history==
The Matterhorn was one of the last of the main Alpine mountains to be ascended, not because of its technical difficulty, but because of the fear it inspired in early mountaineers. The first serious attempts were all from the Italian side, although, despite appearances, the southern routes are technically more difficult. The main figures were Jean-Antoine Carrel and his uncle Jean-Jacques Carrel, from the Valtournenche area, who made the first attempts in 1857 and 1858, reaching on the latter occasion. In July 1860, three brothers from Liverpool attempted the mountain, Alfred, Charles and Sandbach Parker, but they turned back at about . In August of the same year, Jean-Jacques Carrel returned to guide, with , Vaughan Hawkins and John Tyndall to about before turning back. In 1861 the Carrels managed to reach the &quot;Crête du Coq&quot; at . In July 1862, Jean-Antoine, together with César Carrel, accompanied as porters (sic) John Tyndall, Anton Walters and J.J. Bennen to Matterhorn&#x27;s &quot;Shoulder&quot; at , which was subsequently named Pic Tyndall in honor of the client.

Edward Whymper joined the efforts in August 1861, but in his first 7 attempts with a variety of companions could only reach a maximum height of . However, on 14 July 1865, in what is considered the last ascent of the golden age of alpinism, he was able to reach the summit by an ascent of the Hörnli ridge in Switzerland, guided by the famed French mountaineer Michel Croz and the Swiss father and son Peter Taugwalder Sr. and Jr., and accompanied by the British gentlemen Charles Hudson, Lord Francis Douglas, Douglas Robert Hadow. Upon descent, Hadow, Croz, Hudson and Douglas fell to their deaths on the Matterhorn Glacier, and all but Douglas (whose body was never found) are buried in the Zermatt churchyard.

Just three days later, on 17 July 1865, Jean-Antoine Carrel and Jean-Baptiste Bich reached the summit from the Italian side.

=== Before the first ascent ===
In the summer of 1860, Edward Whymper came across the Matterhorn for the first time. He was an English artist and engraver who had been hired by a London publisher to make sketches of the mountains in the region of Zermatt. Although the unclimbed Matterhorn had a mixed reputation among British mountaineers, it fascinated Whymper. Whymper&#x27;s first attempt was in August 1861, from the village of Breuil on the south side. In Châtillon he hired a Swiss guide, who remained anonymous in his accounts, and in Valtournanche he almost hired Jean-Antoine Carrel as well, but, disliking the looks of Carrel&#x27;s uncle, he changed his mind. The Carrels decided to give Matterhorn a try by themselves again, and caught up with Whymper at nightfall. Whymper now had &quot;a strong inclination to engage the pair; but, finally, decided against it&quot; and the Carrels went alone to reach a new high on Matterhorn of the next day. Whymper and his guide camped one more night on the &quot;Col du lion&quot; (= Col Tournanche) and were forced to turn around only an hour above this pass the day after.

In 1862 Whymper made further attempts, still from the south side, on the Lion ridge (or Italian ridge), where the route seemed easier than the Hörnli ridge (the normal route today). On his own, he reached above 4,000 metres, but was injured on his way down to Breuil. In July John Tyndall with Johann Joseph Bennen and another guide overcame most of the difficulties of the ridge that seemed so formidable from below and successfully reached the main shoulder; but at a point not very far below the summit they were stopped by a deep cleft that defied their utmost efforts. The Matterhorn remained unclimbed.

Whymper returned to Breuil in 1863, persuading Carrel to join forces with him and try the mountain once more via the Italian ridge. On this attempt, however, a storm soon developed and they were stuck halfway to the summit. They remained there for 26 hours in their tent before giving up. Whymper did not make another attempt for two years.

In the decisive year 1865, Whymper returned with new plans, deciding to attack the Matterhorn via its south face instead of the Italian ridge. On 21 June, Whymper began his ascent with Swiss guides, but halfway up they experienced severe rockfall; although nobody was injured, they decided to give up the ascent. This was Whymper&#x27;s seventh attempt.

During the following weeks, Whymper spent his time climbing other mountains in the area with his guides, before going back to Breuil on 7 July. Meanwhile, the Italian Alpine Club was founded and its leaders, Felice Giordano and Quintino Sella, established plans to conquer the Matterhorn before any non-Italian could succeed. Felice Giordano hired Carrel as a guide. He feared the arrival of Whymper, now a rival, and wrote to Quintino Sella:


Just as he did two years before, Whymper asked Carrel to be his guide, but Carrel declined; Whymper was also unsuccessful in hiring other local guides from Breuil. When Whymper discovered Giordano and Carrel&#x27;s plan, he left Breuil and crossed the Theodul Pass to Zermatt to hire local guides. He encountered Lord Francis Douglas, a Scottish mountaineer, who also wanted to climb the Matterhorn. They arrived later in Zermatt in the Monte Rosa Hotel, where they met two other British climbers — the Reverend Charles Hudson and his young and inexperienced companion, Douglas Robert Hadow — who had hired the French guide Michel Croz to try to make the first ascent. These two groups decided to join forces and try the ascent of the Hörnli ridge. They hired another two local guides, a father and son, both named Peter Taugwalder.

=== First ascent ===

Whymper and party left Zermatt early in the morning of 13 July 1865, heading to the foot of the Hörnli ridge, which they reached 6 hours later (approximately where the Hörnli Hut is situated today). Meanwhile, Carrel and six other Italian guides also began their ascent of the Italian ridge.

Despite its appearance, Whymper wrote that the Hörnli ridge was much easier to climb than the Italian ridge:
After camping for the night, Whymper and party started on the ridge. According to Whymper:

When the party came close to the summit, they had to leave the ridge for the north face because &quot;[the ridge] was usually more rotten and steep, and always more difficult than the face&quot;. At this point of the ascent Whymper wrote that the less experienced Hadow &quot;required continual assistance&quot;. Having overcome these difficulties the group finally arrived in the summit area, with Croz and Whymper reaching the top first.

Precisely at this moment, Carrel and party were approximatively 400 metres below, still dealing with the most difficult parts of the Italian ridge. When seeing his rival on the summit, Carrel and party gave up on their attempt and went back to Breuil.

After building a cairn, Whymper and party stayed an hour on the summit. Then they began their descent of the Hörnli ridge. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, the elder Taugwalder, Whymper, with the younger Taugwalder coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. Whymper wrote:

The weight of the falling men pulled Hudson and Douglas from their holds and dragged them down the north face. The Taugwalders and Whymper were left alive when the rope linking Douglas to the elder Taugwalder broke. They were stunned by the accident and for a time could not move until the younger Taugwalder descended to enable them to advance. When they were together Whymper asked to see the broken rope and saw that it had been employed by mistake as it was the weakest and oldest of the three ropes they had brought. They frantically looked, but in vain, for traces of their fallen companions. They continued their descent, including an hour in the dark, until 9.30 p.m. when a resting place was found. The descent was resumed at daybreak and the group finally reached Zermatt, where a search of the victims was quickly organized. The bodies of Croz, Hadow and Hudson were found on the Matterhorn Glacier, but the body of Douglas was never found. Although the elder Taugwalder was accused of cutting the rope to save himself and his son, the official inquest found no proof of this.

===Second ascent===
On 16 July, two days after the first ascent and the catastrophe, Jean-Antoine Carrel set out to crown Whymper&#x27;s victory by proving that the Italian side was not unconquerable. He was accompanied by Amé Gorret, a priest who had shared with him the first attempt on the mountain back in 1857. Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet completed the party. Giordano would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one&#x27;s life. After hearing Sunday mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Amé Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: &quot;At last we crossed the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!&quot; On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall&#x27;s flagstaff. &quot;We were about to enter unknown country,&quot; wrote Gorret, &quot;for no man had gone beyond this point.&quot; Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse to the west of the peak, and thence go up on the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his recent defeat.

They made the passage of the &quot;enjambée&quot;, and traversed the west face to reach the Zmutt ridge. A false step made by one of the party and a fall of icicles from above warned them to return to the direct line of ascent, and the traverse back to the Lion ridge was one of the greatest difficulty. A falling stone injured Gorret in the arm.

At last they reached the base of the final tower. &quot;We stood,&quot; wrote Gorret, &quot;in a place that was almost comfortable. Although it was not more than two yards wide, and the slope was one of 75 percent, we gave it all kinds of pleasant names : the corridor, the gallery, the railroad, &amp;c., &amp;c.&quot; They imagined all difficulties were at an end; but a rock couloir, which they had hitherto not observed, lay between them and the final bit of ridge, where progress would be perfectly easy. It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile, Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: &quot;Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn.&quot;

=== Other ascents ===

====Ridges====
The first direct ascent of the Italian (south-west) ridge as it is climbed today was by J. J. and J. P. Maquignaz on 13 September 1867. Julius Elliott made the second ascent via the Hörnli (north-east) ridge in 1868, and later that year the party of John Tyndall, J. J. and J. P. Maquignaz was the first to traverse the summit by way of the Hörnli and Italian ridges. On 22 August 1871, while wearing a white print dress, Lucy Walker became the first woman to reach the summit of the Matterhorn, followed a few weeks later by her rival Meta Brevoort. The first winter ascent of the Hörnli ridge was by Vittorio Sella with guides J. A. Carrel, J. B. Carrel and L. Carrel on 17 March 1882, and its first solo ascent was made by W. Paulcke in 1898. The first winter solo ascent of the Hörnli ridge was by G. Gervasutti in 1936.

The Zmutt (north-west) ridge was first climbed by Albert F. Mummery, Alexander Burgener, J. Petrus and A. Gentinetta on 3 September 1879. Its first solo ascent was made by Hans Pfann in 1906, and the first winter ascent was made by H. Masson and E. Petrig on 25 March 1948.

The last of the Matterhorn&#x27;s four ridges to be ascended was the Furggen (south-east) ridge. M. Piacenza with guides J. J. Carrel and J. Gaspard on 9 September 1911, climbed most of the ridge but bypassed the overhangs near the top to the south. Not until 23 September 1942, during the Second World War, did Alfredo Perino, along with guides Louis Carrel (nicknamed &quot;The Little Carrel&quot;) and Giacomo Chiara, climb the complete ridge and the overhangs directly.

In 1966, René Arnold and Joseph Graven made the first solo enchainement of the four Matterhorn ridges in 19.5 hours. Beginning at the 3,300m Bossi Bivouac hut, the pair followed the normal route up the Furggen Ridge and then descended the Hornli Ridge. After crossing the Matterhorn Glacier at the base of the north face, they ascended the Zmutt Ridge and then descended the Italian (Lion) Ridge to the village of Breuil. In 1985, Marco Barmasse repeated their achievement, but this time his route included the first solo ascent of the Furggen overhangs. He completed the enchainement, reaching the Abruzzi Hut after 15 hours.

On 20 August 1992, Italian alpinist Hans Kammerlander and Swiss alpine guide Diego Wellig climbed the Matterhorn four times in just 23 hours and 26 minutes. The route they followed was: Zmutt ridge–summit–Hörnli ridge (descent)–Furggen ridge–summit–Lion ridge (descent)–Lion ridge–summit–Hörnli ridge (descent)–Hörnli ridge–summit–Hörnli Hut (descent). However the Italian route (Lion Ridge), was not climbed from Duca degli Abruzzi Refuge at 2802 m, but from Carrel Hut, at 3830 m, both uphill and downhill.

In 1995, Bruno Brunod climbed Matterhorn from the village Breuil-Cervinia in 2 h 10 min. and from Breuil-Cervinia to Matterhorn and back, in 3:14:44

On 21 August 2013, the Spanish mountain runner Kilian Jornet broke Brunod&#x27;s record as it took him 1 hour, 56 min to the top from Breuil-Cervinia - a round-trip time of 2 hours 52 minutes to return to his starting point.
====Faces====
William Penhall and guides made the first (partial) ascent of the west face, the Matterhorn&#x27;s most hidden and unknown, one hour after Mummery and party&#x27;s first ascent of the Zmutt ridge on 3 September 1879. It was not until 1962 that the west face was completely climbed. The ascent was made on 13 August by Renato Daguin and Giovanni Ottin. In January 1978 seven Italian alpine guides made a successful winter climb of Daguin and Ottin&#x27;s highly direct, and previously unrepeated, 1962 route. But a storm came during their ascent, bringing two metres of snow to Breuil-Cervinia and Zermatt, and their accomplishment turned bitter when one of the climbers died during the descent.

The north face, before it was climbed in 1931, was one of the last great big wall problems in the Alps. To succeed on the north face, good climbing and ice-climbing technique and route-finding ability were required. Unexpectedly it was first climbed by the brothers Franz and Toni Schmid on 31 July – 1 August 1931. They reached the summit at the end of the second day, after a night of bivouac. Because they had kept their plans secret, their ascent was a complete surprise. In addition, the two brothers had travelled by bicycle from Munich and after their successful ascent they cycled back home again. The first winter ascent of the north face was made by Hilti von Allmen and Paul Etter on 3-4 February 1962. Its first solo ascent was made in five hours by Dieter Marchart on 22 July 1959. Walter Bonatti climbed the &quot;North Face Direct&quot; solo on 18-22 February 1965. The same year, Yvette Vaucher became the first woman to climb the north face. Bonatti&#x27;s direct route was not repeated solo until 29 years later, in winter 1994 by Catherine Destivelle.

Ueli Steck set the record time in climbing the north face (Schmid route) of Matterhorn in 2009 with a time of 1 hour 56 minutes.

After Bonatti&#x27;s climb, the best alpinists were still preoccupied with one last great problem: the &quot;Zmutt Nose&quot;, an overhang lying on the right-hand side of the north face. In July 1969 two Italians, Alessandro Gogna and Leo Cerruti, attempted to solve the problem. It took them four days to figure out the unusual overhangs, avoiding however its steepest part. In July 1981 the Swiss Michel Piola and Pierre-Alain Steiner surmounted the Zmutt Nose by following a direct route, the Piola-Steiner.

The first ascent of the south face was made by Enzo Benedetti with guides Louis Carrel and Maurice Bich on 15 October 1931, and the first complete ascent of the east face was made by Enzo Benedetti and G. Mazzotti with guides Louis and Lucien Carrel, Maurice Bich and Antoine Gaspard on 18-19 September 1932.

===Casualties on the Matterhorn===

The four men lost in 1865 have not been the only fatalities on the Matterhorn. In fact, several climbers die each year due to a number of factors including the scale of the climb and its inherent dangers, inexperience, falling rocks, and overcrowded routes. The Matterhorn is thus amongst the deadliest mountains in the world. By the late 1980s, it was estimated that over 500 people have died whilst attempting its summit since the 1865 ascent, with an average of about 12 deaths each year.

In the 2000s, there was a trend of fewer people dying each year on the mountain. This has been attributed partly to a greater awareness of the risks, and also due to the fact that a majority of climbers now use local guides. However, in the summer of 2018, at least ten people died on the mountain.

Here is a list of people who died on the mountain whose bodies were not recovered until later:
*1954 French skier Henri le Masne went missing on the Matterhorn. In 2005 remains were found, identified as le Masne in 2018
*1970 Two Japanese climbers missing; remains found after 45 years in 2015
*1979 British climber missing; remains found after 34 years in 2014
*2014 Japanese hiker missing; remains found 2018
*2016 Two British climbers missing; remains found 2016

===Legacy: beginning of mountain culture===
The first ascent of the Matterhorn changed mountain culture. Whymper’s book about his first ascent, &quot;Scrambles Amongst the Alps&quot;, published in 1871, was a worldwide bestseller. Tourists began to visit Switzerland in the summer to see the Alps and often hired locals as guides. With the beginning of alpine skiing in the early 20th century, tourists began traveling to Switzerland in winter also. Mountaineering, in part, helped transform Switzerland’s mountain regions from poor rural areas to tourist destinations. This combination of mountain climbing, skiing and tourism, was used in the western United States, creating Sun Valley, Vail, Jackson Hole, and other mountain towns around the world.

== Climbing routes ==
Today, all ridges and faces of the Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons, and mountain guides take a large number of people up the northeast Hörnli route each summer. In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during summer. By modern standards, the climb is fairly difficult (AD Difficulty rating), but not hard for skilled mountaineers according to French climbing grades. There are fixed ropes on parts of the route to help. Still, it should be remembered that several climbers may die on the mountain each year.

The usual pattern of ascent is to take the Schwarzsee cable car up from Zermatt, hike up to the Hörnli Hut elev. , a large stone building at the base of the main ridge, and spend the night. The next day, climbers rise at 3:30 am so as to reach the summit and descend before the regular afternoon clouds and storms come in. The Solvay Hut located on the ridge at can be used only in a case of emergency.

Other popular routes on the mountain include the Italian (Lion) ridge (AD+ Difficulty rating) and the Zmutt ridge (D Difficulty rating). The four faces, as well as the Furggen ridge, constitute the most challenging routes to the summit. The north face is amongst the six most difficult faces of the Alps, as well as ‘The Trilogy’, the three hardest of the six, along with the north faces of the Eiger and the Grandes Jorasses (TD+ Difficulty rating).

Overcrowding on the several routes have become an issue and guides and local authorities have struggled with how to regulate the numbers. In 2015 the Hörnli hut became the first mountain shelter in Europe to limit beds.


==History==
Aegidius Tschudi, one of the earliest Alpine topographers and historians, was the first to mention the region around the Matterhorn in his work, &quot;De Prisca ac Vera Alpina Raethi&quot;, published in Basel in 1538. He approached the Matterhorn as a student when in his Alpine travels he reached the summit of the Theodul Pass but he does not seem to have paid any particular attention to the mountain itself.
The Matterhorn remained unstudied for more than two centuries, until a geologist from Geneva, Horace Benedict de Saussure, travelled to the mountain, which filled him with admiration. However, de Saussure was not moved to climb the mountain, and had no hope of measuring its altitude by taking a barometer to its summit. &quot;Its precipitous sides,&quot; he wrote, &quot;which give no hold to the very snows, are such as to afford no means of access.&quot; Yet his scientific interest was kindled by &quot;the proud peak which rises to so vast an altitude, like a triangular obelisk, that seems to be carved by a chisel.&quot; His mind intuitively grasped the causes which gave the peak its present precipitous form: the Matterhorn was not like a perfected crystal; the centuries had laboured to destroy a great part of an ancient and much larger mountain. On his first journey de Saussure had come from Ayas to the Col des Cimes Blanches, from where the Matterhorn first comes into view; descending to Breuil, he ascended to the Theodul Pass. On his second journey, in 1792, he came to the Valtournanche, studying and describing it; he ascended to the Theodul Pass, where he spent three days, analysing the structure of the Matterhorn, whose height he was the first to measure, and collecting stones, plants and insects. He made careful observations, from the sparse lichen that clung to the rocks to the tiny but vigorous glacier fly that fluttered over the snows and whose existence at such heights was mysterious. At night he took refuge under the tent erected near the ruins of an old fort at the top of the pass. During these days he climbed the Klein Matterhorn (3,883 metres), which he named the &quot;Cime Brune du Breithorn&quot;.

The first inquirers began to come to the Matterhorn. There is a record of a party of Englishmen who in the summer of 1800 crossed the Great St. Bernard Pass, a few months after the passage of Bonaparte; they came to Aosta and thence to Valtournenche, slept at the chalets of Breuil, and traversed the Theodul Pass, which they called &quot;Monte Rosa&quot;. The Matterhorn was to them an object of the most intense and continuous admiration.
The Matterhorn is mentioned in a guide-book to Switzerland by Johann Gottfried Ebel, which was published in Zürich towards the end of the eighteenth century, and translated into English in 1818. The mountain appeared in it under the three names of &quot;Silvius&quot;, &quot;Matterhorn&quot;, and &quot;Mont Cervin&quot;, and was briefly described as one of the most splendid and wonderful obelisks in the Alps. On Zermatt there was a note: &quot;A place which may, perhaps, interest the tourist is the valley of Praborgne (Zermatt); it is bounded by huge glaciers which come right down into the valley; the village of Praborgne is fairly high, and stands at a great height above the glaciers; its climate is almost as warm as that of Italy, and plants belonging to hot countries are to be found there at considerable altitudes, above the ice.&quot;

William Brockedon, who came to the region in 1825, considered the crossing of the Theodul Pass from Breuil to Zermatt a difficult undertaking. He gave, however, expression to his enthusiasm on the summit. When he arrived exhausted on the top of the pass, he gazed &quot;on the beautiful pyramid of the Cervin, more wonderful than aught else in sight, rising from its bed of ice to a height of 5,000 feet, a spectacle of indescribable grandeur.&quot; In this &quot;immense natural amphitheatre, enclosed from time immemorial by snow-clad mountains and glaciers ever white, in the presence of these grand walls the mind is overwhelmed, not indeed that it is unable to contemplate the scene, but it staggers under the immensity of those objects which it contemplates.&quot;

Those who made their way up through the Valtournanche to the foot of the mountain were few in number. W. A. B. Coolidge, a diligent collector of old and new stories of the Alps, mentions that during those years, besides Brockedon, only Hirzel-Escher of Zürich, who crossed the Theodul Pass in 1822, starting from Breuil, accompanied by a local guide. The greater number came from the Valais up the Visp valley to Zermatt. In 1813, a Frenchman, Henri Maynard, climbed to the Theodul Pass and made the first ascent of the Breithorn; he was accompanied by numerous guides, among them J. M. Couttet of Chamonix, the same man who had gone with de Saussure to the top of the Klein Matterhorn in 1792. The writings of these pioneers make much mention of the Matterhorn; the bare and inert rock is gradually quickened into life by men&#x27;s enthusiasm. &quot;Stronger minds,&quot; remarked Edward Whymper, &quot;felt the influence of the wonderful form, and men who ordinarily spoke or wrote like rational beings, when they came under its power seemed to quit their senses, and ranted and rhapsodised, losing for a time all common forms of speech.&quot;

Among the poets of the Matterhorn during these years (1834 to 1840) were Elie de Beaumont, a famous French geologist; Pierre Jean Édouard Desor, a naturalist of Neuchâtel, who went up there with a party of friends, two of whom were Louis Agassiz and Bernhard Studer. Christian Moritz Engelhardt, who was so filled with admiration for Zermatt and its neighbourhood that he returned there at least ten times (from 1835 to 1855), described these places in two valuable volumes, drew panoramas and maps, and collected the most minute notes on the mineralogy and botany of the region. Zermatt was at that time a quiet little village, and travellers found hospitality at the parish priest&#x27;s, or at the village doctor&#x27;s.
In 1841 James David Forbes, professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, came to see the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men&#x27;s feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how at a time when the idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile, Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.

Rodolphe Töpffer, who first accompanied and guided youth to the Alps for purposes of education and amusement, began his journeys in 1832, but it is only in 1840 that he mentions the Matterhorn. Two years later Töpffer and his pupils came to Zermatt. He has described this journey of his in a chapter entitled &quot;Voyage autour du Mont Blanc jusqu&#x27;à Zermatt&quot;, here he sings a hymn of praise to the Matterhorn, comparing its form with a &quot;huge crystal of a hundred facets, flashing varied hues, that softly reflects the light, unshaded, from the uttermost depths of the heavens&quot;. Töpffer&#x27;s book was illustrated by Alexandre Calame, his master and friend, with drawings of the Matterhorn, executed in the romantic style of the period. It is an artificial mountain, a picture corresponding rather with the exaggerated effect it produces on the astonished mind of the artist, than with the real form of the mountain.

About this time there came a man who studied the Matterhorn in its structure and form, and who sketched it and described it in all its parts with the curiosity of the artist and the insight of the scientist. This was John Ruskin, a new and original type of philosopher and geologist, painter and poet, whom England was enabled to create during that period of radical intellectual reforms, which led the way for the highest development of her civilisation. Ruskin was the Matterhorn&#x27;s poet par excellence. He went to Zermatt in 1844, and it is to be noticed as a curious fact, that the first time he saw the Matterhorn it did not please him. The mountain on its lofty pedestal in the very heart of the Alps was, perhaps, too far removed from the ideal he had formed of the mountains; but he returned, studied and dreamt for long at its feet, and at length he pronounced it &quot;the most noble cliff in Europe.&quot; Ruskin was no mountaineer, nor a great friend to mountaineering; he drew sketches of the mountains merely as an illustration of his teaching of the beauty of natural forms, which was the object of his whole life. In his work on Modern Painters he makes continual use of the mountains as an example of beauty and an incentive to morality. The publication of Ruskin&#x27;s work certainly produced a great impression at the time on educated people in England, and a widespread desire to see the mountains.


Other men of high attainments followed, but in the years 1850 scientists and artists were about to be succeeded by real climbers and the passes and peaks around Zermatt were explored little by little. In the preface to the first volume of the &quot;Alpine Journal&quot;, which appeared in 1863, the editor Hereford Brooke George wrote that: &quot;While even if all other objects of interest in Switzerland should be exhausted, the Matterhorn remains (who shall say for how long?) unconquered and apparently invincible.&quot; Whymper successfully reached the summit in 1865, but four men perished on the descent. The English papers discussed it with bitter words of blame; a German newspaper published an article in which Whymper was accused of cutting the rope between Douglas and Taugwalder, at the critical moment, to save his own life.

In 1890 the Federal Government was asked simultaneously by the same contractor for a concession for the Zermatt-Gornergrat railway, and for a Zermatt-Matterhorn one. The Gornergrat railway was constructed in 1896-1898 and has been working since August 1898, but there has been no more talk of the other. The project essentially consisted of a line which went up to the Hörnli, and continued thence in a rectilinear tunnel about two kilometres long, built under the ridge, and issuing near the summit on the Zmutt side. Sixty years later in 1950, Italian engineer Count Dino Lora Totino planned a cable car on the Italian side from Breuil-Cervinia to the summit. But the Alpine Museum of Zermatt sent a protest letter with 90,000 signatures to the Italian government. The latter declared the Matterhorn a natural wonder worthy of protection and refused the concession to the engineer.

2015 marked the 150th anniversary of the first ascent. Events and festivities were held throughout the year. A completely renewed Hörnli Hut opened the same year in the month of July.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, light artist Gerry Hofstetter started projecting country flags and messages of endurance onto the mountain peak as part of a nightly series designed to show support and spread hope for everyone suffering and those fighting the pandemic.

== Other mountains ==
Hundreds of other mountains have been compared to the Matterhorn, either for their resemblance to it or because of their apparent inaccessibility.

=== Mountains named after the Matterhorn ===

*Matterhorn (1,600 m), in Antarctica
*Matterhorn (3,305 m), in Nevada
*Matterhorn Peak (3,744 m), in California
*Matterhorn Peak (4,144 m), in Colorado
*Matterhorn Peak (2,636 m), in British Columbia
*Neny Matterhorn (1,125 m), Antarctica

==In culture==

During the 20th century, the Matterhorn and the story of the first ascent in particular, inspired various artists and film producers such as Luis Trenker and Walt Disney. Large-scale replicas can be found at Disneyland and Window of the World. In 2021, a Matterhorn-related attraction opened in the Swiss Museum of Transport, enabling visitors to climb it virtually from the Solvay Hut to the summit.

Designed in 1908 by Emil Cardinaux, a leading poster artist of the time, the Matterhorn poster for the Zermatt tourist office is often considered the first modern poster. It has been described as a striking example of a marriage of tourism, patriotism and popular art. It served as decoration in many Swiss military hospices during the war in addition to be found in countless middle-class living rooms. Another affiche depicting the Matterhorn was created by Cardinaux for the chocolate brand Toblerone in the 1920s. The image of the Matterhorn first appeared on Toblerone chocolate bars in 1960. Since then, the Matterhorn has become a reference that still inspires graphic artists today and has been used extensively for all sort of publicity and advertising.

<text>Preference-rank translation is a mathematical technique used by marketers to convert stated preferences into purchase probabilities, that is, into an estimate of actual buying behaviour. It takes survey data on consumers’ preferences and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.

A survey might ask a question using a ranking scale such as :

A marketing researcher will re-specify the numerical values during codification. 1 will become 5, 2 will become 4, 4 will become 2, 5 will become 1, and 3 will remain the same. In this way greater values will correspond with greater preference. 

Next, the researcher uses a data reduction technique like factor analysis to obtain aggregate scores. To convert these aggregate rankings into purchase probabilities, each category (in this case, each product) will be weighted with a translation coefficient. These weights are predefined. 

A typical weighting scheme is:

The weighting schemes vary depending on the variables being measured.

The following chart illustrates the procedure:
Other purchase intention/rating translations include logit analysis and the intent scale translation.

<doc id="275528" wikidata="Q6017549" url="?curid=275528" title="Independent sideband">
<text>Independent sideband (ISB) is an AM single sideband mode which is used with some AM radio transmissions. Normally each sideband carries identical information, but ISB modulates two different input signals — one on the upper sideband, the other on the lower sideband. This is used in some kinds of AM stereo (sometimes known as the Kahn system).

ISB is a compromise between double sideband (DSB) and single sideband (SSB) — the other is vestigial sideband (VSB). If the sidebands are out of phase with each other, then phase modulation (PM) of the carrier occurs. AM and PM together then create quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). ISB may or may not have the carrier suppressed.

Suppressed-carrier ISB was employed in point-to-point (usually overseas) radiotelephony and radioteletype by shortwave (HF). In military use, ISB usually referred to a close pair of FSK radioteletype channels which could be demodulated by a single receiver, and employed in fleet broadcast, point-to-point, and between larger vessels and shore stations on HF and UHF.

<doc id="275536" wikidata="Q259670" url="?curid=275536" title="Rebecca Clarke (composer)">
<text>Rebecca Helferich Clarke (27 August 1886 – 13 October 1979) was a British classical composer and violist. Internationally renowned as a viola virtuoso, she also became one of the first female professional orchestral players in London.

Rebecca Clarke had a German mother and an American father, and spent substantial periods of her life in the United States, where she permanently settled after World War II. She was born in Harrow and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music in London. Stranded in the United States at the outbreak of World War II, she married composer and pianist James Friskin in 1944. Clarke died at her home in New York at the age of 93.

Although Clarke&#x27;s output was not large, her work was recognised for its compositional skill and artistic power. Some of her works have yet to be published; those that were published in her lifetime were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.

==Early life==
Clarke was born in Harrow, England, to Joseph Thacher Clarke, an American, and his German wife, Agnes Paulina Marie Amalie Helferich. Her father was interested in music, and Clarke started on violin after sitting in on lessons that were being given to her brother, Hans Thacher Clarke, who was 15 months her junior. Her father was abusive, often hitting her with a steel ruler over infractions such as biting her nails. She started composing at an early age and began her studies at the Royal Academy of Music in 1903, but was abruptly withdrawn by her father in 1905 after her harmony teacher Percy Hilder Miles proposed to her. Miles later left his Stradivarius violin to Clarke in his will. She made the first of many visits to the United States shortly after leaving the Royal Academy. She then attended the Royal College of Music, becoming one of Sir Charles Villiers Stanford&#x27;s few female composition students. Her substantial &quot;Theme and Variations&quot; for piano dates from this period.

At Stanford&#x27;s urging she shifted her focus from the violin to the viola, just as the latter was coming to be seen as a legitimate solo instrument. She studied with Lionel Tertis, who was considered by some the greatest violist of the day. In 1910 she composed &quot;Tears&quot;, a setting of Chinese poetry, in collaboration with a group of fellow students at RCM. She also sang under the direction of Ralph Vaughan Williams in a student ensemble organised by Clarke and another student called Beryl Reeve (later Clarke&#x27;s sister-in-law) to study and perform Palestrina&#x27;s music.

Following her criticism of his extra-marital affairs, Clarke&#x27;s father turned her out of the house and cut off her funds. She had to leave the Royal College in 1910 and supported herself through her viola playing. Clarke (along with Jessie Grimson) became one of the first female professional orchestral musicians when she was selected by Sir Henry Wood to play in the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra in 1912. She was highly sought after as a violist, playing with Artur Schnabel, Pablo Casals, Jascha Heifetz, Jacques Thibaud, Guilhermina Suggia, Arthur Rubinstein, Pierre Monteux, and George Szell, among others.

In 1916 Clarke moved to the United States to continue her performing career. In 1918, she premiered her short, lyrical piece for viola and piano titled &quot;Morpheus&quot;, composed under the pseudonym of &#x27;Anthony Trent,&#x27; at her joint recital with cellist May Mukle in New York City. Reviewers praised the &quot;Trent&quot;, largely ignoring the works credited to Clarke premiered in the same recital. She continued to perform with May Mukle in Hawaii in 1918 and 1919, and on a tour of the British colonies in 1923.

Her compositional career peaked in a brief period, beginning with the viola sonata she entered in a 1919 competition sponsored by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, Clarke&#x27;s neighbour and a patron of the arts. In a field of 72 entrants, Clarke&#x27;s sonata tied for first place with a composition by Ernest Bloch. Coolidge later declared Bloch the winner. Reporters speculated that &quot;Rebecca Clarke&quot; was only a pseudonym for Bloch himself, or at least that it could not have been Clarke who wrote these pieces, as the idea that a woman could write such a beautiful work was socially inconceivable. The sonata was well received and had its first performance at the Berkshire music festival in 1919. In 1921 Clarke again made an impressive showing in Coolidge&#x27;s composition competition with her piano trio, though again failed to take the prize. A 1923 rhapsody for cello and piano followed, sponsored by Coolidge, making Clarke the only female recipient of Coolidge&#x27;s patronage. These three works represent the height of Clarke&#x27;s compositional career.

==Later life ==
Clarke, in 1924, embarked upon a career as a solo and ensemble performer in London, after first completing a world tour in 1922–23. In 1927 she helped form the English Ensemble, a piano quartet that included herself, Marjorie Hayward, Kathleen Long and May Mukle. She also performed on several recordings in the 1920s and 1930s, and participated in BBC music broadcasts. Her compositional output greatly decreased during this period. However, she continued to perform, participating in the Paris Colonial Exhibition in 1931 as part of the English Ensemble. Between 1927 and 1933 she was romantically involved with the British baritone John Goss, who was eight years her junior and married at the time. He had premiered several of her mature songs, two of which were dedicated to him, &quot;June Twilight&quot; and &quot;The Seal Man&quot;. Her &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot;, finished at the time the relationship was ending, proved to be her last composition for solo voice until the early 1940s.

In 1936 Clarke sold the Stradivarius she had been bequeathed to a dealer in New York. At the outbreak of World War II, Clarke was in the US visiting her two brothers, and was unable to obtain a visa to return to Britain. She lived for a while with her brothers&#x27; families and then in 1942 took a position as a governess for a family in Connecticut. She composed 10 works between 1939 and 1942, including her &quot;Passacaglia on an Old English Tune&quot;. She had first met James Friskin, a composer, concert pianist, and founding member of the Juilliard School faculty, and later to become her husband, when they were both students at the Royal College of Music. They renewed their friendship after a chance meeting on a Manhattan street in 1944 and married in September of that year when both were in their late 50s. According to musicologist Liane Curtis, Friskin was &quot;a man who gave [Clarke] a sense of deep satisfaction and equilibrium.&quot;

Clarke has been described by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. It has been suggested by musicologist Liane Curtis that Clarke had dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: &quot;I can&#x27;t do it unless it&#x27;s the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and the last thing I think of every night before I go to sleep.&quot; After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.

In 1963 Clarke helped establish the May Mukle prize at the Royal Academy. The prize is still awarded annually to an outstanding cellist. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1967, Clarke began writing a memoir, titled &quot;I Had a Father Too (or the Mustard Spoon)&quot;; it was completed in 1973 but never published. In it she describes her early life, marked by frequent beatings from her father and strained family relations which affected her perceptions of her proper place in life. In the 1970s, as interest in her music, and in tonal compositions and in women composers, surged, she gave a few more major performances in New York. Clarke died on 13 October 1979 at her home in New York City at the age of 93, and was cremated.

Clarke is now established as one of the most important &#x27;women composers&#x27; of her generation. However, as she told a journalist, &quot;I would sooner be regarded as a 16th-rate composer than be judged as if there were one kind of musical art for men and another for women.&quot;

==Compositions ==
A large portion of Clarke&#x27;s music features the viola, as she was a professional performer for many years. Much of her output was written for herself and the all-female chamber ensembles she played in, including the Norah Clench Quartet, the English Ensemble, and the d&#x27;Aranyi Sisters. She also toured worldwide, particularly with cellist May Mukle. Several trends in 20th-century classical music strongly influenced her works. Clarke also knew many leading composers of the day, including Bloch and Ravel, with whom her work has been compared.

The impressionism of Debussy is often mentioned in connection with Clarke&#x27;s work, particularly its lush textures and modernistic harmonies. The Viola Sonata (published in the same year as the Bloch and the Hindemith Viola Sonata) is an example of this, with its pentatonic opening theme, thick harmonies, emotionally intense nature, and dense, rhythmically complex texture. The Sonata remains a part of the standard repertoire for the viola. &quot;Morpheus&quot;, composed a year earlier, was her first expansive work, after over a decade of songs and miniatures. The &quot;Rhapsody&quot; that Coolidge sponsored is Clarke&#x27;s most ambitious work: it is roughly 23 minutes long, with complex musical ideas and ambiguous tonalities contributing to the varying moods of the piece. In contrast, &quot;Midsummer Moon&quot;, written the following year, is a light miniature, with a flutter-like solo violin line.

In addition to her chamber music for strings, Clarke wrote many songs. Nearly all of Clarke&#x27;s early pieces are for solo voice and piano. Her 1933 &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot;, a setting of Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Tyger&quot;, is dark and brooding, almost expressionist. She worked on it for five years to the exclusion of other works during her tumultuous relationship with John Goss and revised it in 1972. Most of her songs, however, are lighter in nature. Her earliest works were parlour songs, and she went on to build up a body of work drawn primarily from classic texts by Yeats, Masefield, and A.E. Housman.

During 1939 to 1942, the last prolific period near the end of her compositional career, her style became more clear and contrapuntal, with emphasis on motivic elements and tonal structures, the hallmarks of neoclassicism. &quot;Dumka&quot; (1941), a recently published work for violin, viola, and piano, reflects the Eastern European folk styles of Bartók and Martinů. The &quot;Passacaglia on an Old English Tune&quot;, also from 1941 and premiered by Clarke herself, is based on a theme attributed to Thomas Tallis which appears throughout the work. The piece is modal in flavor, mainly in the Dorian mode but venturing into the seldom-heard Phrygian mode. The piece is dedicated to &quot;BB&quot;, ostensibly Clarke&#x27;s niece Magdalen; scholars speculate that the dedication is more likely referring to Benjamin Britten, who organised a concert commemorating the death of Clarke&#x27;s friend and major influence Frank Bridge. The &quot;Prelude, Allegro, and Pastorale&quot;, also composed in 1941, is another neoclassically influenced piece, written for clarinet and viola (originally for her brother and sister-in-law).

Clarke composed no large scale works such as symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten for a long period of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Some of Clarke&#x27;s compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and &quot;Morpheus&quot;, published in 2002.

Modern reception of Clarke&#x27;s work has been generally positive. A 1981 review of her Viola Sonata called it a &quot;thoughtful, well constructed piece&quot; from a relatively obscure composer; a 1985 review noted its &quot;emotional intensity and use of dark tone colours&quot;. Andrew Achenbach, in his review of a Helen Callus recording of several Clarke works, referred to &quot;Morpheus&quot; as &quot;striking&quot; and &quot;languorous&quot;. Laurence Vittes noted that Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Lullaby&quot; was &quot;exceedingly sweet and tender&quot;. A 1987 review concluded that &quot;it seems astonishing that such splendidly written and deeply moving music should have lain in obscurity all these years&quot;.

The Viola Sonata was the subject of BBC Radio 3&#x27;s Building a Library survey on 17 October 2015. The top recommendation, chosen by Helen Wallace, was by Tabea Zimmermann (viola) and Kirill Gerstein (piano). In 2017 BBC Radio 3 devoted five hours to her music as &quot;Composer of the Week.&quot;

==Rebecca Clarke Society==
The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in September 2000 to promote performance, scholarship, and awareness of the works of Rebecca Clarke. Founded by musicologists Liane Curtis and Jessie Ann Owens and based in the Women&#x27;s Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, the Society has promoted recording and scholarship of Clarke&#x27;s work, including several world premiere performances, recordings of unpublished material, and numerous journal publications.

The Society made available previously unpublished compositions from Clarke&#x27;s estate. &quot;Binnorie&quot;, a twelve-minute song based on Celtic folklore, was discovered in 1997, and not premiered until 2001. Over 25 previously unknown works have been published since the establishment of the Society. Several of Clarke&#x27;s chamber works, including the expansive &quot;Rhapsody&quot; for cello and piano, and &quot;Cortège&quot; for solo piano (1930), dedicated to William Busch and premiered by him, were first recorded in 2000 on the Dutton label, using material from the Clarke estate. In 2002, the Society organised and sponsored the world premieres of the 1907 and 1909 violin sonatas.

The head of the Rebecca Clarke Society, Liane Curtis, is the editor of &quot;A Rebecca Clarke Reader&quot;, originally published by Indiana University Press in 2004. The book was withdrawn from circulation by the publisher following complaints from the current manager of Clarke&#x27;s estate about the quotation of unpublished examples from Clarke&#x27;s writings. However, the &quot;Reader&quot; has since been reissued by the Rebecca Clarke Society itself.

<doc id="275540" wikidata="Q925618" url="?curid=275540" title="Texas City disaster">
<text>The 1947 Texas City disaster was an industrial accident that occurred on April 16, 1947, in the port of Texas City, Texas, United States, located in Galveston Bay. It was the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history and one of history&#x27;s largest non-nuclear explosions.

The explosion was triggered by a mid-morning fire on board the French-registered vessel SS &quot;Grandcamp&quot; (docked at port), which detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons (about 2,100 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate. This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions aboard other ships and in nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of Texas City&#x27;s volunteer fire department.

The disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government, on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act.

==Ships==
SS &quot;Grandcamp&quot; was a recently re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named SS &quot;Benjamin R. Curtis&quot; in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship served in the Pacific theater and was mothballed in Philadelphia after the war. In a Cold War gesture, the ship was assigned by the U.S. to the French Line to assist in the rebuilding of France, along with other efforts in Europe. Along with the ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—she was carrying small-arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of sisal twine on the deck. Another ship in the harbor, SS &quot;High Flyer&quot;, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from &quot;Grandcamp&quot;. The ammonium nitrate aboard the two ships, and fertilizer in an adjacent warehouse, were intended for export to farmers in Europe. &quot;Grandcamp&quot; had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit the loading of ammonium nitrate.

==Cargo==
&quot;Grandcamp&quot; had a mixed cargo, containing chiefly ammonium nitrate, but also twine, peanuts, tobacco, some small arms ammunition, engineering equipment, and cotton. The ammonium nitrate, needed either as fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa and shipped to Texas City by rail before being loaded onto &quot;Grandcamp&quot;. It was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was packaged in paper sacks, then transported and stored at higher temperatures that increased its chemical activity. Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading. &quot;High Flyer&quot; held an additional of ammonium nitrate and of sulfur.

==Fire==
On Wednesday, April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of &quot;Grandcamp&quot; while she was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were then ordered to leave. At this point, the captain of &quot;Grandcamp&quot; ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, he ordered all hatches sealed and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire. This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship&#x27;s hold.

Around 8:30, the steam pressure became so great that it blew off the hatches. A column of yellow-orange smoke billowed out, the typical color for nitrogen dioxide fumes. The fire and its unusual-looking smoke attracted spectators along the shoreline, who believed they were at a safe distance. Responding fire departments included the Texas City volunteer fire department and the Republic Oil Refining Company firefighting team.

==First explosion==

At 9:12 a.m., the ammonium nitrate reached an explosive threshold from the combination of heat and pressure. &quot;Grandcamp&quot; detonated, causing utter destruction within 2,000 feet and extreme damage throughout the port. The tremendous blast produced a tsunami and a shockwave, levelling nearly 1,000 buildings on land. Among the buildings destroyed was a Monsanto Chemical Company plant, killing 145 of its 450 workers.

Flying shrapnel resulted in ignition of refineries and chemical tanks along the waterfront. Falling bales of burning twine from &quot;Grandcamp&quot;″s cargo added to the damage, and her anchor was hurled across the city. Two sightseeing airplanes flying nearby were blown out of the sky, while away, half of the windows in Galveston were shattered. The explosion blew almost of the ship&#x27;s steel into the air, some at supersonic speed.

Official casualty estimates came to a total of 567, including all the crewmen who remained aboard &quot;Grandcamp&quot;. All but one member of the 28-man Texas City volunteer fire department were killed in the initial explosion on the docks while fighting the shipboard fire. With fires raging throughout Texas City, first responders from other areas were initially unable to reach the site of the disaster.

==Second explosion==
The first explosion had set &quot;Highflyer&quot; free from its moorings, and it had drifted across the harbor, coming to rest against SS &quot;Wilson B. Keene&quot;. Her crew stayed aboard for an hour before the smoke of the burning oil in the harbor forced them to leave. In the afternoon, two men boarded &quot;Highflyer&quot; searching for injured crewmembers. They noted that her cargo was ablaze and reported it to someone on the Harborfront. This message seems to have gone unheeded for several hours until it was realized that this indicated a serious problem. Only around 11 p.m. did tugboats attempt to pull &quot;Highflyer&quot; away from the docks. Despite having cut her anchor, they were unable to move her. They fled the area around 1 a.m. the next day (April 17). Ten minutes later, at 1:10 a.m., &quot;Highflyer&quot; exploded, killing two more people. According to witnesses, the explosion was more powerful than that of &quot;Grandcamp&quot;. Casualties were light since the docks had already been evacuated, but the second explosion exacerbated the damage to nearby ships and buildings. The blast destroyed the nearby &quot;Wilson B. Keene&quot;. The steel frame of &quot;Highflyer&quot; had been heated until glowing, and these chunks rained down upon Texas City setting mass fires. One of the propellers was blown off and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now in a memorial park near the anchor of &quot;Grandcamp&quot;.

==Scale of the disaster==

The Texas City disaster is generally considered the worst industrial accident in U.S. history. Witnesses compared the scene to the fairly recent images of the 1943 air raid on Bari and the much larger devastation after an atomic bomb was dropped at Nagasaki.

Of the dead, 405 were identified and 63 have never been identified. The latter remains were placed in a memorial cemetery in the north part of Texas City near Moses Lake. An additional 113 people were classified as missing, for no identifiable parts were ever found. This figure includes firefighters who were aboard &quot;Grandcamp&quot; when she exploded. There is some speculation that there were hundreds more killed but uncounted, including visiting seamen, illegal aliens and their families, and an untold number of travelers. More than 800 people were left orphaned or widowed. However, there were also some survivors among people as close as 70 feet (21 m) from the dock. The victims&#x27; bodies quickly filled the local morgue. Several bodies were laid out in the local high school&#x27;s gymnasium for identification by family or friends.
More than 5,000 people were injured, with 1,784 admitted to 21 area hospitals. More than 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, leaving 2,000 homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million (). This number may not encompass the full scope of damage: a further $500 million of oil products burned ().

A anchor of &quot;Grandcamp&quot; was hurled 1.62 miles (2.61 km) and found in a 10-foot (3 m) crater. It was installed at a memorial park. The other main anchor was hurled to the entrance of the Texas City Dike. It rests on a &quot;Texas-shaped&quot; memorial at the entrance. Burning wreckage ignited everything within miles, including dozens of oil and chemical tanks. The nearby city of Galveston was covered with an oily fog that left deposits over every exposed outdoor surface.

==Firefighting casualties==

Some of the deaths and damage in Texas City were due to the destruction and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. Twenty-seven of the twenty-eight members of Texas City&#x27;s volunteer fire department and three of four members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department who were on the docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100 km) away. Alvin Fussell, sole survivor of the Heights Volunteer firefighters, was driving to work in Alvin when he heard of the fire on the radio. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived from as far away as Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned husks.

==Cause==
The cause of the initial fire on board &quot;Grandcamp&quot; was never determined. It may have been started by a cigarette discarded the previous day, meaning the ship&#x27;s cargo had been smoldering throughout the night when the fire was discovered on the morning of the explosion. Historian Hugh Stephens later identified human error as the cause, and cites numerous reasons as to why a minor fire became such a severe incident.

==Reactions and rebuilding==
The disaster received national media attention, with offers of assistance coming from around the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city&#x27;s mayor Curtis Trahan. One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city and the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island, featuring entertainers including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan. In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($ in today&#x27;s terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($ in today&#x27;s terms).

Within days of the disaster, major companies that had lost facilities in the explosions announced plans to rebuild in Texas City and in some cases to expand their operations. Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to use them in the rebuilding. Cost estimates of the industrial reconstruction were estimated at approximately $100 million ($ adjusted for inflation).

&quot;Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the explosion [...], just as the Phoenix bird symbolizes resurrection from the ashes of despair, the &#x27;Phoenix Fountain&#x27; epitomizes courage and the triumph of the human spirit. [...] Chewelah, Washington Artist David Govedare was commissioned by Mayor Charles T. Doyle [...] [to] produce this twelve foot sculpture from half inch cor-ten steel. Architect Joseph Allen Hoover and City Engineer James McWhorter designed the fountain built by Texas City&#x27;s Public Works Department.&quot;

==Legal case==
Many of the legal cases seeking compensation were combined into &quot;Elizabeth Dalehite, et al. v. United States&quot;, under the recently enacted Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, the district court found the United States government responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage.

On June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding that the United States maintained the right to exercise its own &quot;discretion&quot; in vital national matters. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), in a 4-to-3 opinion, noting that the district court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the government liable for &quot;negligent planning decisions&quot; which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. In short, the FTCA clearly exempts &quot;failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty&quot;, and the court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature.

In its dissent, the three justices argued that, under the FTCA, &quot;Congress has defined the tort liability of the government as analogous to that of a private person&quot;, i.e., when carrying out duties unrelated to governing. In this case, &quot;a policy adopted in the exercise of an immune discretion was carried out carelessly by those in charge of detail&quot;, and that a private person would certainly be held liable for such acts. A private person is held to a higher standard of care when carrying out &quot;inherently dangerous&quot; acts such as transportation and storage of explosives.

According to Melvin Belli in his book &quot;Ready for the Plaintiff!&quot; (1965), Congress acted to provide some compensation after the courts refused to do so. The &quot;Dalehite&quot; decision was eventually &quot;appealed&quot; to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707 (1955)). When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made.

<doc id="275547" wikidata="Q751130" url="?curid=275547" title="Selena (film)">
<text>Selena is a 1997 American biographical musical drama film about Tejano music star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, played by Jennifer Lopez. The film, written and directed by Gregory Nava, chronicles the star&#x27;s rise to fame and death when she was murdered by Yolanda Saldívar at the age of 23. In addition to Lopez, the film also stars Edward James Olmos, Jon Seda, Constance Marie, Jacob Vargas, Lupe Ontiveros, and Jackie Guerra.

&quot;Selena&quot; was released in the United States on March 21, 1997, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $35 million worldwide against a production budget of $20 million. For her performance, Jennifer Lopez received a Best Actress nomination at the 55th Golden Globe Awards.

In 2021, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and was re-released in select cinemas on April 7, 2022, to coincide with the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

In 2024, the Pérez Art Museum Miami organized a screening of &quot;Selena&quot; as part of the institution&#x27;s Floating Films with Ballyhoo Media. In the event, the film is screened from the water.

==Plot==
The film opens backstage at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas on February 26, 1995, right before Tejano superstar Selena plays to a sold-out crowd (&quot;Disco Medley&quot;).

In 1961, young Abraham Quintanilla and his band &quot;The Dinos&quot; are rejected by a restaurant owner after an audition in Texas. They perform for a Mexican-American nightclub, but a riot ensues when they do not perform the audience&#x27;s preferred Tejano music, but rather American pop (&quot;Blue Moon&quot;).

Twenty years later, Abraham is married to Marcella Samora, with three children: son A.B., and daughters Suzette and Selena. Discovering Selena&#x27;s singing talent, Abraham creates the band &quot;Selena y Los Dinos&quot;, her as lead singer, A.B. on bass, and Suzette on drums. Initially reluctant, the children enjoy making music (&quot;We Belong Together&quot;). Moving to Corpus Christi, Texas, the band goes on the road to support the family. After lackluster reception at a carnival, Selena begins adding more dance and personality into her acts. The band&#x27;s success grows following local performances. In 1989, Selena reveals her bustier during a carnival performance (&quot;Baila Esta Cumbia&quot;), angering Abraham due to its sexually suggestive nature.

In 1990, Chris Pérez auditions as the guitarist. Abraham disapproves of his heavy metal style but hires him after he agrees to cut his hair. Then Selena and Chris eventually fall in love. In 1992, when Chris&#x27; former band members trash a hotel suite, Abraham threatens to fire him. A.B. pleads with him to reconsider, mentioning he is needed for their upcoming tour in Mexico. Promoters worry when they realize Selena does not speak Spanish well, but her personality and care for her fans win everyone over. A show almost goes awry when the huge crowd rushes the stage and it buckles (&quot;La Carcacha&quot;). Selena calms them down with a joyous performance (&quot;Como la Flor&quot;) and is accepted as an &quot;artist for the people&quot; in Mexico.

After catching Selena hugging Chris on the tour bus, an apoplectic Abraham fires Chris, leaving Selena heartbroken, and threatens to disband the band if Selena follows him. Eventually on April 2, 1992, Selena insists that Chris marry her, stating that Abraham will never willingly accept their relationship, and they elope at the Nueces County courthouse. The day after a radio station announces their marriage, Abraham tells Selena he is proud of her maturity, having realized that he was too harsh on her and Chris. The Quintanilla&#x27;s congratulate them, accept Chris into their family, and rehire him as the guitarist.

In 1994, José Behar and music executives from EMI Latin attend a Selena concert (&quot;Bidi Bidi Bom Bom&quot;/&quot;No Me Queda Más&quot;) and offer her the chance to record an English-language album, showing that she has successfully broken-down cultural barriers. Selena opens her first Selena Etc. boutique and asks her fan club president Yolanda Saldívar to manage it. Her live album wins a Grammy for Best Mexican American album, so her staff chip in to get her a celebratory gift. After claiming she knows the perfect gift and suggesting they give her all of the money to buy it, Yolanda gives Selena a ring resembling the Faberge eggs but does not mention it was a group present. Selena begins recording her crossover album (&quot;I Could Fall In Love&quot;) and she and Chris plan to start a family together.

One night, Abraham tells Selena fans are upset as they paid to join her fan club but received nothing. Other funds that Yolanda has been handling cannot be accounted for, and vital business records are missing. Summoned to Q-Productions and confronted by Abraham, Selena, and Suzette, Yolanda denies wrongdoing and says she will find the missing documents. While on the road Selena talks to her mother about being accepted in the English-speaking market with the upcoming crossover album and tour as well as possibly starting a family (&quot;Dreaming of You&quot;). On March 31, 1995, Selena is fatally shot offscreen by Yolanda, who then ends up in a standoff into the night with police and negotiation units. The Quintanilla-Pérez family mourns Selena&#x27;s death, while a candlelight vigil is held by her fans.

== Production ==
===Development===
On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, a former friend who had managed the singer&#x27;s Selena Etc. boutiques. Response by the Hispanic community was comparable to the reaction of the assassinations of John Lennon and John F. Kennedy, or the death of Elvis Presley. Newsstands were swarmed by people looking for items concerning Selena. Shortly thereafter, several media projects were in production, including eight unauthorized biographies, six documentaries and two Quintanilla family-unapproved biographical films. This led Abraham to begin working on an authorized biographical material within weeks of her death, a process he found difficult since the family was still mourning.

He believed the film would &quot;put an end to all the false rumors&quot; that were circulating through the media at the time and &quot;silence [the media] from telling the wrong story.&quot; He wanted &quot;the whole world to know the [true] story about [Selena].&quot; A.B. spoke out about the family&#x27;s concern about possible &quot;misinterpretation of [Selena], [their] family, and a culture&quot; by outside sources, and their belief that it was imperative to release their own official film. A.B. claimed the decision was foisted upon them after learning about the unauthorized biographies and films that could have potentially misconstrued Selena&#x27;s story. At the time of Abraham&#x27;s decision, there were &quot;gossip and hurtful crazy things that were coming from the press&quot; about the family&#x27;s plan on a film. Abraham wanted the film to immortalize Selena &quot;in a true positive and beautiful way [and wanted] to celebrate her life [and to] quiet and put to rest all [the] negative ugliness [the media had portrayed].&quot;

News of Abraham&#x27;s desire to release an official authorized film reached Hollywood, and American film producer, Moctesuma Esparza. Esparza immediately approached Abraham at his Corpus Christi office about partnering to produce the film. He educated Abraham about the filmmaking process and the support system he could provide while giving Abraham authoritative control over casting, approval of the script and choosing the director. On August 30, 1995 (a week after he and Abraham agreed to partner), Esparza returned to Corpus Christi from California and brought on Gregory Nava. Abraham disliked Esparza&#x27;s decision and expressed concern about Nava&#x27;s potential involvement.

Abraham told Esparza he did not want Nava to be the director because of his ego, though Esparza convinced Abraham that he was the perfect candidate. Producer Robert Katz later said Nava was chosen because other films he directed &quot;[have] a very uplifting and positive quality&quot; and believed they deal with &quot;very strong and tragic elements.&quot; &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; found Nava&#x27;s works to give &quot;moviegoers a passionate, powerful look at Hispanic life&quot;. On September 8, 1995, Abraham informed the media his decision to partner with Esparza/Katz Productions and announced the film&#x27;s budget to be in the range of $15 and $20 million. In an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interview, Abraham confessed on wanting the duo because they were &quot;in tune with our culture&quot;. Other Hispanic filmmakers were considered to direct the film including Luis Valdez and Edward James Olmos (who later joined the cast for the film), but had settled with Nava. Katz said the team had overcome &quot;what most people thought was a fatal contract&quot; by entrusting Abraham&#x27;s decisions and having a working relationship with him throughout the film&#x27;s production: &quot;working things out in advance so the studios knew exactly what we were proposing.&quot;

Nava began writing the script after recording the Quintanilla family on their stories about Selena. Suzette commented on how Nava took &quot;hours and hours of little stories of our lives and what we would do and how we felt.&quot; Nava explained how some stories &quot;had came out&quot; during his recording sessions with the family and published the first draft on March 4, 1996. The incident where Selena and Perez eloped was written in the draft, which Abraham expressed disagreements on. Citing the singer&#x27;s popularity with children, he was concerned that they could get the wrong message about elopement as being in her best interest.

Nava took a few days to persuade Abraham about the scene&#x27;s content before he agreed to it, noting that although he understood Abraham&#x27;s viewpoint, Selena&#x27;s elopement was important to include because it was a major part of her story. He further insisted that his character&#x27;s embrace of the match after the scene would shade a more positive tone after his earlier negative judgments on Selena and Perez&#x27;s relationship. Curious about how Nava found out about the elopement, Abraham asked the director and found out that he had interviewed Perez, who had said that Selena had coaxed him into engagement. The earlier assumption was that Perez had pressured her into secretly getting married.

=== Casting ===
Roger Mussenden was hired as casting director, and he held casting calls throughout the United States including San Antonio, Texas, Miami, Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Casting calls began on March 16, 1996, and concluded on March 23. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1939). Casting turnouts reached 10,000 in Los Angeles and 5,000 in Chicago, while turnouts reached 8,000 in San Antonio. Mussenden chose newcomer 10-year-old Rebecca Lee Meza of Harlingen, Texas to portray young Selena.

Mexican actress Salma Hayek was invited to test the role of Selena by Esparza. Hayek turned the role down; she said she felt it was &quot;too early&quot; to base a movie on Selena and that it would be too emotional. Abraham discovered an actress in Los Angeles and wanted her for the role as Selena, despite her inability to convince the casting crew. He later had a change of heart when American actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez had showed up for the audition.

Lopez found the audition process an elaborated procedure and was asked to sing, dance, and act out the elopement scene in front of the casting crew and Abraham. Within three takes of the elopement scene, Lopez convinced the entire casting crew who believed her performance was &quot;among the strongest&quot;. Lopez had previously worked with Nava in &quot;My Family&quot; (1995). Screen testing was described as &quot;grueling&quot; and required &quot;nine minutes of singing and dancing and eight pages of script.&quot; After the announcement that Lopez would portray Selena, news media and fans criticized Abraham for choosing Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, to play a Texan of Mexican descent.

The Mexican media disapproved of the film and were outraged that Lopez was chosen for the title role. Lopez received backlash from the media and fans because she was not a Mexican American. The Hispanic community began protesting for a recast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: &quot;I know a few people were protesting, but in Corpus [Selena&#x27;s hometown] everyone has been really supportive&quot;. Nava admitted that the backlash was &quot;a little hurtful&quot;, and felt the protesters &quot;should be celebrating that we have an all-Latino cast and that Lopez, one of our own, is becoming a star.&quot; The announcement was described as the &quot;role of a lifetime,&quot; with Lopez&#x27;s salary for the film reportedly $1M USD, making Lopez the highest paid Hispanic actress up to that time. Dave Karger of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that &quot;nothing could have prepared [Lopez] for the hype attached to her million-dollar salary.&quot;

On August 8, the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; announced that Jon Seda (who is of Puerto Rican descent) and Edward James Olmos (who is of Mexican descent, and previously became as one of the candidates for replacing Nava as the director) had joined the cast as Chris Pérez and Abraham Quintanilla, respectively. After Lopez landed the role, she decided to stay with Suzette Quintanilla, Selena&#x27;s sister, at her home to study her character in the recordings and footage the family shared with her. Lopez felt that her &quot;spirit and [Selena&#x27;s] spirit were so similar&quot; which was echoed by the singer&#x27;s family who found that Lopez mimicked the personality traits of Selena. They believed that Lopez&#x27; body language, laugh and how she talked were identical to that of Selena.

Lopez had constant dance rehearsals for the film and said how she would arrive at the studio late in the day after finishing filming for another role. The family often had the entire main cast of the film over for dinner and would notice how they would watch them in their interactions with each other and the way they ate. Edward James Olmos, who took the role as Abraham, was asked to gain for the film. The cast found Olmos to be a father figure for them who often gave advice to the cast during filming.

A.B. found Olmos&#x27; portrayal of his father to be convincing, especially in the scene where Abraham was angered after finding out about Selena and Perez&#x27; relationship. Band member Pete Astudillo, commenting on production, said he had to do a screen test to play himself and had to improvise in several of his scenes, since he had little dialogue in the film.

Jon Seda often spent time with his subject Chris Pérez for character development. Seda visited Perez at the home he shared with Selena and found a price sticker in the bathroom with a scribbled letter that read &quot;Selena and Chris, I Love You&quot; which further inspired Seda to &quot;show the love they [once] had&quot; in the film. The biographical film focused on Selena&#x27;s life rather than her death, with Nava saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to attend to [her murder].&quot;

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began September 1996, in San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Poteet, Houston, and Lake Jackson, Texas. Nava used locals as extras for the film. Selena&#x27;s singing voice was dubbed onto Lopez&#x27;s performance. During the opening of the Selena Etc. boutique scene, Suzette Quintanilla, Selena&#x27;s sister, believed Lopez was wearing Selena&#x27;s clothing, but it was in fact a replica recreated by the film&#x27;s costume designer.

Quintanilla expressed how she was overcome with emotions after seeing Lopez in a replica of the dress Selena had worn to the 1994 Grammy Awards. During the elopement scene, Pérez explained how the scene was reminiscent of the actual event as if he were &quot;transported back in time,&quot; and remembered how he had a do not disturb sign and heard a knock on his door. He found the scene to be one of the hardest to watch after and recalled Selena told him that eloping was the only resource they had and they would never have a wedding she dreamed about. Pérez refused to visit the set and explained that he did not want to partake in the film&#x27;s process.

Seda convinced Perez to visit the set for the scene where his character auditions for the role as the new guitarist for the band. After researching on how to perform a riff on a guitar and having lessons from Pérez, Seda felt that the scene would not come off as authentic since he could not replicate Pérez&#x27;s guitar riffs. He tricked Pérez into visiting the set so that he could play the riff and have the director shoot a close up of his hands for the film. Seda said how after the film was released that people were convinced he could play the guitar; Seda said he revealed to fans how it was actually Perez performing the riff in the scene.

Nava pointed out how he wanted the performance scenes in the film to be &quot;integrated into the drama and to reflect what the characters were going through emotionally and what Selena was going through emotionally at that particular time.&quot; He further explained how he wanted the Astrodome scene to be the opening of the film to show viewers at her height of her career and then flashback to show how she got there. The scene was shot at the San Antonio Alamodome on September 15, 1996, and was attended by 35,000 residents lured by newspaper ads.

Lopez expressed that she was nervous for the scene since it would be the first time she would perform in front of an audience of that size. Furthermore, she explained how uneven she felt due to the criticism she received and was unsure how fans would receive her. Jackie Guerra commented that during the scene she caught a glimpse of Selena&#x27;s parents sobbing. The cast later expressed how they were overwhelmed with emotions once the scene was completed. Later that night, fans approached Lopez, sobbing and expressed to the actress that “she looked so much” like Selena and the public perception of Lopez changed after her performance.

The hospital scene set after Selena&#x27;s death was shot once, making everyone present emotional. Guerra said how she was physically and emotionally drained after the filming the scene. She explained how she &quot;could not imagine what&#x27;s it like to be [the Quintanilla family]&quot; and further said how she had to live with the pain for four months and found the pain the family goes through unimaginable. Lopez said it made her appreciate life even more, whereas Seda expressed that working on the film was one of the hardest for him in terms of departing from the cast.

===Music===

An original motion picture &quot;Selena&quot; soundtrack was released by EMI Latin on March 11, 1997, debuting at number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The soundtrack is a compilation of Selena&#x27;s music, three of which are medleys of Selena&#x27;s live recording remixed for the film, as well as tracks included in the film and tribute songs from various artists. The only songs featured on the soundtrack that were not in the film were &quot;Is it the Beat,&quot; &quot;Only Love&quot; and &quot;A Boy Like That,&quot; and Selena tributes sung by other artists. The only recordings heard in the film were the &quot;Cumbia Medley,&quot; &quot;Disco Medley&quot; and &quot;Where Did the Feeling Go?&quot;, which was played in the last half of the film&#x27;s closing credits. The Vidal Brothers&#x27; &quot;Oldies Medley&quot; was also in the film. All the other songs, including rare tracks, hits and cuts like the &quot;Disco Medley, Part II&quot; (which was recorded live during Selena&#x27;s 1995 concert at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo), were live recordings of Selena in concerts.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Selena&quot; opened March 21, 1997 and earned $11.6 million on its opening weekend. On its second weekend, the film earned $6.2 million. The following weekend, it earned $6.1 million. The film grossed $35.5 million domestically during its theatrical run.

===Home media===
The first VHS and DVD releases of &quot;Selena&quot; were released in 1997. A 10th Anniversary DVD edition was released on September 18, 2007, by Warner Home Video. The two-disc set contains the original theatrical version (127 minutes) and a director&#x27;s cut version (134 minutes) of the film, which had been shown on several TV stations before.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Selena&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 66% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 85 reviews, with an average score of 6/10. The critics’ consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Selena&quot; occasionally struggles to tell its subject&#x27;s story with depth or perspective, but those flaws are rendered largely irrelevant by Jennifer Lopez in the title role.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 67 based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times,&quot; was impressed by the acting, and gave &quot;Selena&quot; three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Young Selena is played by Becky Lee Meza, who has a big smile and a lot of energy. The teenage and adult Selena is played by Lopez in a star-making performance. After her strong work as the passionate lover of Jack Nicholson in the current &quot;Blood and Wine,&quot; here she creates a completely different performance, as a loyal Quintanilla who does most of her growing up on a tour bus with her dad at the wheel.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; believed Lopez perfected Selena&#x27;s accent while &quot;studying performance footage of the pop sensation&quot; according to Nava. Lopez said &quot;you need to do your homework on this gig&quot; because Selena was &quot;fresh in the public&#x27;s mind&quot;.

Film critic Lisa Kropiewnicki liked the film and wrote, &quot;Jennifer Lopez delivers a breakout performance...[and] Nava&#x27;s engaging script wisely mines his subject&#x27;s life for humor and conflict, embracing Selena Quintanilla&#x27;s passion for music.&quot; Film critic James Berardinelli also liked the film and the screenplay, writing, &quot;It would have been easy to trivialize Selena&#x27;s story, turning it into a sudsy, made-for-TV type motion picture.&quot; He believed the acting was top-notch and wrote &quot;Jennifer Lopez is radiant as the title character, conveying the boundless energy and enthusiasm that exemplified Selena, while effectively copying not only her look but her mannerisms. I wonder if Selena&#x27;s family, upon watching this performance, felt an eerie sense of &quot;déjà vu&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kenneth Turan gave the film a mixed review. He wrote the film is part of a &quot;completely predictable Latino soap opera.&quot; However, he added that &quot;there are chunks of &quot;Selena&quot; that only a stone could resist. This movie turns out to be a celebration not only of the singer but also (as &quot;What&#x27;s Love&quot; was for Angela Bassett) of the actress who plays her, Jennifer Lopez.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four; while he praised Lopez and Olmos, he called the film a &quot;glossy, congenially corny biography. &quot;Ironically,&quot; Maltin wrote, &quot;the film does more to solidify Selena&#x27;s celebrity than she was able to accomplish in her short lifetime.&quot;

Some critics, however, did not like how the film appeared to be a sanitized Selena portrait. Critic Walter Addiego considers Nava&#x27;s work a worshipful biography of her. Addiego, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner,&quot; did have a few enjoyable moments viewing the film but wrote, &quot;You can&#x27;t help cheering for Selena, but the good feeling is diminished by the sense that her story&#x27;s been simplified and sanitized.&quot;

==Accolades==
==Legacy and recent history==
In &quot;Latin Sensations&quot; (2001), Herón Márquez noted that the film&#x27;s success &quot;introduced English-speaking America to Selena&#x27;s music, made Jennifer Lopez a bona fide star, and awakened Corporate America to the enormous and growing presence—and buying power—of Latinos in the United States.&quot;

On January 1, 2021, all 38 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus signed a letter addressed to the Library of Congress &quot;formally nominating&quot; &quot;Selena&quot; to be added to the National Film Registry. The lobbying effort aimed at Carla Hayden was led by Representative Joaquin Castro (D–TX), chairman of the caucus, and framed the act as a way to, among other things, more broadly recognize Latino contributions to film, increase acclaim of Latino cinema and effect broader cinematic representation. On December 14, 2021, the film was officially selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

&quot;&quot; is a biographical television series about the late singer Selena Quintanilla. The series comes 23 years after its original film and premiered on Netflix on December 4, 2020.

<doc id="275548" wikidata="Q942322" url="?curid=275548" title="Col du Tourmalet">
<text>Col du Tourmalet (; elevation ) is one of the highest paved mountain passes in the French Pyrenees, in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées. Sainte-Marie-de-Campan is at the foot on the eastern side and the ski station La Mongie two-thirds of the way up. The village of Barèges lies on the western side, above the town of Luz-Saint-Sauveur.

==Higher roads in the Pyrenees==
The Col du Tourmalet is the highest &quot;paved mountain pass&quot; in the &quot;French&quot; Pyrenees second only to the Col de Portet. So in contrast to frequent claims (see for example ), it is neither the highest paved road in the Pyrenees nor the highest paved mountain pass in the Pyrenees. Paved roads leading to the mountain lakes Lac de Cap-de-Long and Lac d&#x27;Aumar in the same French Department Hautes-Pyrénées are higher, as these lakes are at altitudes of and , respectively. However, these roads are not mountain passes. Departing directly from the Col du Tourmalet, there is a road to the mountain pass Col de Laquets with an altitude of However, this road is not paved. Finally, the highest paved mountain pass in the Pyrenees is the Port d&#x27;Envalira in Andorra with its altitude of .

==Meaning of &quot;Tourmalet&quot;==
Some Frenchmen believe that &quot;Tourmalet&quot; translates into &quot;bad trip&quot; or &quot;bad detour&quot; because in French &quot;Tour&quot; translates into &quot;trip&quot; and &quot;mal&quot; translates into &quot;bad&quot;; however, the correct language to translate from is Gascon, not French, because of the mountain&#x27;s location in the Gascony region. Then &quot;Tour&quot; becomes &quot;distance&quot;, which is spelled &quot;tur&quot; but pronounced &quot;tour&quot; and &quot;mal&quot; is translated into &quot;mountain&quot;. The translation from Gascon to English then becomes &quot;Distance Mountain&quot;.

Tourmalet is also a cheese made from sheep milk produced in these mountains.

== Details of the climb ==

The western side, from Luz-Saint-Sauveur, is long, climbing at an average of 7.4% with a maximum of 10.2% near the summit. Starting from Sainte-Marie-de-Campan, the eastern climb is , gaining , at an average of 7.4% with a maximum of 12%. As with most French climbs, each kilometre mountain pass cycling milestones indicate the height of the summit, the distance to the summit, and the average gradient of the next kilometre. According to PJAMM Cycling&#x27;s ranking system, the east side is the 24th hardest bike climb in France, and the west is ranked 26th.

From the pass, a rough track leads to the Pic du Midi de Bigorre observatory. Up to the Col de Laquets (elevation ) this track is a dirt and gravel road. The part between the Col de Laquets and the observatory is a steep and narrow hiking track. Some terraces of the observatory can be entered for free from the end of the track. Paying an entrance fee, one can enter the actual observatory and also take the cable car down to La Mongie.

== Tour de France ==

The Col du Tourmalet is one of the most famous climbs on the Tour de France. It has been included more than any other pass, starting in 1910, when the Pyrenees were introduced. The first rider over was Octave Lapize, who went on to win the general classification in Paris. In 1913, Eugène Christophe broke his fork on the Tourmalet and repaired it himself at a forge in Sainte-Marie-de-Campan.

Up to 2020, the Tour has visited the Col du Tourmalet a total of 87 times. The total includes three stage finishes at the summit and three at La Mongie. Since 1980 it has been ranked &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, or exceptional. The Vuelta a España has also crossed the pass several times.

The 2010 edition of the Tour included the pass on two consecutive stages, crossing westward on the 16th stage to Pau and eastward on the 17th stage with a finish at the summit.

At the col is a memorial to Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France from 1936 to 1987, and a large statue of Octave Lapize gasping for air as he struggles to make the climb. The Souvenir Jacques Goddet prize is awarded for the first rider to cross the Col du Tourmalet summit.

In 2023, the climb was featured in the Tour de France Femmes for the first time, as the &quot;queen stage&quot; of the race.

===Origins in the Tour===

The Pyrenees were included in the Tour de France at the insistence of Alphonse Steinès, a colleague of the organiser, Henri Desgrange. He told the story in a book published soon after the event.

Steinès first agreed that the Tour would pay 2,000 francs to clear the Col d&#x27;Aubisque, then came back to investigate the Tourmalet. He started at Sainte-Marie-de-Campan with sausage, ham and cheese at the inn opposite the church and arranged to hire a driver called Dupont from Bagnères-de-Bigorre. Dupont and Steinès made it the first 16 km, after which their car came to a stop. Dupont and Steinès started to walk but Dupont turned back after 600m, shouting: &quot;The bears come over from Spain when it snows&quot;. Steinès set off. He mistook voices in the darkness for thieves. They were youngsters guarding sheep with their dog. Steinès called to one.

&quot;Son, do you know the Tourmalet well? Could you guide me? I&#x27;ll give you a gold coin. When we get to the other top, I&#x27;ll give you another one&quot;

The boy joined him but then turned back.

Steinès rested on a rock. He considered sitting it out until dawn, then realised he&#x27;d freeze. He slipped on the icy road, then fell into a stream. He climbed back to the road and again fell in the snow. Exhausted and stumbling, he heard another voice.

&quot;Tell me who goes there or I&#x27;ll shoot&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m a lost traveller. I&#x27;ve just come across the Tourmalet&quot;.

&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s you, Monsieur Steinès! We were expecting you! We got a phone call at Ste-Marie-de-Campan. Everybody&#x27;s at Barèges. It&#x27;s coming on for three o&#x27;clock. There are search teams of guides out looking for you&quot;.

The organising newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, had a correspondent at Barèges, a man called Lanne-Camy. He took him for a bath and provided new clothes.

Steines sent a telegram to Desgrange: &quot;Crossed Tourmalet stop. Very good road stop. Perfectly feasible&quot;.

=== Tour de France stage finishes ===

===Other appearances in Tour de France===
===Tour de France Femmes===

The Col du Tourmalet featured in the premiere event of Tour de France Femmes in 2023 as the finish of stage 7 on July 29.


==Other events==
The Col du Tourmalet features in other bicycle races, including the Vuelta a España when it has made excursions into France. It is also on the route of cyclosportive competitions. Thousands of amateur riders make the climb every year and many take documents to have rubber-stamped in the shop at the summit to show they have made it.

Stallman decided to call this operating system &quot;GNU&quot; (a recursive acronym meaning &quot;GNU&#x27;s not Unix!&quot;), basing its design on that of Unix, a proprietary operating system. According to its manifesto, the founding goal of the project was to build a free operating system, and if possible, &quot;everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free.&quot; Development was initiated in January 1984. In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU Project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU Project, it allowed for the first operating system that was free software, commonly known as Linux.

The project&#x27;s current work includes software development, awareness building, political campaigning, and sharing of new material.

== Origins ==

Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message in September 1983. Despite never having used Unix prior, Stallman felt that it was the most appropriate system design to use as a basis for the GNU Project, as it was portable and &quot;fairly clean&quot;.

When the GNU Project first started they had an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor commands, a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, and a linker. The GNU system required its own C compiler and tools to be free software, so these also had to be developed. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities (such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5). They had an initial kernel that needed more updates.

Once the kernel and the compiler were finished, GNU was able to be used for program development. The main goal was to create many other applications to be like the Unix system. GNU was able to run Unix programs but was not identical to it. GNU incorporated longer file names, file version numbers, and a crash-proof file system. The GNU Manifesto was written to gain support and participation from others for the project. Programmers were encouraged to take part in any aspect of the project that interested them. People could donate funds, computer parts, or even their own time to write code and programs for the project.

The origins and development of most aspects of the GNU Project (and free software in general) are shared in a detailed narrative in the Emacs help system. (C-h g runs the Emacs editor command describe-gnu-project.) It is the same detailed history as at their web site.

== GNU Manifesto ==

The GNU Manifesto was written by Richard Stallman to gain support and participation in the GNU Project. In the GNU Manifesto, Stallman listed four freedoms essential to software users: freedom to run a program for any purpose, freedom to study the mechanics of the program and modify it, freedom to redistribute copies, and freedom to improve and change modified versions for public use. To implement these freedoms, users needed full access to the source code. To ensure code remained free and provide it to the public, Stallman created the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allowed software and the future generations of code derived from it to remain free for public use.

== Philosophy and activism ==

Although most of the GNU Project&#x27;s output is technical in nature, it was launched as a social, ethical, and political initiative. As well as producing software and licenses, the GNU Project has published a number of writings, the majority of which were authored by Richard Stallman.

== Free software ==

The GNU Project uses software that is free for users to copy, edit, and distribute. It is free in the sense that users can change the software to fit individual needs. The way programmers obtain the free software depends on where they get it. The software could be provided to the programmer from friends or over the Internet, or the company a programmer works for may purchase the software.

== Funding ==

Proceeds from Free Software Foundation associate members, purchases, and donations support the GNU Project.

== Copyleft ==

Copyleft is what helps maintain free use of this software among other programmers. Copyleft gives the legal right to everyone to use, edit, and redistribute programs or programs&#x27; code as long as the distribution terms do not change. As a result, any user who obtains the software legally has the same freedoms as the rest of its users do.

The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation sometimes differentiate between &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; copyleft. &quot;Weak&quot; copyleft programs typically allow distributors to link them together with non-free programs, while &quot;strong&quot; copyleft strictly forbids this practice. Most of the GNU Project&#x27;s output is released under a strong copyleft, although some is released under a weak copyleft or a lax, push-over free software license.

== Operating system development ==


The first goal of the GNU Project was to create a whole free-software operating system. Because UNIX was already widespread and ran on more powerful machines, compared to contemporary CP/M or MS-DOS machines of time, it was decided it would be a Unix-like operating system. Richard Stallman later commented that he considered MS-DOS &quot;a toy&quot;.

By 1992, the GNU Project had completed all of the major operating system utilities, but had not completed their proposed operating system kernel, GNU Hurd. With the release of the Linux kernel, started independently by Linus Torvalds in 1991, and released under the GPLv2 with version 0.12 in 1992, for the first time it was possible to run an operating system composed completely of free software. Though the Linux kernel is not part of the GNU Project, it was developed using GCC and other GNU programming tools and was released as free software under the GNU General Public License. Most compilation of the Linux kernel is still done with GNU toolchains, but it is currently possible to use the Clang compiler and the LLVM toolchain for compilation.

As of present, the GNU Project has not released a version of GNU/Hurd that is suitable for production environments since the commencement of the GNU/Hurd project over .

== GNU/Linux ==

A stable version (or variant) of GNU can be run by combining the GNU packages with the Linux kernel, making a functional Unix-like system. The GNU Project calls this GNU/Linux, and the defining features are the combination of:

* GNU packages (except for GNU Hurd) The GNU packages consist of numerous operating system tools and utilities (shell, coreutils, compilers, libraries, etc.) including a library implementation of all of the functions specified in POSIX System Application Program Interface (POSIX.1). The GCC compiler can generate machine-code for a large variety of computer-architectures.
* Linux kernel – this implements program scheduling, multitasking, device drivers, memory management, etc. and allows the system to run on a large variety of computer-architectures. Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel under the GNU General Public License in 1992; it is however not part of the GNU Project.
* non-GNU programs – various free software packages which are not a part of the GNU Project but are released under the GNU General Public License or another FSF-approved Free Software License.

Within the GNU website, a list of projects is laid out and each project has specifics for what type of developer is able to perform the task needed for a certain piece of the GNU Project. The skill level ranges from project to project but anyone with background knowledge in programming is encouraged to support the project.

The packaging of GNU tools, together with the Linux kernel and other programs, is usually called a Linux distribution (distro). The GNU Project calls the combination of GNU and the Linux kernel &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;, and asks others to do the same, resulting in the GNU/Linux naming controversy.

Most Linux distros combine GNU packages with a Linux kernel which contains proprietary binary blobs.

=== GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines ===

The GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG) is a system distribution commitment that explains how an installable system distribution (such as a Linux distribution) qualifies as free (libre), and helps distribution developers make their distributions qualify.

The list mostly describes distributions that are a combination of GNU packages with a Linux-libre kernel (a modified Linux kernel that removes binary blobs, obfuscated code, and portions of code under proprietary licenses) and consist only of free software (eschewing proprietary software entirely). Distributions that have adopted the GNU FSDG include Dragora GNU/Linux-Libre, GNU Guix System, Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, Trisquel GNU/Linux, PureOS, and a few others.

The Fedora Project&#x27;s distribution license guidelines were used as a basis for the FSDG. The Fedora Project&#x27;s own guidelines, however, currently do not follow the FSDG, and thus the GNU Project does not consider Fedora to be a fully free (libre) GNU/Linux distribution.

== Strategic projects ==

From the mid-1990s onward, with many companies investing in free software development, the Free Software Foundation redirected its funds toward the legal and political support of free software development. Software development from that point on focused on maintaining existing projects, and starting new projects only when there was an acute threat to the free software community. One of the most notable projects of the GNU Project is the GNU Compiler Collection, whose components have been adopted as the standard compiler system on many Unix-like systems.

The copyright of most works by the GNU Project is owned by the Free Software Foundation.

=== GNOME ===
The GNOME desktop effort was launched by the GNU Project because another desktop system, KDE, was becoming popular but required users to install Qt, which was then proprietary software. To prevent people from being tempted to install KDE and Qt, the GNU Project simultaneously launched two projects. One was the Harmony toolkit. This was an attempt to make a free software replacement for Qt. Had this project been successful, the perceived problem with the KDE would have been solved. The second project was GNOME, which tackled the same issue from a different angle. It aimed to make a replacement for KDE that had no dependencies on proprietary software. The Harmony project did not make much progress, but GNOME developed very well. Eventually, the proprietary component that KDE depended on (Qt) was released as free software. GNOME has since dissociated itself from the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation, and is now independently managed by the GNOME Project.

=== GNU Enterprise ===

GNU Enterprise (GNUe) was a meta-project started in 1996, and can be regarded as a sub-project of the GNU Project. GNUe&#x27;s goal is to create free &quot;enterprise-class data-aware applications&quot; (enterprise resource planners, etc.). GNUe is designed to collect Enterprise software for the GNU system in a single location (much like the GNOME project collects Desktop software),it was later &quot;Decommissioned&quot;.

== Recognition ==
In 2001, the GNU Project received the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award for &quot;the ubiquity, breadth, and quality of its freely available redistributable and modifiable software, which has enabled a generation of research and commercial development&quot;.

<text>Lionel Dyke &quot;Pete&quot; Parker (September 7, 1895 – February 11, 1991) was a Canadian radio announcer. He was one of the first people to ever broadcast ice hockey. He served overseas in World War I from 1916 to 1919.

==Career==
On March 14, 1923, Parker made the world&#x27;s first complete play-by-play radio broadcast of a professional ice hockey game. The broadcast was carried by CKCK Radio in Regina, Saskatchewan. The game, held at Exhibition Park in Regina between the Regina Capitals and the Edmonton Eskimos, was a meeting of two Western Canada Hockey League teams. Edmonton beat Regina, 1–0. This broadcast was officially recognized by Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1972. This followed by one month the Norman Albert broadcast on February 8, 1923, of the third period of a game between Midland and North Toronto of the Ontario Hockey Association. The first-ever full-game radio broadcast was made of a February 22, 1923 game between the Winnipeg Falcons and Port Arthur by Winnipeg radio station CJCG (owned by the Manitoba Free Press).

For many years, it was thought that Parker&#x27;s broadcast preceded by 8 days the March 22, 1923, first broadcast by &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;″s Foster Hewitt. Hewitt&#x27;s own biography lists the date of his first hockey broadcast as March 22. However, on March 22, there was no game at Toronto&#x27;s Arena Gardens to call. Hewitt&#x27;s first broadcast (of the third period only) may have been on February 16, 1923, for a game between Toronto and Kitchener.

<doc id="275553" wikidata="Q209645" url="?curid=275553" title="Tammar wallaby">
<text>The tammar wallaby (Notamacropus eugenii), also known as the dama wallaby or darma wallaby, is a small macropod native to South and Western Australia. Though its geographical range has been severely reduced since European colonisation, the tammar wallaby remains common within its reduced range and is listed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has been introduced to New Zealand and reintroduced to some areas of Australia where it had been previously extirpated. Skull variations differentiate between tammar wallabies from Western Australia, Kangaroo Island, and mainland South Australia, making them distinct population groups.

The tammar wallaby is among the smallest of the wallabies in the genus &quot;Notamacropus&quot;. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar wallaby has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision, and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends the nighttime in grassland habitat and the daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar wallaby can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar wallaby is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. Its genome was sequenced in 2011.

==Taxonomy and classification==
The tammar wallaby was seen in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by survivors of the 1629 &quot;Batavia&quot; shipwreck, and recorded by François Pelsaert in his 1629 &quot;Ongeluckige Voyagie&quot;. It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, who gave it the name &quot;eugenii&quot; based on a specimen found on an island then known as Ile Eugene in the Nuyts Archipelago off South Australia, which is now known as St. Peter Island. The island&#x27;s French name was given in honour of Eugene Hamelin, caption of the ship &quot;Naturaliste&quot;; whose name is now the specific name of the tammar wallaby. The common name of the animal is derived from the thickets of the shrub locally known as tamma (&quot;Allocasuarina campestris&quot;) that sheltered it in Western Australia. It is also known as the dama wallaby or darma wallaby.

The tammar wallaby is traditionally classified together with the kangaroos, wallaroos and several other species of wallaby in the genus &quot;Macropus&quot;, and in the subgenus &quot;Notamacropus&quot; with the other brush wallabies, all of which have a facial stripe. However, some authors have proposed elevating the three subgenera of &quot;Macropus&quot;, &quot;Macropus&quot; (sensu stricto), &quot;Osphranter&quot;, and &quot;Notamacropus&quot; into distinct genera, making the tammar&#x27;s specific name &quot;Notamacropus eugenii&quot;. This has been supported by genetic studies.

Fossil evidence of the tammar wallaby exists from the Late Pleistocene Eraremains were found in the Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island-dwelling tammar wallabies split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The extirpated tammar wallabies on Flinders Island were greyer in colour with thinner skulls than present-day Kangaroo Island tammars, which are in turn larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammar wallabies were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population.

A 1991 examination of tammar wallaby skulls from different parts of the species&#x27; range found that the populations can be divided into three distinct groups: one group consisting of the populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group consisting of the populations from Flinders Island, 19th-century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting of the population from Kangaroo Island. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as the subspecies &quot;Macropus eugenii derbianus&quot;, &quot;M. e. eugenii&quot; and &quot;M. e. decres&quot;, respectively.

A 2017 study found many genetic differences between tammars from Western and South Australia and comparably little between the Kangaroo island and introduced New Zealand tammars. The researchers proposed dividing the species into two subspecies; the subspecific name &quot;eugenii&quot; for South Australian tammars and &quot;derbianus&quot; for those from Western Australia.

==Characteristics and adaptations==
One of the smallest wallaby species, the tammar wallaby features a proportionally small head with large ears, and an elongated tail, with a thick base. It has dark greyish upperparts with a paler underside and rufous-coloured sides and limbs. The tammar wallaby exhibits great sexual dimorphism, males reaching in weight compared to for females. Males are long while females are , while both sexes stand tall. The tail has a length of for males and for females.
===Locomotion===

As with most macropods, the tammar wallaby moves around by hopping. This species typically leaps with 3.5 landings per second. Proximal muscles at the knee and hip joints provide the power for each leap, which shifts to the ankle muscles as the animal pushes off. As it lands, the energy of the jump is converted into strain energy made when its leg tendons are stretched. As it leaps back off the ground, the tammar wallaby can recover much of this energy for reuse through elastic recoil. When on the move, animal&#x27;s respiration is tried to its hopping cycle, inhaling when leaping and exhaling when landing. As it moves faster, its heart rate increases nearly twice as much as its hopping frequency.

The amount of energy stored in the tendons increases with the animal&#x27;s speed and the weight of the load it is carrying. This is particularly helpful for mothers carrying young, and explains why tammar wallabies can increase their hopping speed without using more energy. The tammar wallaby shares this characteristic with other macropods that move on flat terrain, like the red kangaroo. By comparison, rock-wallabies, such as the yellow-footed rock-wallaby, have traded efficient energy-saving for greater tendon strength: an adaption for rocky cliffs which allows them to leap higher and lowers the risk of their tendons breaking.

===Senses===
The tammar wallaby can see at 324° peripheral vision and 50° binocular vision, which gives them a wide field view but still being about to see their hands in front of them. It can discern light gradients better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. Its vision is, nevertheless, not as good as that of a cat or human. Tammar wallabies appear to have some colour vision: its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing it to see colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the longer wavelengths of the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as apart.

The pinna (ear) of the tammar wallaby is mobile, allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar wallaby can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum&#x27;s sound pressure by 25–30 dB at 5kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal&#x27;s hearing level quickly drops. When born, a tammar wallaby&#x27;s sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother&#x27;s pouch by scent.

===Thermoregulation and water balance===
Tammar wallabies lick their forearms and pant to keep cool in hot weather. They breathe more heavily and lose more water when the temperature is over . Tammar wallabies cannot survive in temperatures above and must find cooler surroundings. To prevent dehydration, tammar wallabies urinate less and suck up water from the distal colon, which gives them relatively dry feces. Being able to concentrate more urine in their kidneys allows them to survive on seawater.

==Ecology and life history==

During the day, tammar wallabies stay close to scrub for shade and move out to more open grassland by nightfall.In winter their home ranges are about , but in the dry summers they range further afield to search for quality food, needing about of space. Tammar wallaby home ranges overlap with those of conspecifics. Like all macropods, the tammar wallaby is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammar wallabies handle them with their fingers. Tammar wallabies consume several plant species such as heart-leaved poison (&quot;Gastrolobium bilobum&quot;), small-flowered wallaby grass (&quot;Austrodanthonia setacea&quot;), and marri (&quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot;). They survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater.
Tammar wallabies gather into groups which lessens the chance of an individual being taken by a predator. As the group increases in size, tammar wallabies spend more time feeding, grooming, and interacting and less time being vigilant and moving around. They are also more likely to rest on their sides rather than in a more alert posture where their head is held up. Predators of the tammar wallaby include dingoes, feral cats, red foxes and wedge-tailed eagles. They may also have been preyed upon by the extinct thylacine. Tammar wallabies appear to respond more to the sight than the sound of predators. They can also use their acute sense of smell to detect a potential threat. When a predator is detected, a tammar wallaby will alert others by thumping its foot. When lost, young tammar wallabies are known to emit a distress call and adult females may respond with a similar call.

===Breeding and development===

The tammar wallaby has a polygynandrous mating system, were both males and females mate with multiple partners. It is a seasonal breeder and with many births taking place between late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male&#x27;s prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge while the weight of the testes remain the same. Around two weeks prior to the first births, the males start checking the reproductive status of the females by sniffing their urogenital openings and pouches. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may risk attacks from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy, and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.
The female tammar wallaby is receptive shortly after giving birth. Tammar wallabies undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant for nearly a year. A joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing for the first six months and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this time period will stimulate the blastocyst&#x27;s development. However, after this, the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice at the end of December. A 2019 study found that more males are born due to a greater amount of Y chromosome sperm in sires. To balance out the sex ratios, tammar mothers are more likely to abandon male joeys and more females survive to weaning periods.

The lactation period of the tammar is divided into phases 2A, 2B, and 3 (pregnancy is labeled phase 1). Phase 2A encompasses the first 100–120 days after birth, and the underdeveloped young is fed diluted milk which is richer in carbohydrates than proteins and lipids. This allows for the rapid growth of important organs and internal systems including the respiratory system, lymphoid system, and nervous system. During this phase, the young remains latched on to a teat. Phase 2B lasts for another 100 days; the young suckles intermittently but still does not leave the pouch. The composition of the milk is similar, though the proteins are different. During phase 3, the joey can leave the pouch and eat plant material. The joey will continue to suckle, the teat having enlarged and the milk having become richer in proteins and lipids over carbohydrates to give the joey more energy. During this time, the joey also experiences rapid development and transitions from ectothermy to endothermy. The joey no longer needs the pouch by 250 days and is fully weaned at 300–350 days. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another&#x27;s young. Female tammar wallabies may mature at nine months and live to age fourteen, while males mature around two years and live for eleven years.

===Health===
In one population of tammar wallabies, the tick species &quot;Ixodes hirsti&quot; was found to infest them during autumn and winter while those of the genus &quot;Amblyomma&quot; were more common in spring and summer. In late 1998 and again in early 1999, 120–230 tammar died suddenly in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than 12 hours after their sickness was discovered, with most showing no symptoms prior. Necropsies revealed haemorrhaging of the muscles, and numerous internal organs. The syndrome is known as tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney, and treatment is difficult due to the rapid progression of the disease.

==Population dynamics and conservation==

The tammar wallaby is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN as of 2016, being particularly numerous on Kangaroo Island and four Western Australian islands. It has a maximum population of 50,000 mature individuals in total. However, the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of inbreeding and physical deformities in some populations.

Since European colonisation, tammar wallabies on both mainland Australia and some of the islands have greatly declined or even been eradicated. In the early 20th century, the mainland population in Western Australia was described as numerous throughout the southwest, but declining in agricultural areas to the north. Clearings made for wheat and sheep caused the population to fall even further. Starting in the 19th century, tammar wallabies in the Eyre Peninsula and around Adelaide were decimated by mobs of hunters protecting agriculture. As a result, they were extirpated from both these areas in the 20th century. Tammars from Flinders Island and St Peter Island were eradicated in a similar manner.
Tammar wallabies from these areas were introduced to Kawau Island in New Zealand by Sir George Grey in 1870. They were introduced to the Rotorua area in the early 20th century. Since then, they have flourished to the point where their foraging has damaged local plants. Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate to control their populations, a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted by the poison, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative.

In 1985, tammar wallabies were introduced to the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to over 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals. In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily kept 85 tammar wallabies from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Four releases have been made, and the population increased to 100–120 animals by 2012. Tammar wallaby were reintroduced to Kalbarri National Park in 2010 though the project was not considered successful as the majority of radio-collared individuals did not last more than a year.

===Resistance to sodium fluoroacetate===
Different tammar wallaby populations have varying levels of resistance to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western Australian tammar wallabies appear to be the most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammar wallabies from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammar wallabies from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western Australian tammar wallabies, but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammar wallabies originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.

==Use in science==
The tammar wallaby is a model organism for studying marsupial biology, as well as mammal biology in general. It has been used in the fields of reproductive biology, immunology, metabolism, neurobiology and many others. Its &quot;seasonal and lactational control of its reproduction&quot; makes its reproduction particularly suited for study. Saunders and colleagues (2017) have suggested the bipedal tammar as a better model for research into human spinal cord injuries than quadrupedal rodents. Tammar wallabies are easy to keep in captivity as they are non-aggressive, can adjust to surgeries and reproduce easily, requiring just one male for five females. Tammar wallabies used for scientific study are generally housed in outdoor pens with enough water and shelter, instead of a laboratory.

The genomes of marsupials are of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics, and the study of tammar wallabies has provided much information about the genetics of marsupials and mammals in general. Marsupials are at a convenient degree of evolutionary divergence from humans; mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. Key immune genes from the tammar wallaby were highlighted and studied in 2009.

In 2011, the tammar would become the second marsupial to have its full genome sequenced after the grey short-tailed opossum. The researchers found &quot;innovation in reproductive and lactational genes, rapid evolution of germ cell genes, and incomplete, locus-specific X inactivation&quot;. The researchers also found new HOX genes that control gene expression, as well as new microRNAs. Genes for producing milk were shown to be novel while gonad genes appeared to be more conserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renfree/Papenfuss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the full genome sequencing of marsupials, the identification and characterization of important immunological components were limited in most marsupial species. The current sequencing and annotation of whole marsupial genomes have been useful for the further understanding of marsupial immune systems by simplifying the characterization of immune molecules in marsupials, and has aided in biomedical research. A 2017 molecular study of the tammar and the mink found the potential involvement of EGF, FOXO, CDKN1A in controlling mammalian embryonic diapause. IL-10 and IL-10Δ3 are conserved in the tammar showing their immune system can respond to pathogens similarly to other eutherian mammals using these same immune components.

A compound in the milk of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 has the potential to be a new and effective antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be far more powerful than penicillin. It kills many types pathogenic bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and at least one fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the finding of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics. The foregut of the tammar wallaby contains species of bacteria belonging to the phyla Bacillota, Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota. New species have been discovered: WG–1 of Pseudomonadota and TWA4 of Bacillota. These bacteria produce less methane than others and do not require CO2 to survive. This has important environmental implications, as this information could be used to reduce carbon production in livestock.

<doc id="275554" wikidata="Q448343" url="?curid=275554" title="Gloria Leonard">
<text>Gloria Leonard (born Gale Sandra Klinetsky; August 28, 1940 – February 3, 2014) was an American pornographic actress during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984) who later became the publisher of &quot;High Society&quot; magazine. As a board member of Adult Video Association and its successor the Free Speech Coalition, Leonard was an outspoken advocate for the adult film industry and free speech rights.

==Career==
In the 1960s, Leonard was a Wall Street commodities trader. She later went into public relations and worked for Elektra Records. Upon her return to New York, looking for work, she contacted casting agent Dorothy Palmer, who apparently failed to tell Leonard that the acting role she cast her in was for an adult film.

===Adult film===
Leonard began appearing in hardcore pornography in 1974 and appeared in approximately 40 film/projects from 1976 to 1984, in films including &quot;Odyssey: The Ultimate Trip&quot; (1977), directed by Gerard Damiano, &quot;The Trouble With Young Stuff&quot;, &quot;All About Gloria Leonard&quot; (both of which were written and directed by Joseph W. Sarno), &quot;Fortune Smiles&quot;, &quot;Maraschino Cherry&quot; and &quot;Taboo: American Style&quot;. She is best known for her role in &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot;, Radley Metzger’s erotic reimagining of George Bernard Shaw’s play &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. She retired from acting in 1984.

She directed several films for companies such as Adam &amp; Eve, VCA Pictures, and Vivid Entertainment.

===Publishing===
In 1977, she was hired as the publisher of &quot;High Society&quot; magazine, a position she held for 14 years while continuing to act and appear in films. She was hired by the magazine&#x27;s publisher Carl Ruderman, who wanted a female publisher of a men&#x27;s magazine. Adult-industry historian Ashley West stated in an interview that Ruderman expected her to be a figurehead, but that she took the position seriously. West said, &quot;Gloria really would visit wholesalers herself, had relationships with all the distributors, would hire and fire staff, would supervise layouts, would recommend and decide upon the content, so really became a hands-on editor, at least in the first five or six years of her stint at &quot;High Society.&quot;&quot;

Leonard is also credited with two successful ideas that each became cottage industries: the publishing of nude celebrity photos and phone sex lines. Starting out as a feature that showcased risqué photos of celebrities like Jodie Foster and Goldie Hawn, usually lifted from film stills, the former became a spin-off venture of &quot;High Society&quot; called &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; magazine in 1986. Over its 25-year run Margot Kidder, Ann-Margret and Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully attempted to sue the magazine after it published nude photos of them.

===Phone sex line pioneer===
Leonard is credited with being one of the first people to use &quot;976 numbers&quot; for promotional purposes and as a revenue stream: this later became known as the &quot;phone sex&quot; industry. Initially Leonard recorded her own voice informing callers of the contents of the next issue of &quot;High Society&quot; magazine before its publication. Later she recorded others, such as Annie Sprinkle, &quot;talking sexy&quot;. Leonard convinced magazine owner Ruderman to purchase more of these numbers and the business began to be successful using the magazine to promote the service.

===Appearances===
Early in her career she was interviewed by a magazine for an article titled &quot;The Parkway All-Stars&quot; (after the Mosholu Parkway in the Bronx) about a group of overachievers who grew up within a 15-block radius. The article also featured interviews with actor Robert Klein, actress Penny Marshall (and her brother, TV producer Garry Marshall) and fashion designers Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. Leonard remarked to a colleague, &quot;Yeah, I knew Ralph Lauren when he was Ralph Lipschitz&quot; (actually Lifshitz).

Leonard was also presenter at an awards ceremony for &quot;Video Review&quot; magazine that was emceed by Klein. She recalled in an interview, &quot;When he introduced me he told the audience, &#x27;For 15 years I walked to school with this woman and I saw more of her in three minutes of Misty Beethoven than I saw in all of those 15 years.&#x27;&quot;

Leonard appeared in a documentary film by Melissa Monet called &quot;Porn—It&#x27;s A Living&quot;. Leonard delivered the film&#x27;s opening line: &quot;Not too many people are going to be proud saying, &#x27;Look at my daughter, look how good she sucks cock.&#x27;&quot;

===Television appearances===
She had a role as a salesperson on &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; in 1984, in the episode &quot;Manna from Heaven&quot;. Leonard had also been a guest on several talk shows, including &quot;Oprah&quot;, &quot;Geraldo&quot;, &quot;Maury&quot;, &quot;Larry King&quot;, &quot;Morton Downey Jr.&quot;, and &quot;Howard Stern&quot;. She has also hosted her own television shows - &quot;The Leonard Report: For Adults Only&quot; and later, &quot;Gloria Leonard&#x27;s Hot Shopper Hour&quot;.

==Advocacy==

===Organizations===
Leonard helped found and was a lifetime member of one of the industry&#x27;s earliest adult actress support groups. Started in 1984, the group was named &quot;Club 90&quot; and initially met at Annie Sprinkle&#x27;s home at &quot;90 Lexington Avenue&quot; in New York. Other members included Veronica Vera, Veronica Hart, Annie Sprinkle, and Candida Royalle.

She also served as administrative director of the Adult Film and Video Association of America, the adult film industry trade association, from 1989 to 1992, until that organization merged with the Free Speech Coalition. In 1998, she was elected president of the FSC. She was also president of the AFVAA in 1986.

===Feminism===
Leonard was a feminist and free speech advocate, and debated on the issues of pornography and censorship and their impact on the women&#x27;s movement at several colleges and universities. For several years in the 1980s she debated representatives from the feminist organization Women Against Pornography at numerous college campuses.

==Awards and recognition==
She won the Best Actress award for &quot;Taboo, American Style&quot; from the AFAA. Leonard is a member of the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) Hall of Fame and Adult Video News (AVN) Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Leonard was Jewish and raised in the Bronx neighborhood of New York City. She was a single mother, more mature than most porn ingenues, and had had other occupations, such as a Wall Street broker and publicist. She was formerly married to adult-film producer/director Bobby Hollander. Her first two marriages ended in divorce. She was separated from Hollander, her third husband, when he died in 2002.

===Relationship with Norman Mailer===
In a chance meeting in an Upper East Side New York restaurant in 1982, Leonard first met author/playwright Norman Mailer. Mailer, a noted womanizer, struck up a conversation with Leonard after recognizing her. The meeting was rumored to have led to an affair between the two, but it did not last long.

Later on, Leonard was approached by a group of movie distributors from the Midwest to finance what was described as &quot;the world&#x27;s first million-dollar pornographic movie.&quot; She invited Mailer to lunch and made her pitch. In an interview Leonard said that the author &quot;sat straight up in his chair and said, &#x27;I always knew I&#x27;d one day make a porny.&#x27;&quot; Leonard then asked what his fee would be and Mailer responded with &quot;Two-hundred fifty thousand&quot;. The project later ended due to scheduling conflicts between the two.

==Death==
Leonard had made her home in Waimea, Hawaii, in what proved to be her last years. Either on January 31, 2014, or in the early hours of February 1, she suffered a massive stroke there. Not found for approximately 24 hours afterward, she was transported to a nearby hospital. As a result of the stroke, Leonard was left with extensive brain damage, and she died on February 3, 2014, at the age of 73, after having her life-support systems disconnected.

Cochise (or &quot;Cheis&quot;) was one of the most noted Apache leaders (along with Geronimo and Mangas Coloradas) to resist intrusions by Mexicans and Americans during the 19th century. He was described as a large man (for the time), with a muscular frame, classical features, and long, black hair, which he wore in traditional Apache style. He was about tall and weighed about . In his own language, his name &quot;Cheis&quot; meant &quot;having the quality or strength of oak.&quot;

Cochise and the Chokonen-Chiricahua lived in the area that is now the northern region of Sonora, Mexico; New Mexico, and Arizona, which they had settled in sometime before the arrival of the European explorers and colonists. As Spain and later Mexico attempted to gain dominion over the Chiricahua lands, the indigenous groups became increasingly resistant. Cycles of warfare developed, which the Apache mostly won. Eventually, the Spanish tried a different approach; they tried to make the Apache dependent (thereby placating them), giving them older firearms and liquor rations issued by the colonial government (this was called the &quot;Galvez Peace Policy&quot;). After Mexico gained independence from Spain and took control of this territory, it ended the practice, perhaps lacking the resources (and/or possibly the will) to continue it. The various Chiricahua bands resumed raiding in the 1830s to acquire what they wanted after the Mexicans stopped selling these goods to them.

As a result, the Mexican government began a series of military operations to stop the raiding by the Chiricahua, but they were fought to a standstill by the Apache. Cochise&#x27;s father was killed in the fighting. Cochise deepened his resolve, and the Chiricahua Apache pursued vengeance against the Mexicans. Mexican forces captured Cochise at one point in 1848 during an Apache raid on Fronteras, Sonora, but he was exchanged for nearly a dozen Mexican prisoners.

===Border tensions and fighting===
Beginning with early Spanish colonization around 1600, the Apache suffered tension and strife with European settlers until the greater part of the area was acquired by the United States in 1850 following the Mexican War. For a time, the two peoples managed peaceful relations. In the late 1850s, Cochise may have supplied firewood for the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach station at Apache Pass.

The tenuous peace did not last, as American encroachment into Apache territory continued. In 1861, the Bascom affair was a catalyst for armed confrontation. An Apache raiding party had driven away a local rancher&#x27;s cattle and kidnapped his 12-year-old stepson (Felix Ward, who later became known as Mickey Free). Cochise and his band were mistakenly accused of the incident (which had been carried out by another band, Coyotero Apache). Army officer Lt. George Bascom invited Cochise to the Army&#x27;s encampment in the belief that the warrior was responsible for the incident. Cochise maintained his innocence and offered to look into the matter with other Apache groups, but the officer tried to arrest him. Cochise escaped by drawing a knife and slashing his way out of the tent, but was shot at as he fled.

Bascom captured some of Cochise&#x27;s relatives, who apparently were taken by surprise as Cochise escaped. Cochise eventually also took hostages to use in negotiations to free the Apache Indians. However, the negotiations fell apart, because the arrival of U.S. troop reinforcements led Cochise to believe that the situation was spiraling out of his control. Both sides eventually killed all their remaining hostages. Cochise went on to carry out about 11 years of relentless warfare, reducing much of the Mexican/American settlements in southern Arizona to a burned-out wasteland. Dan Thrapp estimated the total death toll of settlers and Mexican/American travelers as 5,000, but most historians believe it was more likely a few hundred. The mistaken arrest of Cochise by Lt. Bascom is still remembered by the Chiricahua&#x27;s descendants today, who describe the incident as &quot;Cut the Tent&quot;.

Cochise joined his father-in-law Mangas Coloradas (Red Sleeves, &quot;Kan-da-zis Tlishishen&quot;), the powerful Chihenne-Chiricahua chief, in a long series of retaliatory skirmishes and raids on the white settlements and ranches. The First Battle of Dragoon Springs was one of these engagements. During the raids, many people were killed, but the Apache quite often had the upper hand. The United States was distracted by its own internal conflict of the looming Civil War, and had begun to pull military forces out of the area. Additionally, the Apaches were highly adapted to living and fighting in the harsh terrain of the Southwest. Many years passed before the US Army, using tactics conceived by General George Crook and later adopted by General Nelson A. Miles, was able to effectively challenge the Apache warriors on their own lands.

===Battle of Apache Pass===
At Apache Pass in 1862, Cochise and Mangas Coloradas, with around 500 fighters, held their ground against a New Mexico-bound force of California volunteers under General James Henry Carleton until carriage-mounted howitzer artillery fire was brought to bear on their positions in the rocks above.

According to scout John C. Cremony and historian Dan L. Thrapp, the howitzer fire sent the Apaches into an immediate retreat. The Battle of Apache Pass was one of the rare pitched battles the Apaches fought against the Army. Normally, the Apaches&#x27; tactics involved guerrilla-style warfare. Capt. Thomas Roberts was persuaded by this conflict that it would be best to find a route around Apache Pass, which he did. Gen. Carleton continued unhindered to New Mexico and subsequently took over as commander of the territory.

In January 1863, Gen. Joseph R. West, under orders from Gen. Carleton, captured Mangas Coloradas by luring him into a conference under a flag of truce. During what was to be a peaceful parley session, the Americans took Mangas Coloradas prisoner and later murdered him. This fanned the flames of enmity between the encroaching Americans and the Apache. Cochise believed that the Americans had violated the rules of war by capturing and killing Mangas Coloradas during a parley session. Cochise and the Apache continued their raids against U.S. and Mexican settlements and military positions throughout the 1860s.

===Capture, escape and retirement===

Following various skirmishes, Cochise and his men were gradually driven into Arizona&#x27;s Dragoon Mountains, but used the mountains for cover and as a base from which to continue attacks against white settlements. Cochise evaded capture and continued his raids against white settlements and travelers until 1872. In 1871, General Oliver O. Howard was ordered to find Cochise, and in 1872, Howard was accompanied by his aide 1st Lt Joseph A. Sladen and Captain Samuel S. Sumner to Arizona to negotiate a peace treaty with Cochise. Tom Jeffords, the Apache leader&#x27;s only white friend, was also present. A treaty was negotiated on October 12, 1872. Based on statements by Sumner and descriptions by Sladen, modern historians such as Robert M. Utley believe that Cochise&#x27;s Spanish interpreter was Geronimo.

After the peace treaty, Cochise retired to the short-lived Chiricahua Reservation (1872–1876), with his friend Jeffords as agent. He died of natural causes (probably abdominal cancer) in 1874, and was buried in the rocks above one of his favorite camps in Arizona&#x27;s Dragoon Mountains, now called the Cochise Stronghold. Only his people and Tom Jeffords knew the exact location of his resting place, which they never disclosed.

Many of Cochise&#x27;s descendants reside at the Mescalero Apache Reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico, and in Oklahoma with the Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Chiricahua Warm Springs Apache.

Whether a portrait of Cochise exists is unknown; a reported portrait is actually that of a 1903 Pueblo of Isleta man named Juan Rey Abeita.

==Family==
Cochise married Dos-teh-seh (&quot;Dos-tes-ey&quot;, &quot;Doh-teh-seh&quot; – &quot;Something-at-the-campfire-already-cooked&quot;, b. 1838), the daughter of Mangas Coloradas, who was the leader of the Warm Springs and Mimbreño local groups of the Chihenne band. Their children were Taza (1842–1876) and Naiche (1856–1919).

==In popular culture==
*The US Navy tugboat USS Cochise (YTB-216) was named after him
*In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, three starships were named after Cochise: USS Cochise (NCC-530, Cochise-class), USS Cochise (NCC-4345, Larson-class), and USS Cochise (Constellation-class) 
*The best-selling novel by Elliott Arnold in 1947 titled &quot;Blood Brother&quot; gives a fictionalized account of the latter part of the struggle and friendship between Tom Jeffords and Cochise.
*In 1950, director Delmer Daves turned Arnold&#x27;s novel into a film retitled &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, featuring James Stewart as Tom Jeffords and Jeff Chandler as Cochise. &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; is often credited as the first sound film to show a sympathetic picture of Native Americans and influenced the popular image of Native American people. The tall, handsome, deeply tanned Chandler, a Jewish actor born in Brooklyn, New York, portrayed Cochise as a noble, nearly tragic character forced to fight against the U.S. Army officers who led incursions into Apache territory.
*John Ford&#x27;s representation of Cochise in the 1948 film &quot;Fort Apache&quot; was also positive to Native Americans, although in that film, Cochise spoke Spanish (a language the Apaches had learned from their Mexican enemies). 
*Jeff Chandler again portrayed Cochise in the 1952 film &quot;The Battle at Apache Pass&quot;. &quot;Taza, Son of Cochise&quot; (1954), stars Rock Hudson as his son, Taza. 
*The film &quot;Conquest of Cochise&quot; released by Columbia Pictures in 1953 and starring John Hodiak as Cochise also showed Cochise as a caring man who wanted peace with whites. 
*&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; is a TV series adapted from the 1950 film that told a fictionalized account of the historical relationship between Tom Jeffords (John Lupton) and Cochise (Michael Ansara); the show was aired on ABC in prime time from 1956 through 1958. 
*Cochise was portrayed by Jeff Morrow in a 1961 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;.
*&quot;Cochise&quot; is an instrumental piece in the album &quot;Guitars&quot;, by Mike Oldfield.
*Audioslave&#x27;s debut single &quot;Cochise&quot; is named after the chief. In an interview, guitarist Tom Morello said that Cochise was &quot;the last great American Indian chief to die free and absolutely unconquered. When several members of his family were captured, tortured, and hanged by the U.S. Cavalry, Cochise declared war on the entire Southwest... Cochise the avenger, fearless and resolute, attacked everything in his path with an unbridled fury.&quot;
*The 2008 novel by Melody Groves titled &quot;Arizona War: A Colton Brothers Saga&quot; gives a fictionalized account of Cochise&#x27;s dealings with the main characters, James and Trace Colton, during the early 1860s, including the Bascom affair of 1861 and the New Mexico-bound force of California volunteers under General James Henry Carleton during 1862.
*Wes Studi portrays Cochise in &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot; despite the film being set in 1882, eight years after Cochise&#x27;s death.
*A statue of Cochise is shown as a meeting point between friends Jaime Reyes and Tye Longshadow in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; episode &quot;Beneath&quot;.
*A small lunar crater was named after Cochise, located near the landing site in the Taurus–Littrow valley, by the astronauts of Apollo 17.
*Phoenix-area theme park, Legend City (now defunct), featured a popular animatronic river ride called Cochise&#x27;s Stronghold.
*An alien from the TV show &quot;Falling Skies&quot; is nicknamed &quot;Cochise&quot; by his human allies.

That photo is a popular one of Chato (Apache) from the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Anthropological Archives: See Portrait of Chief Chato in Native Dress 1886. Since the photo was taken in 1886, Cochise was long gone (he died in 1874). The second photo in Find a Grave is of Eskiminzin, the Aravapai Apache leader.

<text>Arsenio Hall (born February 12, 1956) is an American comedian, actor and talk show host. He hosted a late-night talk show, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, from 1989 until 1994, and again from 2013 to 2014.

He has appeared in &quot;Martial Law&quot;, &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; (2021), and &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989). He was also the host of &quot;Star Search&quot; and appeared as Alan Thicke&#x27;s sidekick on the talk show &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;.

In 2012, he won NBC&#x27;s reality-competition game show &quot;Celebrity Apprentice 5&quot;.

==Early life==
Hall was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Fred and Annie Hall. His father is a Baptist minister. Hall performed as a magician when he was a child. He graduated from Warrensville Heights High School in Warrensville Heights, Ohio, in 1973, after briefly attending John F. Kennedy High School. He later attended Ohio University and Kent State University.

==Career==
Hall later moved to Chicago, and then Los Angeles, to pursue a career in comedy, making a couple of appearances on &quot;Soul Train&quot;. In 1984, he was the announcer/sidekick for Alan Thicke during the short-lived talk show &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot; (a role for which he has on occasion noted his confusion with Monty Hall).

He appeared on five weeks of episodes of the short-lived NBC game show &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; from 1983 to 1984. He was also the original voice of Winston Zeddemore in the animated series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; from 1986 to 1987. In 1988, he co-starred in the comedy film &quot;Coming to America&quot; with Eddie Murphy. During his career, he set up Arsenio Hall Communications in 1987, and then he had signed a two-year, multi-picture agreement with Paramount Pictures to develop films for an exclusive agreement.

===Talk shows===
In 1986, the Fox network introduced &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, created to directly challenge &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. After a moderate start, ratings for the show sagged. Relations between Rivers and network executives at Fox quickly eroded, and she left in 1987. The series was subsequently renamed &quot;The Late Show&quot;, and featured several interim hosts, including Ross Shafer, Suzanne Somers, Shawn Thompson, Richard Belzer and Robert Townsend, before it was canceled in 1988. Hall was also chosen to host the show in the fall of 1987, and his stint proved immensely popular, leading to his being offered his own show in syndication.

From January 2, 1989, to May 27, 1994, he had a Paramount contract to host a nationwide syndicated late-night talk show, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. It was a breakout success, rating especially high among the coveted younger demographic, and it was known for its audience&#x27;s distinctive alternative to applause in chanting, &quot;Woof, woof, woof!&quot; (which originated in the Cleveland Browns&#x27; Dawg Pound in the east end zone) while pumping their fists. The practice soon became such a ritual that by 1991 it had become a &quot;pop culture stamp of approval&quot;—one that Hall said had become &quot;so popular it&#x27;s getting on people&#x27;s nerves&quot;. The gesture was so well known that it appeared in films such as &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and &quot;The Hard Way&quot;.

He also had a rivalry with Jay Leno after the latter was named host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, during which Hall said that he would &quot;kick Jay&#x27;s ass&quot; in ratings.

==== Support of gay rights and the fight against AIDS ====
Hall was a supporter of gay rights long before the movement had become overwhelmingly popular and supported in the mainstream, especially in black culture. In the early 1990s, this culminated in an episode of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; where Hall was protested by gay rights activists, who criticized that he didn&#x27;t have any gay guests on the show and that he would occasionally play gay characters; Hall was clearly upset by the accusation, saying he had famously put LGBT celebrities on his show, including Elton John, and had others on who preferred not to publicly advocate their sexual orientation. After passionately stating his points, Hall received overwhelming woof chants of support from his audience. Additionally, Hall used his fame during this period to help fight worldwide prejudice against HIV/AIDS after Magic Johnson contracted the virus. Hall and Johnson filmed a public service announcement about the disease that aired in the early 1990s.

===Other television and radio work===

Between 1988 and 1991, Hall hosted the MTV Video Music Awards. Over the years, he has appeared as a guest on numerous talk shows, in special features, as a voice actor, on game shows and other award shows. Since &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; ended, Hall had leading roles on television shows such as the short-lived sitcom &quot;Arsenio&quot; (1997) and &quot;Martial Law&quot; with Sammo Hung (1998–2000), and hosted the revival of &quot;Star Search&quot; (2003–2004). While hosting &quot;Star Search&quot;, he popularized the catchphrase &quot;Hit me with the digits!&quot;

Hall appeared as himself in &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; in March 2004 (convinced by Swedish comedy director Saman Khadiri) when Chappelle was imagining &quot;what Arsenio is doing right now&quot; in a dinner scene. Hall has guest co-hosted Wednesday evenings on &quot;The Tim Conway Jr. Show&quot; on KLSX 97.1 FM radio. He hosted MyNetworkTV&#x27;s comedic web video show &quot;The World&#x27;s Funniest Moments&quot; and TV One&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Black Power Moves&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; in May 2012, in a discussion commemorating the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

Hall was considered the host of the syndicated version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and filmed a pilot (there were six taped). However, by the time the syndicated series began on September 8, 2008, Howie Mandel was chosen as host.

Hall also appeared regularly on &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, and was a guest on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot;. George Lopez credits Arsenio as the reason he had a late night show; Lopez appeared on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; more times than any other comedian. Lopez requested Hall be a co-host on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; (November 25, 2009) since he regarded Hall as his inspiration and the first &quot;late night party show host&quot;. Hall has filled in as guest host for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Access Hollywood Live&quot; (2011) and CNN&#x27;s evening talk/interview program &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; in 2012.

In 2012, Hall was a contestant on the fifth edition of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, which began airing February 19, 2012. Hall represented his charity, the Magic Johnson Foundation, which is dedicated to advancing economic and social equality by engaging minorities in every aspect of their communities; increasing academic and innovative achievement; and raising HIV/AIDS awareness, treatment and prevention. While Hall clashed with Aubrey O&#x27;Day, he befriended a majority of the cast. On May 20, 2012, in the live season finale, he was chosen as the &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; winner, being &quot;hired&quot; by Donald Trump over the other celebrity finalist, singer Clay Aiken. For winning &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, Hall won the $250,000 grand prize for his charity, in addition to money for the tasks he and his team performed when he was a team leader.

A revival of Hall&#x27;s syndicated late-night talk show, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, premiered September 9, 2013, on Tribune owned stations and other networks via CBS Television Distribution. It was canceled after one season due to low ratings. The last taping aired May 30, 2014.

Arsenio appeared in a bit in the January 2024 Emmys.

==Personal life==
In 1997, after being out of the public eye for three years, Hall gave an interview to dispel rumors regarding what had driven him off stage. &quot;I went on the Internet,&quot; he said, &quot;and read I was in detox at Betty Ford. I got online under a fake name and typed in, &#x27;I know Arsenio better than anyone else and he&#x27;s not in detox, you idiots!&#x27;&quot;

Hall has one son, born in 1998. Hall says he took time off to raise his son before resuming &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in 2013. Hall had an interest in returning to the business eventually, but his decision was not confirmed until he appeared on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; in 2009 (although he initially considered a weekend show because he did not want to compete in ratings against his friend George Lopez).

On May 5, 2016, Hall filed a $5 million defamation lawsuit against Sinéad O&#x27;Connor after she claimed he had fueled Prince&#x27;s drug habit and had also spiked his drink at a party at Eddie Murphy&#x27;s house. Hall dropped the lawsuit after O&#x27;Connor apologized and retracted her allegations.

==Recognition==
* 1988 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (&quot;Coming to America&quot;)
* 1989 American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (&quot;Coming to America&quot;)

<doc id="275563" wikidata="Q539437" url="?curid=275563" title="Gayane (ballet)">
<text>Gayane (&quot;Gayaneh&quot; or &quot;Gayne&quot;, the &quot;e&quot; is pronounced; ; ) is a four-act ballet with music by Aram Khachaturian. Originally composed in or before 1939, when it was first produced (in Yerevan) as &quot;Happiness&quot;. Revised in 1941–42 to a libretto by Konstantin Derzhavin and with choreography by Nina Aleksandrovna Anisimova (Derzhavin&#x27;s wife), the score was revised in 1952 and in 1957, with a new plot. The stage design was by Nathan Altman (scenery) and Tatyana Bruni (costumes).

The first performance took place on 9 December 1942, staged by the Kirov Ballet while in Perm, Russia, during the Second World War evacuation, and was broadcast on the radio. The principal dancers were: Natalia Dudinskaya (Gayane), Nikolai Zubkovsky (Karen), Konstantin Sergeyev (Armen), Tatanya Vecheslova (Nune), and Boris Shavrov (Giko). The conductor was Pavel Feldt. The most famous parts of the ballet are the &quot;Sabre Dance&quot;, which has been performed by many (including pop artists).

Khachaturian&#x27;s original &quot;Gayane&quot; was the story of a young Armenian woman whose patriotic convictions conflict with her personal feelings on discovering her husband&#x27;s treason. In later years the plot was modified several times, the resultant story emphasizing romance over nationalistic zeal.

== Background ==
The ballet, based on an earlier ballet composed in 1939 by Khachaturian called &quot;Happiness&quot;, was created when the Kirov ballet was in Perm. Khachaturian started composing the score in autumn 1941 and the ballet was first mounted on 3 December 1942 on the small stage of the Perm state theatre. Despite these limitations, the effect was profound; in effect, the message was that the company was continuing to exist and to produce new ballets, despite the very hard times. Anisimova invited different dancers to participate in her ballet, dancers who happened to be in the city at that time; there was a sense of &quot;camaraderie&quot; and combined effort which suited the positive feeling of the ballet itself. The composition, the music, the dancing, all together created something which, regardless of the weaknesses in the libretto, expressed the triumph of dancing and its many different possibilities.

== Instrumentation ==
The orchestral score calls for:
* &quot;woodwinds&quot;: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), alto saxophone, 2 bassoons;
* &quot;Brass&quot;: 4 horns, cornet, 3 trumpets, alto trumpet, 3 trombones, bass tuba;
* Timpani &quot;and percussion&quot;: triangle, tambourine, 2 side drums, cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, &quot;doli&quot;, &quot;daira&quot;, &quot;Glockenspiel&quot;, xylophone, marimba, vibraphone, chimes;
* &quot;keyboards&quot;: celesta, piano;
* &quot;strings&quot;: 2 harps, violins (1st and 2nd), violas, cellos and double basses.

== Plot ==
Many themes of love, betrayal and friendship interact in an Armenian setting. The central character is a young woman named Gayane, who works in a kolkhoz in a mountainous district near the national border.

;Act I
In the Armenian kolkhoz, farmers are busy reaping cotton. Among them are heroine Gayane, her father Ovanes, brother Armen and younger sister Nune. They are all models of hard work with the only exception of Gayane&#x27;s husband Giko, a lazy drunkard. She admonishes Giko for his misconduct and this escalates into a quarrel. Then arrives Kazakov, commander of the Soviet frontier guard, and a dance of welcome begins. Seeing Gayane present a bouquet to Kazakov, Giko violently snatches the bouquet from her and ignoring everybody&#x27;s reproach, disappears.

;Act II
At Gayane&#x27;s home, people console Gayane who is deploring her husband&#x27;s misconduct. The singing voices of carpet weavers are heard. As Giko returns, all go out. Gayane sings her child Ripsime to sleep. Three smugglers come to see Giko. They conspire to share the public money they have embezzled, to set fire to the cotton warehouse and to flee abroad. Overhearing their conspiracy, Gayane admonishes her husband, but he thrusts her into another room and locks her up.

;Act III
At a Kurdish settlement in a mountainous area near the kolkhoz are many people, including Gayane&#x27;s brother Armen, a Kurdish girl Aishe, and a Kurdish young man Izmail who loves her. Giko and the three smugglers arrive, asking Armen their way. Wondering about their intentions and activity, he sends some Kurdish youths to fetch Kazakov. Noticing this, Giko and his gang try to kill Armen, but Kazakov appears just in time and arrests the three smugglers. Giko escapes, however, and sets fire to the cotton warehouse. Trying to flee in the confusion of the moment, Giko is found by Gayane, who has managed to break out of the room in which she was imprisoned. Giko threatens Gayane that he will drop their child Ripsime from a cliff. As Gayane does not yield, Giko stabs her with a dagger. Hearing her shriek, Kazakov rushes in and arrests Giko, who will be brought to justice. Kazakov tends Gayane devotedly, and she recovers. Love grows between the two.

;Act IV
A year later, at the kolkhoz, a dedication ceremony of the reconstructed warehouse occurs, as well as three weddings: Gayane and Kazakov, Armen and Aishe, Karen and Nune. Folk dances, rich in local color, are performed one after another. The ballet ends amid blessings by all.

== Analysis ==
The ballet &quot;Gayane&quot; was modestly successful when danced before Joseph Stalin; performances outside the USSR have been infrequent. At the time, it was understood that the simple libretto was a necessary backdrop for the dancing, which was splendidly staged and choreographed by Anisimova, who danced in the original production. Choreographically, Anisimova thought in character dancing terms; she knew much classical dance.

Excerpts from &quot;Gayane&quot; are performed by dance companies and dance schools, especially the wedding in the second act: wonderful duets and variations for Gayane and Kazakov, her lover. The choreography was unusual for its time—classical and folk dance combined—especially the stylized use of arms and hands from the folkloric Armenian culture that is the ballet&#x27;s background.

The collective farm&#x27;s ethnic diversity is the backdrop for each part of the music (adagio arrangements, lively Armenian and Caucasian tunes) and for the compelling tale of love between a couple from different social classes.

The premiere cast included Natalia Dudinskaya and Konstantin Sergeyev, then leading figures in Leningrad ballet. Nina Anisimova danced the part of an Armenian girl who is an image and symbol of socialist labour: she works hard, she knows how to produce the most from the fields, but she also knows how to enjoy life, spending her free time dancing and laughing.

The suite of dances in the second act reflects the nationalities of the Soviet Union. At the time, Armenia was one of 15 republics within the Union. For that, Anisimova created the famous &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; that, when performed as a musical extract, became a showpiece for many dance companies.

The style of movement in the dance is unusual and unexpected for character dance—unusual bends of the body, inventive positions of the arms, not from the classical moves, the overall structure of the body is not balletic, but, most of all, in keeping with Khachaturian&#x27;s music, the choreography is temperamental, like Anisimova herself.

When critics analysed &quot;Gayane&quot;, they saw that, in strict ballet terms, it is not completely successful as a whole, because of its naïve libretto and its overtly social emphasis, yet, choreographers, critics, and historians persuaded the Kirov Theatre to profitably stage excerpts of the ballet.

The &quot;Variation of Gayane&quot;, the &quot;Variation of Giko&quot;, and the character dances were effectively done and subsequently danced as gala pieces. After its premiere in Perm, Anisimova twice restaged &quot;Gayane&quot; for the Kirov and after revision, the 1952 version stands as the definitive version of &quot;Gayane&quot;.

In the end, Nina Anisimova proved that character dancing endures and should be included in the world of classical ballet. The dance in &quot;Gayane&quot; did not follow the Petipa tradition, for example &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, wherein the audience is treated to national dance in discrete divertissements of &quot;dances of le salon&quot;, in Petipa&#x27;s words; in contrast, the dance in &quot;Gayane&quot;, by force of character, is felt throughout the ballet; it is a natural part of the people and of their history. In time, the ballet helped choreographers understand the importance of choreographic art in Russia, combining character dance with classical and mime traditions. &quot;Gayane&quot; is an excellent example of character dance and ballet combined; its artistic value to twentieth-century Soviet choreography is significant.

For concert performance Khachaturian arranged three orchestral suites drawn from the score. Published in 1943, these became very popular. The suites exist in various configurations, and conductors often compile their own selection for any given performance.

Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; featured one of the less up-tempo sections of the &quot;Gayane&quot; third suite (the Adagio). The composer James Horner quoted from this same piece in three of his film scores, &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;. The &quot;Adagio&quot; was also used, among other pieces by Khachaturyan, in Tinto Brass&#x27;s &quot;Caligula&quot;. 

The &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; features prominently in the 1961 film &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; directed by Billy Wilder and starring James Cagney, as well as in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Scoop&quot;. It has also been used in numerous other movies, TV shows, and video games. Because of its feverish tempo, the music has long been a staple of novelty acts such as plate twirling. It is also used as the introductory and promotional theme for the professional hockey team, the Buffalo Sabres.

<doc id="275564" wikidata="Q154824" url="?curid=275564" title="Norman Borlaug">
<text>Norman Ernest Borlaug (; March 25, 1914September 12, 2009) was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal, one of only seven people to have received all three awards.

Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and PhD in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations.

Borlaug is often called &quot;the father of the Green Revolution&quot;, and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook&#x27;s 1997 article &quot;Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity.&quot; The article states that the &quot;form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths.&quot; Dennis T. Avery also estimated that the number of lives saved by Borlaug&#x27;s efforts to be one billion. In 2009, Josette Sheeran, then the Executive Director of the World Food Programme, stated that Borlaug &quot;saved more lives than any man in human history&quot;. He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.

Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa. He was also an accomplished wrestler in college and a pioneer of wrestling in the United States, being inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame for his contributions.

==Early life, education, and family==

Borlaug was the great-grandchild of Norwegian immigrants to the United States. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of Feios, a small village in Vik kommune, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway, emigrated to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1854. The family eventually moved to the small Norwegian-American community of Saude, near Cresco, Iowa. There they were members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was baptized and confirmed.

Borlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889–1971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888–1972) on his grandparents&#x27; farm in Saude in 1914, the first of four children. His three sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916–2004), Charlotte (Culbert; 1919–2012) and Helen (b. d. 1921). From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the family farm west of Protivin, fishing, hunting, and raising corn, oats, timothy-grass, cattle, pigs and chickens. He attended the one-teacher, one-room New Oregon #8 rural school in Howard County through eighth grade. Today, the school building, built in 1865, is owned by the Norman Borlaug Heritage Foundation as part of &quot;Project Borlaug Legacy&quot;. At Cresco High School, Borlaug was a member of the football, baseball and wrestling teams; his wrestling coach, Dave Barthelma, continually encouraged him to &quot;give 105%&quot;.

Borlaug attributed his decision to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather&#x27;s urgent encouragement to learn: Nels Olson Borlaug (1859–1935) once told him, &quot;you&#x27;re wiser to fill your head now if you want to fill your belly later on.&quot; When Borlaug applied for admission to the University of Minnesota in 1933, he failed its entrance exam, but was accepted at the school&#x27;s newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture&#x27;s forestry program. As a member of the University of Minnesota men&#x27;s wrestling team, Borlaug reached the Big Ten semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in exhibition matches all around the state:

Wrestling taught me some valuable lessons ... I always figured I could hold my own against the best in the world. It made me tough. Many times, I drew on that strength. It&#x27;s an inappropriate crutch perhaps, but that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;m made.

To finance his studies, Borlaug put his education on hold periodically to earn some income, as he did in 1935 as a leader in the Civilian Conservation Corps, working with the unemployed on federal projects. Many of the people who worked for him were starving. He later recalled, &quot;I saw how food changed them. All of this left scars on me&quot;. From 1935 to 1938, before and after receiving his Bachelor of Science in forestry in 1937, Borlaug worked for the United States Forest Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. He spent one summer in the middle fork of Idaho&#x27;s Salmon River, the most isolated piece of wilderness in the nation at that time.

In the last months of his undergraduate education, Borlaug attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Charles Stakman, a professor and soon-to-be head of the plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug&#x27;s future. Stakman, in his speech entitled &quot;These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops&quot;, discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust, a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley crops. Stakman had discovered that special plant breeding methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug&#x27;s job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest pathology. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead. He subsequently enrolled at the university to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a Master of Science degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942.

Borlaug was a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. While in college, he met his future wife, Margaret Gibson, as he waited tables at a coffee shop in the university&#x27;s Dinkytown, where the two worked. They were married in 1937 and had three children, Norma Jean &quot;Jeanie&quot; Laube, Scotty (who died from spina bifida soon after birth), and William; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. On March 8, 2007, Margaret Borlaug died at the age of 95 following a fall. They had been married for 69 years. Borlaug resided in Dallas the last years of his life, although his global humanitarian efforts left him with only a few weeks of the year to spend there.

==Career==
From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural bacteriocides, fungicides, and preservatives. However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces. One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had gained control of the island of Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with camouflage, canteen disinfectants, DDT to control malaria, and insulation for small electronics.

In 1940, the Avila Camacho administration took office in Mexico. The administration&#x27;s primary goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation&#x27;s industrialization and economic growth. U.S. Vice President-Elect Henry Wallace, who was instrumental in persuading the Rockefeller Foundation to work with the Mexican government in agricultural development, saw Avila Camacho&#x27;s ambitions as beneficial to U.S. economic and military interests. The Rockefeller Foundation contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both Mexican and US scientists, focusing on soil development, maize and wheat production, and plant pathology.

Stakman chose Dr. Jacob George &quot;Dutch&quot; Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to hire Borlaug as head of the newly established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont. In July 1944, after rejecting DuPont&#x27;s offer to double his salary, and temporarily leaving behind his pregnant wife and 14-month-old daughter, he flew to Mexico City to head the new program as a geneticist and plant pathologist.

In 1964, Borlaug was made the director of the International Wheat Improvement Program at El Batán, Texcoco, on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, as part of the newly established Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research&#x27;s International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center &quot;(Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo,&quot; or CIMMYT). Funding for this autonomous international research training institute developed from the Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program was undertaken jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Mexican government.

Besides his work in genetic resistance against crop loss, Borlaug felt that pesticides including DDT had more benefits than drawbacks for humanity and advocated publicly for their continued use. He continued to support pesticide use despite the severe public criticism he received for it. Borlaug mostly admired the work and personality of Rachel Carson but lamented her &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, what he saw as an inaccurate portrayal of the effects of DDT.

Borlaug retired officially from the position in 1979, but remained a CIMMYT senior consultant. In addition to taking up charitable and educational roles, he continued to be involved in plant research at CIMMYT with wheat, triticale, barley, maize, and high-altitude sorghum.

In 1981, Borlaug became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

In 1984, Borlaug began teaching and conducting research at Texas A&amp;M University. Eventually he was given the title Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture at the university and the holder of the Eugene Butler Endowed Chair in Agricultural Biotechnology.

He advocated for agricultural biotechnology as he had for pesticides in earlier decades: publicly, knowledgeably, and always despite heavy criticism.

Borlaug served on the faculty of the University of Minnesota, University of Iowa, Cornell University, and Texas A&amp;M University. Borlaug remained at A&amp;M until his death in September 2009.

==Wheat research in Mexico==
The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil science, and cereal technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain. Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944. The four other members were soil scientist William Colwell; maize breeder Edward Wellhausen; potato breeder John Niederhauser; and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States. During the sixteen years Borlaug remained with the project, he bred a series of remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat.

Borlaug said that his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust. &quot;It often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico,&quot; he wrote in the epilogue to his book, &quot;Norman Borlaug on World Hunger&quot;. He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including rust. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.

===Double harvest season===
Initially, Borlaug&#x27;s work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of Chapingo near Texcoco, where the problems with rust and poor soil were most prevalent. The village never met their aims. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country&#x27;s two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the Valle del Yaqui research station near Ciudad Obregón, Sonora. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year.

Borlaug&#x27;s boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug&#x27;s plan went against a then-held principle of agronomy that has since been disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700 miles (1000 km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8,500 feet (2600 m) apart in altitude. This was called &quot;shuttle breeding&quot;.

As an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, &quot;As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we&#x27;d take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn&#x27;t supposed to happen by the books&quot;. This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.

===Disease resistance through varieties of wheat===
Because purebred (genotypically identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major genes for disease resistance, and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line&#x27;s resistance, multiple linear lines varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.

In 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent. Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug&#x27;s method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the pathogen. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines.

As new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.

===Dwarfing===
Dwarfing is an important agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants produce thick stems. The cultivars Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight but tend to collapse under the weight of the extra grain—a trait called lodging—from the rapid growth spurts induced by nitrogen fertilizer Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favor shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a Japanese dwarf variety of wheat called Norin 10 developed by the agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka in Iwate Prefecture, including ones which had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14 by Orville Vogel. Norin 10/Brevor 14 is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant. Also, larger amounts of assimilate were partitioned into the actual grains, further increasing the yield. Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor 14 cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates.

Borlaug&#x27;s new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of spring wheat dramatically. By 1963, 95% of Mexico&#x27;s wheat crops used the semi-dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug. That year, the harvest was six times larger than in 1944, the year Borlaug arrived in Mexico. Mexico had become fully self-sufficient in wheat production, and a net exporter of wheat. Four other high-yield varieties were also released, in 1964: Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros, Sonora 64, and Super X.

==Expansion to South Asia: the Green Revolution==

In 1961 to 1962, Borlaug&#x27;s dwarf spring wheat strains were sent for multilocation testing in the International Wheat Rust Nursery, organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In March 1962, a few of these strains were grown in the fields of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in Pusa, New Delhi, India. In May 1962, M. S. Swaminathan, a member of IARI&#x27;s wheat program, requested of Dr B. P. Pal, director of IARI, to arrange for the visit of Borlaug to India and to obtain a wide range of dwarf wheat seed possessing the Norin 10 dwarfing genes. The letter was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture headed by Shri C. Subramaniam, which arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation for Borlaug&#x27;s visit.

In March 1963, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government sent Borlaug and Dr Robert Glenn Anderson to India to continue his work. He supplied 100 kg (220 lb) of seed from each of the four most promising strains and 630 promising selections in advanced generations to the IARI in October 1963, and test plots were subsequently planted at Delhi, Ludhiana, Pant Nagar, Kanpur, Pune and Indore. Anderson stayed as head of the Rockefeller Foundation Wheat Program in New Delhi until 1975.

During the mid-1960s the Indian subcontinent was at war and experienced minor famine and starvation, which was limited partially by the U.S. shipping a fifth of its wheat production to India in 1966 and 1967. The Indian and Pakistani bureaucracies and the region&#x27;s cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from fulfilling his desire to immediately plant the new wheat strains there. In 1965, as a response to food shortages, Borlaug imported 550 tons of seeds for the government.

Biologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, &quot;The battle to feed all of humanity is over ... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.&quot; Ehrlich said, &quot;I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,&quot; and &quot;India couldn&#x27;t possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.&quot;

 In 1965, after extensive testing, Borlaug&#x27;s team, under Anderson, began its effort by importing about 450 tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250 tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat was held up in Mexican customs and so it could not be shipped from the port at Guaymas in time for proper planting. Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the Mexico–United States border. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to the Watts riots in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury&#x27;s payment of US$100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for Bombay, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve hours into the freighter&#x27;s voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Borlaug received a telegram from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I&#x27;ve got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank...&quot;

These delays prevented Borlaug&#x27;s group from conducting the germination tests needed to determine seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately and often worked in sight of artillery flashes. A week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at less than half the normal rate. It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates.

The initial yields of Borlaug&#x27;s crops were higher than any ever harvested in South Asia. The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000 tons—the largest purchase and import of any seed in the world at that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000 tons, and Turkey 21,000 tons. Pakistan&#x27;s import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation&#x27;s wheatland the following year. By 1968, when Ehrlich&#x27;s book was released, William Gaud of the United States Agency for International Development was calling Borlaug&#x27;s work a &quot;Green Revolution&quot;. High yields led to a shortage of various utilities—labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the threshing floor, jute bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.

In Pakistan, wheat yields nearly doubled, from 4.6 million tons in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970; Pakistan was self-sufficient in wheat production by 1968. Yields were over 21 million tons by 2000. In India, yields increased from 12.3 million tons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970. By 1974, India was self-sufficient in the production of all cereals. By 2000, India was harvesting a record 76.4 million tons (2.81 billion bushels) of wheat. Since the 1960s, food production in both nations has increased faster than the rate of population growth. India&#x27;s use of high-yield farming has prevented an estimated 100 million acres (400,000 km2) of virgin land from being converted into farmland—an area about the size of California, or 13.6% of the total area of India. The use of these wheat varieties has also had a substantial effect on production in six Latin American countries, six countries in the Near and Middle East, and several others in Africa.

Borlaug&#x27;s work with wheat contributed to the development of high-yield semi-dwarf &quot;indica&quot; and &quot;japonica&quot; rice cultivars at the International Rice Research Institute and China&#x27;s Hunan Rice Research Institute. Borlaug&#x27;s colleagues at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research also developed and introduced a high-yield variety of rice throughout most of Asia. Land devoted to the semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties in Asia expanded from 200 acres (0.8 km2) in 1965 to over 40 million acres (160,000 km2) in 1970. In 1970, this land accounted for over 10% of the more productive cereal land in Asia.

===Nobel Peace Prize===
For his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00 a.m., but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the Toluca valley, about 40 miles (65 km) west of Mexico City. A chauffeur took her to the fields to inform her husband. According to his daughter, Jeanie Laube, &quot;My mom said, &#x27;You won the Nobel Peace Prize,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;No, I haven&#x27;t&#x27;, ... It took some convincing ... He thought the whole thing was a hoax&quot;. He was awarded the prize on December 10.

In his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: &quot;When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the &#x27;green revolution&#x27;, they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both for bread and for peace&quot;. His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. &quot;The green revolution has won a temporary success in man&#x27;s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise, the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.

&quot;Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the &quot;Population Monster&quot;...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth...&quot;

===Borlaug hypothesis===
Borlaug continually advocated increasing crop yields as a means to curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the &quot;Borlaug hypothesis&quot;, namely that &quot;increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland&quot;. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require at least one of the following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving ecosystems from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine how true this view remains. 

Increased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.

Borlaug expressed the idea now known as the &quot;Borlaug hypothesis&quot; in a speech given in Oslo, Norway, in 2000, upon the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize: &quot;Had the global cereal yields of 1950 still prevailed in 1999, we would have needed nearly 1.8 billion ha of additional land of the same quality – instead of the 600 million that was used – to equal the current global harvest.&quot;

===Criticisms and his view of critics ===

Borlaug&#x27;s name is nearly synonymous with the Green Revolution, against which many criticisms have been mounted over the decades. Throughout his years of research, Borlaug&#x27;s programs often faced opposition by nonscientists who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural, and therefore those that inherently dislike the unnatural criticized such crossbreeding. These farming techniques, in addition to increasing yields, often reaped large profits for U.S. agribusiness and agrochemical corporations and were criticized by one author in 2003 as widening social inequality in the countries owing to uneven food distribution while forcing a capitalist agenda of U.S. corporations onto countries that had undergone land reform.

Other concerns include the crossing of genetic barriers; the inability of a single crop to fulfill all nutritional requirements; the decreased biodiversity from planting few varieties; the environmental and economic effects of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; the side effects of large amounts of herbicides sprayed on fields of herbicide-resistant crops; and the destruction of wilderness caused by the construction of roads in populated third-world areas.

Borlaug refuted or dismissed most claims of his critics but did take certain concerns seriously. He stated that his work has been &quot;a change in the right direction, but it has not transformed the world into a Utopia&quot;. Of environmental lobbyists opposing crop yield improvements, he stated, &quot;some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They&#x27;ve never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they&#x27;d be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things.&quot; Borlaug cautioned, &quot;There are no miracles in agricultural production. Nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of wheat, rice, or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all ills of a stagnant, traditional agriculture.&quot; 

The journalist John Vidal, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, commented that the plaudits and honors heaped on Borlaug present him as a &quot;saint or even the god of American farmers&quot;, but that the technology was far from perfect. The Green Revolution promised to end hunger and poverty, and to benefit rural societies everywhere. Instead, its long-term effects included what the Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva has called &quot;rural impoverishment, increased debt, social inequality and the displacement of vast numbers of peasant farmers&quot;. Vidal further cites the political commentator Alexander Cockburn, who wrote that Borlaug was &quot;aside from Kissinger, probably the biggest killer of all to have got the peace prize&quot;, given that his wheat &quot;led to the death of peasants by the million&quot;.

==Later roles==
Following his retirement, Borlaug continued to participate in teaching, research and activism. He spent much of the year based at CIMMYT in Mexico, conducting research, and four months of the year serving at Texas A&amp;M University, where he had been a distinguished professor of international agriculture since 1984. From 1994 to 2003, Borlaug served on the International Fertilizer Development Center board of directors. In 1999, the university&#x27;s Board of Regents named its US$16 million Center for Southern Crop Improvement in honor of Borlaug. He worked in the building&#x27;s Heep Center, and taught one semester each year.

===Production in Africa===
In the early 1980s, environmental groups that were opposed to Borlaug&#x27;s methods campaigned against his planned expansion of efforts into Africa. They prompted the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the World Bank to stop funding most of his African agriculture projects. Western European governments were persuaded to stop supplying fertilizer to Africa. According to David Seckler, former Director General of the International Water Management Institute, &quot;the environmental community in the 1980s went crazy pressuring the donor countries and the big foundations not to support ideas like inorganic fertilizers for Africa.&quot;

In 1984, during the Ethiopian famine, Ryoichi Sasakawa, the chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (now the Nippon Foundation), contacted the semi-retired Borlaug, wondering why the methods used in Asia were not extended to Africa, and hoping Borlaug could help. He convinced Borlaug to help with this new effort, and Borlaug assisted in creating the Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA) to coordinate the project.

The SAA is a research and extension organization that aims to increase food production in African countries that are struggling with food shortages. &quot;I assumed we&#x27;d do a few years of research first,&quot; Borlaug later recalled, &quot;but after I saw the terrible circumstances there, I said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s just start growing&#x27;.&quot; Soon, Borlaug and the SAA had projects in seven countries. Yields of maize in developed African countries tripled. Yields of wheat, sorghum, cassava, and cowpeas also increased in these countries. At present (more than ten years after Borlaug&#x27;s death in 2009), program activities are under way in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, all of which suffered from repeated famines in previous decades.

From 1986 to 2009, Borlaug was the President of the SAA. That year, a joint venture between The Carter Center and SAA was launched called Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000). The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy. Since then, more than 8 million small-scale farmers in 15 African countries have been trained in SAA farming techniques, which have helped them to double or triple grain production. Those elements that allowed Borlaug&#x27;s projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized market economies, transportation, and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout much of Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields and reducing the ongoing threat of food shortages. Because of these challenges, Borlaug&#x27;s initial projects were restricted to relatively developed regions of the continent.

Despite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement. Visiting Ethiopia in 1994 after a major famine, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister Meles Zenawi&#x27;s support for a campaign seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer diammonium phosphate and Borlaug&#x27;s methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggested that there was still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa, despite lingering questions about population sustainability and the absence of long-term studies in Africa.

===World Food Prize===
The World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, as a way to recognize personal accomplishments, and as a means of education by using the Prize to establish role models for others. The first prize was given to Borlaug&#x27;s former colleague, M. S. Swaminathan, in 1987, for his work in India. The next year, Swaminathan used the US$250,000 prize to start the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation for research on sustainable development.

=== Global stem rust and the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative ===
In 2005, Borlaug, with his former graduate student Ronnie Coffman, convened an international expert panel in Kenya on the emerging threat of Ug99 in east Africa. The working group produced a report, &quot;Sounding the Alarm on Global Stem Rust&quot;, and their work led to the formation of the Global Rust Initiative. In 2008, with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the organization was re-named the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative

===Future of global farming and food supply===
The limited potential for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, &quot;we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.&quot; With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to &quot;transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins (gliadin and glutenin) to other cereals, especially rice and maize&quot;.

Borlaug believed that genetically modified organisms were the only way to increase food production as the world runs out of unused arable land. Genetic modification was not inherently dangerous &quot;because we&#x27;ve been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.&quot;
In a review of Borlaug&#x27;s 2000 publication entitled &quot;Ending world hunger: the promise of biotechnology and the threat of antiscience zealotry&quot;, the authors argued that Borlaug&#x27;s warnings were still true in 2010:

According to Borlaug, &quot;Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the cerrado are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before&quot;.

Besides increasing the worldwide food supply, early in his career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, &quot;Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the &#x27;Population Monster&#x27; ... If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?&quot; However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: &quot;I now say that the world has the technology—either available or well advanced in the research pipeline—to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called &#x27;organic&#x27; methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.&quot; However, Borlaug remained on the advisory board of Population Media Center, an organization working to stabilize world population, until his death.

==Death==
Borlaug died of lymphoma at the age of 95, on September 12, 2009, in his Dallas home.

Borlaug&#x27;s children released a statement saying, &quot;We would like his life to be a model for making a difference in the lives of others and to bring about efforts to end human misery for all mankind.&quot;

The Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and President of India Pratibha Patil paid tribute to Borlaug saying, &quot;Borlaug&#x27;s life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man&#x27;s towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress.&quot;

The United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization described Borlaug as &quot;a towering scientist whose work rivals that of the 20th century&#x27;s other great scientific benefactors of humankind&quot; and Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations said, &quot;As we celebrate Dr. Borlaug&#x27;s long and remarkable life, we also celebrate the long and productive lives that his achievements have made possible for so many millions of people around the world... we will continue to be inspired by his enduring devotion to the poor, needy and vulnerable of our world.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
In 1968, Borlaug received what he considered an especially satisfying tribute when the people of Ciudad Obregón, where some of his earliest experiments were undertaken, named a street after him. Also in that year, he became a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

In 1970, he was given an honorary doctorate by the Agricultural University of Norway.

In 1970, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee &quot;for his contributions to the &#x27;green revolution&#x27; that was having such an impact on food production particularly in Asia and in Latin America.&quot;

In 1970, he was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government.

In 1971, he was named a Distinguished Fellow of the National Academy of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine of Argentina

In 1971, he received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award.

In 1974, he was awarded a Peace Medal (in the form of a dove, carrying a wheat ear in its beak) by Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, India.

In 1975, he was named a Distinguished Fellow of the Iowa Academy of Science.

In 1980, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1980, he was elected honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

In 1984, his name was placed in the National Agricultural Hall of Fame at the national center in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Also that year, he was recognized for sustained service to humanity through outstanding contributions in plant breeding from the Governors Conference on Agriculture Innovations in Little Rock, Arkansas. Also in 1984, he received the Henry G. Bennet Distinguished Service Award at commencement ceremonies at Oklahoma State University.

In 1986, Borlaug was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame during Norsk Høstfest.

Borlaug was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.

Borlaug had a long history of involvement with the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST). Borlaug&#x27;s remarks as the invited speaker at the organization&#x27;s conference in 1973 became its first published paper. Borlaug received the organization&#x27;s Charles A. Black Award in 2005 for his contributions to public policy and the public understanding of science.
In 2010, CAST changed the name of the Charles A. Black Award (1986-2009) to the Borlaug CAST Communication Award.

On August 19, 2013, his statue was unveiled inside the ICAR&#x27;s NASC Complex at New Delhi, India.

On March 25, 2014, a statue of Borlaug at the United States Capitol was unveiled in a ceremony on the 100th anniversary of his birth. This statue replaces the statue of James Harlan as one of the two statues given to the National Statuary Hall Collection by the state of Iowa.

Borlaug received the 1977 U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 2002 Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, the 2002 Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace, and the 2004 National Medal of Science. As of January 2004, Borlaug had received 49 honorary degrees from as many universities, in 18 countries, the most recent from Dartmouth College on June 12, 2005, and was a foreign or honorary member of 22 international Academies of Sciences. In Iowa and Minnesota, &quot;World Food Day&quot;, October 16, is referred to as &quot;Norman Borlaug World Food Prize Day&quot;. Throughout the United States, it is referred to as &quot;World Food Prize Day&quot;.

In 2006, the Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award: the Padma Vibhushan. He was awarded the Danforth Award for Plant Science by the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St Louis, Missouri in recognition of his lifelong commitment to increasing global agricultural production through plant science.

The stained-glass &quot;World Peace Window&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Cathedral in Minneapolis, Minnesota, depicts &quot;peace makers&quot; of the 20th century, including Norman Borlaug.

In August 2006, Dr. Leon Hesser published &quot;The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug and His Battle to End World Hunger&quot;, an account of Borlaug&#x27;s life and work. On August 4, the book received the 2006 Print of Peace award, as part of International Read For Peace Week. Borlaug is also the subject of the documentary film &quot;The Man Who Tried to Feed the World&quot; which first aired on &quot;American Experience&quot; on April 21, 2020.

On September 27, 2006, the United States Senate by unanimous consent passed the Congressional Tribute to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug Act of 2006. The act authorizes that Borlaug be awarded America&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal. On December 6, 2006, the House of Representatives passed the measure by voice vote. President George Bush signed the bill into law on December 14, 2006, and it became Public Law Number 109–395. According to the act, &quot;the number of lives Dr. Borlaug has saved [is] more than a billion people&quot; The act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to strike and sell duplicates of the medal in bronze. He was presented with the medal on July 17, 2007.

Borlaug was a foreign fellow of the Bangladesh Academy of Sciences.

The Borlaug Dialogue (Norman E. Borlaug International Symposium) is named in his honour.

<text>Michael Craig Judge (born October 17, 1962) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, and director. He is best known for being the creator of the animated television series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; (1993–1997, 2011, 2022–present). He also co-created the television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (1997–2010), &quot;The Goode Family&quot; (2009), &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; (2014–2019), and &quot;Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus&quot; (2017–2018). He wrote and directed the films &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; (1996), &quot;Office Space&quot; (1999), &quot;Idiocracy&quot; (2006), and &quot;Extract&quot; (2009), and co-wrote the screenplay to &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot; (2022).

Judge was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He graduated from the University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics. After losing interest in a career in science, Judge focused on animation and short films. His animated short &quot;Frog Baseball&quot; was developed into the successful MTV series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, and the spin-off series &quot;Daria&quot; (with which Judge had no involvement).

In 1995, Judge and former &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Greg Daniels developed &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, which debuted on Fox in 1997 and quickly became popular with both critics and audiences. Running for 13 seasons, it became one of the longest-running American animated series. During the run of the show, Judge took time off to write and direct &quot;Office Space&quot;, &quot;Idiocracy&quot; and &quot;Extract&quot;. As &quot;King of the Hill&quot; was coming to an end, Judge created his third show, ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Goode Family&quot;, which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After a four-year hiatus, he created his fourth show, the live-action &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; for HBO, which has received critical acclaim. In 2017, Judge&#x27;s fourth animated series, the music-themed &quot;Tales from the Tour Bus&quot;, premiered on Cinemax, to acclaim.

Judge has won a Primetime Emmy Award and two Annie Awards for &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards and Satellite Awards for &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

==Early life==
Michael Craig Judge was born on October 17, 1962, in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He is the middle of three children born to Margaret Yvonne (née Blue), a librarian, and William James Judge, an archaeologist. At the time of his birth, his father was working for a nonprofit organization in Guayaquil and other parts of Ecuador, promoting agricultural development. Judge was raised from age three in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he spent a small portion of his life working on a chicken farm. He attended St. Pius X High School and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics from the University of California, San Diego, (UCSD) in 1985.

==Career==

===1985–1997: Early science career; musician; animation and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;===
After graduating from UCSD in 1985, he held several brief jobs in physics and mechanical engineering, but found himself growing bored with science. In 1987, he moved to Silicon Valley to join Parallax Graphics, a startup video card company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara, California. Disliking the company&#x27;s culture and his colleagues, Judge quit after less than three months, describing it as, &quot;The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don&#x27;t know what it was&quot;. Shortly after quitting his job, he became a bass player with a touring blues band.
He was a part of Anson Funderburgh&#x27;s band for two years, playing on their 1990 Black Top Records release &quot;Rack &#x27;Em Up&quot;, while taking graduate math classes at the University of Texas at Dallas. He was planning to earn a master&#x27;s degree as &quot;a back-up plan&quot; to become a community college math teacher after relocating to the north Dallas area for his then-wife&#x27;s new job. In 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, Judge purchased a Bolex 16 mm film camera and began creating his own animated shorts in his home in Richardson, Texas. In 1991, his short film &quot;Office Space&quot; (also known as the &quot;Milton&quot; series of shorts) was acquired by Comedy Central, following an animation festival in Dallas. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of school to focus on his career. In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass with Doyle Bramhall.

In 1992, he developed &quot;Frog Baseball&quot;, a short film featuring the characters Beavis and Butt-Head, which was to be featured on &quot;Liquid Television&quot;, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on MTV. The short led to the creation of the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head, who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.

Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – &quot;Blood Drive&quot;/&quot;Give Blood&quot; and &quot;Door to Door&quot; – which he described as &quot;awful, I don&#x27;t know why anybody liked it ... I was burying my head in the sand.&quot; The series spawned the musical single &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; (1993) (a humorous cover with participation by Cher), a feature-length film &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; (1996) and the spin-off show &quot;Daria&quot;.

After a hiatus of two decades, the series aired a new season on October 27, 2011. The premiere episode was a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. On January 10, 2014, Judge said that there is still a possibility that &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; could be pitched to another network, adding that he wouldn&#x27;t mind making more episodes.

===1997–2009: &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Office Space&quot;, and &quot;Idiocracy&quot;===
In early 1995, after the successful first run of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Judge decided to create another animated series, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote a pilot script. Fox was uncertain of the viability of Judge&#x27;s concept for an animated comedy based in reality and set in the American South, so the network teamed him up with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer Greg Daniels. Judge was a former resident of Garland, Texas, upon which the fictional community of Arlen was loosely based, but as Judge stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Judge voiced characters Hank Hill and Jeff Boomhauer. The show is about a middle-class Methodist family named the Hills living in a small town called Arlen, Texas. It attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. After its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

For the 1997–1998 season, the series became one of Fox&#x27;s highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformed &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in ratings. Although ratings remained consistent throughout the 10th, 11th and 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overall Nielsen ratings (up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), Fox abruptly announced in 2008 that &quot;King of the Hill&quot; had been cancelled. The cancellation coincided with the announcement that Seth MacFarlane, creator of &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;American Dad!&quot;, would be creating a &quot;Family Guy&quot; spin-off called &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, which would take over &quot;King of the Hill&#x27;s&quot; time slot. Hopes to keep the show afloat surfaced as sources indicated that ABC (which was already airing Judge&#x27;s new animated comedy, &quot;The Goode Family&quot;) was interested in securing the rights to the show, but in January 2009, ABC president Steve McPherson said he had &quot;no plans to pick up the animated comedy.&quot; On April 30, 2009, it was announced that Fox ordered at least two more episodes to give the show a proper finale. The show&#x27;s 14th season was supposed to air sometime in the 2009–10 season, but Fox later announced that it would not air the episodes, opting instead for syndication. On August 10, 2009, however, Fox released a statement that the network would air a one-hour series finale (which consisted of a regular 30-minute episode followed by a 30-minute finale) on September 13, 2009. The four remaining episodes of the series aired in syndication the week of May 3, 2010, and again on Adult Swim during the week of May 17, 2010. During the panel discussion for the return of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; at San Diego Comic-Con in 2011, Mike Judge said that no current plans exist to revive &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, although he would not rule out the possibility of it returning.

Judge began to develop one of his four animated short films titled &quot;Milton&quot;, about an office drone named Milton that Judge created, which first aired on &quot;Liquid Television&quot; and &quot;Night After Night with Allan Havey&quot; and later aired on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s, &quot;just in the heart of Silicon Valley and in the middle of that overachiever yuppie thing, it was just awful&quot;. Judge sold the completed film &quot;Office Space&quot; to 20th Century Fox based on his script and a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Ron Livingston, and David Herman. Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an ensemble cast–based film. The studio suggested that he should make a film like &quot;Car Wash&quot; but &quot;just set in an office&quot;. Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film&#x27;s director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, &quot;I had a great crew, and it&#x27;s good going into it not pretending you&#x27;re an expert.&quot; Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, &quot;More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You&#x27;re failing! You&#x27;re failing!&quot; In addition, Fox did not like the gangsta rap music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary. In the film, he made a cameo appearance as Stan (complete with hairpiece and fake mustache), the manager of Chotchkie&#x27;s, a fictionalized parody of chain restaurants like Chili&#x27;s, Applebee&#x27;s and TGI Friday&#x27;s, and the boss of Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s character, whom he continually undermines and interrogates over her lack of sufficient enthusiasm for the job and the insufficient quantity of &quot;flair&quot; (buttons, ribbons, etc.) she wears on her uniform. The film was released on February 19, 1999, and it was well received by critics. Although not particularly successful at the box office, it sold well on VHS and DVD, and it has come to be recognized as a cult classic.

Beginning in fall 2003, Judge and fellow animator Don Hertzfeldt created an animation festival called &quot;The Animation Show&quot;. &quot;The Animation Show&quot; toured the country annually for several years, screening animated shorts. In 2005, Judge was presented with the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Outstanding Television Writer Award by Johnny Hardwick.

Judge has made supporting and cameo appearances in numerous films. Judge had a voice cameo as Kenny in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut&quot; (1999), the feature-length film adaptation of the popular Comedy Central series; he voiced Kenny McCormick when he was unhooded towards the end of the film. He later acted in the science-fiction family comedy franchise &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, where he played Donnagon Giggles in the first three films. His next film appearance was &quot;Serving Sara&quot; (2002) where he played a motel manager. He later appeared in the comedy &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; (2006), in which he can be seen during the closing credits. An extended version of his sequence can be seen in &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot; (2007) which was a direct-to-video release. Judge also created a video clip of Beavis and Butt-Head ripping into Steve-O for his video &quot;Poke the Puss&quot;, where the two try imagining if they would like the video better if they were black. The clip aired as a part of &quot;Jackassworld.com: 24-Hour Takeover&quot;, a February 23, 2008, television special on MTV to coincide with the official launch of jackassworld.com. The characters appeared again in the third Jackass film, titled &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, at the beginning of the film, telling viewers to put on their 3D glasses for the film.

Judge&#x27;s third film, &quot;Idiocracy&quot;, a dystopian comedy starring Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph, was given a limited release theatrically by 20th Century Fox in September 2006, two years after production. The film&#x27;s original release date was intended to be on August 5, 2005, according to Mike Judge. In April 2006, a release date was set for September 1, 2006. The film was released without a trailer or substantial marketing campaign. The film was not screened for critics beforehand as is usually done. Lack of concrete information from Fox led to speculation that the distributor may have actively attempted to keep the film from being seen by a large audience, while fulfilling a contractual obligation for theatrical release ahead of a DVD release, according to Ryan Pearson of the AP. That speculation was followed by open criticism of the studio&#x27;s lack of support from Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;″s Joel Stein wrote &quot;the film&#x27;s ads and trailers tested atrociously&quot;, but &quot;still, abandoning &quot;Idiocracy&quot; seems particularly unjust, since Judge has made a lot of money for Fox.&quot; Despite the film not being screened for critics, the film received positive reviews and was a minor box-office success. In the U.S., the film was released to DVD in January 2007 and later aired on premium-television, multiplex channels Cinemax in September 2007 and HBO in January 2008. Since then, it has gained a cult following.

===2009–2013: &quot;The Goode Family&quot;, &quot;Extract&quot;, and other projects===

Judge&#x27;s fourth directorial effort was 2009&#x27;s &quot;Extract&quot;. Shortly after completing &quot;Office Space&quot;, Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. Over the next several years, he focused his energy on developing &quot;Idiocracy&quot;. But years later, by the time of the film&#x27;s release, audiences had decided that &quot;Office Space&quot; had struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus the &quot;Extract&quot; script was given new life.

Seeking to keep &quot;Extract&quot; below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. &quot;I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself ... I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world,&quot; Judge stated.

Keeping true to this baseline of reality, &quot;Extract&quot; was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of Commerce. He makes an uncredited appearance as Jim, a union organizer. The film premiered on September 4, 2009, and received mixed to positive reviews from critics and was a minor commercial success.

Judge&#x27;s third television series, &quot;The Goode Family&quot;, debuted on ABC but was cancelled after one season. Comedy Central first aired the series in reruns on January 4, 2010. However, the series was pulled off the schedule shortly thereafter. It was confirmed on &quot;The Goode Family&quot; Facebook page that Comedy Central had picked up the reruns of the series, which were to be evaluated for a chance of being renewed for a second season. On August 8, 2009, however, ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson stated that the show, along with &quot;Surviving Suburbia&quot;, had officially been canceled due to low ratings.

In 2010, reruns of &quot;The Goode Family&quot; aired Monday nights at 10 pm on Comedy Central, beginning January 4. It departed the network&#x27;s primetime schedule after four weeks, returning occasionally in low-trafficked timeslots.

In 2012, Judge directed the music video (animation by Titmouse) for country music group Zac Brown Band&#x27;s &quot;The Wind&quot;. In 2013, Judge collaborated with Seth MacFarlane on a mashup episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, in which, complete with a &quot;Hill&quot;-themed opening, Judge reprises his role as Hank Hill. Earlier in 2010 and 2012, Judge played cameos as Hank on two episodes of MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;.

===2014–2019: &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Tour Bus&quot;===
Judge created his fourth show, &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;, with &quot;King of the Hill&quot; executive producers John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. The HBO comedy is a single-camera live-action sitcom set in Northern California. One of its main themes is the idea that &quot;the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success&quot;. The first season of &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; was 8 episodes long and received critical and public acclaim. &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; was renewed for a second season on April 21, 2014, and a third season on April 13, 2015. &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; aired its fourth season, which premiered on April 23, 2017. The series was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on March 25, 2018, and a sixth season, which premiered on October 27, 2019, and served as its final season.

On January 12, 2017, &quot;Deadline&quot; confirmed that Cinemax ordered 8 episodes of Judge&#x27;s new animated series, &quot;Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus&quot;. The series premiered on September 22, 2017. Judge wrote the story for &quot;Action Point&quot;, the film was released in 2018. In 2018, he starred in the film, &quot;The Front Runner&quot;. In 2019, Judge announced he had been developing two projects for HBO: &quot;QualityLand&quot; and &quot;A5&quot;, both of which were later scrapped by HBO in 2021.

===2020–present: Bandera Entertainment, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head &quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot; revivals===
In June 2020, Comedy Central announced it had ordered a second revival of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; consisting of two new seasons along with spin-offs and specials. In the new series, Beavis and Butt-Head will enter a &quot;whole new Gen Z world&quot; with meta-themes that are said to be relatable to both new fans, who may be unfamiliar with the original series, and old.

In February 2022, it was announced that the revival would instead premiere on Paramount+, following a second &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; feature film entitled &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;. Originally, Paramount executives wanted a live-action &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; movie. Judge held auditions over Zoom for the project. He eventually talked the company into doing an animated movie instead to reestablish the characters first, with a future live-action movie still a possibility. In June 2022, it was confirmed that new episodes would debut later that year, along with the full library of over 227 original episodes, newly remastered, with music videos intact. One month later, it was announced that the revival would premiere on August 4, 2022. Season 9 continues the concept of the Beavis and Butt-Head multiverse initially explored in &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;. Teenage Beavis and Butt-Head, Old Beavis and Butt-Head, and Smart Beavis and Butt-Head all get their own dedicated episodes in the revival.

In January 2022, it was announced that Judge and Daniels had formed an animation company called Bandera Entertainment, with a revival of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; being one of several series in development. During a panel at San Diego Comic-Con in 2022, Judge stated that the show &quot;has a very good chance of coming back.&quot; In September 2022, Fox Entertainment president Michael Thorn confirmed that the series would not air on Fox, with the reason being that Fox prefers to have full ownership of whatever new shows they air. On January 31, 2023, a revival on Hulu was officially confirmed to be ordered.

Bandera&#x27;s first produced series is Anna Drezen&#x27;s &quot;Praise Petey&quot; starring Annie Murphy, John Cho, and Stephen Root among others. The series premiered on July 21, 2023 on Freeform and Hulu, and has received mostly positive reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes ratings of 80% Fresh from critics, and 90% Fresh from audiences. The series was cancelled after one season. In 2024, Judge, along with Zach Woods and Brandon Gardner, co-created the series &quot;In the Know&quot;. The series premiered on January 25, 2024 on Peacock.

His new show, Common Side Effects airs on Comedy Central (2025).

==Personal life==

Judge married Francesca Morocco in 1989; they divorced in 2009. Together they have two daughters. 
He has a son with Katrina Holden Bronson. The family lives in Austin, Texas, and Santa Monica, California, having previously resided in Malibu.

===Political views===
While &quot;King of the Hill&quot; is often a satire of protagonist Hank Hill, identifiable as a conservative, and his &quot;The Goode Family&quot; is essentially a satire centered around a liberal family, Judge avoids discussing his own political leanings.

In reviewing &quot;Idiocracy&quot;, Salon stated, &quot;Judge&#x27;s is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on &quot;South Park&quot; libertarianism&quot;. A writer for the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot; seems to agree, comparing &quot;King of the Hill&quot; to the anti-authoritarian point of view of &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, though he calls the show more populist, noting the disdain &quot;King of the Hill&quot; seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and big-box chains.

Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in 2006 in an &quot;IGN&quot; interview about &quot;King of the Hill&quot;:

In June 2016, before the presidential election in November, Etan Cohen told &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; that he and Judge would produce &quot;Idiocracy&quot;-themed campaign advertisements mocking Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign if given permission from 20th Century Fox to do so. It was later reported by &quot;Business Insider&quot; that they would not have been campaign ads, would have mocked all of the candidates, and would not go forward.

<text>The Jungfrau (, , , &quot;maiden, virgin&quot;), at is one of the main summits of the Bernese Alps, located between the northern canton of Bern and the southern canton of Valais, halfway between Interlaken and Fiesch. Together with the Eiger and Mönch, the Jungfrau forms a massive wall of mountains overlooking the Bernese Oberland and the Swiss Plateau, one of the most distinctive sights of the Swiss Alps.

The summit was first reached on August 3, 1811, by the Meyer brothers of Aarau and two chamois hunters from Valais. The ascent followed a long expedition over the glaciers and high passes of the Bernese Alps. It was not until 1865 that a more direct route on the northern side was opened.

The construction of the Jungfrau Railway in the early 20th century, which connects Kleine Scheidegg to the Jungfraujoch, the saddle between the Mönch and the Jungfrau, made the area one of the most-visited places in the Alps. Along with the Aletsch Glacier to the south, the Jungfrau is part of the Jungfrau-Aletsch area, which was declared a World Heritage Site in 2001.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Jungfrau&quot; (&quot;maiden, virgin&quot;), which refers to the highest of the three prominent mountains overlooking the Interlaken region, along with the Mönch (&quot;monk&quot;) and the Eiger (&quot;ogre&quot;), is most likely derived from the name &quot;Jungfrauenberg&quot; given to Wengernalp, the alpine meadow directly facing the huge northern side of the Jungfrau, across the Trummelbach gorge. Wengernalp was so named for the nuns of Interlaken Monastery, its historical owner. Contrary to popular belief, the name did not originate from the appearance of the snow-covered mountain, the latter looking like a veiled woman.

The &quot;virgin&quot; peak was heavily romanticized as &quot;goddess&quot; or &quot;priestess&quot; in late 18th to 19th century Romanticism. Its summit, considered inaccessible, remained untouched until the 19th century. After the first ascent in 1811 by Swiss alpinist Johann Rudolf Meyer, the peak was jokingly referred to as &quot;Mme Meyer&quot; (Mrs. Meyer).

== Geographic setting ==
Politically, the Jungfrau (and its massif) is split between the municipalities of Lauterbrunnen (Bern) and Fieschertal (Valais). It is the third-highest mountain of the Bernese Alps after the nearby Finsteraarhorn and Aletschhorn, respectively away. But from Lake Thun, and the greater part of the canton of Bern, it is the most conspicuous and the nearest of the Bernese Oberland peaks; with a height difference of between the summit and the town of Interlaken. This, and the extreme steepness of the north face, secured for it an early reputation for inaccessibility.
The Jungfrau is the westernmost and highest point of a gigantic wall dominating the valleys of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. The wall is formed by the alignment of some of the biggest north faces in the Alps, with the Mönch () and Eiger () to the east of the Jungfrau, and overlooks the valleys to its north by a height of up to . The Jungfrau is approximately from the Eiger; with the summit of the Mönch between the two mountains, from the Jungfrau. The Jungfraujoch is the saddle between the Jungfrau and the Mönch and the Eigerjoch is the saddle between the Mönch and the Eiger. The wall is extended to the east by the Fiescherwand and to the west by the Lauterbrunnen Wall, although it follows different directions from the Jungfrau and the Eiger.

The difference of altitude between the deep valley of Lauterbrunnen () and the summit is particularly visible from the area of Mürren. From the valley floor, west of the massif, the altitude gain is more than for a horizontal distance of .

The landscapes around the Jungfrau are extremely contrasted. In contrast to the vertiginous precipices of its northwest, the mountain&#x27;s southeastern side emerges from the upper snows of the Jungfraufirn, one of the main feeders of the Aletsch Glacier, at around . The valley of Aletsch on the southeast is completely uninhabited, and is surrounded by neighboring valleys with similar landscapes. The area as a whole constitutes the largest glaciated area not just in the Alps, but in Europe as well.

== Climbing history ==

In 1811, the brothers Johann Rudolf (1768–1825) and Hieronymus Meyer, sons of Johann Rudolf Meyer (1739–1813), the head of a rich merchant family of Aarau, along with several servants and a porter picked up at Guttannen, first reached the Valais by way of the Grimsel, and crossed the Beich Pass, a glacier pass over the Oberaletsch Glacier, to the head of the Lötschen valley. There, they added two local chamois hunters, Alois Volken and Joseph Bortis, to their party and traversed the Lötschenlücke before reaching the Aletschfirn (the west branch of the Aletsch Glacier), where they established the base camp, north of the Aletschhorn. After the Guttannen porter was sent back alone over the Lötschenlücke, the party finally reached the summit of the Jungfrau by the Rottalsattel on August 3. They then recrossed the two passes named to their point of departure in Valais, and went home again over the Grimsel.

The journey was a most extraordinary one for the time, and some persons threw doubts at its complete success. To settle these, another expedition was undertaken in 1812. In this the two sons, Rudolf (1791–1833) and Gottlieb (1793–1829), of Johann Rudolf Meyer, played the chief parts. After an unsuccessful attempt, defeated by bad weather, in the course of which the Oberaarjoch was crossed twice (this route being much more direct than the long detour through the Lötschental), Rudolf, with the two Valais hunters (Alois Volker and Joseph Bortis), a Guttannen porter named Arnold Abbühl, and a Hasle man, bivouacked on a depression on the southeast ridge of the Finsteraarhorn. Next day (August 16) the whole party attempted the ascent of the Finsteraarhorn from the Studer névé on the east by way of the southeast ridge, but Meyer, exhausted, remained behind. The following day the party crossed the Grünhornlücke to the Aletsch Glacier, but bad weather then put an end to further projects. At a bivouac, probably just opposite the present Konkordia Hut, the rest of the party, having come over the Oberaarjoch and the Grünhornlücke, joined the Finsteraarhorn party. Gottlieb, Rudolf&#x27;s younger brother, had more patience than the rest and remained longer at the huts near the Märjelensee, where the adventurers had taken refuge. He could make the second ascent (September 3) of the Jungfrau, the Rottalsattel being reached from the east side as is now usual, and his companions being the two Valais hunters.

The third ascent dates from 1828, when several men from Grindelwald, headed by Peter Baumann, planted their flag upon the summit. Next came the ascent by Louis Agassiz, James David Forbes, Heath, Desor, and Duchatelier in 1841, recounted by Desor in his &quot;Excursions et Séjours dans les Glaciers&quot;. Gottlieb Samuel Studer published an account of the next ascent made by himself and Bürki in 1842.

In 1863, a party consisting of three young Oxford University graduates and three Swiss guides successfully reached the summit and returned to the base camp of the Faulberg (located near the present position of the Konkordia Hut) in less than 11 hours (see the section below, The 1863 Ascent). In the same year Emma Winkworth, the daughter of Thomas Thomasson, became the first woman to climb the Jungfrau. She also slept overnight in the Faulberg cave prior to the ascent as there was no hut at that time. 

Before the construction of the Jungfraujoch railway tunnel, the approach from the glaciers on the south side was very long. The first direct route from the valley of Lauterbrunnen was opened in 1865 by Sir George Young, H. Brooke George with the guide Christian Almer. They had to carry ladders with them in order to cross the many crevasses on the north flank. Having spent the night on the rocks of the Schneehorn () they gained next morning the Silberlücke, the depression between the Jungfrau and Silberhorn, and thence in little more than three hours reached the summit. Descending to the Aletsch Glacier they crossed the Mönchsjoch, and passed a second night on the rocks, reaching Grindelwald next day. This route became a usual until the opening of the Jungfraujoch.

The first winter ascent was made on 23 January 1874, by Meta Brevoort and W. A. B. Coolidge with guides Christian and Ulrich Almer. They used a sled to reach the upper Aletsch Glacier, and were accompanied by Miss Brevoort&#x27;s favorite dog, Tschingel.

The Jungfrau was climbed via the west side for the first time in 1885 by Fritz and Heinrich von Allmen, Ulrich Brunner, Fritz Graf, Karl Schlunegger and Johann Stäger—all from Wengen. They ascended the Rottal ridge (&quot;Innere Rottalgrat&quot;) and reached the summit on 21 September. The more difficult and dangerous northeast ridge that connects the summit from the Jungfraujoch was first climbed on 30 July 1911 by Albert Weber and Hans Schlunegger.

In July 2007, six Swiss Army recruits, part of the Mountain Specialists Division 1, died in an accident on the normal route. Although the causes of the deaths was not immediately clear, a report by the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research concluded that the avalanche risk was unusually high due to recent snowfall, and that there was &quot;no other reasonable explanation&quot; other than an avalanche for the incident.

===The 1863 ascent===
The &quot;Führerbuch&quot; of the Alpine guide Peter Baumann records an ascent of the Jungfrau made by himself with three men from England in July 1863. The foreign climbers were long thought to have been John Tyndall, J. J. Hornby and T. H. Philpott, until in 1958 the records were checked by the Alpine Club and the following conclusion was reached:

On July 23, 1863, Phillpotts, with James Robertson and H.J. Chaytor, climbed the Jungfrau (the entry shown in A.J. 32. 227 was wrongly transcribed by Montagnier, who says ‘T.H. Philpott’ for J. S. Phillpotts). The entry in Peter Baumann’s Führerbuch (facsimile in A.C. archives) says that the trio crossed the Strahlegg Pass and the Oberaarjoch, and then climbed the Jungfrau from the Eggishorn.

Tyndall, Hornby and Philpott were well-known Alpinists, but there is no record of their having attempted the Jungfrau in 1863. Robertson, Chaytor and Phillpotts were novices; they had recently graduated from Oxford University where they had all been keen members of the Oxford University Boat Club.

William Robertson (1839–1892), the leader of the expedition (wrongly called &#x27;James&#x27; in the Note quoted above), was an Australian by birth, and the first non-British national to take part in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. He later became a barrister and member of parliament in Australia. He and H. J. Chaytor (possibly the father of the medievalist Henry John Chaytor) were both members of the victorious Oxford team in the 1861 Boat Race. James Surtees Phillpotts (1839–1930) was the third member of the team; he would later become headmaster of Bedford School. The trio had three Swiss guides, Peter Baumann, Peter Kaufmann (&quot;Grabipeter&quot;, father of Peter Kaufmann the younger) and Rubi.

A description of the ascent of the Jungfrau is contained in a letter dated Sunday 26 July which Phillpotts wrote to his friend Alexander Potts (later to become the first headmaster of Fettes College). The letter is now in the possession of the Alpine Club. The following extracts are from that letter.

The Virgin certainly did not smile on the poor &quot;fools who rushed in&quot; on her sacred heights, i.e. in plain British, we had the treadmill slog, the biting wind, the half frost-bitten feet and the flayed faces that generally attend an Alpine ascent.

We got to the Faulberg hole about dark, and enjoyed the coffee the longman (Kauffmann) made, as one would in a hole in a rock in a cold evening. The &quot;Faulberg Nachtlager&quot; consists of two holes and a vestibule to the upper hole. The Upper Hole in which we lodged just contained Chay[tor], the Guv [Robertson] and myself, stretched at full length on a little hay over a hard rock mattress, convex instead of concave at the point where one likes to rest one&#x27;s weight. Chaytor was in the middle, and as we were very close was warm and slept. The Guv and I courted Nature&#x27;s soft nurse in vain. At two we got up and methodically put our feet into the stocks, i.e. our boots, breakfasted and shivered, then started (unwashed of course, as the cold gave us malignant hydrophobia) a little after 3:30.

The hole was about up one of the loose stone cliffs one now knows so well. So we groped our way down it and over the moraine – the stars still lingering, as day was just dawning. We could not start at 1:30, the proper time, as there was no moon and we wanted light as we had to tramp the glacier at once. Rubi led, and off we went, roped and in Indian file, in the old treadmill way over the slippery plowed-field-like snow that lay on the upper glacier, for a pull without a check of one or two hours.

At last we came to the region of &quot;bergschrunds&quot; and crevasses. They seemed to form at first an impassable labyrinth, but gradually the guides wound in and out between the large rifts, which were exquisitely lovely with their overhanging banks of snow and glittering icicles, and then trod as on pins and needles over a snowbridge here and there, or had to take a jump over the more feasible ones – and we found ourselves at the foot of the mountain; trudged up on the snow which ought to have been crisp but was even then more or less fresh fallen and sloppy; had to creep over about three crevasses, and after a tiresome pull, dragging one leg after another out of ankle or knee deep snow, we got on a crest of snow at right angles to the slope we had just come up. That slope with its crevasses on one side, and on the other a shorter and much steeper one which led in a few steps to a precipice.

All along this crest went a snakelike long crevasse, for which we had continually to sound, and go first one side and then the other; then we got to the foot of the saddle. Some twenty or thirty steps, some cut, some uncut, soon took us up a kind of hollow, and we got on a little sloping plateau of some large, where we left the grub and the knapsack, keeping my small flask of cognac only. Then up a steep ice slope, very steep I should say, down which the bits of ice cut out of the steps hopped and jumped at full gallop and then bounded over to some bottomless place which we could not see down. Their pace gave one an unpleasant idea of the possible consequence of a slip.

Here we encountered a biting bitter wind. Peter Baumann cut magnificent steps, at least he and Rubi did between them, the one improving on the other&#x27;s first rough blows. After Rubi came Chaytor with Kauffmann behind him, then the Guv, and then myself, the tail of the string. Each step was a long lift from the last one, and as the snow was shallow they had to be cut in the ice which was like rock on this last slope.

Suddenly there burst upon us, on lifting our heads over the ridge, the green and cheerful valleys of Lauterbrunnen and Interlaken, of Grindelwald and a distant view of others equally beautiful stretching on for ever in one vast panorama. On the other side in grim contrast there was a wild and even awful scene. One gazed about one and tried in vain to see to the bottom of dark yawning abysses and sheer cliffs of ice or rock.

== Tourism ==
Named after the Jungfrau, the Jungfrau Region of the Bernese Oberland is a major tourist destination in the Alps and includes a large number of railways and other facilities. While the mountain peak was once difficult to access, the Jungfrau Railway, a rack railway, now goes to the Jungfraujoch railway station at , therefore providing an easy access to the upper Aletsch Glacier and a relatively short access to the Jungfrau itself, the height difference between the station and the summit being only 704 metres and the horizontal distance being slightly less than 2 kilometres. As a result, in the popular mind, the Jungfrau has become a mountain associated with the Bernese Oberland and Interlaken, rather than with Upper Valais and Fiesch.

In 1893, Adolf Guyer-Zeller conceived of the idea of a railway tunnel to the Jungfraujoch to make the glaciated areas on its south side more accessible. The building of the tunnel took 16 years and the summit station was not opened before 1912. The goal was in fact to reach the summit of the Jungfrau with an elevator from the highest railway station, located inside the mountain. The complete project was not realized because of the outbreak of the World War I. Nevertheless, it was at the time one of the highest railways in the world and remains today the highest in Europe and the only (non-cable) railway on Earth going well past the perennial snow-line.
The Jungfrau Railway leaves from Kleine Scheidegg, which can be reached from both sides by trains from Grindelwald, and Lauterbrunnen via Wengen. The train enters the Jungfrau Tunnel running eastward through the Eiger just above Eigergletscher, which is, since 2020, also accessible by aerial tramway from Grindelwald. Before arriving at the Jungfraujoch, it stops for a few minutes at two other stations, &quot;Eigerwand&quot; (on the north face of the Eiger) and &quot;Eismeer&quot; (on the south side), where passengers can see through the holes excavated from the mountain. The journey from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungfraujoch takes approximately 50 minutes including the stops; the downhill return journey taking only 35 minutes.

A large complex of tunnels and buildings has been constructed at the Jungfraujoch, referred to as the &quot;Top of Europe&quot;. There are several restaurants and bars, shops, multimedia exhibitions, a post office, and a research station with dedicated accommodation facilities. An elevator enables access to the top of the Sphinx and its observatory, at , the highest viewing platform of the area. Outside, at the level of the Jungfraujoch, there is a ski school, and the &quot;Ice Palace&quot;, a collection of elaborate ice sculptures displayed inside the Aletsch Glacier. Another tunnel leads to the east side of the Sphinx, where one can walk on the glacier up to the Mönchsjoch Hut, the only hotel infrastructure in the area.

Apart from the Jungfraujoch, many facilities have been built in the Jungfrau Region, including numerous mountain railways. In 1908, the first public cable car in the world, the Wetterhorn Elevator, opened at the foot of the Wetterhorn, but was closed seven years later. The Schilthorn above Mürren, the Männlichen above Wengen, and the Schynige Platte above Wilderswil, offer good views of the Jungfrau and the Lauterbrunnen valley. On the south side, the Eggishorn above Fiesch also offers views of the Jungfrau, across the Aletsch Glacier.

== Climbing routes ==
The normal route follows the traces of the first climbers, but the long approach on the Aletsch Glacier is no longer necessary. From the area of the Jungfraujoch the route to the summit takes only a few hours. Most climbers start from the Mönchsjoch Hut. After a traverse of the Jungfraufirn the route heads to the Rottalsattel (), from where the southern ridge leads to the Jungfrau. It is not considered a very difficult climb but it can be dangerous on the upper section above the Rottalsattel, where most accidents happen. The use of the Jungfrau Railway instead of the much more gradual approach from Fiesch (or Fieschertal), via the Konkordia Hut, can cause some acclimatization troubles as the difference of altitude between the railway stations of Interlaken and Jungfraujoch is almost .

<text>Margaret Josephine &quot;Peggy&quot; Hill ( Platter) is a fictional character in the Fox animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, voiced by Kathy Najimy. She is the matriarch of the Hill family and the wife of the series protagonist Hank Hill, mother to Robert Jeffrey &quot;Bobby&quot; Hill, and aunt to Luanne Platter.

== Character biography ==
The character of Peggy was born in Billings, Montana to cattle ranchers. She moved to Texas during high school, where she meets her future husband Hank Hill. She is 5&#x27;7&quot;. She wears glasses and is generally seen wearing sleeveless blouses and culottes. She wears a size 16½ shoe on her left foot, and a size 16 on her right. Her disproportionately enormous feet are the one trait she is deeply insecure about, despite it being stated by a doctor that such feet give her exceptional confidence, perfect posture, and incredible athletic ability. She is a gifted pitcher in softball, and talented in other sports as well, including roller derby. She is also skilled at playing the dice-based word game &quot;Boggle&quot; and once won the Texas State Boggle Championship.

Within the household, Peggy provides a voice of reason and a buffer between Hank and Bobby, who have difficulty relating to each other. Peggy has taken Hank to task about their relationship, or the lack thereof. Peggy&#x27;s devotion to family extends to her niece Luanne, whom she thinks of as a daughter. Peggy freely encourages Bobby and Luanne to express themselves, sometimes to Hank&#x27;s distress. Peggy&#x27;s high opinion of herself is often quite an annoyance to her family and friends. She usually considers herself smarter than everyone she meets and knows; more attractive than Luanne, Nancy, and many other more conventionally attractive women; and constantly takes credit for things she has never done. She also assumes that everyone else thinks as highly of her as she herself does.

She believes that she can do anything if she commits herself. This often gets her into trouble. Peggy often plunges into things, disregarding her own complete lack of skill; for example, during the episode &quot;Phish and Wildlife,&quot; she walks onto a crime scene expecting to become part of the investigation just because she is &quot;on a roll.&quot; Her inability to understand the potential consequences of her actions has led to the harm of those around her.

Peggy prides herself as a cook, although others consider her cooking to be average. Her family dinners are a regular rotation of a few menu items: Frito pie with Wolf Brand Chili on Mondays; fried pork chops on Tuesdays; and on Wednesdays &quot;Spa-Peggy&quot; and meatballs, the one dish which, according to Hank, &quot;she&#x27;s kind of made her own,&quot; though it is simply spaghetti with meatballs with &quot;just the right amount of sugar and grated parmigiana cheese.&quot; She is also proud of her Apple Brown Betty to which she adds a spoonful of orange juice.

As the series progresses, it puts increasing emphasis on Peggy&#x27;s superiority complex. As her egotism grows to extremes, other characters become more aware of it but seem to tolerate Peggy&#x27;s behavior. Hank truly loves Peggy and usually tolerates her ego. But at one point, he has enough of Peggy&#x27;s ego and directly confronts Peggy after she attacks Randy Travis in public, claiming he stole a song she wrote. Ironically, Randy Travis &quot;did&quot; indeed steal the song, but because Peggy often takes credit for things she never did, not even her own husband could believe her.

Peggy&#x27;s desire for importance and excellence often reveals a competitive side, leading to pettiness when she feels overshadowed. During the episode, &quot;Goodbye Normal Jeans,&quot; Peggy begins to feel threatened by Bobby when she discovers that his newfound talent for domestic skills means that she is out-shined by her own son. She began trying and failing to outdo him, culminating in her stealing the Thanksgiving turkey he prepared. These traits can also make her susceptible to manipulation if her ego is stroked. In &quot;Death and Texas&quot;, a death row prisoner tricked her into smuggling cocaine into prison after he pretended to be a former student of hers. Even though the man was almost as old as she was, she was too blinded by his praise to see the truth.

Despite this, Peggy is a kind person at heart who often works from the best motives. She is completely devoted to her husband and family. She refers to Hank as the love of her life and has demonstrated her love for and protectiveness of him several times. However, Peggy makes no secret of her contempt for her father-in-law, Cotton Hill, particularly because of his neglectful, cruel behavior toward Hank. Cotton shows even more disrespect towards Peggy herself, including only referring to her as &quot;Hank&#x27;s wife&quot; instead of her name. She dislikes him so much that she accepts his offer to literally dance on his grave. This hatred between the two even continues when Cotton is on his deathbed. While Hank is out of the room, Peggy tells Cotton exactly what she thinks of him just before he dies. When Hank returns, she lies and says Cotton said kind things about Hank before his passing.

=== Family ===
Earlier episodes such as &quot;I Remember Mono&quot; and &quot;Transnational Amusements Presents: Peggy&#x27;s Magic Sex Feet&quot; depicted Peggy&#x27;s parents living nearby and being on speaking terms with her, with her mother as a homemaker. This changed in later episodes (beginning with &quot;A Rover Runs Through It&quot;, which depict Peggy&#x27;s mother as emotionally cold towards her, her father as constantly speaking in riddles, and both of them living in Montana). These later episodes suggest that Peggy left her parents behind when she went to Texas. Both depictions show Mrs. Platter as being critical, unappreciative, and dismissive of her daughter.

Peggy thinks of Luanne as a surrogate daughter and does her best to give her guidance and encourage her, always wanting the best for her. With this in mind, Peggy is openly critical of Luanne&#x27;s choice to get involved with Lucky, who Peggy views as not being good enough for Luanne. At first, Peggy sabotages Lucky&#x27;s efforts to better himself by getting a GED. But, in the end, Peggy accepts the relationship, realizing that Lucky makes Luanne happy and is a genuinely good man. She is protective of Luanne, and has defended her niece from her abusive and alcoholic mother, Leanne.

Peggy has a brother named Hoyt, who is Luanne&#x27;s father. She lied to Luanne by telling her that Hoyt was working on an oil rig when he was actually in prison. When Hoyt returns to Arlen, Peggy tried to help him out and gave him money, but eventually realized Hoyt was an incorrigible criminal and would destroy the entire family. Hank then tricked Hoyt into committing an obvious crime and convinced him to confess to it along with an earlier robbery. This would send him to prison for life, but maintain Luanne&#x27;s false impression of her father as a good and hard-working man. Peggy and Hank then told Luanne that Hoyt had accepted &quot;a lifetime contract&quot; to work on an oil rig.

=== Jobs ===
At the start of the series, Peggy works as a substitute teacher at Arlen High School and Tom Landry Middle School, typically teaching Spanish. Briefly, she works as a full-time teacher at a Catholic school by pretending to be a nun. A running gag in the show is her overconfidence in speaking the language, when she in fact speaks it poorly and doesn&#x27;t understand it as well as she believes she does. For example, in &quot;Lupe&#x27;s Revenge&quot; her poor understanding of the language caused her to mistakenly bring a young Mexican girl back to Texas after a school field trip across the Mexican border, confusing the child by saying &quot;Yo vivo en México&quot;, which means &quot;I live in Mexico&quot; in Spanish, with &quot;Viva México&quot;, which means &quot;Long live Mexico&quot;. Her own egotism makes her believe she is better at speaking it than native Mexicans. Peggy often remarks she won the &quot;Substitute Teacher Of The Year&quot; three years in a row. But for the third year, she claimed an award for the school itself that was really for Hank.

In the third season, she starts writing a column for a local newspaper, the Arlen Bystander and is occasionally seen sub-editing. In season 11, she gets dismissed from the newspaper after writing a scathing piece about a local real estate agent, but she is subsequently hired by the real estate agent, where she works for the rest of the series. She is a somewhat successful real estate agent who is prepared to go to extraordinary measures to make a deal, including overzealous self-promotion on her part.

== Character analysis ==
Although Peggy is often cited as &quot;&quot;the&quot; hated wife and mother of adult animated TV&quot; due to her arrogance and character flaws, Austin Jones of Paste argues that she is one of the most complex characters in the series, calling her a &quot;keen satire on the way Southern suburbia mollifies women with talent into embittered sidekick roles to mediocre men&quot;.

According to Jo Johnson of McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press, Peggy differs from the usual depiction of women in adult animated sitcoms due to the fact that she is both a mother and homemaker while also being employed. In most other animated sitcoms, such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, regular employment is &quot;bestowed upon male breadwinners or single unattractive females&quot;. Johnson argues that Peggy&#x27;s ability to comfortably juggle her role at home with a career &quot;sets her apart from other animated mothers&quot;.

Lara Karaian of Fireweed states that the characters of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; represent stereotypes of working class southern communities. They describe Peggy as the &quot;liberal feminist of her southern town&quot;, and is &quot;someone who stands by her man while still remaining a strong and independent Texas woman&quot;, comparing her to Hillary Clinton.

<doc id="275572" wikidata="Q2044941" url="?curid=275572" title="Coital alignment technique">
<text>The coital alignment technique sex position is used primarily as a variant of the missionary position and is designed to maximize clitoral stimulation during sexual intercourse. This is achieved by combining the &quot;riding high&quot; variation of the missionary position with pressure-counterpressure movements performed by each partner in rhythm with coitus.

==Technique==
When used as a variant of the missionary position, the male lies above the female but moves upward along the woman&#x27;s body, until his erection, which would otherwise point &quot;up,&quot; is pointing &quot;down&quot;, with the dorsal side of the penis pressing against the clitoris. By adopting this ‘pelvic-override’ position, the male achieves a fundamental genital &#x27;circuitry&#x27;: vaginal penetration in coitus with constant direct contact between the base of the penis and the clitoris.

The partners then maintain their genital contact by coordinating their sexual movement. Instead of engaging in the familiar &#x27;in and out&#x27; motion of coital thrusting, the partners hold their penile-clitoral connection together by simultaneously exerting genital pressure and counterpressure in a rocking or grinding motion. As opposed to the missionary position, the male&#x27;s body moves downward (relative to the female&#x27;s) during the inward stroke, and upward for the outward stroke. Sexual movement is focused in the pelvises, without leverage from the arms or legs.

The male leads the downward stroke and the female the upward stroke, with the partner who is moving the pelvis backward exerting a slight but firm counterpressure. The female may also wrap her legs around the male. The rocking downward and upward sexual movement builds arousal that the partners let develop and peak naturally.

The woman on top variant is known as the reverse coital alignment technique.

==History of studies==
The technique for coital alignment was first defined by American psychotherapist Edward Eichel, and the original study was published by Eichel, De Simone Eichel, and Kule in 1988 in the &quot;Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy.&quot;

Since then, the topic has been studied several times in the same journal. A 1992 report by Kaplan and her sex therapist trainees described the team&#x27;s cursory trial of the coital alignment technique (CAT), acknowledging that they may have resorted to old routines after only a few attempts out of fear of disappointing their partners. Their call for other sex therapists to give the technique more rigorous testing instigated a series of controlled studies by Hurlbert and colleagues reporting statistically significant results in the treatment of female hypoactive sexual desire.

In 2005, Eichel asserted that &quot;the three classic problems of sexual &#x27;dysfunction&#x27; have been redefined as interdependent parts of ONE behavioral syndrome - the problems are NOT &#x27;diseases&#x27;[…] [t]he &#x27;cure&#x27; is a fundamental change in sexual technique&quot;. In his concluding paragraph, Eichel wrote that &quot;[t]he CAT model provides a fundamental matrix for the analysis of classic sex problems and other subtle, but widespread, sex-related health problems.&quot;

<text>William James Durant (; November 5, 1885 – November 7, 1981) was an American historian and philosopher, best known for his eleven-volume work, &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;, which contains and details the history of Eastern and Western civilizations. It was written in collaboration with his wife, Ariel Durant, and published between 1935 and 1975. He was earlier noted for &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; (1926), described as &quot;a groundbreaking work that helped to popularize philosophy&quot;.

Durant conceived of philosophy as total perspective or seeing things &quot;sub specie totius&quot; (i.e., &quot;from the perspective of the whole&quot;)—a phrase inspired by Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;sub specie aeternitatis&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;from the perspective of the eternal&quot;. He sought to unify and humanize the great body of historical knowledge, which had grown voluminous and become fragmented into esoteric specialties, and to vitalize it for contemporary application. As a result of their success, he and his wife were jointly awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977.

==Early life==
William James Durant was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, to French-Canadian Catholic parents, Joseph Durant and Mary Allard, who had been part of the Quebec emigration to the United States.

After graduating from St. Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1903, Durant enrolled at Saint Peter&#x27;s College (now Saint Peter&#x27;s University), also in Jersey City, where he graduated in 1907. Historian Joan Rubin writes of that period, &quot;Despite some adolescent flirtations, he began preparing for the vocation that promised to realize his mother&#x27;s fondest hopes for him: the priesthood. In that way, one might argue, he embarked on a course that, while distant from Yale&#x27;s or Columbia&#x27;s apprenticeships in gentility, offered equivalent cultural authority within his own milieu.&quot;

In 1905, he began experimenting with socialist philosophy, but, after World War I, he began recognizing that a &quot;lust for power&quot; underlay all forms of political behavior. However, even before the war, &quot;other aspects of his sensibility had competed with his radical leanings,&quot; notes Rubin. She adds that &quot;the most concrete of those was a persistent penchant for philosophy. With his energy invested in Baruch Spinoza, he made little room for the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. From then on, writes Rubin, &quot;his retention of a model of selfhood predicated on discipline made him unsympathetic to anarchist injunctions to &#x27;be yourself.&#x27;... To be one&#x27;s &#x27;deliberate self,&#x27; he explained, meant to &#x27;rise above&#x27; the impulse to &#x27;become the slaves of our passions&#x27; and instead to act with &#x27;courageous devotion&#x27; to a moral cause.&quot;

==Teaching career==

From 1907 to 1911, Durant taught Latin and French at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.

After leaving Seton Hall, Durant was a teacher at Ferrer Modern School from 1911 to 1913. Ferrer was &quot;an experiment in libertarian education,&quot; according to the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners&quot;. Alden Freeman, a supporter of the Ferrer Modern School, sponsored him for a tour of Europe. 

In 1913, he resigned his post as teacher and married the 15-year-old Ariel Kaufman; they had one daughter, Ethel, and a &quot;foster&quot; son, Louis, whose mother was Flora—Ariel&#x27;s sister. To support themselves, he began lecturing in a Presbyterian church for $5 and $10; the material for the lectures became the starting point for &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;.

By 1914, he began to reject &quot;intimations of human evil,&quot; notes Rubin, and to &quot;retreat from radical social change.&quot; She summarizes the changes in his overall philosophy:
Durant was director and lecturer at the Labor Temple School in New York City from 1914 to 1927 while pursuing a PhD at Columbia University that he completed in 1917, the year he also served as an instructor in philosophy.

==Writing career==
In 1908, Durant worked as a reporter for Arthur Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;. At the &quot;Evening Journal&quot;, he wrote several articles on sexual criminals.

In 1917, while working on a doctorate in philosophy at Columbia University, he wrote his first book, &quot;Philosophy and the Social Problem&quot;. He discussed the idea that philosophy had not grown because it had refused to confront the actual problems of society. He received his doctorate from Columbia that same year. He was also an instructor at the university.

===&quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot;===
&quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; originated as a series of Little Blue Books (educational pamphlets aimed at workers) and because it was so popular, it was republished as a hardcover book by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1926 and became a bestseller, giving the Durants the financial independence that allowed them to travel the world several times and spend four decades writing &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;. Will left teaching and began work on the 11-volume &quot;Story of Civilization&quot;.

=== &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;===


Throughout their writing of &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;, the Durants strove to create what they called &quot;integral history.&quot; They opposed the &quot;specialization&quot; of history, an anticipatory rejection of what some have called the &quot;cult of the expert.&quot; Their goal was to write a biography of a civilization, in this case, the history of the West; not only would it describe the usual history of the Western world&#x27;s wars, the history of politics and biographies of people of greatness and villainy, but also the history of the Western world&#x27;s culture, art, philosophy, religion, and the rise of mass communication. Much of &quot;The Story&quot; considers the living conditions of everyday people throughout the 2500-year period that their &quot;story&quot; of the West covers, and bring an unabashedly moral framework to their accounts, constantly stressing the &quot;dominance of the strong over the weak, the dominance of the clever over the simple.&quot; As of this date,&quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; is the most successful historiographical series ever written. In the 1990s, an unabridged audiobook production of all 11 volumes was produced by Books On Tape, read by Grover Gardner (under the alias Alexander Adams).

The Durants were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature for &quot;Rousseau and Revolution&quot; (1967), the 10th volume of &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;. In 1977, it was followed by one of the highest awards was ever granted to civilians by the United States government, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (awarded by President Gerald Ford). As well, the Durants received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1976.
===Other works===

On April 8, 1944, Durant was approached by two leaders of the Jewish and Christian faiths, Meyer David and Christian Richard, about starting &quot;a movement, to raise moral standards.&quot; He suggested instead that they start a movement against racial intolerance and outlined his ideas for a &quot;Declaration of Interdependence&quot;. The movement for the declaration, Declaration of INTERdependence, Inc., was launched at a gala dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on March 22, 1945, attended by over 400 people including Thomas Mann and Bette Davis. The Declaration was read into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; on October 1, 1945, by Ellis E. Patterson.

Throughout his career, Durant made several speeches, including &quot;Persia in the History of Civilization&quot;, which was presented as an address before the Iran-America Society in Tehran, Iran, on April 21, 1948, and it had been intended for inclusion in the &quot;Bulletin of the Asia Institute&quot; (formerly, the &quot;Bulletin of the American Institute for Persian&quot;, then &quot;Iranian, Art and Archaeology&quot;), Vol. VII, no. 2, which never saw publication.

&quot;Rousseau and Revolution&quot; was followed by a slender volume of observations which was titled &quot;The Lessons of History&quot;, which was both a synopsis of the series as well as an analysis of human history.

Though Ariel and Will had intended to carry the work on &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; into the 20th century, at their now very advanced age, they expected the 10th volume to be their last. However, they went on to publish a final volume, their 11th, &quot;The Age of Napoleon&quot; in 1975. They also left notes behind for a 12th volume, &quot;The Age of Darwin&quot;, as well as an outline of a 13th volume, &quot;The Age of Einstein&quot;, which would have taken &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; to 1945.

Three posthumous works by Durant have been published in recent years, &quot;The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time&quot; (2002), &quot;Heroes of History: A Brief History of Civilization from Ancient Times to the Dawn of the Modern Age&quot; (2001) and &quot;Fallen Leaves&quot; (2014).

====Final years====
The Durants shared an intense love for one another as they explained in their &quot;Dual Autobiography&quot;. After Will entered the hospital, Ariel stopped eating, and she died on October 25, 1981. Though their daughter, Ethel, and their grandchildren strove to conceal the news of Ariel&#x27;s death from the ailing Will, he found out that she had died while he was watching the evening news, and he died two weeks later, two days after his 96th birthday, on November 7, 1981. Will was buried beside Ariel in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, in Los Angeles.

===Writing about Russia===
In 1933, he published &quot;Tragedy of Russia: Impressions from a Brief Visit&quot; and soon afterward, he published &quot;The Lesson of Russia&quot;. A few years after the books were published, the social commentator Will Rogers read them and he described a symposium which he had attended which included Durant as one of the contributors to it. He later wrote of Durant, &quot;He is just about our best writer on Russia. He is the most fearless writer that has been there. He tells you just what it&#x27;s like. He makes a mighty fine talk. One of the most interesting lecturers we have, and a fine fellow.&quot;

===Writing about India===

In 1930, Durant visited British India to collect information for &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;. While in India, Durant was shocked by the poverty and instances of starvation he witnessed, to the point where he took a period of time off from his intended goal to write a short book titled &quot;The Case for India&quot; about the &quot;conscious and deliberate bleeding of India&quot; by Britain. He also stated that &quot;I began to feel that I had come upon the greatest crime in all history.&quot; when learning of the plight of India. In &quot;The Case for India&quot;, Durant wrote that &quot;The British conquest of India was the invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company utterly without scruple or principle, careless of art and greedy of gain, over-running with fire and sword a country temporarily disordered and helpless, bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing, and beginning their career of illegal and &#x27;legal&#x27; plunder which has now gone on ruthlessly for one hundred and seventy-three years.&quot;

== Personal views ==
On his personal religious beliefs, Durant wrote that “I am prepared to have you put me down as an atheist, since I have reluctantly abandoned belief in a personal and loving God. But I am loath to leave the word God out of my life and creed.”, adding that he was “a Christian in the literal and difficult sense of sincerely admiring the personality of Christ and making a persistent effort to behave like a Christian.”

==Reception==
While Durant&#x27;s work was well received by popular audiences, its academic reception was more critical. Classics scholar Moses Finley criticised Durant&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Greece&quot; on a number of grounds, including the book&#x27;s racial essentialism and support for the great man theory of history.

== History ==
100 Mile House was originally known as Bridge Creek House, named after the creek running through the area.

It acquired its current name during the Cariboo Gold Rush where a roadhouse was constructed in 1862 at the mark up the Old Cariboo Road from Lillooet.

In 1930, Lord Martin Cecil left England to come to 100 Mile House and manage the estate owned by his father, the 5th Marquess of Exeter. The estate&#x27;s train stop on the Pacific Great Eastern (now BC Rail leased and operated by Canadian National) railway is to the west of town and called Exeter.

It has almond-shaped, dark brown eyes with an intelligent, friendly expression. The ears are pendant, relatively small, and lie close to the head. The occiput (the bone at the back of the skull) is not to be accentuated (as it is in setters, for example) with the head flowing smoothly into a well-arched neck. The topline is strong and straight with a well-feathered tail of moderate length held straight off the back. This breed should be well angulated front and rear, allowing for open, effortless movement.
 The Flat-Coated Retriever comes in three colors – black (most common), liver, and yellow. Although yellow is a disqualifier in conformation, they can compete in other venues.

===Temperament===
While they will protect their owners and property with an assertive bark, they are unlikely to back up such noise with actual aggression. Because of their excellent sense of smell, combined with their boundless energy and eagerness to please their masters, they are sometimes used as drug-sniffer dogs. They are used in the breeding program for The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the UK, both as a breed and as cross-breeds with the Labrador Retriever.

Paddy Petch, author of &quot;The Complete Flat-Coated Retriever&quot;, refers to these dogs as the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; of the retriever breeds, given they never quite grow up.

==History==

Originating in the mid-19th century in England, the Flat-Coated Retriever gained popularity as a gamekeeper’s dog. Part of its ancestry is thought to have come from stock imported from North America from the now extinct St. John&#x27;s water dog, but this is unverified. Canadian seafarers are thought to have brought Newfoundlands to British ports, and they factored into the ancestry of the Flat-Coated Retriever. Collie-type dogs may have been added to increase the breed&#x27;s trainability along with the Newfoundland for strength and Setter blood for enhanced scenting ability. The first examples of the breed were introduced around 1860, but the final type was only established 20 years later.

After its introduction into the U.S., the Flat-Coated Retriever began to quickly gain in popularity as a gun dog, and from 1873 when the breed became a &quot;stable type&quot; according to the American Kennel Club until 1915 when it was officially recognised as a breed, 
their number grew rapidly. However, soon after, their popularity began to decrease, eclipsed by the Golden Retriever, which was actually bred in part from the Flat-Coated Retriever, along with other breeds. By the end of World War II, so few Flat-Coated Retrievers remained, the breed&#x27;s survival was uncertain. However, beginning in the 1960s, careful breeding brought the population back and the breed gained in popularity again, for both the sport of conformation showing, and as a companion pet. Today, the Flat-Coated Retriever enjoys a modest popularity and is moving ahead as a breed through attentive breeding for the conformation, health, multipurpose talent, and exceptional temperament that are its hallmarks. It has yet to return in substantial numbers to field competition.

In 2011, &#x27;Sh Ch. Vbos The Kentuckian&#x27; (aka Jet), a 9.5-year-old Flat-Coated Retriever from South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, Scotland, won Best in Show at Crufts. &quot;Almanza Far and Flyg&quot; (a.k.a. Simon), from Oslo, Norway, won the Gundog Group at Crufts in 2007. Before that in 2003, a Swedish dog &#x27;Inkwells Named Shadow&#x27; had also won the Gundog Group. The last UK dog to win the Gundog Group at Crufts was &quot;Sh Ch Gayplume Dream-maker&quot; in 2002. In 2022 Crufts, Baxer ‘Ch. Almanza Backseat Driver’, a 6-year-old liver flat-coated retriever from Oslo Norway, won the Best in Show. The previous other Flat-Coated Retriever to win Best in Show at Crufts was &#x27;Ch. Shargleam Blackcap&#x27; in 1980. These wins have contributed to the breed&#x27;s popularity in Europe and the United Kingdom.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.7 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The most common types of tumours in the Flat-coated Retriever are cutaneous histiocytomas and soft-tissue sarcomas. A health survey of purebred dogs in the UK from 2004 showed approximately 50% of Flat-Coated Retrievers death were due to some form of cancer.

<text>The Konkordiaplatz or Concordia Place (French: Place de la Concorde), is a flat area of snow and ice lying just to the south of the Jungfrau in the Bernese Alps in the Swiss canton of Valais. It is the junction of four large glaciers coming down from the &quot;Aletschfirn&quot;, the &quot;Jungfraufirn&quot;, the &quot;Ewigschneefäld&quot; and the &quot;Grüneggfirn&quot;. The main Aletsch Glacier originates from Konkordiaplatz. The &quot;Konkordiaplatz Charter&quot; was signed by the municipalities located in the Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area UNESCO World Heritage site, vowing to retain the aesthetic beauty of the region.

== Naming ==

&quot;Concordia&quot; is the Latin word for harmony, literally &quot;with (one) heart&quot;. It was the name of the Roman goddess of agreement, understanding, and marital harmony. British mountaineer John Frederick Hardy dubbed the location at the convergence of the several glaciers &quot;Place de la Concorde of Nature&quot;.

The name &quot;Concordia&quot; was then given to other places where two or more glaciers meet, or large glaciated areas, such as Concordia in the Karakoram, and Concordia Station in Antarctica.

== Geography ==

Konkordiaplatz is located at an altitude between 2,700 and 2,800 metres, covering an area of approximately 2 km2. The depth of snow and ice is more than 900 metres. It is surrounded by the Dreieckhorn (south), the Fiescher Gabelhorn (east), the Grünhorn (north-east) and the Kranzberg (subpeak of the Jungfrau) and Trugberg (north).

The area is uninhabited but the Konkordia Hut lies above the glacier, on the western slope of Gross Wannenhorn.

<doc id="275589" wikidata="Q189898" url="?curid=275589" title="Emirate">
<text>An emirate is a territory ruled by an emir, a title used by monarchs or high officeholders in the Muslim world. From a historical point of view, an emirate is a political-religious unit smaller than a caliphate. It can be considered equivalent to a principality in non-Muslim contexts.

Currently in the world, there are two emirates that are independent states (Kuwait and Qatar), one state ruled by an unrecognised emirate (Afghanistan), and a state that consists of a federation of seven emirates (the United Arab Emirates). A great number of previously independent emirates around the world are now part of larger states, as can be seen in Nigeria.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, emirate or amirate ( &#x27;, plural: &#x27;) is the quality, dignity, office, or territorial competence of any emir (prince, commander, governor, etc.). In English, the term is pronounced or in British English and or in American English.

==Types==
===Monarchies===
The United Arab Emirates is a federal state that comprises seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven forming the electoral college for the federation&#x27;s president and prime minister.

As most emirates have either disappeared, been integrated in a larger modern state, or changed their rulers&#x27; styles, e.g. to malik (Arabic for &quot;king&quot;) or sultan, such true emirate-states have become rare.

===Provinces===
Furthermore, in Arabic the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member (usually styled emir) of the royal family, as in Saudi Arabian governorates.

==List of present emirates==

Current emirates with political autonomy are listed below:

===Arabian Peninsula===
* (since 14 May 1961)
* (since 3 December 1971)
* (since 2 December 1971):
**
**
**

===South Asia===
* (since 15 August 2021; unrecognized)

==List of former and integrated emirates==
These are the emirates that have either ceased to exist, are not recognized and hold no real power, or were integrated into another country and preserved as &quot;traditional states&quot;. They are arranged by location and in order of the date of the first leader styled &quot;emir.&quot;

<doc id="275591" wikidata="Q3297873" url="?curid=275591" title="Tornado warning">
<text>A tornado warning (SAME code: TOR) is a public warning that is issued by weather forecasting agencies to an area in the direct path of a tornado, or a severe thunderstorm capable of producing one, and advises individuals in that area to take cover. Modern weather surveillance technology such as Doppler weather radar can detect rotation in a thunderstorm, allowing for early warning before a tornado develops. They are also commonly issued based on reported visual sighting of a tornado, funnel cloud, or wall cloud, typically from weather spotters or the public, but also law enforcement or local emergency management. When radar is unavailable or insufficient, such ground truth is crucial. In particular, a tornado can develop in a gap of radar coverage, of which there are several known in the United States.

A warning should not be confused with a tornado watch, issued in the United States by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and in other countries by applicable regional forecasting agencies or national severe weather guidance centers, which only indicates that conditions are favorable for the formation of tornadoes. Although a tornado warning is generally a higher alert level than a tornado watch, in the U.S., it can be surpassed by a higher-level alert—structured as wording that can be added to the official warning product—to warn the public of intense tornadoes affecting a densely populated area.

A tornado watch is not required for a warning to be issued; tornado warnings are occasionally issued when a tornado watch is not active (i.e. when a severe thunderstorm watch is active, or when no watches are in effect), if a severe thunderstorm develops and has a confirmed tornado or strong rotation.

==Early history==

In April 1899, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote to the United States Weather Bureau via a news article posing the question on why tornado warnings are not sent out via telegraphs or even the telephone to warn the local population in the path. Cleveland Abbe responded by saying &quot;it is certain that if any such arrangement were possible, the Weather Bureau would have done this many years ago&quot; along with &quot;we must remember that the destructive areas of tornadoes, and even of thunderstorms, are so small that the chance of being injured is exceedingly slight&quot; and that &quot;we do not attempt to prevent that which is inevitable&quot;.

The first official tornado forecast—and tornado warning—was made by United States Air Force Capt. (later Col.) Robert C. Miller and Major Ernest Fawbush, on March 25, 1948. The first such forecast came after the events that occurred five days earlier on March 20, 1948; Miller – a California native who became stationed at Tinker Air Force Base three weeks earlier – was assigned to work the late shift as a forecaster for the base&#x27;s Air Weather Service office that evening, analyzing U.S. Weather Bureau surface maps and upper-air charts that failed to note atmospheric instability and moisture content present over Oklahoma that would be suitable for producing thunderstorm activity, erroneously forecasting dry conditions for that night. Thunderstorms soon developed southwest of Oklahoma City, and at 9:30 p.m., forecasters from Will Rogers Airport sent a warning to Tinker that the storm encroaching the city was producing wind gusts of and a &quot;Tornado South on Ground Moving NE!&quot; Base personnel received an alert written by the staff sergeant on duty with Miller, minutes before the twister struck Tinker several minutes later around 10:00 p.m., damaging several military aircraft (with total damage estimated at $10 million) that could not be secured in time before it crossed the base grounds.

Following an inquiry the next day before a tribunal of five generals who traveled to Tinker from Washington, D.C., who ruled that the March 20 tornado was an &quot;act of God ... not forecastable given the present state of the art&quot;, base commander Gen. Fred Borum tasked Miller and Fawbush to follow up on the board&#x27;s suggestion to consider methods of forecasting tornadic thunderstorms. Over the next three days, Miller and Fawbush studied reports and charts from previous tornado events to determine the atmospheric conditions favorable for the development of tornadic activity, in an effort to predict such events with some degree of accuracy. At the time, there had not been studies on how tornadoes formed; however, military radars were being adapted for forecasting use, allowing forecasters to see the outlines of storms but not their internal attributes such as rotation. Miller and Fawbush&#x27;s findings on atmospheric phenomenon present in past outbreaks would aid in their initial forecast, as the day&#x27;s surface and upper-air analysis charts determined the same conditions present on March 20 were present on the 25th, concluded that central Oklahoma would have the highest risk for tornadoes during the late-afternoon and evening.

Borum, who had put together a severe weather safety plan for base personnel, then suggested that Miller and Fawbush issue a severe thunderstorm forecast, and then asked the men if they would issue a tornado forecast based on the similarities between the conditions that produced the tornado which hit the base five days earlier, which they were reluctant to do. Fawbush wrote the forecast message that Miller would type and issued it to base operations at 2:50 p.m. as thunderstorms were approaching from North Texas. Defying the high odds against two tornadoes hitting the same area in five days, one hit the Tinker campus around 6:00 p.m., to the surprise of Miller (who left the base an hour earlier, believing their forecast would not pan out), who found out about the storm (produced by two thunderstorms that merged to the southwest of Tinker) via a radio report. Miller and Fawbush would not put out another tornado forecast until March 25, 1949, when they successfully predicted tornadic activity would occur in southeastern Oklahoma.

Miller and Fawbush soon would distribute their tornado forecasts to the American Red Cross and Oklahoma Highway Patrol, after giving William Maughan, chief meteorologist at the U.S. Weather Bureau&#x27;s Oklahoma City office (who provided them with additional archived weather data to help fine-tune their forecasts), permission to relay their forecasts to those agencies. The relative accuracy of the forecasts restarted a debate over their reliability and whether military or civilian agencies should have jurisdiction over the issuance of weather warnings. The USAF had pioneered tornado forecasting and tornado warnings, although John P. Finley had developed the first experimental tornado forecasts in 1885. Two years later, he and other officials with the agency were prohibited by the United States Signal Service&#x27;s weather service from using the word &quot;tornado&quot; in forecasts. They were instead directed to refer to &quot;severe local storms&quot;. This position on tornado forecasting would be shared by the U.S. Weather Bureau after its formation in 1890, fearing that tornado forecasts were insufficiently reliable and that such warnings would incite panic among the public. The side effect of this policy was that the lack of warning resulted in a steady increase in the number of tornado-related fatalities through the 1950s, with some events prior to 1948 (such as the deadliest tornado in U.S. history, the Tri-State Tornado in March 1925, and the Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes in April 1947) having death tolls well over 100.

In 1938, the Weather Bureau rescinded its ban on the usage of the word &quot;tornado&quot; in weather products disseminated to emergency management personnel. The Bureau would develop a network of volunteer storm spotters in the early 1940s during World War II, to provide warning of tornadoes to workers in munitions plants and strategic factories. The ban on issuing tornado warnings to the general public would not be revoked until Chief of Bureau Francis W. Reichelderfer officially lifted the ban in a Circular Letter issued on July 12, 1950, to all first order stations: &quot;Weather Bureau employees should avoid statements that can be interpreted as a negation of the Bureau&#x27;s willingness or ability to make tornado forecasts&quot;, and that a &quot;good probability of verification&quot; exist when issuing such forecasts due to the difficulty in accurately predicting tornadic activity. The American Meteorological Society agreed to have Miller and Fawbush present their methodology for forecasting tornadoes during the organization&#x27;s 1950 meeting in St. Louis; after garnering press coverage for their successful prediction of past tornadoes, AMS representatives decided to open the presentation to the public.

The Air Force began issuing severe weather forecasts relayed to Weather Bureau offices and emergency personnel in tornado-prone regions through the formation of the Severe Weather Warning Center in 1951, before the Bureau&#x27;s contention that the USAF intruded on its responsibility to relay such forecasts led to the SWWC limiting the release of its tornado forecasts to military personnel; however, the move to prohibit the USAF from widespread releasing of tornado forecasts led to disapproval and heavy criticism from Oklahoma media outlets, given the agency&#x27;s continued refusal to provide public tornado warnings. The Weather Bureau issued its first experimental public tornado forecast in March 1952, which proved inaccurate and was released too late to become widely available for public consumption; however, a forecast issued the following evening managed to predict an outbreak of tornadoes across most of the warned seven-state area (from Texas to Indiana).

Even after the U.S. Weather Bureau lifted their ban on tornado warnings, the Federal Communications Commission continued to ban television and radio outlets from broadcasting tornado warnings on-air for the same reasoning cited in the Bureau&#x27;s abolished ban. Broadcast media followed this ban until 1954, when meteorologist Harry Volkman broadcast the first televised tornado warning over WKY-TV (now KFOR-TV) in Oklahoma City, due to his belief that the banning of tornado warnings over broadcast media cost lives. Through an alert issued by the USAF Severe Weather Warning Center, Volkman opted to interrupt regular programming to warn viewers of a reported tornado approaching the Oklahoma City area; although station management and U.S. Weather Bureau officials were displeased with his move, WKY-TV received numerous telephone calls and letters thanking Volkman for the warning.

==Definition==

A tornado warning is issued when any of the following conditions has occurred:
* a tornado is reported on the ground, or
* a funnel cloud has been reported, or
* strong low-level rotation is indicated by weather radar, or
* a waterspout is headed for landfall.

A &quot;tornado warning&quot; means there is immediate danger for the warned area and immediate surrounding locations from the severe thunderstorm producing (or likely to produce) a tornado, if not from the relatively narrow tornado itself. Persons in the path of a warned storm are urged to immediately seek shelter in a basement, cellar, safe room or a sturdy above-ground room in the center section of a home or building (such as a bathroom or closet). In addition to the likelihood of a tornado, generally (but not always), a tornado warning also indicates that the parent severe thunderstorm has the likelihood of producing straight-line winds and/or large hail exceeding regional severe criterion as well as intense lightning, heavy rainfall and/or, through associated rain accumulations, flash flooding. (The classifiable criteria for a severe thunderstorm vary by country; e.g., in the United States, a thunderstorm is considered severe if it produces winds exceeding and/or hailstones larger than in diameter.) A tornado warning therefore implies that it is also a severe thunderstorm warning. Conversely, a severe thunderstorm warning, either in its entirety or sectionally, can be replaced by a tornado warning if a storm exhibits credible characteristics of tornadogenesis from radar and ground observations.

Tornado warnings are issued by weather forecasting agencies based on mesocyclone and debris signatures identifiable on Doppler weather radar, and/or ground truth from storm spotters of signs of tornadogenesis (including wall clouds, funnel clouds and low-level mesocyclonic rotation) and of observed tornadoes. Skywarn, a U.S.-based international spotter program that provides training to citizens on how to spot severe weather phenomena, is offered by forecasting agencies in several countries including the National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States. Used in tandem with Doppler weather radar information, eyewitness reports can be very helpful for warning the public of an impending tornado, especially when used for ground truthing. Other spotter groups such as the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, news media, local law enforcement agencies, emergency management organizations, cooperative observers; members of the general public also relay information to forecasting agencies for ground truthing.

When a warning is issued, people in the storm&#x27;s path are advised to use local broadcast media, weather radio, weather app alert notifications and/or SMS notifications to receive warnings and updated storm information. In some tornado-prone regions, tornado sirens, if present, are usually activated within the specified warning region or an entire municipality—varying in coverage based on if a local siren network maintains a sector-organized relay structure—to inform people that a tornado has been sighted or may be forming nearby. Because sirens are generally difficult to hear indoors, residents are advised against completely depending on them as a method of receiving warnings. Local police or fire departments may dispatch crews not assigned to an existing emergency call to travel within a designated area to warn residents to take tornado safety precautions if sirens are disabled due to technical problems or are not present, while automated phone calls may be made to residents for the same purpose in some areas should such disruptions occur.

Advances in technology, both in identifying conditions and in distributing warnings effectively, have been credited with reducing the death toll from tornadoes. The average warning times have increased substantially from -10 to -15 minutes in 1974 to about 15 minutes (in some cases, the lead time can extend to more than an hour&#x27;s warning of impending tornadoes). In the United States, the tornado death rate has declined from 1.8 deaths per million people per year in 1925 to only 0.11 per million in 2000. Much of this change is credited to improvements in the tornado warning system, via the various advances in the detection of severe local storms, along with an increase in reports visually confirming severe weather activity via storm spotters, public officials and citizens.

===Regional basis===
====United States====
In the United States, tornado warnings are issued by local Weather Forecast Offices of the National Weather Service, which, in conjunction with the Storm Prediction Center, maintains a multi-tier public warning system to disseminate probabilistic outlooks and alerts for tornadoes:
#Convective Outlook (categorical and probabilistic forecasts issued at least twice per day to describe threats of general or severe convective storms; severe thunderstorm outlooks for the Day 1 and Day 2 periods include charts and maps assessing tornado probabilities) 
#Public Severe Weather Outlook (issued when a significant or widespread severe thunderstorm/tornado outbreak is expected or, particularly from November to March, when strong tornadoes are forecast to occur after nightfall)
#Tornado Watch
#PDS Tornado Watch (upgraded wording indicating the likelihood of a significant tornado outbreak and/or a credible threat of strong to violent tornadoes within the watch area)
#Tornado Warning
#PDS Tornado Warning 
#Tornado Emergency

Local NWS forecast offices utilize WarnGen software integrated into the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) to generate the warning statement, which is disseminated through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to NOAA satellites, and over NOAA Weather Radio; additionally, the National Weather Service has the option of requesting activation of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) to interrupt television and radio broadcasts to get the bulletin out quickly. Warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms are outlined in polygonal shapes for map-based weather hazard products distributed to the main agency, individual forecast office websites and the Storm Prediction Center (including open-source APIs available for free use to public weather websites and mobile apps), based on the storm&#x27;s projected path as determined by Doppler radar at the time of the warning&#x27;s issuance. In NWS text products, warnings are usually illustrated by individual counties, parishes or other county-equivalent jurisdictions (sections or the entirety thereof, and in list format if it covers more than one jurisdiction), particularly dependent on the jurisdiction&#x27;s total land area. Prior to October 2007, warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on a per-county basis. SPC and NWS products as well as severe weather alert displays used by some television stations, and desktop and mobile radar software typically highlight tornado warnings with a red or purple polygon or filled county/parish/equivalent jurisdiction outline. (Since the late 2010s, Baron Services broadcast radar software and some public commercial radar software, such as GRLevelX, have used custom polygon coloring to denote tornado warnings based on impact level: usually, purple to indicate warnings for a confirmed tornado and inlined black-on-purple to indicate tornado emergencies.)

The NWS has the option of adding intensified wording to tornado warning products and update statements issued as a Severe Weather Statement (SVS)—&quot;particularly dangerous situation&quot; (PDS) or &quot;tornado emergency&quot;—when a severe threat to human life and considerable or catastrophic property damage from a visually observed or radar-detected large tornado is imminent or ongoing. Tornado emergencies and PDS tornado warnings—which, when warranted, are usually issued when a large tornado is expected to impact a populated area—typically include action statements indicating that the tornado is extremely dangerous and life-threatening, and capable of significant if not total property destruction and severe injury or death from the intense winds and projectile debris; tornado warnings that have the &quot;tornado emergency&quot; wording typically incorporate a combination of the emergency and PDS phrasing above the text&#x27;s basis (or &quot;hazard&quot;) statement.

In March 2012, as part of its implementation of a multi-tier Impact Based Warning (IBW) system to notify the public and emergency management officials of the severity of specific severe weather phenomena, the NWS Weather Forecast Offices in Wichita and Topeka, Kansas, and Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City/Pleasant Hill, Missouri, began incorporating categorical tornado and damage threat indicators for visually confirmed and radar-indicated tornadoes that appear at the bottom of the text products for tornado warnings and associated Severe Weather Statements providing updated storm information. The categorical criteria—which are applicable to all NWS Weather Forecast Offices, primarily those operating within the agency&#x27;s Central and Southern Region divisions—were introduced to further communicate to the public and prevent complacency of the threat of tornadoes. The NWS expanded the threat and damage indicators to 33 additional Central Region WFOs in March 2013; eight additional offices operating within the Eastern, Southern and Western Region divisions began using the IBW indicators in March 2014. The entire agency began using the format in 2016; IBW formatting was fully implemented for other individual warning bulletins in July 2021, when all NWS offices incorporated damage threat indicators into severe thunderstorm warnings. The threat indicators consist of four coded taglines, ascending by observational level and damage threat:
* Radar Indicated – Doppler weather radar indicates the thunderstorm is exhibiting mesocyclonic circulation supportive of tornado formation; generally requires no visual confirmation of a tornado at the time the initial warning or a subsequent severe weather statement is issued. Hazard statements will classify the tornadic rotation as &quot;radar indicated&quot; or &quot;radar-indicated rotation&quot; in the bulletin text when identifying the source of the hazard.
* Observed – Tornado is visually confirmed by storm spotters, law enforcement or other emergency personnel, or detected on radar in concert with an observed intense velocity couplet and/or debris signature. Hazard statements within the bulletin text will indicate a &quot;damaging tornado.&quot;
* Considerable (originally &quot;Significant&quot; during the 2012 Kansas and Missouri tests) – Typically reserved for PDS tornado warnings, it indicates credible evidence exists (through visual or radar confirmation) that a tornado capable of producing considerable damage is imminent or ongoing. As with warnings containing the &quot;observed&quot; tag, bulletins with this indicator will classify a &quot;damaging tornado&quot; in the hazard statement.
* Catastrophic – Generally reserved for warnings containing Tornado Emergency wording, it indicates reliable sources have confirmed a violent tornado posing a severe threat to human life and catastrophic property damage is occurring. In most instances, bulletins with this indicator will classify a &quot;deadly tornado&quot; in the hazard statement.

On August 15, 2020, for the first time in history, the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for pyrocumulonimbus capable of producing a tornado in southeastern Lassen County, California, which was being affected by the Loyalton Fire.

In April 2023, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker (R–MS) introduced the Tornado Observation Research Notification and Deployment to Operations (TORNADO) Act. The bill would establish a Hazard Risk Communication Office to propose improvements in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s methods for predicting severe weather events and communicating weather alerts to the public—requiring NOAA to coordinate with government and emergency management to optimize collection and sharing of storm survey data, implement high-resolution probabilistic tornado forecast guidance systems, and make recommendations for revisions to the Enhanced Fujita Scale.

====Canada====
In Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada issues tornado warnings through regional Meteorological Service offices based in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth for specified municipalities and census subdivisions. Although issuance criteria are similar to the U.S. National Weather Service, Meteorological Service-issued tornado warnings can include areas not in the immediate approximate path of the tornadic thunderstorm but are in an environment conducive to tornado development from adjacent thunderstorms during the warning timeframe (similar to but covering a smaller total area than tornado watches issued by the U.S. Storm Prediction Center).

Warnings are disseminated to the public through broadcast and online media outlets, and Weatheradio Canada; depending on storm severity and regional office discretion, the warning may require activation of depending on storm severity and regional office discretion, the warning may require activation of the National Public Alerting System (Alert Ready) () and feeding provincial alerting systems (such as Alberta Emergency Alert and SaskAlert) to distribute the alert to local broadcast media and cellular phones. Separately, Emergency Management Ontario—upon implementing the system in 2008—issues red alerts for sections of the province under an Environment Canada-issued tornado warning, and can sometimes override the tornado warning if local government or media outlets participate in the program.

====Australia====
In Australia, tornado warnings are issued by regional offices of the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) based in Melbourne Docklands, Adelaide, Darwin, Perth and Brisbane. BOM-issued tornado warnings are outlined as either a broad-based warning, covering expected impacts within a weather reporting area, or as a detailed warning, when a thunderstorm is within weather-watch radar range and includes a map depicting any existing thunderstorms and the forecast direction of movement for up to 60 minutes. Warnings are disseminated to the public through terrestrial and online media outlets, and through activation of Emergency Alert Australia to distribute the alert to local broadcast media (led by the Standard Emergency Warning Signal tone), SMS messaging and automated landline phone calls.

Tornado Alert sirens and Fire Tornado Alert sirens part of the Emergency Alert Australia plan, HHEM His Highness Emergency Management plan, Emergency Management Australia plan, HH government plan and the Australian Government plan.

==Related warnings and alerts==
===Tornado alert===
For many years until the early 1980s, an intermediate type of tornado advisory known as a tornado alert was defined by the National Weather Service and issued by the agency&#x27;s local forecast offices, indicating that tornado formation was imminent. In theory, tornado alerts covered situations such as visible rotation in clouds and certain other phenomena which are portents of funnel cloud formation. The National Weather Service&#x27;s use of this advisory began to decline after 1974, although it was still listed on public information materials issued by various media outlets, local NWS offices and other entities for another decade or so.

The criteria which called for tornado alerts in the past now generally result in a tornado warning with clarifying verbiage specifying that the warning was issued because rotation was detected in one way or another, that a wall cloud has formed or a tornado has been spotted or detected. The preferred response to both the tornado alerts and warnings is to take shelter immediately, so distinguishing them could be seen as splitting hairs, especially since storm prediction methods have improved.

The tornado alert was finally eliminated outright because it was made largely obsolete by the advent of Doppler weather radar, which can detect rotational funnel cloud formations earlier than is typically possible by trained spotters and members of the public. With fewer false-positives, radar also helped reduce public confusion over storm types, strengths and precise locations. The last tornado alert to be officially issued was discussed in earnest following the 1974 Super Outbreak.

===Tornado emergency===

The National Weather Service has the option of issuing a tornado emergency, a severe weather statement with unofficial, enhanced wording that is disseminated when reliable sources confirm that a violent tornado is ongoing, that poses a catastrophic risk for damage and threat to human life. This category of weather statement is the highest and most urgent level relating to tornadoes, albeit an unofficial alert product. The first tornado emergency was declared on May 3, 1999, when an F5 tornado struck southern portions of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, causing major damage exceeding $1 billion. In some cases, such as an F3 tornado that struck the Indianapolis, Indiana metropolitan area on September 20, 2002, a tornado emergency has been declared within the initial issuance of the tornado warning. Not all confirmed tornadoes will be considered a &quot;tornado emergency&quot;, and such statements are commonly declared when it is believed that the tornado is at a severity in which it would cause a significant threat to life and property.

==Examples==






Below are several examples of a tornado warning issued. The audio files on the right are for Greensburg, Kansas, and upstate South Carolina.

Below is an example of tornado warning for a pyrocumulonimbus capable of causing a fire tornado. This was the first time a tornado warning was issued for an event of this type.

Below is an example of an Environment Canada-issued tornado warning for southeastern Saskatchewan. As with all emergency warnings in Canada, a French-language version would immediately follow.

<text>Charles Franklin Kettering (August 29, 1876 – November 25, 1958) sometimes known as Charles Fredrick Kettering was an American inventor, engineer, businessman, and the holder of 186 patents. He was a founder of Delco, and was head of research at General Motors from 1920 to 1947. Among his most widely used automotive developments were the electrical starting motor and leaded gasoline. In association with the DuPont Chemical Company, he was also responsible for the invention of Freon refrigerant for refrigeration and air conditioning systems. At DuPont he also was responsible for the development of Duco lacquers and enamels, the first practical colored paints for mass-produced automobiles. While working with the Dayton-Wright Company he developed the &quot;Bug&quot; aerial torpedo, considered the world&#x27;s first aerial missile. He led the advancement of practical, lightweight two-stroke diesel engines, revolutionizing the locomotive and heavy equipment industries. In 1927, he founded the Kettering Foundation, a non-partisan research foundation, and was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in January 1933.

==Early life==
Charles was born in Loudonville, Ohio, United States, the fourth of five children of Jacob Henry Kettering and Martha (Hunter) Kettering. Poor eyesight gave him headaches in school. After graduation he followed his sister Emma into a teaching position at Bunker Hill School. By all accounts he was an engaging and innovative teacher. He attracted students to evening scientific demonstrations on electricity, heat, magnetism, and gravity.

He took classes at the College of Wooster, before transferring to Ohio State University. He was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Eye problems forced him to withdraw, and he took a job as foreman of a telephone line crew. At first, the termination of his studies caused him to be depressed. Then he found ways to apply his electrical engineering skills on the job, and his spirits revived. He also met his future wife, Olive Williams. When his eye condition improved, he was able to return to his studies and graduated from OSU in 1904 with an electrical engineering degree.

==Career==
===NCR===
Kettering was hired directly out of school to head the research laboratory at National Cash Register (later known as NCR Corporation). Kettering invented an easy credit approval system, a precursor to today&#x27;s credit cards, and the electric cash register in 1906, which made ringing up sales physically much easier for sales clerks. Kettering distinguished himself as a practical inventor. As he said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t hang around much with other inventors and the executive fellows. I lived with the sales gang. They had some real notion of what people wanted.&quot; During his five years at NCR, from 1904 to 1909, Kettering secured 23 patents for NCR. He attributed his success to a good amount of luck but added, &quot;I notice the harder I work, the luckier I get.&quot;

===The Barn Gang===
Beginning in 1907, his NCR colleague Edward A. Deeds convinced Kettering to develop improvements for the automobile. Deeds and Kettering invited other NCR engineers, including Harold E. Talbott, to join them nights and weekends in their tinkering at Deeds&#x27;s barn. They became known as the &quot;Barn Gang,&quot; and Kettering was called Boss Ket. Their first goal was to find a replacement for the magneto.

===Delco===
In 1909, Kettering resigned from NCR to work full-time on automotive developments, and the group incorporated as Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company, or Delco.

====The self-starter====
The hand crank used to start early automobiles could kick back under some circumstances. Byron Carter, founder of Cartercar, died from complications after such an accident in Detroit&#x27;s Belle Isle park. Henry M. Lelandthe head of Cadillacbecame determined to develop an electric self-starting device.
When Leland&#x27;s engineers failed to develop a self-starter small enough to be practical he consulted Kettering, and Delco developed a practical model by February 1911.

====Automobile electrical system====
Kettering&#x27;s key insight lay in devising an electrical system performing the three functions it still serves in modern cars: starter; producer of spark for ignition; and source of current for lighting. Leland ordered 12,000 self-starters for his 1912 models; Delco had to then transition from its research and development activities to production.
The invention won a Dewar Trophy in 1913.

Kettering helped found the Engineers Club of Dayton in 1914.

===Flxible===

In 1914, Flxible Sidecar Company was incorporated with the help of Kettering, who then became president of the company and joined the board of directors. Kettering provided significant funding for the company in its early years, particularly after 1916, when Kettering sold his firm, the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco), to United Motors Company for $2.5 million. Kettering continued to serve as president of Flxible until he became chairman of the board in 1940, a position that he held until his death in 1958.

===General Motors===
Delco was sold to General Motors in 1918, as part of United Motors. Delco became the foundation for the General Motors Research Corporation and Delco Electronics. Kettering became vice-president of General Motors Research Corporation in 1920 and held the position for 27 years.

Between 1918 and 1923, he led the research and development at GM&#x27;s Dayton research laboratories to commercialize air-cooled engines for cars and trucks. The GM &quot;copper-cooled&quot; automotive engine used fans forcing air across copper fins for heat dissipation. The commercialization, attempted between 1921 and 1923, was unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, nontechnical and technical. Air-cooled engines have had commercial success before and since, used widely in such applications as lawnmowers, small aircraft, and automobiles - notably the Volkswagen Beetle and many generations of Porsche sports cars.

===Leaded gas===
Kettering&#x27;s research in fuel was based on his belief that oil would be in short supply and additives would allow more efficient engines with higher compression. His &quot;high percentage&quot; solution was to mix ethanol with gasoline, while his &quot;low percentage solution&quot; looked for additives that would be added in small quantities to increase what later would be called the octane rating of gasoline. Thomas Midgley Jr. and Kettering identified tetraethyllead (TEL) in December 1921 as an additive that would eliminate engine knocking at a dilution of one thousand to one. While use of ethanol could not be patented, TEL&#x27;s use as an additive could. Kettering and Midgley secured its patent and proceeded to promote the use of TEL as an additive instead of other options. Kettering became the first president of the newly founded Ethyl Corporation that started to produce TEL in 1923. One year later, he hired Robert A. Kehoe as the medical expert to proclaim that leaded gasoline was safe for humans. That its use was an ecological disaster leading to a global lead contamination was not acknowledged until many decades later.

==Personal life==
Kettering married Olive Williams of Ashland, Ohio, on August 1, 1905. Their only child, Eugene Williams Kettering, was born on April 20, 1908. Eugene joined Winton Engine in 1930, which was acquired by General Motors and was eventually incorporated into the General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). He became a central figure in the development of the EMD 567 locomotive engine and the Detroit Diesel 6-71 engine, serving at EMD until his retirement in 1960.

Charles Kettering built a house, &quot;Ridgeleigh Terrace&quot;, in 1914. According to local sources, it was the first in the United States to have electric air conditioning using freon. Ridgeleigh Terrace was the home of his son, Eugene, until his death. Eugene&#x27;s wife, Virginia, lived in the house for many years, restoring and redecorating it. In the late 1990s, the house largely destroyed in a fire, and was rebuilt with serious deviation from the original blueprints to accommodate its current use as a conference center.

Some of Charles&#x27; memorable quotations are: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if you try and try and try again, and fail. It does matter if you try and fail, and fail to try again.&quot;, &quot;Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.&quot;, &quot;My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there.&quot; .

Kettering died on November 25, 1958. After his death, his body lay in honor at the Engineers Club and then was interred in the mausoleum at Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Max D. Liston, one of Kettering&#x27;s co-workers at GM, described him &quot;one of the gods of the automotive field, particularly from an inventive standpoint.&quot; Liston quoted Kettering as advising him, &quot;People won&#x27;t ever remember how many failures you&#x27;ve had, but they will remember how well it worked the last time you tried it.&quot;

Kettering and Deeds had a lifelong business, professional and personal relationship. In 1914, recognizing that Dayton was among the leading industrial cities in the US because of the skilled engineers and technicians in the city, they founded the Engineers Club of Dayton and the Foreman&#x27;s Club of Dayton, which later on became the National Management Association.

Kettering held 186 U.S. patents. He invented the all-electric starting, ignition, and lighting system for automobiles. Electric starters replaced crank (manual) starting of automobiles. First incorporated in the 1912 Cadillac, all-electric starting aided in the growth of the US auto industry by making the automobile easy for anyone to start. Other patents included a portable lighting system and an for premature infants. His engine-driven generator was combined with storage batteries to form a &quot;Delco Plant&quot;, providing electrical power for farmsteads and other locations far from the power grid.

In 1918 Kettering designed the &quot;aerial torpedo&quot;, nicknamed the Kettering Bug.

Kettering and colleagues&#x27; development of leaded gasoline ultimately caused the release of large quantities of lead into the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of leaded gasoline all over the world. Due to the neurotoxic effects of lead, leaded gasoline has been widely banned since the late 1990s. The development of Freon using CFCs has been implicated in the depletion of the ozone layer.

He developed the idea of Duco paint and helped develop diesel engines and ways to harness solar energy. He was a pioneer in the application of magnetism to medical diagnostic techniques.

His inventions, especially the electric automobile starter, made him wealthy. In 1945, he helped found what became the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, based on the premise that American industrial research techniques could be applied to cancer research.. His son and daughter-in-law, Eugene and Virginia, created Kettering Medical Center in Ohio, as a tribute to Charles Kettering&#x27;s life and his work in healthcare research.

On January 1, 1998, the former General Motors Institute changed its name to Kettering University to honor Kettering as a founder.

===Memorials===
In 1998, GMI Engineering and Management Institute (formerly General Motors Institute), of Flint, Michigan, changed its name to Kettering University in honor of Kettering. His ideals, prowess, and belief in co-operative education continue there. Kettering is also remembered through the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a cancer research and treatment center in New York City, and through the Kettering Health Network, which includes several hospitals and medical center campuses as well as Kettering College in Kettering, Ohio.

The city of Kettering, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton, was named after him when it was incorporated in 1955.

The former U.S. Army Air Service testing field, McCook Field, is now a Dayton park called Kettering Field.

Several U.S. public schools are named after him:

The endowed Olive Williams Kettering Chair of The College of Wooster Department of Music is named in honor of his wife.

The University of Dayton&#x27;s engineering building, Kettering Labs, is named after him.

The Kettering Science center on the Ashland University campus in Ohio is named for him.

Kettering Hall at Wilmington College is named for him, also &quot;Kettering Hall of Science&quot; at Oberlin College.

At Antioch College, the 1929 Science Building he donated was not named after him (it is now the Arts and Science Building), but the school&#x27;s 33.000-square-foot Charles F. Kettering Building was (the same being originally a research facility, now home to campus radio station WYSO), while the college&#x27;s Olive Kettering Library was named after his wife.

<text>Laurence A. Canter (born June 24, 1953) and Martha S. Siegel (born April 9, 1948) were partners and spouses in a firm of lawyers who committed the first massive commercial Usenet spamming on April 12, 1994. They were not the first Usenet spammers, but some consider them pioneers in the modern global field of ad spamming.

==Green card spam==
In early 1994, Canter and Siegel contracted with Leigh Benson to write a program to advertise on Usenet, but Benson was unable to write their software. In April 1994 they used a Perl script written by a programmer known only as &quot;Jason&quot;, to generate advertisements for their service of enrolling people in a &quot;green card lottery&quot;. This US government program allocates a limited quantity of &quot;green cards&quot; to certain non-citizens, allowing them to stay and work in the country. The two lawyers offered to do the necessary paperwork for a fee.

Canter and Siegel sent their advertisement, with the subject &quot;Green Card Lottery – Final One?&quot;, to at least 5,500 Usenet discussion groups, an enormous number at the time. Rather than cross-posting a single copy of the message to multiple groups, so a reader would only see it once (considered a common courtesy when posting the same message to more than one group), they posted it as separate postings in each newsgroup, so a reader would see it in each group they read. Their internet service provider, Internet Direct, received so many complaints that its mail servers crashed repeatedly for the next two days; it promptly terminated their service. Despite the ire directed at the two lawyers, they posted another advertisement to 1,000 newsgroups in June 1994. This time, Arnt Gulbrandsen put together a software &quot;cancelbot&quot; to trawl Usenet and kill their messages within minutes. Canter claimed in a December 1994 interview regarding the spam that &quot;The best I can recall we probably made somewhere between $100,000 to $200,000 related to that&quot;.

On May 5, 1994, the couple established a company called Cybersell. They promoted themselves as experts in the then-new business of online retail and in February 1995 undertook the first known commercial spamming on behalf of clients (so-called &quot;spam for hire&quot;). They wrote a book titled &quot;How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway: Everyone&#x27;s Guerrilla Guide to Marketing on the Internet and Other On-line Services&quot; (). In 1997, Martha Siegel published a revised version titled &quot;How to Make a Fortune on the Internet&quot; () under her name only.

In 1997, the Supreme Court of Tennessee disbarred Canter in part for illegal advertising practices. William W. Hunt III, of the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, said at the time that he believed it was the first time a lawyer had been disciplined for Internet advertising practices.

<doc id="275597" wikidata="Q111187335" url="?curid=275597" title="Schön scandal">
<text>The Schön scandal concerns German physicist Jan Hendrik Schön (born August 1970 in Verden an der Aller, Lower Saxony, West Germany) who briefly rose to prominence after a series of apparently successful experiments with semiconductors that were discovered later to be fraudulent. Before he was exposed, Schön had received the Otto-Klung-Weberbank Prize for Physics and the Braunschweig Prize in 2001, as well as the Outstanding Young Investigator Award of the Materials Research Society in 2002, all of which were later rescinded. He was also supposed to receive the William L. McMillan Award from the University of Illinois in 2002, but due to the intervention of Daniel C. Ralph of Cornell University (who was on the committee of the McMillan Award), Schön was never given the award.

The scandal provoked discussion in the scientific community about the degree of responsibility which coauthors and reviewers of scientific articles bear in cases of scientific misbehavior. The discussion mainly concerned whether peer review, traditionally designed to find errors and determine relevance and originality of articles, should also be required to detect deliberate fraud.

==Beginning of fame==
Schön&#x27;s topic of research was condensed matter physics and nanotechnology. He received his PhD from the University of Konstanz in 1997. During late 1997, he was hired by Bell Labs, where he worked on electronics in which conventional semiconducting elements (such as silicon) were replaced by crystalline organic (meaning carbon-based) materials. Schön, however, claimed spectacular ability for changing the conductivity of the organic materials, well beyond anything achieved to date. His measurements in most cases confirmed various theoretical predictions, notably that the organic materials could be made to display superconductivity or be used in lasers. The findings were published in prominent scientific publications, including the journals &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;, and gained worldwide attention. However, no research group anywhere in the world succeeded in reproducing the results claimed by Schön.

In 2001, he was listed as an author on an average of one newly published research paper every eight days. In the same year, he announced in &quot;Nature&quot; that he had produced a transistor on the molecular scale. Schön claimed to have used a thin layer of organic dye molecules to assemble an electric circuit that, when acted on by an electric current, behaved as a transistor. The implications of his work were significant. It would have been the beginning of a transition from using silicon-based electronics and toward using organic electronics. It would have allowed the continued miniaturization of transistors past the point at which silicon breaks down, which would continue Moore&#x27;s law for much longer than was then predicted. It also would have drastically reduced the cost of electronics.

A major element of Schön&#x27;s work claimed that successful observation of various physical phenomena in organic materials was dependent on the transistor setup. Specifically, Schön claimed to use a thin layer of aluminium oxide which he incorporated into his transistors using laboratory facilities at the University of Konstanz. However, while the equipment and materials used were common in laboratories all over the world, none succeeded in preparing aluminium oxide layers of similar quality to the ones claimed by Schön.

==Allegations and investigation==
Soon after Schön published his work on single-molecule semiconductors, others in the physics community alleged that his data contained anomalies. Julia Hsu and Lynn Loo originally noticed problems with Schön&#x27;s paper describing the assembly of molecular transistors while attempting to patent research concerning lithography, realizing that Schön had duplicated some numbers. Hsu and Loo had attempted initial experiments to gather evidence for their patent but relied on the scientific outcomes of Schön&#x27;s work. It was not until April 19, 2002, when Loo and Hsu were meeting with their patent lawyer John McCabe, that they noticed the duplicated data. Hsu and Loo both contacted Robert Willett, who then contacted one of his old postdoctoral students, Lydia Sohn, telling her to look out for a correction in one of Schön&#x27;s papers. Sohn, then of Princeton University, noticed that two experiments carried out at very different temperatures had identical noise. When the editors of &quot;Nature&quot; mentioned this to Schön, he claimed to have accidentally submitted the same graph twice. Paul McEuen of Cornell University then found the same noise in a paper describing a third experiment. More research by McEuen, Sohn, Loo, and other physicists revealed a number of examples of duplicate data in Schön&#x27;s work. McEuen gathered the six most convincing pieces of evidence regarding Schön&#x27;s fabrication of data he could find, and sent it to Schön, John A. Rogers, Bertram Batlogg, and editors from the journals &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;. In response, Lucent Technologies (which managed Bell Labs) soon began a formal investigation.

During May 2002, Bell Labs established a five-person committee to investigate, with Malcolm R. Beasley from Stanford University as chair. The remaining four members were Supriyo Datta of Purdue University, Herbert Kogelnik of Bell Labs, Herbert Kroemer of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Don Monroe of Agere Systems. The committee obtained information from all of Schön&#x27;s coauthors and interviewed the three principal ones (Zhenan Bao, Bertram Batlogg and Christian Kloc). The committee found that none of the three authors ever saw Schön take measurements from his devices in real time. It examined electronic drafts of the disputed articles, which included processed numeric data. The committee requested copies of the raw data, but found that Schön had kept no laboratory notebooks. His raw data files had been erased from his computer. According to Schön, the files were erased because his computer had limited hard drive space. Additionally, all of his experimental samples, working, and non-working devices had either been discarded or damaged beyond repair, so the committee was unable to conduct examinations of those.

On September 25, 2002, the committee released its report publicly. The report contained details of 24 allegations of misconduct on Schön&#x27;s part. They found evidence of scientific misconduct in at least 16 of them, while the remaining 8 were either unrelated to publications or were &quot;troubling&quot;, but lacked compelling evidence of misconduct. They found that whole data sets had been reused for a number of different experiments. They also found that some of his graphs, which had purportedly been plotted from experimental data, had instead been produced using mathematical functions.

The report found that all of the misdeeds had been performed by Schön alone. All of the coauthors (including Bertram Batlogg, who was the head of the team) were exonerated of scientific misconduct. However, the report was critical of whether or not the coauthors were sufficiently critical in questioning and validating the results of Schön&#x27;s papers. This caused widespread debate in the scientific community on how the blame for misconduct should be distributed among co-authors, particularly when they share a significant part of the credit.

==Aftermath and sanctions==
Schön acknowledged that the data were incorrect in many of these articles. He claimed that the substitutions could have occurred by honest mistake. He omitted some data and stated that he did so to show more convincing evidence for behavior that he observed. However, he also claimed that he had observed genuine physical effects. 

Researchers at Delft University of Technology and the Thomas J. Watson Research Center have since performed experiments similar to Schön&#x27;s, without achieving similar results. Even before the allegations had become public, several research groups had tried to reproduce most of his spectacular results with respect to the topic of the physics of organic molecular materials, without success.

In June 2004 the University of Konstanz issued a press release stating that Schön&#x27;s doctoral degree had been revoked due to &quot;dishonourable conduct&quot;. Department of Physics spokesman Wolfgang Dieterich termed the affair the &quot;biggest fraud in physics in the last 50 years&quot; and said that the &quot;credibility of science had been brought into disrepute&quot;. Schön appealed the ruling, but on October 28, 2009, it was upheld by the university. In response, Schön sued the University of Konstanz and appeared in court to testify on September 23, 2010. The court overturned the decision on September 27, 2010. However, in November 2010 the university acted to appeal the court&#x27;s ruling. The state court ruled in September 2011 that the university was correct in revoking his doctorate. The Federal Administrative Court sustained the state court&#x27;s decision in July 2013, and the Federal Constitutional Court confirmed it in September 2014. The FCC declined to hear Schön&#x27;s further complaint.

In October 2004, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, the German Research Foundation) Joint Committee announced sanctions against him. Schön was deprived of his right to vote in DFG elections or serve on DFG committees for an eight-year period. During that period, Schön was also unable to serve as a peer reviewer or apply for DFG funds.

Schön returned to Germany and accepted a job with a company as a process engineer.
