<text>The Junkers ( ; ) were members of the landed nobility in Prussia. They owned great estates that were maintained and worked by peasants with few rights. These estates often lay in the countryside outside of major cities or towns. They were an important factor in Prussian and, after 1871, German military, political and diplomatic leadership. The most famous Junker was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck held power in Germany from 1871 to 1890 as Chancellor of the German Empire. He was removed from power by Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Many Junkers lived in the eastern provinces that were annexed by either Poland or the Soviet Union after World War II. Junkers fled or were expelled alongside other German-speaking populations by the incoming Polish and Soviet administrations, and their lands were confiscated. In western and southern Germany, the land was often owned by small independent farmers or a mixture of small farmers and estate owners, and this system was often contrasted with the dominance of the large estate owners of the east. Before World War II, the dividing line was often drawn at the river Elbe which was also roughly the western boundary of Slavic settlement by the Wends in the so-called Germania Slavica prior to &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;. The term for the junker dominated East was thus &quot;Ostelbien&quot; or East Elbia. They played a prominent role in repressing the liberal movement in Germany.

==Origins==

&quot;Junker&quot; is derived from Middle High German &quot;Juncherre&quot;, meaning &quot;young nobleman&quot; or otherwise &quot;young lord&quot; (derivation of &quot;jung&quot; and &quot;Herr&quot;), and originally was the title of members of the higher &quot;edelfrei&quot; (immediate) nobility without or before the accolade. It evolved to a general denotation of a young or lesser noble, often poor and politically insignificant, understood as &quot;country squire&quot; (cf. Martin Luther&#x27;s disguise as &quot;Junker Jörg&quot; at the Wartburg; he would later mock King Henry VIII of England as &quot;Juncker Heintz&quot;). As part of the nobility, many Junker families only had prepositions such as &quot;von&quot; or &quot;zu&quot; before their family names without further ranks. The abbreviation of the title is Jkr., most often placed before the given name and titles, for example: Jkr. Heinrich von Hohenberg. The female equivalent &quot;Junkfrau&quot; (Jkfr.) was used only sporadically. In some cases, the honorific Jkr. was also used for &quot;Freiherren&quot; (Barons) and &quot;Grafen&quot; (Counts).

A good number of poorer Junkers took up careers as soldiers (&quot;Fahnenjunker&quot;), mercenaries, and officials (&quot;Hofjunker&quot;, &quot;Kammerjunker&quot;) at the court of territorial princes. These families were mostly part of the German medieval &quot;Uradel&quot; and had carried on the colonisation and Christianisation of the northeastern European territories during the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;. Over the centuries, they had become influential commanders and landowners, especially in the lands east of the Elbe River in the Kingdom of Prussia.

As landed aristocrats, the Junkers owned most of the arable land in Prussia. Being the bulwark of the ruling House of Hohenzollern, the Junkers controlled the Prussian Army, leading in political influence and social status, and owning immense estates worked by tenants. These were located especially in the north-eastern half of Germany (i.e. the Prussian provinces of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, West Prussia, East Prussia, and Posen). This was in contrast to the predominantly Catholic southern states such as the Kingdom of Bavaria or the Grand Duchy of Baden, where land was owned by small farms, or the mixed agriculture of the western states like the Grand Duchy of Hesse or even the Prussian Rhine and Westphalian provinces.

Junkers formed a tightly knit elite. Their challenge was how to retain their dominance in an emerging modern state with a growing middle and working class.

==Modern influences==

The Junkers held a virtual monopoly on all agriculture in the part of the German Reich lying east of the River Elbe. Since the Junker estates were necessarily inherited by the eldest son alone, younger sons, all well-educated and with a sense of noble ancestry, turned to the civil and military services, and dominated all higher civil offices, as well as the officer corps. Around 1900 they modernised their farming operations to increase productivity. They sold off less productive land, invested more heavily in new breeds of cattle and pigs, used new fertilisers, increased grain production, and improved productivity per worker. Their political influence achieved the imposition of high tariffs that reduced competition from U.S. grain and meat.

During World War I, Irish nationalist MP Tom Kettle compared the Anglo-Irish landlord class to the Prussian Junkers, saying, &quot;England goes to fight for liberty in Europe and for junkerdom in Ireland.&quot;

Their political influence extended from the German Empire of 1871–1918 through the Weimar Republic of 1919–1933. It was said that &quot;if Prussia ruled Germany, the Junkers ruled Prussia, and through it the Empire itself&quot;. A policy known as &quot;Osthilfe&quot; (&quot;Help for the East&quot;) granted Junkers 500,000,000 marks in subsidies to help pay for certain debts and to improve equipment. Junkers continued to demand and receive more and more subsidies, which gave them more money in their pockets, thus resulting in political power. Junkers exploited a monopoly on grain by storing it to drive up the price. As more money was profited, they were able to control political offices. Junkers were able to force people to continue paying more money for their product, while keeping who they wanted in office. Through the controlling of politics behind a veil, Junkers were able to influence politicians to create a law that prohibited collecting of debts from agrarians, thus pocketing even more money and strengthening their power.

Supporting monarchism and military traditions, Junkers were seen as reactionary, anti-democratic, and protectionist by liberals and Socialists, as they had sided with the conservative monarchist forces during the Revolution of 1848. Their political interests were served by the German Conservative Party in the Reichstag and the extraparliamentary Agriculturists&#x27; League (&quot;Bund der Landwirte&quot;). This political class held tremendous power over industrial classes and government alike, especially through the Prussian three-class franchise. When German chancellor Leo von Caprivi in the 1890s reduced the protective duties on imports of grain, these landed magnates demanded and obtained his dismissal; and in 1902, they brought about a restoration of such duties on foodstuffs as would keep the prices of their own products at a high level.

&quot;Junker&quot; acquired its current and often pejorative sense during the 19th-century disputes over the domestic policies of the German Empire. The term was used by sociologists such as Max Weber and was even adopted by members of the landed class themselves. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was a noted Junker, though his family hailed from the Altmark region west of the Elbe. After World War I many Prussian agriculturists gathered in the national conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). The term was also applied to Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, lord of Neudeck in West Prussia, and to the &quot;camarilla&quot; around him urging the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, personified by men like Hindenburg&#x27;s son Oskar and his West Prussian &quot;neighbour&quot; Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, who played a vital role in the &quot;Osthilfe&quot; scandal of 1932/33.

Many World War II field marshals were also members of the Junkers, most notably Gerd von Rundstedt, Fedor von Bock, and Erich von Manstein. Many Junkers used forced labourers from Poland and the Soviet Union. However, Helmuth James Graf von Moltke formed the Kreisau Circle as part of the resistance to Nazi rule, and as World War II turned against Nazi Germany, several senior Junkers in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; participated in Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg&#x27;s assassination attempt of 20 July 1944. Fifty-eight of them either were executed when the plot failed, among them Erwin von Witzleben and Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort, or committed suicide like Henning von Tresckow. During the advance of the Red Army in the closing months of the war and subsequently, most Junkers had to flee from the eastern territories that were turned over to the re-established Republic of Poland with the implementation of the Oder–Neisse line according to the Potsdam Agreement.

==&quot;Bodenreform&quot;==

After World War II, during the communist &quot;Bodenreform&quot; (land reform) of September 1945 in the Soviet Occupation Zone, later East Germany, all private property exceeding an area of was expropriated, and then predominantly allocated to &#x27;New Farmers&#x27; on condition that they continued farming them. As most of these large estates, especially in Brandenburg and Western Pomerania, had belonged to Junkers, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany promoted their plans with East German President Wilhelm Pieck&#x27;s slogan &quot;Junkerland in Bauernhand!&quot; (&quot;Junker land into farmer&#x27;s hand!&quot;). The former owners were accused of war crimes and involvement in the Nazi regime by the Soviet Military Administration and the SED, with many of them being arrested, brutally beaten and interned in NKVD special camps (&quot;Speziallager&quot;), while their property was plundered and the manor houses demolished. Some were executed. Many women were raped. From 1952 these individual farms were pressured by a variety of means to join together as collectives and incorporated into &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaften&quot; (&quot;agricultural production comradeships&quot;, LPG) or nationalised as &quot;Volkseigene Güter&quot; (&quot;publicly owned estates&quot;, VEG).

After German reunification, some Junkers tried to regain their former estates through civil lawsuits, but the German courts have upheld the land reforms and rebuffed claims to full compensation, confirming the legal validity of the terms within the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (Two Plus Four Agreement) (and incorporated into the Basic Law of the Federal Republic), by which expropriations of land under Soviet occupation were irreversible. The last decisive case was the unsuccessful lawsuit of Prince Ernst August of Hanover in September 2006, when the Federal Administrative Court decided that the prince had no right to compensation for the disseized estates of the House of Hanover around Blankenburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt. Other families, however, have quietly purchased or leased back their ancestral homes from the current owners (often the German federal government in its role as trustee). A petition for official rehabilitation of the ousted landowners was rejected by the German Bundestag in 2008.

<text>A turban (from Persian دولبند‌, &quot;dolband&quot;; via Middle French &quot;turbant&quot;) is a type of headwear based on cloth winding. Featuring many variations, it is worn as customary headwear by people of various cultures. Communities with prominent turban-wearing traditions can be found in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Africa, West Africa, East Africa, and amongst some Turkic peoples in Russia.

A keski is a type of turban, a long piece of cloth roughly half the length of a traditional &quot;single turban&quot;, but not cut and sewn to make a double-width &quot;Double Turban&quot; (or Double Patti).

Wearing turbans is common among Sikh men (Dastar), and infrequently women. They are also worn by Hindu monks. The headgear also serves as a religious observance, including among Shia Muslims, who regard turban-wearing as &quot;Sunnah mu’akkadah&quot; (confirmed tradition). The turban is also the traditional headdress of Sufi scholars. Muslim men might wear the turban (Imama) during prayer. Additionally, turbans have often been worn by nobility, regardless of religious background.

Turbans come in a variety of styles, and the method of wrapping can vary. Some turbans are simple and functional, while others are elaborate and serve ceremonial or formal purposes. The way a turban is tied can indicate the wearer&#x27;s social or marital status, religious affiliation, or regional identity. Aside from cultural and religious significance, turbans are also practical headwear. They provide protection from the sun, dust, and wind. In some regions with hot climates, turbans can help keep the head cool.

==History==
The earliest depiction of a turban can be found on a Mesopotamian sculpture dating back to 2350 B.C. A style of turban called a &quot;phakeolis&quot; continued to be worn in that region by soldiers of the Byzantine army in the period 400–600, as well as by Byzantine civilians as depicted in Greek frescoes from the 10th century in the province of Cappadocia in modern Turkey, where it was still worn by their Greek-speaking descendants in the early 20th century. The Islamic prophet, Muhammad, who lived 570–632, wore an Imama turban. The style of turban he introduced was a cap with a cloth tied around it; this headwear is known as &quot;Imama&quot; and was emulated by Muslim kings and scholars throughout history. Shia clerics today wear white turbans unless they are descendants of Muhammad or sayyid, in which case they wear a black turban. Many Muslim men choose to wear green, because it represents paradise, especially among followers of Sufism. In parts of North Africa, where blue is common, the shade of a turban can signify the tribe of the wearer.

==National styles==
Contemporary turbans come in many shapes, sizes and colours. Turban wearers in North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, and Philippines (Sulu) usually wind it anew for each wearing, using long strips of cloth. The cloth is usually under five meters in length. Some elaborate South Asian turbans may also be permanently formed and sewn to a foundation. Turbans can be very large or quite modest depending upon region and culture.

===East Africa===
Turbans are commonly worn in East Africa by Muslim clerics, as well as Ethiopian Orthodox Christian priests. The headwrap has a long presence in the region, where it was frequently sported by Sultans, Wazirs, and other aristocratic and court officials. Among these nobles are the Somali Sultans Deria Hassan of the Isaaq Sultanate, Mohamoud Ali Shire of the Warsangali, Osman Mahamuud of the Majeerteen Sultanate, and Yusuf Ali Kenadid and Ali Yusuf Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo. Prominent historical Islamic leaders in the region that are known to have worn turbans include Sheikh Abadir Umar Ar-Rida. It is typically worn with a maccawiis (sarong) or a jellabiya.

Among Tumbuka nobility in Malawi and Zambia, black turbans (mphumphu) in various styles are worn by the king Chikulamayembe and all chiefs below him. These turbans thus function as crowns. The practice of Tumbuka nobles wearing black turbans dates back to the late 18th century when a Swahili/Nyamwezi trades man gifted all chiefs he encouraged in the tumbuka territories black cloth, some of which he would wrap around their heads.

===Arabian Peninsula===
In most countries of the Arabian Peninsula, a plain or checkered scarf (called &quot;ghutrah&quot;, &quot;shumagh&quot; or &quot;chefiyah&quot;), not usually described as a turban is often worn, though the Arabic &quot;Emamah&quot; tradition remains strong in Oman (see Sultan Qaboos of Oman), Sudan and some parts of the Arabian peninsula. In Yemen, the traditional Muslim Imama is worn. The colored turban, &quot;Ghabanah&quot;, is a common inherited cultural turban in the regions of Hijaz, and it still the inhabitants costume of Mecca, Madinah and Jeddah in particular. &quot;Ghabanah&quot; is the heritage uniform headwear for traders and the general community categories of the prestigious and middle-class, with the exception of religious scholars who have had their special turbans distinctiveness predominately white. The Hijazi turbans with different shapes are the extension of the turban of Islamic prophet Muhammad who lived in Mecca and Madinah. There are several types of &quot;Ghabanah&quot;, perhaps the most famous is the yellow (Halabi), made in Aleppo, characterized by different inscriptions, and wrapped on a dome-like hollow taqiyah or a Turkish fez or kalpak cap. Colorful turbans called &quot;Masar&quot; are the national headwear costume in Oman, and also are common in some regions in south of Yemen and Hadhramaut. Moreover, the white &quot;ghutrah&quot; or &quot;shumagh&quot; are commonly wrapped in &quot;Hamdaniyah&quot; style, which is also the shape of turbans in the United Arab Emirates.

==== Afghanistan ====

Turbans are part of the national dress in Afghanistan. In the Uruzgan Province, male government employees are required to wear the Imama. They are used more widely than elsewhere in the Muslim world, and are worn in a wide range of styles and colours. In the country&#x27;s south-east, turbans are wrapped loosely and largely, whereas in Kabul the garment tends to be smaller and tighter. In traditional Afghan society, a related piece of extra cloth called a &quot;patu&quot; serves practical purposes, such as for wrapping oneself against the cold, to sit on, to tie up an animal or to carry water in the cap. Different ethnic groups in Afghanistan wear different lungees with different patterns, way of styling it, fabric, stripes, lengths and colouration. Males of all ethnic backgrounds generally avoid wearing bright-coloured turbans that draw attention to oneself and prefer wearing simple colors that are white, off white, gray, dark blue and black.

Navy blue is a color common more to the Sikh Nihangs, it signifies war and service, while black is associated with resistance, orange with sacrifice and martyrdom, and white with wisdom, old age, death, or peace; however during times of peace, or rallies for peace, people will usually be in war gear, blue. It is also traditionally worn by members of the Taliban.

==== Indian subcontinent ====
In India, the turban is referred to as a &quot;pagri&quot;, meaning the headdress that is worn by men and is manually tied. There are several styles, which are specific to the wearer&#x27;s region or religion, and they vary in shape, size and colour. For example, the Mysore Peta, the Marathi pheta, and the Puneri Pagadi. The pagri is a symbol of honour and respect everywhere it is worn. It is a common practice to honour important guests by offering them one to wear.

Colours are often chosen to suit the occasion or circumstance: for example saffron, associated with valour or sacrifice (martyrdom), is worn during rallies; white, associated with peace, is worn by elders; and pink, associated with spring, is worn during that season or for marriage ceremonies.

In World War II, some soldiers in the Indian Army were required to wear a turban.

In Rajasthan state of India these turbans, known as Pagri or Safa, is a traditional headwear that is an integral part of the state&#x27;s cultural identity. It is typically made from cotton, silk, or a blend of fabrics and can vary in length. The Safa (Parna) is usually around 1 to 4.5 meters long, while the Pagri can be about 10 meters. Some of the most popular turbans in Rajasthan includes Jodhpuri safa.

In Pakistan, the turban is in widespread use, especially among the rural population. It is worn in different styles and colours across the country, varying by region, e.g. in the north of the country, black and white turbans are preferred. The turban most commonly found in Pakistan is white and crestless, and worn commonly in the Pashtun belt, while in rural Punjab and Sindh, it is mostly worn by elders or feudal lords. The turban is called either a &quot;pagri&quot; or &quot;pag&quot; by Punjabis, while the Pashtuns and Sindhi&#x27;s call it &quot;patkay/patko&quot;.

The Baloch people are famous for their large turbans that are worn with both ends hanging from the sides or as a loop that rests above the chest. These turbans are made with many feet of cloth that are wrapped around a cap and are mostly made with white cloth.

In Bangladesh, the turban is known as &quot;pagri&quot;, or &quot;fagri&quot; in Chittagong and Sylhet. The most common colour worn is white, and generally it is the Sufis that wear green turbans. It is also worn by elders in rural areas as a symbol of honour and respect.

The turban in Nepal is commonly worn in rural areas by males. The rural turban is called either a Pagdi or Pheta. It is common among farmers. All types of coloured clothes were used for Pheta. Historically, Gorkhali nobleman used to wear white turban called Shirpau awarded by the King of Nepal. For example; &quot;Sardar&quot; Ram Krishna Kunwar was awarded with 22 pairs of headgear called Shirpau by the Gorkhali monarch &quot;Maharajadhiraj&quot; Prithvi Narayan Shah. It was common among aristocrats in other contemporary kingdoms. Rulers and vassal lords also adapted a crest to the white turban.

=== Southeast Asia ===
==== Indonesia ====

In Indonesia, the turban-styled headdress for men is traditionally called &quot;iket&quot; (from Javanese and Sundanese language). It literally means &#x27;to tie&#x27;, the main way to attach the fabric over the head of the wearer. It is made of a square or rectangular batik cloth that is folded diagonally to form a triangle. Although there are different ways of folding and tying the fabric over the head, and therefore different shapes of &quot;iket&quot;, they can in general show the social level of the wearer and the area of origin. Its origin is not yet clearly identified, however many sources seemed to conclude that the Javanese might be influenced by turban-wearing Gujarati traders who came to Indonesia more than 500 years ago.

In other parts of Java, for practicality the iket has developed into fixed-form headdresses, called &quot;blangkon&quot; in Central Java and Yogyakarta and &quot;bendo&quot; in West Java. In East Java and Bali, the headdress is still made in traditional way and it is called &quot;udeng&quot;. The batik cloth is made stiff through a process of molding, attaching to stiff paper, and sewing. Similar to &quot;iket, blangkon&quot; and &quot;bendo&quot; come with some variations of shapes based on the areas of origin and the wearer&#x27;s social rank.

==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, the turban has a long history associated with native Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) cultures, and reinforced with significant cultural influences from the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia (especially Java, Borneo and Sumatra), India, Arabia, China, and Persia, through the different epochs of Philippine history.

The most common turban worn by Muslim Filipino women is called the &quot;kombong&quot;, the traditional style of hijab by Muslim women in the Davao area of Mindanao (associated with Maranao, Maguindanao, and Iranun speakers). The kombong is worn as a headwrap-turban, and is paired with the tudong or headscarf, which is ordinarily draped over the chest or shoulder, but worn over the top of the kombong for Islamic prayer, or for providing extra veiling when out of the house or barangay. A white kombong signifies that its wearer has been on the pilgrimage to Makkah, known as Hajj. The wearer of the white kombong will hence be referred to as Hadja, a title given to any Muslim woman who has been on the Hajj.

For men, the most common turban worn is called a &quot;putong&quot;, &quot;potong&quot; or &quot;pudong&quot;. The &quot;putong&quot; was historically worn by men of nearly all major ethnolinguisitc groups in the country, such as the Bisaya, Tagalog and Ilocano, before the mid-17th century, but had waned in lieu of the western hat since the coming of Catholicism in the north and subsequent colonization under Spanish and then American rule. In the precolonial period, pudong were dyed into different distinct colors to signify the social caste of its wearer. Blue was worn for the maginoo nobility class only, red putong for the maharlika warrior class, and other colors like yellow or natural hue for the timawa freeman/raiding caste, and alipin slave castes, respectively.

Today, the turban is worn primarily by Muslim Filipino men, especially by Imams and members of the ulama (Islamic scholars), but is also worn by non-Muslim groups too. Among Muslims, the putong can signify the status of its wearer. Muslim men and imams who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage have traditionally opted to wear the keffiyeh as a putong instead. This is usually bought in Saudi Arabia before returning to the Philippines, in order to signify that they are Hajji. This practice has waned in recent years due to younger jihadist militant groups in the south of the country using keffiyeh as signifiers that they are members of the extremist takfiri groups.

The pre-colonial item of clothing is also worn by non-Muslim Lumad and Cordilleran chiefs and upper class individuals in times of celebration or for specific rituals. These putong or turbans can be ornately woven or designed, and act as a status symbol for the wearer.

In the southern part of the country, in the Sulu archipelago, Tausug and Yakan men wear the pis syabit, an ornate headscarf worn in a manner similar to a turban or bandana. Larger pis syabit are turban like, whereas smaller pis resemble bandanas. As with the other putong found in the Philippines, the size or visual design of the pis indicates the social-status or caste of its wearer.

On some Babuyan islands in the far north of the country, the head of the household wears a white turban, the younger males wear a red turban after their 13th birthday. The three chiefs all wear yellow turbans. It no longer has religious significance and the origin dates back to the end of the Tondo era (circa 900s – 1589). Most Babuyan settlers fled the Philippines in 1589 when Spain began to invade the Philippines. The turban was made from a type of bark cloth but now is made from cotton or silk brought over from the Philippines mainland. The turban style head dress is then cut and wrapped around the head, then tucked in front.

==== Vietnam ====


Alongside a variety of hats, turbans were also worn by the majority ethnic Vietnamese, called &quot;khăn vấn&quot; or &quot;khăn đóng&quot; in Vietnamese. Initially, they were pieces of fabric that had to be coiled every time, but starting in the 20th century, they were replaced with ready-to-wear versions already coiled. The khăn vấn was believed to have been influenced by the Cham sometime during the 18th century though similar turbans are worn by surrounding ethnic groups in Northern Vietnam and Southern China, such as the Zhuang, Hmong, and Yi people.

=== Europe ===
==== United Kingdom ====

In the United Kingdom, turbans have been worn by men and women since the sixth century without ever becoming very common. Poet Alexander Pope is sometimes depicted wearing a turban, as were other notable men seen in contemporary paintings and illustrations. The common use of turbans on less formal occasions, among gentlemen at the time, reflects that their heads were closely cropped, or shaved, to allow the wearing of the elaborate wigs that were the fashion in Europe in the century from about 1650 to 1750, and when wigs were off, some kind of head cover was useful. Hence, the turban.

Now that hats are infrequently worn, turbans too are relatively uncommon. They are worn primarily by women of West Indian descent, Karinas. Some women wear them to make a statement of individuality, such as the British social entrepreneur Camila Batmanghelidjh, who usually wore a colourful matching turban and robe.

==== Greece ====
In Greece, specifically the island of Crete, the men traditionally wear a lightly knitted turban known as a &quot;sariki&quot;. The headwrap&#x27;s name is borrowed from &quot;sarık&quot;, the Turkish word for turban. Today, it may be more commonly known as a &quot;kritiko mandili&quot; (Cretan kerchief). It is only found in the folklore Cretan dress and not amongst the population, with the exception of older men in remoter, mountainous villages.

===Fiji===
iTaukei indigenous chiefs and priests were known to have worn &quot;masi&quot; (barkcloth) coverings around their head similar to a turban, called an &quot;i-sala&quot;. However, most of the bulk and shape of the &quot;i-sala&quot; came from the bushy hair under the cloth.

===Armenia===
Though not common in daily apparel, turbans are sometimes worn by men ceremonially (often with beards), as a symbol of national identity during celebrations and festivals. However, before Armenia became a Christian nation, turbans were a common part of the daily apparel, just as in other Middle Eastern countries.

===Other===
On the Swahili Coast, turbans were frequently worn by the ruling Omani Sultans of Zanzibar and their retinue.

Tuareg Berbers, and some northern Berbers, Sahrawi, Songhai, Wodaabe, Fulani, and Hausa peoples of North and West Africa wear varieties of turbans. Tuareg Berbers often veil the face to block dust. This Tuareg-Berber turban is known as a tagelmust, and is often blue. The Bedouin tribes in North Africa sometimes wear brown-beige, white or orange turbans. Colombian politician Piedad Cordoba was known to wear turbans (or a similar headgear). Her use of turbans had made her so distinguishable to the point of having earned the nickname &quot;the lady with the turban&quot; in Colombian popular culture.

Kurdish people wear a turban, which they call a &quot;jamadani&quot;. It is worn in many different ways across Iraqi Kurdistan depending on the style of the locality; e.g. the Barzani Kurds are a tribe which wears the turban in a colour (red and white) and style which is typical of their clan. In most parts of South Kurdistan a black-white pattern is used for Jamadani. Mostly, Kurdish turbans consist of a length of striped cloth known as &quot;kolāḡī&quot; which is wound around a conical hat; the tassels that border the kolāḡī are allowed to hang down over the face. In modern times, many Kurds use black and white Ghutra and roll them into turbans.

Turbans have also been a type of headwear worn by women in Western countries. The wearing of such turbans by women in Western societies is less common than it was earlier in the 20th century. They are usually sewn to a foundation, so that they can be donned or removed easily. Turbans are also sometimes donned to protect hair or as a headwrap for women following cancer treatments that cause hair loss. They can also be tied together to form a rope in emergency rescue situations. In popular culture, turbans are also sometimes worn as a fashion statement. For example, American rapper Yeat wears turbans often while being photographed and filmed in public. He also has a song titled &quot;Turban&quot;.

==In religion==
===Sikhism===

The Sikh turban, known mainly as the &quot;dastar&quot; but also the &quot;dumalla&quot;, is used to show others that they represent the embodiment of Sikh teachings, the love of the Guru and dogma to do good deeds. The Gurus ensured that both men and women are able to wear a turban, which shows another action of equality. Other Purposes of the turban include protecting Sikhs&#x27; long unshorn hair and keeping it clean.

Sikhs do not cut their hair, as a religious observance. The turban protects the hair and keeps it clean. As Sikhs form 1.7% of India&#x27;s population and 1.5% of Canada&#x27;s population, their turbans help identify them. When he institutionalized the turban as a part of the Sikh identity, Guru Gobind Singh said, &quot;My Sikh will be recognized among millions&quot;.

Turbans were formerly associated with the upper class, and many men in the cultural elite still wear turbans. This distinction between the turban-wearing upper class (Sardars) and commoners promoted segregation and elitism. In order to eliminate the class system associated with turbans, Guru Gobind Singh declared each and every Sikh a Sardar.

Modern Sikh men mainly wear four kinds of turban: Vattan Wali Turban, Amritsar Shahi Turban, Barnala Shahi and Taksali Dumala. The more traditional Turban styles are the Darbara Singh Dummala, Dastar Bunga (the original turban of the Khalsa) and the Puratan Nok Pagg.

The most common turban colors worn by Sikhs are blue, white and black, although other colors are popular as well. Blue and yellow are particularly prestigious and tend to be worn on religious events such as Vaisakhi. Meanings of the turbans are that the white turban means a saintly person leading an exemplary life, and an off-shade color of white means someone is learning in the Sikh religion. The blue turban signifies a mind as broad as the sky with no place for prejudice. The black turban serves as a reminder of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, and represents humility. The Basanti or yellow turbans are associated with the revolutionary movement, Sardar Bhagat Singh also wore a yellow turban for this reason. Royal blue is usually worn by those who are learned in the Sikh religion and are patriotic about their traditions and culture. The colour green signifies farmers. The orange turban means courage and wisdom. The colour Gold symbolizes a sense of calm and healing that helps with anxiety and clearing the mind which significance derives from the Golden temple.
Akali Nihang Sikhs decorate their blue turbans or Dumalla by wearing small weapons known as shastars in them. The turban&#x27;s color may reflect association with a particular group of Sikhs, although none of the popular turban colors are exclusive to any particular group. The preferred color of the Sikh wedding is pink. All shades of this color from magenta to baby pink is used by families for the joyful occasion. Some prefer red, maroon or orange turbans for the weddings, but pink is so far the most popular. Turban colors are generally a matter of personal choice in Sikhism, with many Sikh men choosing colors based on fashion or taste, sometimes to match clothes. There are traditions associated with some colours, for instance orange and black are often worn at political protest rallies whilst red and pink turbans are worn at weddings and other celebratory events.

===Christianity===
In Kenya, the Akurinu, a Christian denomination, wear turbans as religious headgear. The official name of the denomination is The Kenya Foundation of the Prophets Church, or else Holy Ghost Church. Both men and women wear white turbans; children wear tunics. Some Oriental Orthodox churches such as the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church include turbans in the vestments for the priest.

The origin of the word &quot;akurinu&quot; is not clear. It is said by some to come from the Kikuyu question ‘&quot;Mukuri-ni&quot;’ which translates to ‘who is the redeemer?’. Others say that it comes from the growling sounds made by early adherents to the sect when possessed by the spirit, an act described as &quot;gukurina&quot;. In his book &quot;Facing Mt. Kenya&quot;, Jomo Kenyatta states that the &quot;akurinu&quot; referred to themselves as Arooti(dreamers), people of God.

The &quot;akurinu&quot; identify Joseph Ng’ang’a as the founder of the sect. It was Ng’ang’a who ascended Mount Kenya (then known as Mount Kirinyaga) with the first four akurinu prophets - Joseph Kanini, Henry Maina, Philip Mukubwa, and Lilian Njeru. It was on this ascension that the &quot;akurinu&quot; say Njeru was instructed to remove all adornments she had worn, throw them into River Nyamindi, and cover her hair. They also claim to have been instructed by God to lift their hands in the air as they pray. These two practices form an integral part of &quot;akurinu&quot; religious beliefs today.

===Islam===
In Islamic cultures, some men wear a turban-style headdress in emulation of Muhammad who is believed to have worn a black or white turban. It is sometimes called an Imama. The head wraps are worn in different ways and called by different names depending on the region and culture. Examples include ( &quot;`emãmah&quot;) in Arabic, and the Dastar () in Persian. The most preferred style is the elliptic cylindrical headwrap, with the tail hanging behind.

In Shi&#x27;a Islam, a black head wrap around a small white cap is worn by descendants of Muhammad called Sayyids, and white turbans by other well-educated persons and scholars. Sufi Muslims often wear a green head wrap around a small cap or the green head wrap alone. Members of the Dawat-e-Islami movement wear green turbans, whereas members of Sunni Dawate Islami (which broke away from Dawat-e-Islami in 1992) wear white turbans.

In Sudan, large white headdresses connote high social status. In India and Pakistan the cap is called a topi. Women of Islam typically do not wear turbans, as it is typically considered part of a man&#x27;s dress, while women do typically cover their hair as part of hijab.

However, just as some Muslim women wear no headcovering, some modern Muslim women wear a turban style covering. Although it is still not as widely accepted by the more conservative Islamic communities.

===Judaism===
The traditional Jewish turban is known as a sudra. When the Jewish High Priest served in the Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem, he wore a head covering called &quot;mitznefet&quot; מִצְנֶפֶת. This word has been translated as &quot;mitre&quot; (KJV) or &quot;headdress&quot;. It was most likely a turban, as the word comes from a root meaning &#x27;to wrap&#x27;.

In the Hebrew Bible, the turban worn by the High Priest was much larger than the head coverings of the priests and wound to make a broad, flat-topped shape resembling the blossom of a flower. The head covering of the priests was different, being wound to form a cone, called a &quot;migbahat&quot;.

The priestly crown (Hebrew &quot;tzitz&quot; צִיץ &quot;blossom&quot;, &quot;flower&quot;) was attached to the turban by means of two sets of blue cords: one going over the top of the head and the other around the sides of the head at the level of the ears (Exodus 39:31).

According to the Talmud, the wearing of the turban atoned for the sin of haughtiness on the part of the Children of Israel (B. Zevachim 88b).

The Jews who lived under Arab rule during the Middle Ages, notably in Islamic Spain, wore turbans and headwear not too different from their Muslim counterparts.

The Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, also known as Rishon LeZion customarily wears a turban (mitznefet).

Some married Jewish women wear mitpaḥats as an act of modesty.

=== Mandaeism ===
Mandaean priests wear white turbans called &quot;burzinqa&quot;.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, many Rajputs wear it due to culture. It is called a Pheta. It is a cultural practice driven by the harsh summer months in India especially in the state of Rajasthan. It is also worn by the Gurjars of Rajasthan. Apart from turban; there are several other headgears and also different types of turbans used in different parts of India and people wear them when going out especially in villages.

===Rastafari===
Members of the Bobo Ashanti mansion of the Rastafari movement keep their hair and beards, mainly with their hair in dreadlocks, and they have been wearing turbans over their dreadlocks, which are not to be removed publicly or even not at all, so as to protect and keep their dreadlocks clean. This is called a Rasta headwrap. Along with the turban, they have also been wearing robes since their founding in the 1950s, Since they are a relatively small population, it makes them more distinctive in appearance in Jamaica and elsewhere.

<text>Larry Richard Csonka (; born December 25, 1946) is an American former professional football fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Miami Dolphins for the majority of his career, along with the New York Giants for three years. He also had a short stint with the Memphis Southmen in the WFL. Nicknamed &quot;Zonk&quot;, Csonka is widely regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time. Csonka is mostly remembered for his success during his tenure with the Dolphins, which included being a member of their 17–0 perfect season in 1972, and winning Super Bowl championships in 1972 and 1973, the latter of which he was named Super Bowl MVP when he ran for a then-record 145 yards. He was also a commentator for the original run of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;.

A five-time Pro Bowler, and three-time first-team All-Pro, Csonka remains to this day as the Miami Dolphins franchise&#x27;s all-time leading rusher with 6,737 yards and 53 touchdowns. In his last year with the Dolphins in 1979, Csonka also won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. Csonka was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987. Csonka is also currently one of three former Miami Dolphins to have his jersey number (#39) retired—alongside Bob Griese (#12, 1985) and Dan Marino (#13, 2000) -- with his being the most recent, in 2002.

==Early life==
One of six children, Csonka was born in the Akron suburb of Stow, Ohio, where he was raised on a farm by his Hungarian family.

Csonka began his football career at Stow High School in Stow, Ohio. He was the starting fullback on the 1962 Stow Bulldogs football team that won the Metropolitan League of the Akron-area championship under coach Dick Fortner. Csonka played for Stow from 1960 to 1963. He was also a wrestler while in high school.

Csonka would become a running back by accident. Because of his size, he played defensive end on the varsity team as a sophomore. In the last game that year, he was sent in as a substitute on the kickoff return team. The ball just happened to go to him and he took off running with it. Csonka wrote,

:I ran over two tacklers before I realized what I was doing. I didn&#x27;t score or save the game, but I got a tremendous feeling carrying the ball. I was thrashing around, trying to run six ways at once. I loved it. I knew then that I wanted to run with the ball.

==College career==
Csonka was recruited by Clemson, Iowa, Vanderbilt, and Syracuse. He chose Syracuse, where he played middle linebacker in his first season before being switched to fullback from 1965 to 1967, the position where he was named an All-American. He established many of the school&#x27;s rushing records, breaking several that had been held by Ernie Davis, Jim Nance, Floyd Little, and Jim Brown.

In his three seasons at Syracuse, Csonka rushed for a school-record 2,934 yards, rushed for 100 yards in 14 different games, and averaged 4.9 yards per carry. From 1965 to 1967, he ranked 19th, ninth and fifth in the nation in rushing. He was the Most Valuable Player in the East–West Shrine Game, the Hula Bowl, and the College All-Star Game. In 1989, he was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

===Miami and the Super Bowl years===
Csonka was the No. 1 pick by the American Football League&#x27;s Miami Dolphins in the 1968 Common Draft, the eighth player and first running back drafted in the first round. He signed a three-year contract that paid him a signing bonus of $34,000 () and a car, and a salary of $20,000 (), then $25,000 (), then $30,000 () each year.

Csonka&#x27;s pro career got off to a shaky start. In the fifth game of the 1968 season, at home against Buffalo, he was knocked out and suffered a concussion when his head hit the ground during a tackle. He spent two days in the hospital. Three weeks later at San Diego, he suffered another concussion, plus a ruptured eardrum and a broken nose. There was talk he might have to give up football. He missed three games in 1968 and three more in 1969. Writes his teammate Nick Buoniconti,

:There was some question [after the 1969 season] whether Csonka would ever play fullback again—not just because of injuries but because he didn&#x27;t play well ... When Shula came in [in 1970] he literally had to teach Csonka how to run with the football. He used to run straight up and down and Shula impressed upon him that he had to lead with his forearm rather than his head. Shula and his backfield coach Carl Taseff basically reengineered Csonka to where he became the Hall of Fame player. Csonka emerged as the offensive leader of the Dolphins ...

Over the next four seasons, Csonka never missed a game, and he led the Dolphins in rushing the next five seasons. Writes teammate Jim Langer, &quot;Csonka had the utmost respect of every player on the team, offense and defense.&quot; By the 1970s he was one of the most feared runners in professional football. Standing and , he was one of the biggest running backs of his day and pounded through the middle of the field with relative ease, often dragging tacklers 5–10 yards. He was described as a bulldozer or battering ram. His running style reminded people of a legendary power runner from the 1930s, Bronko Nagurski. Said Minnesota Vikings linebacker Jeff Siemon after Super Bowl VIII, &quot;It&#x27;s not the collision that gets you. It&#x27;s what happens after you tackle him. His legs are just so strong he keeps moving. He carries you. He&#x27;s a movable weight.&quot; He rarely fumbled the ball or dropped a pass, and he was an excellent blocker.

Stories abound about Csonka&#x27;s toughness. He broke his nose about ten times playing football in high school, college, and the pros, causing it to be permanently deformed, and he would remain in the game with blood pouring out of it. He may be the only running back to receive a personal foul for unnecessary roughness while running the ball, when in a game against the Buffalo Bills in 1970, he knocked out safety John Pitts with a forearm shot that was more like a right cross. In a close game against the Minnesota Vikings in the perfect season of 1972, Csonka was hit in the back by linebacker Roy Winston in a tackle so grotesque it was shown on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Csonka thought his back was broken and he actually crawled off the field. Once on the sideline, he &quot;walked it off&quot; and in a few minutes was back in the game. His return to the game was crucial, as the winning touchdown pass to tight end Jim Mandich was set up by a fake to Csonka. He was named the 10th toughest football player of all time in the 1996 NFL Films production &quot;The NFL&#x27;s 100 Toughest Players&quot;. Dolphins&#x27; offensive line coach Monte Clark was asked about Csonka&#x27;s bruising running style, and he responded, &quot;When Csonka goes on safari, the lions roll up &quot;their&quot; windows.&quot;

The Dolphins had one of professional football&#x27;s best rushing attacks in the early 1970s. The Dolphins led the NFL in rushing in 1971 and 1972, setting a new rushing record in 1972 at 2,960 yards. Csonka&#x27;s 1,117 yards that season combined with Mercury Morris contributing exactly 1,000 yards made them the first 1,000 yard rushing duo in NFL history. That rushing attack led the Dolphins to Super Bowls VI, VII, and VIII, with victories in the last two. Csonka&#x27;s powerful running style set the tone for the ball-control Dolphins. He chose to run through defenders instead of around them, leading to three straight 1,000-yard seasons (1971–1973) and two seasons (1971–1972) in which he averaged more than 5 yards per carry, amazing for a fullback. His 5.4 yards per carry average in 1971 led the NFL. Teammate Bob Kuechenberg said that Csonka was the best back he ever saw for turning a 2-yard gain into a 5-yard gain. &quot;The line got him the start, he got the finish and it added up to 4 or 5 yards every time,&quot; said Kuechenberg. Csonka&#x27;s 1971 season was also the only year in the 1970s that a running back gained over 1,000 rushing yards without a single fumble.

During the 1971 off-season, Csonka starred in the critically well-received off-Broadway play of &quot;Larry Csonka and the Chocolate Factory.” Due to financial backing and Larry&#x27;s contract with the Dolphins barring him from any off-season &quot;strenuous activity&quot;, the play never gained commercial success, but for his efforts Csonka was nominated in the 1972 Obie Award for best Actor, where he eventually lost to Douglas Rain for his role in Vivat!Vivat Regina!

During the 1972 season, the Dolphins became the only team since the AFL–NFL Merger to go undefeated, and Csonka was an instrumental part of the success, rushing for a career-best 1,117 yards. Csonka led all rushers in Super Bowl VII with 112 yards on only 15 carries. Late in the third quarter, Csonka had a run that epitomized his style. After breaking several tackles near the line of scrimmage, he rumbled for 49 yards. Near the end of that run, Washington Redskins cornerback Pat Fischer, who was known as a fearless and gritty tackler, came up to try to tackle Csonka. Instead of trying to avoid Fischer, Csonka actually turned toward him and threw a forearm at him, brushing the 175-pound Fischer aside.

In 1973, Csonka was voted Super Athlete of the Year by the Professional Football Writers Association. That season, the Dolphins won a second straight title and &quot;Zonk&quot;, as he was known, was the Super Bowl VIII MVP. Exploiting brilliant blocking by his offensive line, he rushed 33 times for two touchdowns and a then-record 145 yards.
Csonka and his friend, Dolphins running back Jim Kiick, were known as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The August 7, 1972 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; featured a profile of Csonka and Kiick. This issue has become a collector&#x27;s item because of the cover photograph of Csonka and Kiick by famed &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; photographer Walter Iooss, with Csonka (inadvertently) making an obscene gesture with the middle finger of his right hand. In 1973, Csonka and Kiick, in collaboration with sportswriter Dave Anderson, wrote a book, &quot;Always on the Run&quot;. (A second edition, with an additional chapter covering the 1973 season, Super Bowl VIII, and their signing with the World Football League was published in 1974.) Csonka and Kiick discuss their childhoods, their college football careers, their sometimes stormy relationship with Don Shula, their experiences as pro football players, and the sometimes outrageous behavior of their teammates. The book provides insight into the history of the Dolphins and the state of pro football in the late 1960s and early and mid-1970s.

===Move to WFL===
In March 1974, he was selected second overall in the WFL Pro Draft. The same month, Csonka, Kiick, and Dolphin wide receiver Paul Warfield, announced they had signed contracts to play with Toronto in the fledgling World Football League starting in 1975. Csonka signed a three-year guaranteed contract for a salary of $1.4 million. While their signings are credited with giving the WFL credibility, the league was plagued by financial problems from its start. The three played for the Memphis Southmen, but Csonka and the others had minimal success and the league folded midway through its second season. Csonka carried the ball 99 times for 421 yards for 1 touchdown for Memphis in 1975.

===Giants and return to NFL===
A free agent again, he joined the New York Giants in 1976, along with Memphis coach John McVay. (The Giants&#x27; head coach at the time was Bill Arnsparger, who had previously been the Dolphins&#x27; defensive coordinator.) He tore ligaments in his knee, prematurely ending his first season there. He blamed the injury in part on Giants Stadium&#x27;s artificial turf, and has been a vocal critic of the surface and its injury potential ever since. (The Giants currently use a newer, more flexible Fieldturf). When the Giants started the season 0–7, Arnsparger was fired and replaced by McVay.

Two seasons later, he was on the field for The Miracle at the Meadowlands, the play that for years epitomized Giants&#x27; fans exasperation with the franchise&#x27;s long-term mediocrity. On November 19, 1978, New York had apparently secured a 17–12 victory over the favored Philadelphia Eagles. However, with 31 seconds left to play and the Eagles out of timeouts, offensive coordinator Bob Gibson overruled quarterback Joe Pisarcik and called for the ball to be handed off to Csonka for a run up the middle, as Gibson felt Pisarcik was risking too much injury falling on the ball in an era before the quarterback kneel to run out the clock was common. However, Pisarcik botched the handoff and Eagles cornerback Herman Edwards returned the fumbled ball 29 yards for the winning touchdown. The Giants went into a tailspin afterwards, and finished 6–10 after a hopeful start.

The Giants let McVay go after the season ended. Csonka&#x27;s contract was up, too, and he returned to Miami the next year. He ran for over 800 yards, his best since their Super Bowl days, and rushed for a career-high 12 touchdowns while catching one more. Csonka won Comeback Player of the Year for his 1979 season. Unable to come to terms with the Dolphins on a new contract, he retired after the year was over.

In his 11 NFL seasons, Csonka carried the ball 1,891 times for 8,081 yards and 64 touchdowns. He also caught 106 passes for 820 yards and four touchdowns. He was among the NFL&#x27;s top 10 ranked players in rushing yards four times, in rushing touchdowns five times, total touchdowns three times and yards from the line of scrimmage once. He earned All-AFC honors four times and was named All-Pro in 1971, 1972, and 1973. He was also selected to play in five Pro Bowls.

Since his retirement, he has become a motivational speaker and has hosted several hunting and fishing shows for the NBC Sports Network (formerly OLN and Versus). Csonka has been featured in many shows, such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and had a role in the 1970s medical drama &quot;Emergency!&quot; He played the part of commander Delaney in the 1976 movie &quot;Midway&quot;. He worked for the United States Football League (USFL) Jacksonville Bulls in the mid-1980s, first as director of scouting and then as general manager. Csonka was also a color analyst for NFL games on NBC in 1988, and an analyst for the syndicated show &quot;American Gladiators&quot; from 1990 to 1993 (seasons 2 through 4).

Csonka was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987 and his #39 was retired by the Miami Dolphins in 2002. He is one of 11 Dolphins (Jim Langer, Bob Griese, Paul Warfield, Larry Little, Dwight Stephenson, Nick Buoniconti, Jason Taylor, Dan Marino, Don Shula and Zach Thomas)
in the Hall of Fame. Csonka was named a member of the Super Bowl Dream Team in an NFL Films production.

Between 1985 and 1990 Csonka started spending time in Alaska, eventually living most of the year in Anchorage. While observing the 1,161-mile (1,962-km) 2005 Iditarod dog sled race he said, &quot;when I was playing and practicing in that heat in July and August in Miami with shoulder pads on, it just vaporized me&quot;.

From 1998 through 2013, Csonka was producer and co-host of Napa&#x27;s &quot;North to Alaska&quot;, before retiring the show. Csonka also did &quot;Csonka Outdoors&quot;, 1998–2005 on ESPN-2 and OLN. In early September 2005, Csonka and five others were returning by boat to the village of Nikolski on Umnak Island in Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands after filming a reindeer hunt on the island for Csonka&#x27;s TV show, &quot;North to Alaska&quot;. The boat was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized. They rode out the storm for 10 hours before a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter could reach them and rescue them one-by-one in a basket.

Csonka and &quot;North to Alaska&quot; co-host Audrey Bradshaw currently live in Wasilla, Alaska. He also maintains a farm in Lisbon, Ohio and operates Goodrich Seafood House in Oak Hill, Florida. Csonka currently appears in television commercials for the Alaska Spine Institute, an Anchorage-based physical rehabilitation center.

In November 2013, Csonka was recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of &quot;Hometown Hall of Famers,&quot; a national program honoring the hometown roots of the sport&#x27;s greatest coaches, players and contributors with special ceremonies and plaque dedication events in local communities. Csonka was presented with a plaque during a ceremony in the Stow High School gym, where the plaque will stay permanently to serve as an inspiration for the school&#x27;s students and athletes.

Csonka played a fictional version of himself in the HBO series &quot;Ballers&quot; and was named head coach of the Miami Dolphins. He also made a cameo with Dolphins legendary former head coach, Don Shula, during a fishing trip.

In 2022, he released a memoir titled &quot;Head On&quot;.

<text>Katharine Kerr (born October 3, 1944) is an American science fiction and fantasy novelist, best known for her series of Celtic-influenced high fantasy novels set in the fictional land of Deverry.

== Biography ==
Katharine Kerr was born in Cleveland, Ohio; her maiden name is Katharine Nancy Brahtin. She describes her family feeling more like &quot;British-in-exile&quot; than American. She describes her inability to spell properly using either the British or American systems as a result of having been taught to read solely with British books. While still a schoolgirl, her family moved to Santa Barbara, California. In 1969, she moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, eventually moving to San Francisco itself. She spent time studying at Stanford University but dropped out in the mid-1960s. She then worked in some low-paying jobs, including work at a post office.

In 1973, she met up with Howard Kerr, an old friend of hers from secondary school; they were married that same year. In 1979, a friend gave Katharine her first fantasy-role playing game. This gift led her to a fascination with the gaming and fantasy field, which in turn led her to write articles for gaming magazines. She spent time as a contributing editor to Dragon magazine and contributed to gaming modules for both TSR, Inc. and Chaosium. She co-authored the adventure &quot;Legacy of Blood&quot; for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as well as adventures for the &quot;Pendragon&quot; role-playing game.

Katharine Kerr now dedicates herself exclusively to fiction.

== Bibliography ==

=== Deverry novels ===

&quot;See Deverry cycle for a synopsis of Deverry.&quot;

The novels of Deverry are perhaps Kerr&#x27;s best-known works. Originally envisioned as a short story or novella, the project grew into a series of sixteen full novels. Kerr has a contract for two additional full novels in the series.

The series is written in a non-linear style: the principal narrative is frequently interrupted by flashbacks to events that occurred decades, or even centuries, before. These flashbacks concern the prior incarnations of characters in the principal narrative, and provide insight into the relationships of the characters in their current incarnations.

Kerr has likened the series to a play, breaking the story into several acts:

* Act one: Deverry
# &quot;Daggerspell&quot; (1986)
# &quot;Darkspell&quot; (1987) – later reissued in an &quot;author&#x27;s definitive edition&quot;

<doc id="275972" wikidata="Q1061151" url="?curid=275972" title="Massif">
<text>A massif () is a principal mountain mass, such as a compact portion of a mountain range, containing one or more summits (e.g. France&#x27;s Massif Central). In mountaineering literature, a massif is frequently used to denote the main mass of an individual mountain.

As a purely scientific term in geology, however, a &quot;massif&quot; is separately and more specifically defined as a section of a planet&#x27;s crust that is demarcated by faults or flexures. In the movement of the crust, a massif tends to retain its internal structure while being displaced as a whole. A massif is a smaller structural unit than a tectonic plate and is considered the fourth-largest driving force in geomorphology.

The word &quot;massif&quot; originates from French (in which the word also means &quot;massive&quot;), where it is used to refer to a large mountain mass or compact group of connected mountains forming an independent portion of a range. The Face on Mars is an example of an extraterrestrial massif. Massifs may also form underwater, as with the Atlantis Massif.

<text>Sticker art (also known as slaps in a graffiti context) is a form of street art in which an image or message is publicly displayed using stickers. These stickers may promote a political agenda, comment on a policy or issue, or comprise a subcategory of graffiti.

Sticker artists use various types of stickers, from eggshell stickers to free paper stickers, such as the United States Postal Service&#x27;s Label 228 or name tags. Part of their popularity in street art comes from being a faster, and therefore safer, option in illegal graffiti.

==History==

The first recognized example of sticker art in the USA is &quot;Andre the giant has a posse&quot; by Shepard Fairey, created in 1989. The first European (and non-American) sticker art project is that by Piermario Ciani, initially started in the 1980s within the Trax project and more intensely starting from 1991, as also documented by a catalogue published in that year.
Solo One was one of the first graffiti artists to use stickers with tags on them in 1999. Since 2000, many graffiti artists and street artists, like Katsu or Barry McGee incorporated stickers in their production, using them as an alternative to tagging and bombing, or as autonomous art projects.

==Creation==
Sticker artists may hand-draw stickers, print them using a commercial printing service or at home with a computer printer and self-adhesive labels, or have them made commercially.

Any kind of blank sticker can be used for sticker art. Both name tags and Label 228s are often used with hand-drawn art, and are quite hard to remove, leaving a white, sticky residue. Eggshell stickers are popular a type of sticker created specifically for street art. They are named because an attempt to remove them results in tiny pieces breaking off, like an eggshell. Eggshell stickers are made of a mixture of paper and plastic which protects them from the elements. Eggshell stickers longevity allows sticker art to be a part of many urban landscapes.

Unlike other forms of graffiti which are created on public surfaces, stickers are portable before being &quot;used&quot; and many graffiti artists (&quot;writers&quot;) trade stickers, and more popular artists sell their stickers. Graffiti shops often have places for writers to exchange stickers, and global stores allow for worldwide sticker exchanges which lets artist have their work put up in places they may never visit themselves.

Sticker art is sometimes a collectable item with some collections being in the 10,000s of stickers. Within graffiti culture, it is considered good manners for collectors to put up at least some of the stickers received in an exchange.

Sticker art exchanges also allow large numbers of artists to collaborate on a single sticker, or multiple stuck together.

==Artists==
Artist Cristina Vanko refers to her &quot;I am Coal&quot; project as &quot;smart vandalism.&quot; Vanko uses stickers to identify objects that are coal-powered, spreading awareness of global climate change.

The artist Cindy Hinant created a series of projects from 2006 to 2009 that combined the tradition of sticker collecting and sticker bombing in works that reflected on feminine representations in popular culture.

<text>Camphor () is a waxy, colorless solid with a strong aroma. It is classified as a terpenoid and a cyclic ketone. It is found in the wood of the camphor laurel (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;), a large evergreen tree found in East Asia; and in the kapur tree (&quot;Dryobalanops&quot; sp.), a tall timber tree from South East Asia. It also occurs in some other related trees in the laurel family, notably &quot;Ocotea usambarensis&quot;. Rosemary leaves (&quot;Rosmarinus officinalis&quot;) contain 0.05 to 0.5% camphor, while camphorweed (&quot;Heterotheca&quot;) contains some 5%. A major source of camphor in Asia is camphor basil (the parent of African blue basil). Camphor can also be synthetically produced from oil of turpentine.

The compound is chiral, existing in two possible enantiomers as shown in the structural diagrams. The structure on the left is the naturally occurring (+)-camphor ((1&quot;R&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-bornan-2-one), while its mirror image shown on the right is the (−)-camphor ((1&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;S&quot;)-bornan-2-one). Camphor has few uses but is of historic significance as a compound that is readily purified from natural sources.

==Etymology==
The word camphor derived in the 14th century from Old , itself from Medieval , from , perhaps through , from apparently from Austronesian &#x27;lime&#x27; (chalk).

In Old Malay, camphor was called , meaning &quot;the chalk of Barus&quot;, referring to Barus, an ancient port near modern Sibolga on the western coast of Sumatra. This port traded in camphor extracted from the Borneo camphor trees (&quot;Dryobalanops aromatica&quot;) that were abundant in the region.

==Production==

===Natural camphor===
(+)-camphor has been produced as a forest product for centuries, condensed from the vapor given off by the roasting of wood chips cut from Camphora officinarum, and later by passing steam through the pulverized wood and condensing the vapors. By the early 19th century most camphor tree reserves had been depleted with the remaining large stands in Japan and Taiwan, with Taiwanese production greatly exceeding Japanese. Camphor was one of the primary resources extracted by Taiwan&#x27;s colonial powers as well as one of the most lucrative. First the Chinese and then the Japanese established monopolies on Taiwanese camphor. In 1868, a British naval force sailed into Anping harbor and the local British representative demanded the end of the Chinese camphor monopoly. After the local imperial representative refused, the British bombarded the town and took the harbor. The &quot;camphor regulations&quot; negotiated between the two sides subsequently saw a brief end to the camphor monopoly.

(-)-camphor occurs naturally in the essential oil of &quot;Matricaria&quot; plants. As a result, it&#x27;s much rarer.

===Synthetic camphor===
Camphor is produced from alpha-pinene, which is abundant in the oils of coniferous trees and can be distilled from turpentine produced as a side product of chemical pulping. With acetic anhydride as the solvent and with catalysis by a strong acid, alpha-pinene is converted to isobornyl acetate. Hydrolysis of this ester gives isoborneol which can be oxidized to give racemic camphor.

A biological enzyme has been proposed for producing only the rare (-) or -camphor. This &quot;EstB&quot; esterase from &quot;Burkholderia gladioli&quot; hydrolyzes only (+)-isobornyl acetate.

==Reactions==
The reactions of camphor have been extensively examined. Some representative transformations include
*sulfonation:

*oxidation with selenium dioxide to camphorquinone . 

Camphor can also be reduced to isoborneol using sodium borohydride.

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis===

In biosynthesis, camphor is produced from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclisation of linaloyl pyrophosphate to bornyl pyrophosphate, followed by hydrolysis to borneol and oxidation to camphor.

==Uses==
The first significant manmade plastics were low-nitrogen (or &quot;soluble&quot;) nitrocellulose (pyroxylin) plastics. In the early decades of the plastics industry, camphor was used in immense quantities as the plasticizer that creates celluloid from nitrocellulose, in nitrocellulose lacquers and other plastics and lacquers.

===Alternative medicine and scent===
Camphor has been used for its scent, as an embalming fluid, as topical medication, as a manufacturing chemical, and in religious ceremonies.
Camphor has been used as a folk medicine over centuries, probably most commonly as a decongestant. Camphor was used in ancient Sumatra to treat sprains, swellings, and inflammation. Camphor also was used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine for various purposes. In Europe, camphor was used after the Black Death era. 

In the 20th century, camphor was used as an analeptic by injection, and to induce seizures in schizophrenic people in an attempt to treat psychosis.

Camphor has limited use in veterinary medicine by intramuscular injection to treat breathing difficulties in horses.

===Topical medication===
Camphor is commonly applied as a topical medication as a skin cream or ointment to relieve itching from insect bites, minor skin irritation, or joint pain. It is absorbed in the skin epidermis, where it stimulates nerve endings sensitive to heat and cold, producing a warm sensation when vigorously applied, or a cool sensation when applied gently, indicating its properties as a counterirritant. The action on nerve endings also induces a slight local analgesia.

===Respiratory aerosol===
Camphor is also used via an aerosol, typically by steam inhalation, sometimes in the form of branded nasal inhaler sticks, to inhibit coughing and relieve upper airway congestion due to the common cold. However, the clinical efficacy of these remedies is challenged.

===Other niche uses===
Camphor is used by marksmen to blacken the front and rear sights of rifles to prevent the sights from reflecting. This is done by setting light to a small amount of camphor, which burns at a relatively low temperature, and using the soot rising from the flame to deposit a coating on a surface held above it. Historically, this soot blackening was also used to coat barograph record charts. A barracks-room rumour possibly derived from an older rumour about saltpetre holds that soldiers in the Islamic Republic of Iran are dosed with camphor in their daily meals in order to repress their libido and prevent homosexual incidents.

===Pest deterrent and preservative===
Camphor is believed to be toxic to insects and is thus sometimes used as a repellent. Camphor is used as an alternative to mothballs. Camphor crystals are sometimes used to prevent damage to insect collections by other small insects. It is kept in clothes used on special occasions and festivals, and also in cupboard corners as a cockroach repellent. The smoke of camphor crystal or camphor incense sticks can be used as an environmentally-friendly mosquito repellent.

Recent studies have indicated that camphor essential oil can be used as an effective fumigant against red fire ants, as it affects the attacking, climbing, and feeding behavior of major and minor workers.

Camphor is also used as an antimicrobial substance. In embalming, camphor oil was one of the ingredients used by ancient Egyptians for mummification.

===Perfume===
In the ancient Arab world, camphor was a common perfume ingredient. The Chinese referred to the best camphor as &quot;dragon&#x27;s brain perfume&quot;, due to its &quot;pungent and portentous aroma&quot; and &quot;centuries of uncertainty over its provenance and mode of origin&quot;.

===Culinary uses===
One of the earliest known recipes for ice cream dating to the Tang dynasty includes camphor as an ingredient. It was used to flavor leavened bread in ancient Egypt. In ancient and medieval Europe, camphor was used as an ingredient in sweets. It was used in a wide variety of both savory and sweet dishes in medieval Arabic language cookbooks, such as &quot;Kitab al-Ṭabikh&quot; compiled by ibn Sayyār al-Warrāq in the 10th century. It also was used in sweet and savory dishes in the &quot;Ni&#x27;matnama&quot;, according to a book written in the late 15th century for the sultans of Mandu. It is a main constituent of a spice known as &quot;edible camphor&quot; (or &quot;kapur&quot;), which may be used in traditional South Indian desserts like Payasam and Chakkarai Pongal.

===Religious rites===

Camphor is widely used in Hindu religious ceremonies. Aarti is performed after placing it on a stand and setting fire to it usually as the last step of puja or devotional worship ritual to one or more deities. Camphor is mentioned in the Quran as being the fragrance of wine given to believers in heaven.

==Toxicity==
Applied on skin, camphor may cause allergic reactions in some people; when ingested by mouth, camphor cream or ointment is poisonous. In high ingested doses, camphor produces symptoms of irritability, disorientation, lethargy, muscle spasms, vomiting, abdominal cramps, convulsions, and seizures. Lethal doses by ingestion in adults are in the range 50–500 mg/kg (orally). Generally, ingestion of two grams causes serious toxicity and four grams is potentially lethal.

Airborne camphor may be toxic if respired by humans. The Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for camphor in ambient air is 2 mg/m3 at exposure time (TWA) not more than 8 hours. 200 mg/m3 is considered a very dangerous concentration (IDLH).

==History of synthetic camphor==
When its use in the nascent chemical industries (discussed below) greatly increased the volume of demand in the late 19th century, potential for changes in supply and in price followed. In 1911 Robert Kennedy Duncan, an industrial chemist and educator, related that the Imperial Japanese government had recently (1907–1908) tried to monopolize the production of natural camphor as a forest product in Asia but that the monopoly was prevented by the development of the total synthesis alternatives, which began in &quot;purely academic and wholly uncommercial&quot; form with Gustav Komppa&#x27;s first report:

This ongoing check on price growth was confirmed in 1942 in a monograph on DuPont&#x27;s history, where William S. Dutton said, &quot;Indispensable in the manufacture of pyroxylin plastics, natural camphor imported from Formosa and selling normally for about 50 cents a pound, reached the high price of $3.75 in 1918 [amid the global trade disruption and high explosives demand that World War I created]. The organic chemists at DuPont replied by synthesizing camphor from the turpentine of southern US pine stumps, with the result that the price of industrial camphor sold in carload lots in 1939 was between 32 cents and 35 cents a pound.&quot;

 The background of Gustaf Komppa&#x27;s synthesis was as follows. In the 19th century, it was known that nitric acid oxidizes camphor into camphoric acid. Haller and Blanc published a semisynthesis of camphor from camphoric acid. Although they demonstrated its structure, they were unable to prove it. The first complete total synthesis of camphoric acid was published by Komppa in 1903. Its inputs were diethyl oxalate and 3,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, which reacted by Claisen condensation to yield diketocamphoric acid. Methylation with methyl iodide and a complicated reduction procedure produced camphoric acid. William Perkin published another synthesis a short time later. Previously, some organic compounds (such as urea) had been synthesized in the laboratory as a proof of concept, but camphor was a scarce natural product with a worldwide demand. Komppa realized this, and began industrial production of camphor in Tainionkoski, Finland, in 1907 (with plenty of competition, as Kennedy Duncan reported).

A different way of synthesis was developed at the same time by Dr. Karl Stephan from Chemische Fabrik auf Actien. This chemist, who had patented a route to synthesize camphene in 1902, found out that borneol or isoborneol could easily be oxidized with permanganate in benzene solution with unprecedentedly high yields of 95+%, and patented it in 1903. The process was efficient enough to compete with natural camphor, and Japan was forced to lower prices in 1907, but the German company still increased its production, reaching 623 tons in 1913, only to be interrupted by WWI.

<text>Marie Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville (; 5 December 1827 – 26 February 1910) was a French historian, philologist and Celtic scholar.

==Career==
He qualified as a lawyer in 1850, and entered a seminary with the intention of becoming a Catholic priest, but his attention turned to French history and in 1851 he left the École des Chartes with the degree of palaeographic archivist. He was placed in control of the departmental archives of Aube, and remained in that position until 1880, when he retired on a pension.

He published several volumes of inventorial abstracts, a &quot;Répertoire archéologique du département&quot; in 1861; a valuable &quot;Histoire des ducs et comtes de Champagne depuis le VIe siècle jusqu&#x27;à la fin du XIe&quot;, which was published between 1859 and 1869 (8 volumes), and in 1880 an instructive monograph, &quot;Les Intendants de Champagne&quot;. Already he had become attracted to the study of the ancient inhabitants of Gaul; in 1870 he brought out an &quot;Étude sur la déclinaison des noms propres dans la langue franque à l&#x27;époque mérovingienne&quot;; and in 1877 a learned work on &quot;Les Premiers habitants de l&#x27;Europe&quot; (2nd edition in 2 vols. 1889 and 1894).

Next he concentrated his efforts on the field of Celtic languages, literature and law, in which he soon became an authority. Appointed in 1882 to the newly founded professorial chair of Celtic at the , he began the &quot;Cours de littérature celtique&quot; in 1908 extended to twelve volumes. For this he himself edited the following works: &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;étude de la littérature celtique&quot; (1883); &quot;L&#x27;Épopée celtique en Irlande&quot; (1892); &quot;Études de droit celtique&quot; (1895); and &quot;Les Principaux auteurs de l&#x27;Antiquité à consulter sur l&#x27;histoire des Celtes&quot; (1902).

He was among the first in France to study the most ancient monuments of Irish literature with a solid philological preparation and without prejudice.

== Personal life ==
He was born at Nancy, son of Charles-Joseph d’Arbois de Jubainville and Henriette de Beaufort de Gellercourt, a couple who were greatly influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He married Melanie de Plante-Wildentag in 1857. After her death, in 1863, he married Charlotte de Pinterville de Cernon with whom he had children, including a son, Paul.

<doc id="275989" wikidata="Q64390" url="?curid=275989" title="Johann Fust">
<text>Johann Fust or Faust ( 1400 – October 30, 1466) was an early German printer.

== Family background ==
Fust was born to a burgher family of Mainz, traceable back to the early thirteenth century. Members of the family held many civil and religious offices.

The name was written &quot;Fust&quot; until 1506, when Peter Schöffer, in dedicating the German translation of Livy to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, called his father-in-law &quot;Faust.&quot; Thenceforward, the family assumed this name. The Fausts of Aschaffenburg, an old and quite distinct family, placed Johann Fust in their pedigree. Johann&#x27;s brother Jacob, a goldsmith, was one of the burgomasters in 1462, when Mainz was stormed and sacked by the troops of Count Adolf II of Nassau, in the course of which he seems to have been killed (suggested by a document dated May 8, 1678).

== Printing ==
Fust, along with his brother, was a member of the goldsmiths&#x27; guild of Strasbourg. Like many medieval goldsmiths, he also functioned as a financier.
Because of his connection with Johannes Gutenberg (died 1468), Fust has been called the inventor of printing, and the instructor as well as the partner of Gutenberg. Some see him as a patron and benefactor who saw the value of Gutenberg&#x27;s discovery and supplied him with the means to implement it, whereas others portray him as a speculator who took advantage of Gutenberg&#x27;s necessity and robbed him of the profits of his invention.
Whatever the truth, the document of November 6, 1455, shows that Fust advanced money to Gutenberg (apparently 800 guilders in 1450, and another 800 in 1452) to carry on his work, and that Fust, in 1455, brought a suit against Gutenberg to recover the money he had lent, claiming 2026 guilders for principal and interest. It appears that he had not paid in the 300 guilders a year which he had undertaken to furnish for expenses, wages, etc., and, according to Gutenberg, had said that he had no intention of claiming interest.

The suit was apparently decided in Fust&#x27;s favour,
November 6, 1455, in the refectory of the Barefooted Friars of Mainz, when Fust swore that he himself had borrowed 1550 guilders and given them to Gutenberg. There is no evidence that Fust, as is usually supposed, removed the portion of the printing materials covered by his mortgage to his own house, and carried on printing there with the aid of Peter Schöffer of Gernsheim (known to have been a scriptor at Paris in 1449), who in about 1455 married Fust&#x27;s only daughter Christina. The first publication by Fust and Schöffer, the &quot;Psalter&quot; of August 14, 1457 (a folio of 350 pages, the first printed book with a complete date) was remarkable for the beauty of the large initials printed each in two colours, red and blue, from types made in two pieces. New editions of the &quot;Psalter&quot; with the same type appeared in 1459 (August 29), 1490, 1502 (Schöffer&#x27;s last publication) and 1516.

Fust and Schöffer&#x27;s other works include:
* Guillaume Durand, &quot;Rationale divinorum officiorum&quot; (1459), folio, 160 leaves
* the &quot;Clementine Constitutions&quot;, with the gloss of Johannes Andreae (1460), 51 leaves
* &quot;Biblia Sacra Latina&quot; (1462), folio 2 vols., 242 and 239 leaves, 48 lines to a full page
* the &quot;Sixth Book of Decretals&quot;, with Andreae&#x27;s gloss, December 17, 1465, folio 141 leaves
* Cicero. &quot;De officiis&quot;, 88 leaves.

== Fust and Schöffer ==
Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer carried on a partnership after Fust sued and won a case against Johann Gutenberg in 1455 for the right to take back his loans that he offered Gutenberg years earlier. Many rumors came to light about why Fust turned his back on Gutenberg merely a year before the 42-Line Bible was to be completed (even though Gutenberg had not only agreed to pay back the original loans but also was allowing Fust to add interest onto them).

Peter Schöffer was an associate of Fust that worked as an apprentice to Gutenberg during the making of the 42-Line Bible. Schöffer took Fust&#x27;s side when the court case was presented to Gutenberg, and subsequently had his name join Fust&#x27;s on the completed copies of the Bible. The twist is that Schöffer ended up marrying Fust&#x27;s only daughter, Christina, years later.

== As a businessman ==
Johann Fust was not much of a printer but more of a businessman and a salesman. Fust loaned 800 guilders (with an interest of 6%) to Johannes Gutenberg with which to start his original project. Later, another large sum of money was handed over from Fust to Gutenberg. At this point, Fust felt as if he needed to be included as a partner on the project since he had now invested so much into it.

There were all but three Bibles left to be completed when Fust decided to foreclose on his loans. On November 6, 1455, Fust demanded 2,026 guilders from Gutenberg. He also revealed in court that he had to borrow the money he gave to finance Gutenberg at 6% in order to even give the loan. All in all, Gutenberg ended up having to pay 1,200 guilders to Fust along with all of the completed Bibles, unfinished books, and his workshop.

From that point on Gutenberg was hardly ever heard from again and Fust went into partnership with Peter Schöffer. Schöffer had learned all the fine skills of printing from Gutenberg. This meant that Schöffer would be able to use the same techniques he had learned and practiced, while the savvy businessman Fust could find ways to do what he was best at, which was to sell the books that they were making. They made copies of the famed &quot;42-line Bible&quot; in both paper and vellum. The paper ones were sold for 40 guilders each, while the ones on vellum were sold for 75 guilders apiece. Fust set up a sales branch in Paris as well, expanding the sales of this Bible on a global level (long before any type of global businesses were even thought about in society). Paris is also believed to be the place where Fust died in 1466.

== Witchcraft accusations ==
It was once believed that Johann Fust was working for the devil. After several of Gutenberg’s bibles were sold to King Louis XI of France, it was decided that Fust was performing witchcraft. This idea came about for a few reasons, including the fact that some of the type was printed in red ink, mistaken for blood. It was also discovered that all of the letters in these bibles, presented to the King and his courtiers as hand-copied manuscripts, were oddly identical. Fust had sold 50 bibles in Paris and the people there could not fathom the making and selling of so many bibles so quickly, because printing had not come to the forefront yet in France. Parisians figured that the devil had something to do with the making of these copies, and Fust was thrown into jail on charges of black magic. He was eventually released, since it was proved he was running a business in which printing enabled the rapid production of multiple copies of the same text. Elizabeth Eisenstein cites a similar story, and comments:
It does seem plausible to historians of print that Fust may have alarmed certain vested interests in the Paris book trade, and may have had bibles confiscated in Paris in 1465. In general, the church and the Sorbonne welcomed the new technology. Until early sources are verified for this story about witchcraft accusations, it may be that Schafer and Goldschmidt were extrapolating under the influence of the Johann Fust / Johann Georg Faust confusion.

== Death ==
In 1464, Adolf II of Nassau appointed for the parish of St Quintin three Baumeisters (master-builders) who were to choose twelve chief parishioners as assistants for life. One of the first of these &quot;Vervaren&quot;, who were named on May 1, 1464, was Johannes Fust, and in 1467 Adam von Hochheim was chosen instead of the late (&quot;selig&quot;) Johannes Fust. Fust is said to have gone to Paris in 1466 and to have died of the plague, which raged there in August and September. He certainly was in Paris on July 4, when he gave Louis de Lavernade of the province of Forez, then chancellor of the duke of Bourbon and first president of the parliament of Toulouse, a copy of his second edition of Cicero, as appears from a note in Lavernade&#x27;s own hand at the end of the book, which is now in the library of Geneva.

Nothing further is known about Fust save that, on October 30 (), Peter Schöffer, Johann Fust (son), and Schöffer&#x27;s presumed partner Conrad Henlif (variantly, Henekes or Henckis) instituted an annual mass in the abbey-church of St. Victor of Paris, where Fust was buried. Peter Schöffer, who married Fust&#x27;s daughter (c. 1468), also founded a similar memorial service for Fust in 1473 in the church of the Dominican Order at Mainz (Karl Georg Bockenheimer, &quot;Geschichte der Stadt Mainz&quot;, iv. 15).

According to some sources, the speed and precise duplication abilities of the printing press caused French officials to claim that Fust was a magician, leading some historians to connect Fust with the legendary character of Faust. Friedrich Maximilian Klinger&#x27;s Faust, a printer, may borrow more from Fust than other versions of the Faust legend.

== Successors and influence ==
After Peter Schöffer married Fust&#x27;s daughter, Christina, the printing business of Fust and Schöffer carried on through offspring. Fust and Schöffer had done much to keep their printing methods secret, even going as far as to make their employees swear by oath that they would not reveal anything. However, the secrets were revealed anyway. Schöffer&#x27;s sons (Fust&#x27;s grandsons) Johann and Peter continued on in their father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s footsteps. The younger Peter&#x27;s son Ivo also made printing his career. Johann Fust may not have started out as a printing man but he certainly ended up influencing a whole new generation of printing. What started out in Germany spread to other parts of the world. It seemed unlikely that the original partnership between Fust and Gutenberg would end up having the effect that it ultimately did on the printing press. Many people will credit and continue to credit Gutenberg for much of the success of the 42-line Bible and for printing in general. The facts do state, however, that if it was not for Johann Fust that this Bible would have never been created in the first place. Fust controlled the sales aspect as well and branched out this creation to people in other countries. Thanks to Fust&#x27;s partnership with Schöffer a whole new generation of printers were brought into the world. The argument remains who is the true father of the printing press. Johann Fust is the name that most people still do not know today. Johann Fust will always be the man who turned his back on Gutenberg; however, he will also always be the man that truly began the printing press (through cunning and greed but there will also be people who call it business strategy).

<text>Military police (MP) are law enforcement agencies connected with, or part of, the military of a state. In wartime operations, the military police may support the main fighting force with force protection, convoy security, screening, rear reconnaissance, logistic traffic management, counterinsurgency, and detainee handling.

In different countries it may refer to:

* A section of military forces assigned to police, or garrison, occupied territories, usually during a war.
* A section of military forces assigned to policing prisoners of war detentions.
* A section of the military responsible for policing the areas of responsibility of the armed forces (referred to as provosts) against all criminal activity by military or civilian personnel
* A section of the military responsible for policing in both the armed forces and in the civilian population (most gendarmeries, such as the French Gendarmerie, the Italian Carabinieri or the Spanish Guardia Civil)
* A section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population (such as the Romanian Gendarmerie or the Chilean Carabineros)

The status of military police is usually prominently displayed on the helmet or peaked cap, with an armband, brassard, or arm or shoulder flash.

==Military police forces by country==

===Americas===

====Brazil====
&quot;Military police&quot; is a law enforcement agency which follows the Brazilian military rules, responsible for preventative policing of the civilian population. Each state has its own Military Police department, each one is a Gendarmerie. However, and despite their name, these corps are not branches of the Brazilian armed forces, instead, they are auxiliary forces and Brazilian army reserves, alongside also the Military Fire Brigades.

Traditional Provost duties are held by different corps within each branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces: Army Police () for the Army, Navy Police (), part of Brazilian Marines, for the Navy, and Air Force Police () for the Air Force.

====Canada====
The Canadian Forces Military Police (CF MP) contribute to the effectiveness and readiness of the Canadian Forces (CF) and the Department of National Defence (DND) through the provision of professional police, security and operational support services worldwide.

CFMP are classified as peace officers in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, which gives them the same powers as civilian law enforcement personnel to enforce acts of Parliament on or in relation to DND property or assets. They have the power to arrest anyone who is subject to the Code of Service Discipline (CSD), regardless of position or rank, under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;. MPs have the power to arrest and charge non-CSD-bound civilians only in cases where a crime is committed on or in relation to DND property or assets, or at the request of the minister of public safety, commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada or commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Although MP jurisdiction is only on DND property, any civilian accessing these areas falls under MP jurisdiction and is dealt with in the same manner as by any civilian policing agency. If MPs deem that a person, military or civilian, has committed a crime on or in relation to DND property or assets, they have the power to arrest and charge that person under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. The purpose of the CFMP is not to replace a civilian police officer, but rather to support the Canadian Forces through security and policing services. MPs also have the power to enforce the provincial highway traffic acts on all military bases in Canada pursuant to the Government Property Traffic Regulations (GPTR).

====Colombia====

In Colombia, MPs (Policía Militar in Spanish) are very common. They can be seen guarding closed roads, museums, embassies, government buildings and airports. In the National Army of Colombia they are assigned to the 37 Military Police Battalions, wearing green uniforms with the military police helmet. A Naval Police battalion is in service in the Colombian Marine Infantry. MP units also provide military bands and drum and bugle corps for ceremonial events. The Air Force also has a military police force (Policía Militar Aérea) that is in charge of protecting and enforcing law inside Colombian Air Force bases.

====United States====
Each branch of the United States Armed Forces (except the US Space Force) maintains its own police force. The U.S. Coast Guard, which in itself is a law enforcement agency, uses a mixture of enlisted rates and ranks qualified as law enforcement officers to patrol, investigate crimes, and enforce laws and regulations on large bases and training centers through the United States Coast Guard Police. The Coast Guard also uses the Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS), a mixture of civilian, enlisted, reservists, and officers who are qualified and duly sworn federal law enforcement officers separate from the normal Coast Guard chain of command. CGIS primarily investigates and charges those in its own population with serious crimes, such as rape, assault or forgery, that fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

The following is a list of military police forces:

* Military Police Corps/Office of the Provost Marshal General—United States Army
* Provost Marshal Office (base law enforcement) and law enforcement battalions (combat support or &quot;field MPs&quot;)—United States Marine Corps
* Masters-at-Arms (MAs) are enlisted sailors of the U.S. Navy, designated as Naval Security Force (NSF), primarily responsible for law enforcement and force protection. NSF personnel are led by naval commissioned officers from the limited duty officer (LDO) and chief warrant officer (CWO) communities, who are also designated as NSF. Additionally, a host installation&#x27;s security force (both overseas and in the continental United States) are augmented by sailors on temporary assignment of duty (TEMADD) from their parent units, as part of the Auxiliary Security Force (ASF). Shore patrol personnel are sailors from U.S. naval vessels visiting foreign ports (and some domestic ports) assigned to the shore patrol party or beach guard, responsible for the good order and discipline of sailors from the visiting ship(s) on liberty. Sailors assigned to the shore patrol party or beach guard detachment do not include sailors assigned to the ship&#x27;s security force, both performing different duties while visiting that country, because of the status of force agreement (SOFA) or rules of engagement (ROE). Prior to the 1970s, &quot;master-at-arms&quot; and &quot;shore patrol&quot; were used synonymously to refer to sailors assigned to perform law enforcement and shore patrol duties.
* United States Air Force Security Forces (formerly known as Military Police, Air Police and Security Police)—United States Air Force and United States Space Force

===Asia===

====Kingdom of Cambodia====
The Gendarmerie, or &quot;Military Police&quot;, known as the Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia is a paramilitary unit with about 7,000 soldiers deployed in all provinces. It is headquartered in Phnom Penh. The unit&#x27;s chain of command is through the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces High Command.

The Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia is deployed in every province and cities to keep the law and order. Military police in Cambodia play an important role in Cambodia society, keeping law and order in cities along with the National Police.

====China====
The 1954 PRC Constitution stipulates that the President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China unifies the national armed forces, and the 1982 PRC Constitution stipulates that the Central Military Commission leads the national armed forces, in addition to the CPC&#x27;s insistence on the absolute leadership of the Party over the military, so the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army does not have a military police in the traditional sense. The armed forces, including the various military branches of the PLA and the Chinese People&#x27;s Armed Police, have their own police pickets units. According to the &quot;Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Police Regulations&quot;, Article 7 stipulates that the &quot;military affairs department of the commanding authority shall be responsible for the management of police operations in the region&quot; in units above the regimental level, and shall dispatch and lead the police pickets to perform police duties in accordance with Article 27. Article 4 of the Police Regulation provides that:

 The main tasks of policing are&lt;br&gt;
(1) Maintaining military discipline.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Maintaining order in the operation of military vehicles and traffic safety.&lt;br&gt;
(3) To investigate and deal with impersonation of military personnel, military vehicles and military units in accordance with the prescribed authority&lt;br&gt;
(4) To safeguard the image of the army and the legitimate rights and interests of soldiers out in the field&lt;br&gt;
(5) To carry out temporary guard duty.

It can be seen that the duty of the police picket detachment only involves the military personnel, military vehicles military discipline and other issues; while the legal sense of criminal law enforcement or public security administrative law enforcement authority, but belongs to the military procuratorate or military defense department. Cases of counterfeit military personnel, counterfeit military vehicles and counterfeit military units investigated and dealt with in police picketing are transferred to the jurisdiction of local judicial organs. Jurisprudence holds that in general criminal cases (i.e. not including crimes against military duties), military status does not constitute a special subject. According to Article 4 of the Regulations on Handling Mutual Involvement of Military and Local Criminal Cases implemented by the Supreme People&#x27;s Court, the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Justice and the General Political Department of the PLA on August 1, 2009, the principle of personal jurisdiction is adopted for military personnel (including active duty military personnel, civilian cadres, military civilian personnel, non-active duty public service personnel, military employees, retired personnel managed by the military, and The investigation, prosecution, trial, and execution of penalties for military personnel (including active duty military personnel, civilian cadres, military civilian personnel, non-active duty public employees, military employees, retired personnel managed by the military, and reserve personnel and other personnel performing military tasks) are under the jurisdiction and execution of military defense departments, military procuratorates, military courts, military prisons, etc.; the investigation, prosecution, trial, and execution of penalties for local personnel are under the jurisdiction of local judicial organs. Included in the Chinese People&#x27;s Armed Police Force sequence of public security border defense, public security fire, public security guard forces on active duty, in accordance with local personnel to determine the jurisdiction. Special Case: The military police unit established by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army in Hong Kong is the same as the police picket detachment in terms of carrying out its tasks.

In January 2016, the Political and Legal Committee of the Central Military Commission was established as part of the deepening reform of the national defense and military forces. The Bureau of Security of the General Political Department of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army was subsequently changed to the Bureau of Security of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central Military Commission, which will assume the functions of investigation, public prosecution and trial of military-related violations with the Military Procuratorate of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the Military Court of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army, respectively.

====India====

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, the institution which solely has the responsibility and authority concerning the maintenance of discipline and law enforcement towards members of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) is the Military Police Command (Indonesian: &quot;Pusat Polisi Militer TNI&quot; abbreviated &quot;Puspom TNI&quot;), an institution directly under the auspices of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Headquarters (&quot;Mabes TNI&quot;) which heads the three Military Police corps which are the:
*Indonesian Army Military Police Command; (Puspomad)
*Indonesian Navy Military Police Command; (Puspomal)
*Indonesian Air Force Military Police Command (Puspomau)
They are authorised to enforce military law and conduct crime investigations involving active members of the TNI. Other than conducting law enforcement, MPs which are attached to the Paspampres also conduct escort and Honour guard duties for the head of state, high-ranking military officials, and VVIPs.

If a member of the armed forces is caught red-handed by the civilian police, then the violator will be sent to the nearest Military Police or the Military police would be contacted in order to conduct further legal processes. 
The Army, Navy, and Air force have their own Military Police unit which focuses on their own branches, but any Military policemen from either branch can take action towards military members from a different branch if caught red-handed, then the violator will be sent to the Military police of their branch. The Military Police in Indonesia are known locally as &quot;Polisi Militer&quot; sometimes shortened &quot;PM&quot; or &quot;POM&quot;.

The uniforms worn by the Military police varies for the tri-services. The Army Military Police wear dark green, the Navy Military Police wear blue-gray and the Air Force Military Police wear light blue. The beret of all of the three Military police corps in Indonesia is the same which is blue, dragged to the left (except those attached to the Paspampres who wears light blue berets).

Military Police of the Czech republic also contains active reserve units. Members of the active reserve have a civilian profession but several times a year participate in training or other MP activities.

====Denmark====
In Denmark the military police (Danish: &quot;militærpoliti&quot;) services are carried out as independent units under each branch. In the army all military police tasks are done as an integral part of the &quot;Trænregimentet&quot;,
whereas the navy military police is an independent unit under command and control of the commanding officer of the Danish Frogman Corps
and the air force, as a part of the force protection squadron (&quot;Squadron 660&quot;) of the air force &quot;Combat Support Wing&quot;.
Unlike the two other branches, the navy military police also handles installation guard duties (which is carried out by regular soldiers in the army and by an installation protection unit under &quot;Squadron 660&quot; in the air force) of naval installations as well as certain military installations in the Danish capital region, such as the Danish Defence Command and the Ministry of Defence.

MP personnel typically wear either branch-specific display dress uniforms with white shoulder markings with the text &quot;MP&quot; or the branch-common daily combat uniform, with a red beret. In the air force the MP-shoulder markings is typically replaced with markings saying either &quot;VAGT&quot; or &quot;GUARD&quot;, but for international missions they also use the &quot;MP&quot;-markings.

MP personnel generally do not have legal authority over civilians in non-military areas but only over military personnel and on military installations (also publicly accessible places like Holmen Naval Base in Copenhagen). On some occasions MP personnel can support civilian police in certain tasks, but will only have slightly more legal authority than civilians—similar to the police home guard.

In the army military police are almost without exception NCOs or officers, whereas the navy and air force rely mainly of Danish ranks OR-1 to OR-3.

Furthermore, the home guard has a police branch, which supports both the civilian Danish police and the military police.

Typical MP jobs are:
* Installation/perimeter guard
* Personnel protection
* Traffic control
* Courier services
* Prisoner transport

====Estonia====

The &quot;Sõjaväepolitsei&quot; are the Military Police of the Estonian Defence Forces.Kaitsevägi The Estonian MP organization was created in 1994 and is today divided into tactical (patrol) and investigative units. Additionally, conscript-based reserve MP platoons are trained in Guard Battalion every year. MP tasks include investigation of serious disciplinary cases and some armed service-related crimes, supervision of military discipline within the Forces, military traffic control and various security tasks. Within conflict/crises areas (Afghanistan) the MP may provide close protection of the Estonian national representative and other visiting VIPs. When on regular patrol assignment, Estonian MPs wear a black brassard on their right shoulder, with the letters &quot;SP&quot; in silver, and are usually equipped with an HK USP 9 mm pistol, spare magazines, radio, handcuffs, pepper spray and an expandable police baton.

====Finland====

The &quot;&quot; are the military police of the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish MPs wear a black brassard on the left shoulder with the letters &#x27;SP&#x27; in white. A military policeman is usually armed with a 9 mm pistol, a baton, pepper spray and handcuffs on their belt. The military police includes both career and conscript personnel, and is primarily used to guard military installations and supervise military traffic. All military police personnel are trained with basic police techniques and usually receive training for fighting in urban areas. In wartime, the tasks are more extensive and include protection of key personnel and targets, especially against enemy special forces, and surveillance, control, pursuit, arrest and destruction missions. For training, almost all brigades have military police companies. The companies are part of and subordinate to the brigade.

The military police has jurisdiction over military personnel, military areas, installations and exercise areas. However, a military police patrol may stop a crime that it witnesses in process in a civilian area. Additionally, if a military police unit is near to a serious crime taking place, such as a robbery or an assault, and the civilian police are delayed, a military police unit that is near to the scene can offer to handle the situation until the civilian police arrive. As with some other Finnish Defence Forces units, the military police can be used to provide assistance to the civilian police when they are undermanned or lack special resources. In such case, the military police may take measures deemed necessary by the civilian police. For example, during the 2005 Helsinki World Athletic Championship Games, military police conscripts and career personnel were placed along the marathon route to prevent the large numbers of spectators from obstructing the runners.

Before and during World War II, Finland did not have military police in peacetime, but only temporary &quot;sotapoliisi&quot; (&quot;war police&quot;). Ex-police officers were conscripted for police officer duty in the armed forces; usually only the officers had police training. Planning for &quot;sotapoliisi&quot; was still unfinished at the break of war, so regular reservists could not be conscripted. Thus personnel had to be recruited without regard to quality; conscripts found unfit for field duty for e.g. health reasons, and even those with previous criminal record were recruited, and the reputation suffered.
For a long time, &quot;sotapoliisi&quot; existed only in wartime. However, improvement to this came eventually: the military police school was founded in 1963, and civilian police background was no longer required.

The crimes committed by military personnel are, as a rule, investigated by the military. Minor infractions are usually investigated by the career personnel of the unit, while more serious crimes are investigated by the investigative section of the General Staff of the Finnish Defence Forces. In minor matters, the company commander or their superiors may use disciplinary powers, but more serious cases are deferred to the civilian prosecutor who will take the case to the district court.

====France====

The National Gendarmerie acts as both the military police and one of the two national law enforcement forces of France.
Provost missions are assumed by local units for the garrisons of the Ground Army on French soil and by special divisions : 
* The 1100 personnel of the Maritime Gendarmerie police the Navy (and also acts as a coast guard and water police force). National critical merchant ports are protected by specialized units of the Gendarmerie Maritime, the Naval and Harbor Safety Platoons&quot;.
* The 860 members of the Air Gendarmerie polices the Air Force fulfills police and security missions in the air bases, and goes on the site of an accident involving military aircraft. This branch is separate from the Air Transport Gendarmerie, which is placed under the dual supervision of the Gendarmerie and the direction of civilian aviation and fulfills police and security missions in civilian airfields and airports. They also perform immigration and emigration checks on military flights.
* The 280 personnel of the Ordnance Gendarmerie () fulfill police and security missions in the establishments of the France&#x27;s defence procurement agency () and ensure VIP close-protection for the head of the DGA and a few other high-rankings.
* The 50 personnel of the &quot;Gendarmerie of the Safety of Nuclear Armaments&quot;, backed by 250 members of the &quot;Mobile Gendarmerie&quot; monitor all the nuclear armaments of the French Republic.
* The 70 members of the &quot;Provost Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie Prévôtale)&quot; conduct judiciary and disciplinary investigations in foreign garrisons.

The Maritime Gendarmerie, Air Gendarmerie, Ordnance Gendarmerie and Provost Gendarmerie are placed under the dual supervision of the Gendarmerie and the relevant military branch. However, for judiciary duties, they are under exclusive command of the relevant court.

In addition to the Gendarmerie, &quot;Naval Fusiliers (Fusiliers Marins)&quot;, &quot;Fusilier commandos of the Air Force (Fusiliers Commandos de l&#x27;Air)&quot; and dedicated regimental platoons maintain order for their respective branches.

====Germany====

The are the military police of the German . The term &quot;Feldjäger&quot; (&quot;field hunter&quot;) has a long tradition and dates back to the mid-17th century. Their motto is &quot;Suum Cuique&quot; (&quot;To each his own&quot;, derived from Cicero, &quot;De Finibus, Bonorum et Malorum&quot;, &quot;liber V&quot;, 67: &quot;&quot;(...) ut fortitudo in laboribus periculisque cernatur, (...), iustitia in&quot; suo cuique &quot;tribuendo.&quot;&quot;).

The first modern &quot;Feldjäger&quot; unit was activated on 6 October 1955 when the bill creating the was signed. The &quot;Feldjäger&quot; corps serves all component forces of the German Federal Armed Forces () i.e., German Army, German Navy, German Air Force, &quot;Zentraler Sanitätsdienst&quot; (Joint Medical Corps) and &quot;Streitkräftebasis&quot; (Joint Support Service). The Military Police Command has its headquarters in Scharnhorst Kaserne in Hanover and is under the operational command of the Bundeswehr&#x27;s Territorial Tasks Command of the &quot;Streitkräftebasis&quot;.
The &quot;Feldjäger&quot; have three regiments of military police stationed around Germany which are subordinate to the Military Police Command.

====Greece====
The paramilitary Greek Gendarmerie fulfilled most security and order duties in Greece until World War II. In 1951, Law 1746/51 established the framework of the Hellenic Army&#x27;s Greek Military Police (, &quot;Ellinikí Stratiotikí Astynomía&quot;). The organization—and particularly its Special Interrogative Department, EAT-ESA—became notorious for its brutality during the 1967–1974 military junta. Law 276/76 renamed it simply to &quot;Military Police&quot; (Στρατονομία). Corresponding organizations exist also for other two branches of the Greek armed forces: for the Hellenic Air Force (Αερονομία, &quot;Aeronomia&quot;), founded in 1945 as the Greek Air Force Police (Ελληνική Αεροπορική Αστυνομία, ΕΑΑ), and for the Hellenic Navy (Ναυτονομία, &quot;Naftonomia&quot;, properly Υπηρεσία Ναυτονομίας or Y.ΝΑ.)

These three forces work together often but are independent from each other. Most of the personnel are draftee soldiers undergoing their regular military service.
====Hungary====

As part of the Hungarian Defence Forces the Hungarian Military Police (&quot;Katonai Rendészet&quot;) is a military law enforcement organization with duties of protecting selected objects, investigating accidents involving military vehicles, accompanying military delegations and military forces passing through Hungary, traffic control, personal protection of designated military leaders, performing military police duties in international missions, military law enforcement activities in Hungary.

====Ireland====
The Irish Military Police (colloquially &quot;PA&quot;s, deriving from the official title, ) are responsible for the prevention and detection of crime in the Irish Defence Forces. Entry to the PA is restricted to serving members of the Defence Forces. All members of the corps are non-commissioned officers, with officers being transferred in for temporary assignments. Unlike many military police services, they retain responsibility for controlling access to many, but not all, military posts. In addition, they provide a military detachment to the (Houses of Parliament) and have a large ceremonial role. In the past they had a role in training armed elements of the but in recent times this has decreased. Historically, they were responsible for detaining political prisoners in military prisons (until the handing over of military prisons at Cork, Spike Island, Arbour Hill and the Curragh to the civil authorities) and in the past occasionally provided firing squads for executions (the last time being the Emergency of 1939–1946).

====Italy====

The &quot;Arma dei Carabinieri&quot; is a gendarmerie force acting as both the military police and one of the four national police forces in Italy. Formed on 13 July 1814, it has been for almost two centuries the senior branch of the Italian Army, until on 5 October 2000 it became a fully independent Service of the Italian military.

With a strength of about 120,000, the Arma dei Carabinieri is a very large organization, including its own air and naval services, but most of its personnel is used for civilian police duties.

The properly Military Police components of the Arma dei Carabinieri are grouped into the &quot;Divisione Unità Mobili Carabinieri&quot; (Carabinieri Mobile Units Division), organized as follows:

2nd Brigade:
* 1st Carabinieri Parachutist Regiment &quot;Tuscania&quot;
* 7th Carabinieri Battalion &quot;Trentino – Alto Adige&quot;
* 13th Carabinieri Battalion &quot;Friuli – Venezia Giulia&quot;
* Gruppo Intervento Speciale.

From these units are drawn most of the elements that form the Carabinieri MP coys, platoons and detachments assigned to all the major Italian Army, Navy and Air Force units, as well as many of the personnel forming the MSU Regiments (Multinational Specialist Units) and the IPUs (Integrated Police Units) serving abroad in support of European Union, NATO and United Nation missions. The Arma dei Carabinieri have gained a very good reputation for the professionalism and organization of their MP units in support of international missions, so much that during the 2004 G8 Sea Island Conference the Carabinieri have been tasked to organize and run the CoESPU (Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units), to centralize the training of multinational MP units for international missions.

The 1st Brigade of the same &quot;Divisione Unità Mobili Carabinieri&quot;, organized on 11 Mobile battalions and 1 Cavalry Regiment, does contribute to form the same Military Police components as the 1st Brigade, but is mostly tasked to riot control civilian police duties.

During some NATO military mission abroad, the Italian carabinieri contributed to military police operations with the Multinational Specialized Unit.

The &quot;Guardia di Finanza&quot; acts as a specialized Military Police force when called upon. Its normal duties include being a force acting in border control, customs duties, and police investigations into financial crimes and illegal drug trafficking.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, the function of military police is performed by the &quot;Koninklijke Marechaussee&quot; (&quot;Royal Constabulary&quot;), a separate branch of the military independent of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Besides performing military duties, the &quot;Marechaussee&quot; is also a gendarmerie force.

The word &quot;Marechaussee&quot; seems to derive from the old French name &quot;Marecheaux&quot; given to an ancient court of justice in Paris called the &quot;Tribunal of Constables and Marshals of France&quot;. These constables and marshals were to become members of the Gendarmerie, which served as a model for the police forces of both Belgium and the Netherlands. The term &quot;Marechaussee&quot; was also used for the Continental Army&#x27;s military police during the American Revolution.

====Norway====
In Norway, military police are service members of the Norwegian Army, Royal Norwegian Navy or Royal Norwegian Air Force. Since about 2002, all are trained at Sessvollmoen Camp. a portion of MPs in the Army are assigned to the Military Police Battalion, located at Bardufoss, Troms og Finnmark county. The first battalion commander and provost marshal of 6. division Norwegian Army was Maj M Langvik, the current battalion commander is Lieutenant Colonel Jan Henry Norvalls. The battalion consists of approximately 50 officers and NCOs, and 150 privates and corporals. Norwegian MPs first go through a six-month selection/educational period, before being assigned to the battalion or to regimental duties with other units for the remainder of their twelve-month service. Norwegian MPs do not have authority over civilians, except on or in the vicinity of military installations, vehicles or other property or under martial law. They do have authority over military personnel, including in certain circumstances reservists, anywhere, including when such personnel are off duty.

The &quot;Heimevernet&quot; (&quot;Home Guard&quot;) also has MPs in its ranks. Usually each District (regiment) has one or two platoons, consisting exclusively of former regular or conscript military police personnel.

Norwegian MPs wear a red beret and a red lanyard around the left shoulder extending to the left front pocket. Only personnel currently serving as MPs are allowed to wear this. When on official duty, They have previously worn the MP armband, which is black with &quot;MP&quot; in red letters. It was worn on the left shoulder, following NATO practice. Before that it was worn on the right shoulder. They can also wear white webbing, or a number of items for special duties, like high visibility vests for traffic duty, or as mounted personnel while performing motorcycle escort for the Royal Family or their official guests, etc.

Army canine units are also assigned to the MP battalion, but the personnel in such units are not necessarily MPs. Such personnel do not hold military police authority, and do not wear the MP insignia.

MPs have no other powers over civilians than ordinary members of the public, except inside, or in the immediate vicinity of military installations. More serious cases, like narcotics, are handed over to civilian police for investigation.

====Poland====
The Military Gendarmerie (&quot;Żandarmeria Wojskowa&quot;, ŻW) are the MPs for the entire Polish military, established in the 1990s.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, each branch of the Armed Forces has its own military police force. The Portuguese Navy has the &quot;Polícia Naval&quot; (Naval Police), the Portuguese Army has the &quot;Polícia do Exército&quot; (Army Police), and the Portuguese Air Force has the &quot;Polícia Aérea&quot; (Air Police). The Air Police is an arm of its own inside the Air Force, but the Army Police is only a speciality of the cavalry arm and the Naval Police is a unit of the Marine Corps (&quot;Fuzileiros&quot;). A military criminal investigation police, common for the three branches of Armed Forces, also exists, this being the &quot;Polícia Judiciária Militar&quot; (Military Judiciary Police), that is under the direct dependency of the Minister of National Defense.

Portugal, also, has a gendarmerie type force, the &quot;Guarda Nacional Republicana&quot; (GNR, National Republican Guard), that is a special corps of troops that executes both civil public security missions and military missions. In time of peace, GNR is under operational command of the Minister of Internal Affairs, but in time of war it can be put under the command of the Armed Forces. GNR is not tasked with enforcing the law within the Armed Forces.

Included in the Portuguese Navy organization also exist two special police forces. The first one is the &quot;Polícia Maritima&quot; (Maritime Police), that serves as a coast guard and maritime law enforcement agency in the scope of the civil role of the Portuguese Navy as the National Maritime Authority. The other one is the &quot;Polícia dos Estabelecimentos da Marinha&quot; (Navy&#x27;s Establishments Police), a small gendarmerie type agency responsible for guarding the Lisbon Naval Base and some other naval facilities.

====Romania====

In Romania, the Romanian Military Police (&quot;Poliția Militară&quot;) carries out police duties for the Romanian Armed Forces. It usually handles military security and military crimes and it has national jurisdiction. The Romanian military police is organized in four battalions (two of them are headquartered in Bucharest, one in Iași and one in Târgu Mureș).

The Romanian Gendarmerie, although a military force with national jurisdiction, is not tasked with enforcing the law within the armed forces (in contrast to the French Gendarmerie, which acts as both military and national police force).

====Russia====
The Russian Military Police (Военная полиция России) are the MPs for the entire Russian military. They carry out police duties for the Russian Armed Forces.
In April 2012 Chief Military Prosecutor Sergei Fridinsky said Russia&#x27;s military police will be instituted in two stages: first, the integration of the relevant Defence Ministry services and second, granting the new agency investigative functions. In early February 2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law the Law on Military Police, the State Duma adopted on 24 January and approved by the Federation Council on 29 January. During consideration of the bill in the lower house of the parliament, presidential envoy to the State Duma Garry Minkh explained that military police has already been created and running, but its activities are governed by departmental orders. President&#x27;s initiative is aimed at strengthening the legal framework of the forces. On 27 March 2015, Russian President approved the Official Charter of the military police of the Russian Federation.

The Military Police have five main functions:
* Maneuver and mobility support operations
* Area security operations
* Law and order operations
* Internment and resettlement operations
* Police intelligence operations

The National Guard of Russia and Federal Security Service has its own military police units.

====Serbia====
The Military Police () are considered to be among the best qualified and most combat-prepared organizations within the Serbian military. Their responsibilities include counterterrorist operations, combating organized crime, close protection, securing hostages and search and rescue.

Specific training is provided for members of special units of the Military Police. Drills for Military Police units, from squad to battalion, are based on their anticipated tactical employment, including training in putting down civil disorder.
The Military Police Directorate of the General Staff of the Serbian Military is responsible for overseeing the units of the Military Police.

Similar units include:
* Military Police Battalion Cobra
* Military Police Counter-terrorist Battalion

====Spain====

Each branch of the Spanish Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) has its own military police (&quot;Policía Militar&quot;, &quot;Policía Naval&quot; and &quot;Policía Aerea&quot; respectively). They are only recognized as constabularies with jurisdiction over military installations, military operations and military personnel. They have jurisdiction over civilians off of military installations like Civil Guard (Spain). They are also in charge of the security of military installations, play a role as bodyguards of generals, admirals and other relevant military personnel, provide security services to military transports and police military personnel abroad. They have the consideration of authority agents.

The Civil Guard (in Spanish &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;) is the Spanish gendarmerie force. Along with their civilian law enforcement functions, due to their military nature the Civil Guard is also assigned several functions as a Military Police under the Minister of Defence, the most important of which is Criminal Investigations in military facilities and vessels, other MP functions include traffic and customs enforcement in international missions.

====Soviet Union====
The Soviet Armed Forces did not have any units technically named &#x27;military police&#x27;. Two separate agencies handled military police duties on a day-to-day basis.

The &quot;Komendantskaya sluzhba&quot; or &quot;Commandant&#x27;s Service&quot; of the Soviet Army wore a yellow letter &quot;K&quot; on a red patch on the sleeve to indicate their membership of this service—the &quot;de facto&quot; army police.

A second organisation called the Traffic Regulators existed within the Rear Services. Traffic Regulators served to control military highway and motor vehicle traffic. Traffic Regulators also wear a white painted helmet with red stripes to indicate their status and either an armband ar patch with the Cyrillic letter &quot;P&quot; (R).

In the Soviet Navy and (later in the present day Russian Navy) the role of Naval provosts was primarily filled by personnel from the Naval Infantry.

====Sweden====
The Swedish military police are part of the Life Guards, stationed in Stockholm. There are two MP companies, the 14th and the 15th companies. The 14th MP company serve a so-called GSS/T contract (two years of service over a period of eight years, the remaining time the soldiers can have a civilian job or study) and the 15th MP company serve a so-called GSS/K contract (hired continually for eight years). The Life Guards are also the seat of the Swedish military police unit (&quot;MP-enheten&quot;) which is responsible for the education of new MPs and is in charge of all MP activities in Sweden. Part of 13th security battalion, which is a counter-intelligence battalion, is also part of the Life Guards and has some soldiers who are trained MPs (mostly corporals and sergeants).

====Switzerland====
In the Swiss Armed Forces, the Military Police is responsible for law enforcement on military property and for all incidents where military personnel or equipment is involved. Unlike, for example, the United States, a military policeman in Switzerland has the same power to arrest any person that has committed an offense he witnessed or if he has reasonable grounds to believe the person has committed a violent offense.

Furthermore, the military police provides protection of Swiss representatives abroad and is in part responsible for the guarding of embassies and foreign VIPs in Switzerland, as well as maintaining personal security for members of the Swiss Federal Council. In addition, the Swiss Explosive Ordnance Disposal Center is a branch of the MP for the disposal of unexploded ordnance and also participates in various demining operations around the world.

The professional MP units comprise 758 officers and are divided into four Regions, each consisting of two companies and additional groups specialised on criminal investigations and training. The professional MP maintains a standing tactical team, capable of interventions in Switzerland and abroad, headquartered in Bern. In addition, there are four militia MP battalions with a head count of roughly 2000 men. Each MP Battalion has one tactical company who can be called to support either the primary MP tactical team or cantonal police teams if needed.

Unlike regular army personnel, professional military policemen wear olive uniforms in order to provide distinct identification. Militia MP wear the regular Swiss Army TAZ 90 camouflage. Moreover, the (both the professional and the militia) MP is equipped uniquely, armed with Glock side arms, H&amp;K MP5 submachine guns, the Mzgw91 pump-action rifle and the SG553 assault rifle (compared to the standard issue SIG P220 pistol and SIG 550 assault rifle). Professional MP units drive patrol cars similar to those of the civilian police, but also use Piranha and Duro APCs.

====Ukraine====
The Ukrainian Military Police (VSP) is the military police for the Ukrainian Armed Forces

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom the term &quot;Military Police&quot; usually refers to the Royal Military Police. The Royal Military Police is the branch of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps, responsible for policing the British Army (both in the United Kingdom and overseas). The term &quot;Service Police&quot; refers to the three separate police organisations for each of the three branches of the UK&#x27;s Armed Forces:

* The Royal Navy is policed by the Royal Navy Police (RNP), the members of which are traditionally known as Regulators (or Master-at-Arms if a Chief Petty Officer or Warrant Officer).
:The Royal Navy Police also provides Royal Marines specialising as service policemen. Prior to 2009, the Royal Marines Police was an independent organisation.

* The British Army is policed by the Royal Military Police (RMP).
:In addition to the Royal Military Police, most British Army units have their own Regimental police (RP) and Military Provost Guard Service (MPGS) staff. Sometimes incorrectly referred to as Regimental Police, they do not have any police powers or policing function, but are soldiers responsible for discipline within their own units. They are normally located in the Guardroom.

* The Royal Air Force is policed by the Royal Air Force Police (RAFP). The RAFP provides not only a full Policing function, but they also fulfil a security and counter intelligence function for the RAF and the wider defence community.

In addition, each of the three service police has its own Special Investigation Branch (SIB) to undertake investigation of more serious crime and plain-clothes investigations, and use the joint Service Police Crime Bureau operated by the RNP, RMP and RAFP.

===Oceania===

====Australia====

In Australia, &quot;Service Police&quot; refers to services policing three different military branches:

*The 1st Military Police Battalion is the field component of the Military Police and the Domestic Policing Unit is the garrison policing component. In the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police also performs the role of a secondary communications network in the front battle zone. Army MP&#x27;s wear a red shoulder patch with MP in black.
*In the Royal Australian Navy, the Naval Police Coxswain Branch performs dual roles of performing general police duties, investigation of criminal offences and a secondary role of ships&#x27; coxswain staff responsible for administration of ships&#x27; personnel. 
*In the Royal Australian Air Force, the Air Force Police perform the military police role. The Air Force Police organisation falls within Security Forces, therefore their role is largely providing force protection and enforcing military and civilian laws. Air Force Police members wear either a black brassard or patch with white SP meaning Service Police.

The Royal Australian Corps of Military Police train their own working dogs for a more Infantry/combat role.

All major crimes committed by or against personnel of the Australian Defence Force are investigated by the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service.

====New Zealand====
The Joint Military Police Unit (JMPU) is a tri-service Military Police unit from the Navy, Army, and Air Force.

JMPU comprises military police personnel from the Royal New Zealand Navy Naval Police, Royal New Zealand Military Police, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force Police. Personnel still maintain their own single service identity but operate under a single Provost Marshal and investigate offences against the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971.

JMPU operates outside of the normal Navy, Army and Air Force command structure. The current Provost Marshal is a Group Captain who reports directly to the Vice Chief of the NZDF.

For all serious and complex investigations that are outside the scope of regular Military Police personnel a specialised unit known as the Special Investigations Branch (SIB) handles all high-profile investigations. SIB personnel attend courses with the New Zealand Police Criminal Investigation Branch. SIB have a similar role to the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS). SIB are also seconded to the NZ Police CIB.

JMPU also provide the close protection function for the NZDF. Only personnel from within the unit are able to attend the Tier 1 course and undergo a rigorous selection process. From time to time NZ Police officers from the Diplomatic Protection Squad and the Armed Offenders Squad have been known to also complete the course.

JMPU complete certain NZ Police courses such as Urgent Duty Driving, Disaster Victim Identification, Basic and Intermediate Crash Investigation with the NZ Police Serious Crash Unit, and some personnel have completed the Diplomatic Protection Squad training course.

JMPU are responsible for all detainee handling both in peacetime and in an operational environment such as custody and escort of POWs. Military Police are responsible for maintaining discipline at the Services Correction Establishment (SCE) which is located at Burnham Military Camp. SCE is the NZDF Military Prison and consists of guards who are all serving members of JMPU. The guards are responsible for rehabilitation of service personnel who have been sent to the facility as a result of serious offences committed against the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971.

JMPU are identifiable by the blue and white &quot;MP&quot; patch they wear on their uniform and the blue beret as head dress, the wearing of the Blue beret differs from many commonwealth military police units as traditionally a red beret is worn.

JMPU wear their respective service dress for each service. During peacetime JMPU wear either a Multicam Camouflage uniform, or blue uniform with a SRBA vest.

==Air force police==

Air force police or sometimes known as &quot;Air police&quot; refers to certain units that are part of a country&#x27;s air force that perform law enforcement duties such as force protection and air patrols, dealing primarily with the enforcement of aviation law at air force bases. It also indirectly plays a part in ensuring the air sovereignty of a country. It serves similarly to military and paramilitary police forces around the world and are commonly set up as a branch of a nation&#x27;s military police or even a separate institution altogether. In some countries, the Air force police are also responsible for conducting Provost duties in the scope of a country&#x27;s air force, such as implementing crime investigation and enforcing discipline/order towards members of the Air force.

<text>In mathematics, the range of a function may refer to either of two closely related concepts:

* the codomain of the function, or
* the image of the function.

In some cases the codomain and the image of a function are the same set; such a function is called &quot;surjective&quot; or &quot;onto&quot;. For any non-surjective function formula_1 the codomain formula_2 and the image formula_3 are different; however, a new function can be defined with the original function&#x27;s image as its codomain, formula_4 where formula_5 This new function is surjective.

==Definitions==
Given two sets and , a binary relation between and is a function (from to ) if for every element in there is exactly one in such that relates to . The sets and are called the &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;codomain&quot; of , respectively. The &quot;image&quot; of the function is the subset of consisting of only those elements of such that there is at least one in with .

==Usage==
As the term &quot;range&quot; can have different meanings, it is considered a good practice to define it the first time it is used in a textbook or article. Older books, when they use the word &quot;range&quot;, tend to use it to mean what is now called the codomain. More modern books, if they use the word &quot;range&quot; at all, generally use it to mean what is now called the image. To avoid any confusion, a number of modern books don&#x27;t use the word &quot;range&quot; at all.

==Elaboration and example==
Given a function
:formula_6
with domain formula_7, the range of formula_8, sometimes denoted formula_9 or formula_10, may refer to the codomain or target set formula_2 (i.e., the set into which all of the output of formula_8 is constrained to fall), or to formula_13, the image of the domain of formula_8 under formula_8 (i.e., the subset of formula_2 consisting of all actual outputs of formula_8). The image of a function is always a subset of the codomain of the function.

As an example of the two different usages, consider the function formula_18 as it is used in real analysis (that is, as a function that inputs a real number and outputs its square). In this case, its codomain is the set of real numbers formula_19, but its image is the set of non-negative real numbers formula_20, since formula_21 is never negative if formula_22 is real. For this function, if we use &quot;range&quot; to mean &quot;codomain&quot;, it refers to formula_23; if we use &quot;range&quot; to mean &quot;image&quot;, it refers to formula_20.

For some functions, the image and the codomain coincide; these functions are called &quot;surjective&quot; or &quot;onto&quot;. For example, consider the function formula_25 which inputs a real number and outputs its double. For this function, both the codomain and the image are the set of all real numbers, so the word &quot;range&quot; is unambiguous.

Even in cases where the image and codomain of a function are different, a new function can be uniquely defined with its codomain as the image of the original function. For example, as a function from the integers to the integers, the doubling function formula_26 is not surjective because only the even integers are part of the image. However, a new function formula_27 whose domain is the integers and whose codomain is the even integers &quot;is&quot; surjective. For formula_28 the word &quot;range&quot; is unambiguous.

<doc id="275992" wikidata="Q30847" url="?curid=275992" title="Caracal">
<text>The caracal (Caracal caracal) () is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and arid areas of Pakistan and northwestern India. It is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, relatively short tail, and long canine teeth. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches at the shoulder and weighs . It was first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised.

Typically nocturnal, the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe. It is territorial, and lives mainly alone or in pairs. The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon birds, rodents, and other small mammals. It can leap higher than and catch birds in midair. It stalks its prey until it is within of it, after which it runs it down and kills it with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck. Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the year. Gestation lasts between two and three months, resulting in a litter of one to six kittens. Juveniles leave their mothers at the age of nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly 16 years.

== Etymology ==
The name &#x27;caracal&#x27; was proposed by Georges Buffon in 1761 who referred to its Turkish name &#x27;Karrah-kulak&#x27; or &#x27;Kara-coulac&#x27;, meaning &#x27;black ear&#x27;. The &#x27;lynx&#x27; of the Greeks and Romans was most probably the caracal, and the name &#x27;lynx&#x27; is sometimes still applied to it, but the present-day lynx proper is a separate genus.
The caracal is also known as desert lynx and Persian lynx.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
&quot;Felis caracal&quot; was the scientific name used by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776 who described a caracal skin from the Cape of Good Hope. In 1843, John Edward Gray placed it in the genus &quot;Caracal&quot;. It is placed in the family Felidae and subfamily Felinae.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, several caracal specimens were described and proposed as subspecies. Since 2017, three subspecies have been recognised as valid:
* Southern caracal (&quot;C. c. caracal&quot;) – occurs in Southern and East Africa
* Northern caracal (&quot;C. c. nubicus&quot;) – occurs in North and West Africa
* Asiatic caracal (&quot;C. c. schmitzi&quot;) – occurs in Asia

=== Phylogeny ===
Results of a phylogenetic study indicates that the caracal and the African golden cat (&quot;Caracal aurata&quot;) diverged between 2.93 and 1.19 million years ago. These two species together with the serval (&quot;Leptailurus serval&quot;) form the &quot;Caracal&quot; lineage, which diverged between 11.56 and 6.66 million years ago. The ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa between 8.5 and 5.6 million years ago.

The relationship of the caracal is considered as follows:
== Characteristics ==

The caracal is a slender, moderately sized cat characterised by a robust build, a short face, long canine teeth, tufted ears, and long legs. It reaches nearly at the shoulder. The tan, bushy tail extends to the hocks. The caracal is sexually dimorphic; the females are smaller than the males in most bodily parameters.

The prominent facial features include the long black tufts on the ears, two black stripes from the forehead to the nose, the black outline of the mouth, the distinctive black facial markings, and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth. The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid, probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun&#x27;s glare. The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages. The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings. The fur, soft, short, and dense, grows coarser in the summer. The ground hairs are denser in winter than in summer. The length of the guard hairs can be up to long in winter, but shorten to in summer. These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season, typically in October and November. The hind legs are longer than the forelegs, so the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.

Male caracals measure in head-to-body length and have long tails; 77 male caracals ranged in weight between . The head-to-body length of females is with a tail of ; 63 females ranged in weight between .

The caracal is often confused with a lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of difference between the two is that &quot;Lynx&quot; species are spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal&#x27;s, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be distinguished from the caracal by the former&#x27;s lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail, and smaller footprints.

The skull of the caracal is high and rounded, featuring large auditory bullae, a well-developed supraoccipital crest normal to the sagittal crest, and a strong lower jaw. The caracal has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is . The deciduous dentition is . The canines are up to long and sharp. The caracal lacks the second upper premolars, and the upper molars are diminutive. The large paws have four digits in the hind legs and five in the fore legs. The first digit of the fore leg remains above the ground and features the dewclaw. The sharp and retractile claws are larger but less curved in the hind legs.

== Distribution and habitat ==

In Africa, the caracal is widely distributed south of the Sahara, but considered rare in North Africa. In Asia, it occurs from the Arabian Peninsula, Middle East, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan to western India. It inhabits forests, savannas, marshy lowlands, semideserts, and scrub forests, but prefers dry areas with low rainfall and availability of cover. In montane habitats such as in the Ethiopian Highlands, it occurs up to an elevation of .

In Ethiopia&#x27;s Degua Tembien massif, they can be seen along roads, sometimes as roadkills.

In the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, a male caracal was photographed by camera traps in Jebel Hafeet National Park in Al Ain Region, in spring 2019, the first such record since the mid-1980s.

In south-western Turkey, caracals are present in a wildlife reserve in the provinces of Antalya and Muğla that is regularly used for recreational and agricultural activities. However, they avoid humans and are active mostly at night. In Uzbekistan, caracals were recorded only in the desert regions of the Ustyurt Plateau and Kyzylkum Desert. Between 2000 and 2017, 15 individuals were sighted alive, and at least 11 were killed by herders.

In Iran, the caracal has been recorded in Abbasabad Naein Reserve, Bahram’gur Protected Area, Kavir National Park and in Yazd province.

In India, the caracal occurs in Sariska Tiger Reserve and Ranthambhore National Park. The Indian population may be under 100, and is thought extinct in 10 of the 13 Indian states it had historical populations in.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

The caracal is typically nocturnal, though some activity may be observed during the day as well. However, the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed. A study in South Africa showed that caracals are most active when the air temperature drops below ; activity typically ceases at higher temperatures. A solitary cat, the caracal mainly occurs alone or in pairs; the only groups seen are of mothers with their offspring. Females in oestrus temporarily pair with males. A territorial animal, the caracal marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine and probably with dung, which is not covered with soil. Claw scratching is prominent, and dung middens are typically not formed. In Israel, males are found to have territories averaging , while that of females averaged . The male territories vary from in Saudi Arabia. In Mountain Zebra National Park, the home ranges of females vary between . These territories overlap extensively. The conspicuous ear tufts and the facial markings often serve as a method of visual communication; caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving the head from side to side so that the tufts flicker rapidly. Like other cats, the caracal meows, growls, hisses, spits, and purrs.

=== Diet and hunting ===

The caracal typically preys on mammals, which generally comprise at least 80% of its diet; and it also targets small Cercopithecidae monkeys and larger antelopes such as young kudu, impala, mountain gazelle, dorcas gazelle, Cape bushbuck, gerenuk, mountain reedbuck, Sharpe&#x27;s grysbok and springbok. The remaining percentage is made up of lizards, snakes and insects. Rodents comprise a significant portion of its diet in western India. It tends to focus on the most abundant prey species. Occasionally, it consumes grasses and grapes, which help to clear the immune system and stomach of any parasites.

In South Africa, caracals prey on Cape grysbok, common duiker, bush vlei rats, rock hyrax and Cape hare. In areas where sheep and goat are farmed, caracals have also been documented preying on small livestock, but this is however only a small and seasonal portion of their diet when wild prey is scarce. Caracals are estimated to have caused about 11% of African penguin mortality in Simon&#x27;s Town breeding colony between January 1999 and September 2021.

The caracals&#x27;s speed and agility make it an efficient hunter, able to take down prey two to three times its size. The powerful hind legs allow it to leap more than in the air to catch birds on the wing. It can even twist and change its direction mid-air. It is an adroit climber. It stalks its prey until it is within , following which it can launch into a sprint. While large prey such as antelopes are suffocated by a throat bite, smaller prey are killed by a bite on the back of the neck. Kills are consumed immediately, and less commonly dragged to cover. It returns to large kills if undisturbed. It has been observed to begin feeding on antelope kills at the hind parts. It may scavenge at times, though this has not been frequently observed.

=== Reproduction ===

Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are a year old; production of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; a limited number of observations suggest that copulation, lasting nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, which then rolls on the ground. He then approaches and mounts her. The pair separate after copulation.

Gestation lasts about two to three months, following which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvarks and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws not retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around the same time, the kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them every day. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.

In the 1990s, a captive caracal spontaneously mated with a domestic cat in the Moscow Zoo, resulting in a felid hybrid offspring.

== Threats ==
The caracal is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as it is widely distributed in over 50 range countries, where the threats to caracal populations vary in extent. Habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, the building of roads and settlements is a major threat in all range countries. It is thought to be close to extinction in North Africa, critically endangered in Pakistan, endangered in Jordan, but stable in central and Southern Africa. Local people kill caracal to protect livestock, or in retaliation for its preying on small livestock. Additionally, it is threatened by hunting for the pet trade on the Arabian Peninsula. In Turkey and Iran, caracals are frequently killed in road accidents.
In Uzbekistan, the major threat to caracal is killing by herders in retaliation for livestock losses. Guarding techniques and sheds are inadequate to protect small livestock like goats and sheep from being attacked by predators. Additionally, similarly to Ethiopia, heavy-traffic roads crossing caracal habitat pose a potential threat for the species.

== Conservation ==

African caracal populations are listed under CITES Appendix II, while Asian populations come under CITES Appendix I. Hunting of caracal is prohibited in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Caracals occur in a number of protected areas across their range.

In South Africa, the caracal is considered Least Concern, as it is widespread and adaptable to a variety of habitats. It is tolerant to human-dominated areas, although it has been persecuted for many decades. Farmers are encouraged to report sightings of caracals, both dead and alive, and livestock killed by caracals to the national Predation Management Information Centre.

The Central Asian caracal population is listed as Critically Endangered in Uzbekistan since 2009, and in Kazakhstan since 2010.

== In culture ==
The caracal appears to have been religiously significant in the ancient Egyptian culture, as it occurs in paintings and as bronze figurines; sculptures are thought to have guarded the tombs of pharaohs. Embalmed caracals have also been discovered.

The caracal was esteemed for its ability to catch birds in flight and was used for coursing by Mughal emperors in India at least since the Delhi Sultanate. Chinese emperors used caracals as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, Yuan dynasty rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;) and tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;) from Muslim merchants in the western parts of the empire in return for gold, silver, copper cash and silk. According to the &quot;Ming Shilu&quot;, the subsequent Ming dynasty continued this practice. Until the 20th century, the caracal was used in hunts of Indian rulers to hunt small game, while the cheetah was used for larger game. In those times, caracals were used to hunt bustards, francolins, and other game birds. They were also placed in arenas with flocks of pigeons and people would bet on which caracal would kill the largest number of pigeons. This probably gave rise to the expression &quot;to put the cat among the pigeons&quot;. Its pelt was used for making fur coats.

<text>&quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot; is an Imagist poem by Ezra Pound published in April 1913 in the literary magazine &quot;Poetry&quot;. In the poem, Pound describes a moment in the underground metro station in Paris in 1912; he suggested that the faces of the individuals in the metro were best put into a poem not with a description but with an &quot;equation&quot;. Because of the treatment of the subject&#x27;s appearance by way of the poem&#x27;s own visuality, it is considered a quintessential Imagist text.

It is sometimes considered to be the first haiku published in English, though it lacks the traditional 3-line, 17-syllable structure of haiku.

The poem was reprinted in Pound&#x27;s collection &quot;Lustra&quot; in 1917, and again in the 1926 anthology &quot;Personae: The Collected Poems of Ezra Pound&quot;, which compiled his early pre-Hugh Selwyn Mauberley works.

==The poem==
The poem contains only fourteen words (without a verb therein—making it a good example of the verbless poetry form).

Pound was influential in the creation of Imagist poetry until he left the movement to embrace Vorticism in 1914. Pound, though briefly, embraced Imagism stating that it was an important step away from the verbose style of Victorian literature and suggested that it &quot;is the sort of American stuff I can show here in Paris without its being ridiculed&quot;. &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot; is an early work of Modernist poetry as it attempts to &quot;break from the pentameter&quot;, incorporates the use of visual spacing as a poetic device, and does not contain any verbs. The work originally appeared with different spacing between the groups of words. This can be found in the on-line version of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine for April 1913.

==Analysis==

The poem was first published in 1913 and is considered one of the leading poems of the Imagist tradition. Pound&#x27;s process of deletion from thirty lines to only fourteen words typifies Imagism&#x27;s focus on economy of language, precision of imagery and experimenting with non-traditional verse forms. The poem is Pound&#x27;s written equivalent for the moment of revelation and intense emotion he felt at the Paris Metro&#x27;s Concorde station.

The poem is essentially a set of images that have unexpected likeness and convey the rare emotion that Pound was experiencing at that time. Arguably the heart of the poem is not the first line, nor the second, but the mental process that links the two together. &quot;In a poem of this sort,&quot; as Pound explained, &quot;one is trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjective.&quot;

Like other modernist artists of the period, Pound found inspiration in Japanese art, but the tendency was to re-make and to meld cultural styles rather than to copy directly or slavishly. He may have been inspired by a Suzuki Harunobu print he almost certainly saw in the British Library (Rupert Richard Arrowsmith mentions the specific prints he matched to verse), and probably attempted to write haiku-like verse during this period.

<text>The League of American Bicyclists (LAB), officially the League of American Wheelmen, is a membership organization that promotes cycling for fun, fitness and transportation through advocacy and education.
A Section 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the League is one of the largest membership organizations of cyclists in the United States.

==History==

Founded in Newport, Rhode Island, on May 30, 1880, as the League of American Wheelmen by Kirk Munroe and Charles E. Pratt, it soon became the leading national membership organization for cyclists in the United States. The organization&#x27;s first officers were Charles E. Pratt as president, T.K. Longstreet as vice president, O.S. Parsons as corresponding secretary, J.F. Furrell as recording secretary, and H.L. Willoughby as treasurer. The board of directors consisted of two from each state having regularly organization clubs.

Pratt served two terms as the organization&#x27;s first president, from 1880 to 1882. He was the author in 1879 of the first cycling guidebook in the United States, &quot;The American Bicycler: a manual for the observer, the learner and the expert.&quot;

The League was also the governing body for amateur bicycle racing in the U.S. during the late 19th century. Membership peaked at 103,000 in 1898.

=== The 1880–1902 period ===

The League was a prominent advocacy group for the improvement of roads and highways in the United States long before the advent of the automobile. The Good Roads Movement in the late 19th century was founded and led by the League, which began publishing &quot;Good Roads&quot; magazine in 1892.

In the mid-1890s, bicycling became accessible to the population at large with the advent of the mass-produced, chain-driven safety bicycle. A huge boom in bicycle sales occurred, then collapsed as the market became saturated. Bicycle manufacturers were no longer able to support the League financially, and the interest of its members, largely well-to-do hobbyists, turned elsewhere.

In 1894, the League voted to prohibit membership by non-white people, pushed by southern members. Since the League was the governing body for bicycle racing at that time, the League&#x27;s action effectively banned non-white people from most races in the United States. Local clubs had some discretion, as well as a separate racing league being set up, yet racism was still prevalent. Efforts were made the following years to repeal the &quot;white exclusive&quot; clause, an 1895 amendment to reverse the decision was dropped, as a &quot;continued and energetic resistance&quot; ensued before the original League dissolved in 1902. In 1999, a reformed League disavowed the 1894 action.

At its height in 1898, the League had over 103,000 members. Early members included three of the wealthiest men of the Gilded Age: Newport socialites John Jacob Astor, Diamond Jim Brady, and John D. Rockefeller.

Amateur bicycle racing declined with the rise of professional racing. League membership declined to 76,944 in 1900 and only 8,692 in 1902. The League dissolved that year, when there were still only a very few motorized vehicles on the roads. The American Automobile Association was founded the same year, 1902, and was, to an extent, a successor organization. It provided—and still provides—route information to members, as the League had provided. The League&#x27;s Secretary, Abbott Bassett, produced a monthly publication under the League&#x27;s name until 1924, but there was no League organization. Bassett&#x27;s Scrap Book covered topics such as Frank W. Weston&#x27;s role in developing cycling in Boston.

=== The 1939–1955 revival ===
Bicycle club activity revived and was particularly strong in the Chicago area during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Attempts to revive the League were initiated by representatives of the bicycle industry in 1933 and continued through the 1930s, and consisted primarily of a number of exhibitions and races under the League&#x27;s name. Chicago-area bicycle clubs formed the core of a revived League governed by recreational cyclists in 1939 and which adopted a constitution in April 1942. This incarnation of the League was primarily a social organization, holding group rides and annual conventions. World War II contributed to the success of the League through rationing of motor vehicle fuel and tires. Membership was 614 in 1945, with 200 honorary members in the armed services. However, in the late 1940s, the League went into decline. Factors included the increasing availability of motor vehicles; the &quot;baby boom&quot;, which made for difficulties in pursuing recreational cycling; narrow highways; and conformist social attitudes, with a perception of bicycling as a children&#x27;s activity. Membership was only 507 in 1950 and 238 in 1953. The League dissolved again in 1955.

=== 1965–present ===
The League reorganized once again in 1965. By this time, highways had improved, the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System had drained traffic from many of them, and new interest in recreational cycling was spurred by the promotion of sports bicycles with derailleur gearing by the Schwinn Bicycle Company and others. Increasing awareness of the importance of physical fitness also contributed to the popularity of bicycling.

Through the end of the 20th century, the League existed as a national clearinghouse for cycling advocacy, but more so as a social organization, holding three or more regional rallies each year, usually in June, centered on public college campuses in various parts of the US. Each of these rallies featured mapped rides of various lengths, dormitory housing and meals, a variety of cycling-related lectures, and vendors selling products. At their peak, rallies would each attract as many as 2,000 cyclists.

With increasing popularity of bicycling, however, various other organizations adopted functions which the League dropped or did not pursue—most prominently, Bikecentennial (later renamed as the Adventure Cycling Association), which maps touring routes and provides services for touring bicyclists; the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, which promotes conversion of abandoned rail lines to trails; and the Alliance for Biking and Walking (formerly Thunderhead Alliance), a loosely organized consortium of state and local advocacy organizations which maintains communication over the Internet.

In the late 20th century, the League was criticized for its name: League of American Wheel&quot;men&quot;. Also, the term &quot;Wheelmen&quot; was becoming increasingly obscure. In response, the League began doing business as the League of American &quot;Bicyclists&quot; in 1994.

The League reached a peak of 24,000 paid memberships in 1997, then declined to around 20,000, where it has remained since (as of 2009), though it is able to cite larger numbers by using a multiplier for family memberships and counting the approximately 300,000 members of affiliated bicycle clubs and advocacy organizations.

The League&#x27;s rallies became less successful as bicyclists became able to find similar events closer to home. Beginning in 2003, the League would no longer organize its own rallies, but rather, would designate an existing event in one part of the country or another as its National Rally.

A major change in the direction of the League occurred in 1997 when it moved its offices from Baltimore, Maryland, to Washington, D.C., and focused increasingly on advocacy at the federal level. The League has shed most of the services it once provided to individual members, other than its magazine, and now is primarily an advocacy organization. Its major annual event is now the National Bicycle Summit (which see, under Advocacy, below).

The League has continued to play a leading role in cycling issues into the 21st century. One example is the certification of cycling instructors, since the 1970s. The League&#x27;s education program concentrates on practical bicycle handling and traffic skills, and has more than 1,000 active instructors as of 2009. The League&#x27;s Bicycle Friendly America program distributes awards to communities which have adopted measures to accommodate and encourage bicycle use. The League manages liability insurance programs for its instructors and for bicycle clubs, an invaluable service to them.

==Advocacy==
LAB is the voice for cyclists at the national level, and organizes an annual National Bike Summit to bring professionals and advocates in Washington, D.C., together with government representatives. The Summit has attracted around 500 attendees in recent years (as of 2009).

In addition to PeopleForBikes, LAB works in partnership with other organizations such as America Bikes (&quot;leveraging federal transportation dollars for bicycling&quot;, primarily with PeopleForBikes money), the Alliance for Bicycling and Walking (lobbies for government money to encourage bicycle usage while receiving substantial industry funding), Federal Highway Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), NCUTCD and NCUTLO in order to &quot;create a more bicycle-friendly America&quot;.

==Education==
The League offers cycling education for adults and children in many locations across the U.S. Originally the education consisted of a single Effective Cycling (EC) course developed by John Forester and given to the League in 1976. Later, citing poor attendance and blaming the 30-hour length of the EC course, the League developed a curriculum consisting of multiple shorter courses. Forester did not agree with some of the changes to the program and withdrew permission for the League to use the EC name. The name of the League&#x27;s program was then changed to &quot;Bike Ed&quot;. In 2008, the program was renamed &quot;Smart Cycling&quot;.

In addition to sponsoring the biennial &quot;Bicycle Education Leaders Conference&quot;, the League is active in &quot;Safe Routes to School&quot; programs at a national level.

==Bicycle-friendly communities==
, the League has formally recognized 450 communities across all 50 states as bicycle-friendly communities for &quot;providing safe accommodation and facilities for bicyclists and encouraging residents to bike for transportation and recreation.&quot; These are the communities:

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-11:2001, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 11: Latin/Thai alphabet&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 2001. It is informally referred to as Latin/Thai. It is nearly identical to the national Thai standard TIS-620 (1990). The sole difference is that ISO/IEC 8859-11 allocates non-breaking space to code 0xA0, while TIS-620 leaves it undefined. (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.)

&quot;ISO-8859-11&quot; is not a main registered IANA charset name despite following the normal pattern for IANA charsets based on the ISO 8859 series. However, it is defined as an alias of the close equivalent TIS-620 (which lacks the non-breaking space), and which can without problems be used for ISO/IEC 8859-11, since the no-break space has a code which was unallocated in TIS-620. Microsoft has assigned code page 28601 a.k.a. Windows-28601 to ISO-8859-11 in Windows. A draft had the Thai letters in different spots.

As with all varieties of ISO/IEC 8859, the lower 128 codes are equivalent to ASCII. The additional characters, apart from no-break space, are found in Unicode in the same order, only shifted from 0xA1 to U+0E01 and so forth.

The Microsoft Windows code page 874 as well as the code page used in the Thai version of the Apple Macintosh, MacThai, are variants of TIS-620 — incompatible with each other, however.
==Character set==
Code values D1, D4-DA, E7-EE are combining characters.

== Vendor extensions ==

=== Code page 874 (IBM) / 9066 ===
IBM code page 874 (&quot;CP874&quot;, &quot;IBM-874&quot;, &quot;x-IBM874&quot;), also known as Code page 9066 (&quot;IBM-9066&quot;), differs from ISO/IEC 8859-11 in only nine symbols shown boxed in the following table:


=== Code page 1161 ===
Code page 1161 (&quot;CP1161&quot;, &quot;IBM-1161&quot;), is a variant of IBM code page 874. The only difference is the euro sign (€) in position DEhex (222).

=== Code page 874 (Microsoft) / 1162 ===
Windows code page 874 (&quot;windows-874&quot;, &quot;MS874&quot;, &quot;x-windows-874&quot;), known as Code page 1162 (&quot;CP1162&quot;, &quot;IBM-1162&quot;) by IBM, is used by Microsoft Windows. It differs from ISO/IEC 8859-11 only by adding the nine symbols shown in the following table:


=== Mac OS Thai===

This is the variant used on the Classic Mac OS.

<text>Nicolas Freeling (born Nicolas Davidson; 3 March 1927 – 20 July 2003), was a British crime novelist, best known as the author of the &quot;Van der Valk&quot; series of detective novels. A television series based on the character, &quot;Van der Valk&quot;, was produced for the British ITV network by Thames Television during the 1970s and was revived in 1991–92; a remake with new cast, characters, and storylines was launched in 2020 as &quot;Van der Valk&quot;.

==Biography==
Freeling was born in London, but travelled widely, and ended his life at his long-standing home at Grandfontaine to the west of Strasbourg. He had followed a variety of occupations, including the armed services and the catering profession. He began writing during a three-week prison sentence, after being convicted of taking home some veal from a restaurant where he worked, though that was common practice in the restaurant trade.

Freeling got bored with writing about his Amsterdam detective Van der Valk and killed him off in 1972, when the character was shot while following up a rather unpromising lead. Freeling refused to bring the detective back to life and wrote two novels in which his widow Arlette is the detective. Then he started his second detective series, about a French police inspector, Henri Castang to revive his failing income. He eventually revived Van der Valk with &quot;Sand Castles&quot; (1989).

Freeling&#x27;s &quot;The King of the Rainy Country&quot; received a 1967 Edgar Award, from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Novel.

His novel &quot;Gun Before Butter&quot; won France&#x27;s Grand Prix de Littérature Policière and was a runner-up for the UK Crime Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s 1963 Gold Dagger Award.

In 1968 Freeling&#x27;s novel &quot;Love in Amsterdam&quot; was adapted as the film &quot;Amsterdam Affair&quot; directed by Gerry O&#x27;Hara and starring Wolfgang Kieling as Van der Valk.

A radio drama of his Henri Castang novel &quot;The Night Lords&quot; adapted by Michael Bakewell was made in 1990 starring Keith Barron, Richard Vernon, and Edita Brychta as part of the BBC Radio 4 Saturday Night Theatre series.

<text>Michael Cunningham (born November 6, 1952) is an American novelist and screenwriter. He is best known for his 1998 novel &quot;The Hours&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1999. Cunningham is Professor in the Practice of Creative Writing at Yale University.

==Early life and education==
Cunningham was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in La Cañada Flintridge, California. He studied English literature at Stanford University, where he earned his degree. Later, at the University of Iowa, he received a Michener Fellowship and was awarded a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. While studying at Iowa, he had short stories published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;The Paris Review&quot;. His short story &quot;White Angel&quot; was later used as a chapter in his novel &quot;A Home at the End of the World&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Best American Short Stories, 1989&quot;, published by Houghton Mifflin.

In 1988, Cunningham received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and in 1993 a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1995 he was awarded a Whiting Award. Cunningham has taught at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and in the creative writing M.F.A. program at Brooklyn College.

==Career==

&quot;The Hours&quot; established Cunningham as a major force in the American writing sphere, and his 2010 novel, &quot;By Nightfall&quot;, was also well received by U.S. critics. Cunningham edited a book of poetry and prose by Walt Whitman, &quot;Laws for Creations&quot;, and co-wrote, with Susan Minot, a screenplay adapted from Minot&#x27;s novel &quot;Evening&quot;. He was a producer for the 2007 film &quot;Evening&quot;, starring Glenn Close, Toni Collette, and Meryl Streep.

In November 2010, Cunningham judged one of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Three Minute Fiction&quot; contests.

In April 2018, it was announced that Cunningham would serve as consulting producer for a revival of the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; miniseries, which is based on Armistead Maupin&#x27;s book series of the same name. The miniseries premiered on June 7, 2019.

==Personal life==
Although Cunningham is gay, and married to psychoanalyst Ken Corbett, he dislikes being referred to as a gay writer, according to a PlanetOut article. While he often writes about gay people, he does not &quot;want the gay aspects of [his] books to be perceived as their single, primary characteristic.&quot; Cunningham lives in Brooklyn, New York and works in Manhattan.

<text>Arrow Air was a passenger and cargo airline based in Building 712 on the grounds of Miami International Airport (MIA) in Miami-Dade County, Florida. At different times over the years, it operated over 90 weekly scheduled cargo flights, had a strong charter business and at one point operated scheduled international and domestic passenger flights. Its main base was Miami International Airport. Arrow Air ceased operations on June 29, 2010, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 1, 2010. It was then liquidated.

==History==
===California origins===
Arrow Air founder George E. Batchelor was born of Native American ancestry in Shawnee, Oklahoma, in 1920. He became a pilot, and the loss of his first wife and son in a plane crash did not stop him from moving to Compton, California, in 1947 and establishing Arrow Air. The carrier established its base at Torrance Municipal Airport, Torrance, California, from where it operated Douglas DC-3s on passenger and cargo services within the state. The airline halted scheduled operations in 1953 due to Batchelor&#x27;s perception of an anti-competitive regulatory environment in the air transport business. However, Batchelor continued leasing aircraft, often with crews, to other small airlines.

Batchelor moved Arrow Air to South Florida in 1964. Considered a pioneer in both south Florida&#x27;s aviation industry and in the Latin American air cargo market, Batchelor would amass a considerable fortune and donate much of it to homeless and children&#x27;s causes before dying in July 2002.

===Relaunched in 1981===
On May 26, 1981, Arrow Air relaunched as a charter airline under Miami&#x27;s Batchelor Enterprises, whose aviation operations included fixed-base operator (FBO) Batch Air and International Air Leases, Inc., Arrow&#x27;s parent company. (Batch Air eventually became owned by an employee group and was sold to Greenwich Air in 1987 for more than $30 million.) Arrow added scheduled passenger services in April 1982, beginning with California-Montego Bay.

Low fares were causing the company to lose money. In October 1984, it canceled several routes, including Tampa–London. At the same time, the company reoriented its route structure from an east–west alignment to a north–south one, reported Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology. San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the company was building a new hub, was the center of the scheduled network, and by the end of 1985 Arrow Air was flying between SJU and Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, Montreal, Toronto, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Orlando, and Miami. In 1985, more than one million people flew onboard Arrow Air to 245 destinations in 72 countries with the majority of these flights being unscheduled charter service.

Arrow Air was operating Douglas DC-8 and wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft at this time. Like other start-ups, Arrow contracted some functions to other airlines. United Airlines trained Arrow Air crews in Denver, and Florida Air supplemented Batch-Air&#x27;s maintenance work.

The company was approved for military charters in 1984, and in October 1985 won a $13.8 million contract with the Department of Defense. This accounted for only a small segment of Arrow&#x27;s revenues. Most of its business came from scheduled service from Canada and the East Coast to Puerto Rico and Mexico. Commercial charters accounted for another 20 percent or so.

In carrying out its military flights, the airline experienced a large-scale disaster and its second fatal accident and first since the airline&#x27;s relaunch. On December 12, 1985, one of the company&#x27;s DC-8s crashed after takeoff in Gander, Newfoundland, killing 248 soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division and eight of Arrow&#x27;s flight crew personnel. The flight had originated in Cairo and had taken on fuel in Gander after stopping in Cologne, West Germany. The accident resulted in a great deal of unfavorable media coverage and government scrutiny for the airline. Arrow filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on February 11, 1986, laying off 400 employees. However, operations continued.

Richard Haberly was named president of Arrow Air in 1987. Arrow&#x27;s wet lease business—the practice of hiring out planes complete with crews and fuel—began to pick up again. In 1987, Arrow began leasing a DC-8 to LOT Polish Airlines for a Warsaw–New York–Chicago route. It also provided a long-range Douglas DC-8-62CF jet to Air Marshall Islands which was operated in a mixed passenger/freight combi aircraft configuration on flights linking several remote Pacific islands with Honolulu. In early 1991, Arrow was again carrying U.S. troops, this time for the military buildup preceding the war in the Persian Gulf.

Arrow boasted a 98 percent on-time rate and a high degree of customer loyalty. Rates for Latin American cargo fell 15 percent in the early 1990s as U.S. passenger airlines United Airlines and American Airlines paid increased attention to that market. After a few profitable years, Arrow posted losses in 1992 and 1993. Richard Haberly was succeeded as Arrow president in June 1994 by Jonathan D. Batchelor, stepson of chairman and company founder George Batchelor.

In the mid-1990s, Arrow&#x27;s fleet numbered 18 aircraft including Douglas DC-8s and Boeing 727-200s (two of which were configured for passengers). Many of the planes were acquired from bankrupt Eastern Air Lines. The company removed the Boeing 727s from the fleet and began leasing Lockheed L-1011 wide-body jets in 1996 when its fleet numbered just nine aircraft. By this time, charter flights for other airlines were accounting for half of Arrow&#x27;s business.

===Grounded in 1995===
Market conditions were not Arrow&#x27;s only worries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded Arrow in March 1995, charging the carrier had improperly documented maintenance. A company spokesman countered that the grounding was unfair and was related simply to the FAA&#x27;s request that Arrow prints out a hard copy of its fleet records, which were stored electronically. Company officials blamed the affair on a disgruntled employee who had been fired for theft.

Arrow contracted other carriers to handle its business during the crisis. British Airways, for example, handled the route between Columbus, Ohio, and Glasgow, Scotland. Arrow also laid off 368 of its 587 employees. During the shutdown, Arrow lost $3.5 million, plus another $1.5 million in FAA fines.

The FAA allowed the company to begin flying cargo again in June 1995. Soon, Arrow was carrying more international freight at Miami International Airport than any other carrier. It was connecting San Juan to the Northeast via Hartford, Connecticut; to the Midwest via Columbus, Ohio; and to the Southeast via Atlanta.

A restructuring in June 1996 placed Terence Fensome as president and CEO of Arrow Air. Jonathan Batchelor soon took over again as president, but in July 1998 relinquished that role for the positions of chairman and CEO as Guillermo J. &quot;Willy&quot; Cabeza became president and chief operating officer. Cabeza had been vice-president of operations at Arrow.

Arrow failed to profit from the upswing in the economy in 1997. It lost $15.1 million for the year on revenues of $88.3 million. The company had posted losses of $11.3 million in 1996 on revenues of $61.1 million.

Arrow started a new weekly service from Houston to Peru and Ecuador in February 1998. Houston was billing itself as a &quot;Gateway to Latin America&quot; to compete with Miami, which handled 85 percent of cargo traffic to the region. Arrow revenues were $87 million in fiscal 1998.

===A merger and a bankruptcy: 1999–2004===
After a few difficult years, Arrow was acquired by Fine Air Services in early 1999 (the deal was finalized in April) from International Air Leases Inc. for $115 million. Frank and Barry Fine, owners of Fine Air, planned to keep Arrow&#x27;s brand name viable and continued to emphasize scheduled, rather than charter, cargo service. Included in the purchase were 13 Douglas DC-8 jets, four Lockheed L-1011 wide-body jets, 130 jet engines, and spare parts. The buy gave Arrow access to Fine&#x27;s refrigerated distribution facility for handling perishables, which made up the bulk of Latin American cargo.

Unfortunately, Fine Air had its own set of woes resulting from a fatal crash of one of its DC-8s in August 1997. This scuttled Fine&#x27;s planned $123 million initial public offerings. Rising fuel costs, a downturn in the Latin American market, and debt left over from its Arrow Air acquisition combined to make the airline unflyable. Fine lost $108 million in 2000 on revenues of $152 million, and another $36 million on 2001 revenues of $148 million.

The company filed for bankruptcy on September 27, 2000, and subsequently merged with Arrow Air, Inc., leaving behind the Fine Air Services name. The Fine family would no longer control the company. It emerged from Chapter 11 in May 2002 as a unit of Arrow Air Holdings Corp., a Greenwich, Connecticut, investment group led by Dort Cameron.

Revenues were $148 million in 2001 when Arrow had about 800 employees in Miami and another 200 in other locations. The fleet had grown to 16 DC-8s and two Lockheed L-1011s; the carrier had also begun leasing a pair of McDonnell Douglas DC-10s.

The new Arrow was losing $3 million a month, reported Traffic World in early 2002, yet the company aimed to break even by year-end. The withdrawal of Grupo TACA&#x27;s freighters from the market provided Arrow with an opportunity to expand services in Central America with some east–west routes. Arrow re-entered the charter business and diversified geographically via partnerships with airlines such as Atlas Air, Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano, and Air Global International (AGI). AGI had been formed in 2001 and leased two Boeing 747s to carry cargo to South America. Its routes complemented those of Arrow Air, which acquired AGI in March 2002. Operationally, Arrow Air planned to retire its Lockheed L-1011 by 2003 and replace its dozen DC-8s with DC-10s a few years after. In January 2004 Arrow Air filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but exited in June 2004 after a bankruptcy court approved its restructuring.

===Arrow Cargo&#x27;s strategic alliance===
In March 2008, Arrow announced that it entered into a strategic alliance with the firm known as MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities, a private equity investment fund which formerly controlled the Brazilian company Varig Log along with the rebranded ATA Holdings (the parent company of ATA Airlines) which has now been renamed Global Aviation Holdings. As of April, indications were MatlinPatterson would be shuttering Arrow Cargo.

===End of operations===
Arrow Cargo ceased scheduled operations on June 30, 2010. After failing to find a buyer, the company was liquidated.

==Transatlantic and South American routes in 1983-84==

According to the worldwide edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in 1983 Arrow Air was operating scheduled passenger service with stretched Super DC-8 jets between the U.S. and Europe including nonstop flights between London Gatwick Airport (LGW) and both Denver (DEN) and Tampa (TPA) and also direct between Miami (MIA) and both London Gatwick Airport and Amsterdam (AMS) as well as direct between Tampa and Amsterdam. Also according to the OAG, the airline was flying Boeing 707 passenger service nonstop between New York JFK Airport and Georgetown, Guyana at this time. By 1984, Arrow Air was operating nonstop Super DC-8 service between San Juan (SJU) and Amsterdam (AMS) in conjunction with Surinam Airways which was flying connecting service between San Juan and its home base at Paramaribo at the time. None of these flights were operated on a daily basis but were instead primarily flown several days a week.

==Destinations==

===Retired fleet===

Over the years, Arrow Air had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:

==Livery==
The livery used when the airline was operating as Arrow Air had a large dark blue &#x27;A&#x27; on the aircraft tail, one end of which extended into a line along the fuselage below the window-level and to the nose below the cockpit windows. The remainder of the aircraft was white, with &quot;Arrow Air&quot; titles above the windows forward in red. At the time Arrow Cargo ceased operating, its livery consisted of a white fuselage forward, with blue and green to the rear of the aircraft, and with &quot;Arrow Cargo&quot; titles in green accompanied by a blue logo near the front. N140WE was an Arrow Air plane that was painted all white.

==Accidents and incidents==
*December 7, 1949: An Arrow Air Douglas DC-3 (registered N60256), en route from Oakland to Sacramento, flew into the ground near Benicia, California, during bad weather. All aboard (six passengers and three flight crew) were killed, including Batchelor&#x27;s 26-year-old wife, Lorraine, and 2-year-old son, George. The plane crashed into terrain at 800 feet elevation when its reported altitude was 4,000 feet; it was never determined whether the crash was due to pilot error or an instrument malfunction.
*December 12, 1985: An Arrow Air Douglas DC-8-63CF (registered N950JW), operating as Arrow Air Flight 1285R, carrying American military personnel on a charter flight home for Christmas, crashed in Newfoundland, killing all 248 passengers on board and 8 crew members.
* On April 4, 2001, at 01:00 AM Arrow Air Flight from Cali after a refueling stop had a nose landing gear malfunction warning. After checklists completed with putting gear handle down, the nose gear down lock indices were inspected through a viewing hole after depressurizing the jet in flight, and the crew found stowaways in the nose gear compartment and the nose gear down lock 1/8&quot; out of alignment in agreement with the warning. They hoped to land with gear held in place by the 3000 psi hyd pressure. They touched down at 120 kias but at about 90 acidic Skydrol fumes came into the flight deck through the open down lock viewing hole. The fumes turned out to be caused by a broken line in the ceiling of the gear well going to the hyd pressure sensor because of it being tightly held on to by one of the stowaways fearful of the gear doors opening again, evidenced by the stainless line being found broken downwards instead of upwards by the crushing event when the loss of hydraulic pressure through the broken line allowed the nose gear to collapse. The two young men&#x27;s belongings were found next to the hold short line for the runway including a book about the Eastern Airlines L-1011 which had a heated pressurized avionics bay in the nose wheel well. Arrow Air had a L-1011 with the same paint job taking off a couple hours later. The young men mistakenly crawled into the wrong jet to Miami on the dark night at the edge of the runway. This was written by one of the crew members who has evidence and citation of the incident.
* On February 28, 2002, Arrow Air Flight P6L, a Douglas DC-8-62F operated by Arrow Air (registered N1808E), named &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, touched down at Singapore Changi Airport. The tower instructed the aircraft to park at Bay 117. Instead, the aircraft turned right into a grassy area and fell into a ditch where the main landing gears broke off from the aircraft.
*On December 13, 2002, Arrow Air Flight P5L, a Douglas DC-8-62F operated by Arrow Air (registered N1804), named &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot;, flying from Yokota Air Force Base in Japan was approaching runway 20R at Singapore Changi Airport. Due to a miscommunication between the First Officer and Captain during landing, when the aircraft touched down only about 1,500 m of the runway was available. The aircraft overran the runway and came to rest about 300 m from its end.
* In 2004, a former Arrow Air Lockheed L-1011 TriStar that was stored at Miami International Airport was damaged by a hurricane. The aircraft had been retired and was waiting for a new operator.
*June 4, 2006: A McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10F (registered N68047) en route from Miami to Managua touched down fast at Managua and was unable to stop before the end of the runway. The aircraft overran the end of the runway by about . The front landing gear collapsed, which led to substantial damage to the engines on the wing of the aircraft as well as a rupture in a fuel tank.
*On March 26, 2009, Arrow Air Flight 431, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10F, (registered N526MD), en route Manaus-Bogotá lost parts of an engine whilst flying over Manaus. The engine parts fell into the city, damaging 12 houses. The aircraft managed to land safely at El Dorado International Airport, Bogotá, Colombia. No one was injured or killed in this incident.

<text>An asylum seeker is a person who leaves their country of residence, enters another country, and makes in that other country a formal application for the right of asylum according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 14. A person keeps the status of asylum seeker until the right of asylum application has concluded.

The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted the right of asylum protection or whether asylum will be refused and the asylum seeker becomes an illegal immigrant who may be asked to leave the country and may even be deported in line with non-refoulement. Signatories to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are accepted or rejected varies each year from country to country.

The asylum seeker may be simultaneously recognized as a refugee and given refugee status if their circumstances fall into the definition of refugee according to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or regionally applicable refugee laws—such as the European Convention on Human Rights, if within the European Union.

The terms &quot;asylum seeker&quot;, &quot;refugee&quot; and &quot;illegal immigrant&quot; are often confused. In North American English, the term asylee is used both for an asylum seeker, as defined above, and a person whose right of asylum has been granted.

==Asylum and protection==

The right of asylum according to the Article 14 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

Asylum seekers who have committed crimes against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, or other non-political crimes, or whose actions are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, are excluded from international protection. This asylum right is also included in 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. As of 1 July 2013, there were 145 parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention and 146 to the 1967 Protocol. These states are bound by an obligation under international law to grant asylum to people who fall within the definition of Convention and Protocol. Persons who do not fall within this definition may still be granted refugee according to the refugee definitions of 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and persons who fall within this definition are called Convention refugees and their status is called Convention refugee status. Complementary forms of protection exist depending on country if the person falls within other refugee definitions.

The practical determination of whether a person obtains the right of asylum or not is most often left to certain government agencies within the host country. In some countries the refugee status determination (RSD) is done by the UNHCR. The burden of substantiating an asylum claim lies with the claimant, who must establish that they qualify for protection.

In many countries, country-of-origin information is used by migration officials as part of the assessment of asylum claims, and governments commission research into the accuracy of their country reports. Some countries have studied the rejection rates of their migration officials making decisions, finding that individuals reject more applicants than others assessing similar cases—and migration officials are required to standardise the reasons for accepting or rejecting claims, so that the decision of one adjudicator is consistent with what their colleagues decide.

===Subsidiary protection status===
Subsidiary protection is an international protection for persons seeking asylum who do not qualify as refugees. It is an option to get asylum for those who do not have a well-founded fear of persecution (which is required for refugee status according to the 1951 Convention), but do indeed have a substantial risk to be subjected to torture or to a serious harm if they are returned to their country of origin, for reasons that include war, violence, conflict and massive violations of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Union law have a broader definition of who is entitled to asylum.

===Temporary protection visa===
Temporary protection visas are used to persons in Australia who applied for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival. It is the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities and they are required to reapply for it every three years.

==Statistics of asylum decisions==
In the past 20 years the number people applying for asylum every year varied between 0.6 and 2.8 million.
Outcomes of asylum applications 2000-2023 according to UNHCR:

The percentage of women among asylum seekers to Europe from 2008 to 2018 was 31%, which could be explained by factors including gender inequality in origin country and economic incentives.

==Status determination processes==
===Group determination===
Asylum seekers may be given refugee status on a group basis. Refugees who went through the group status determination are also referred to as prima facie refugees. This is done in situations when the reasons for seeking refugee status are generally well known and individual assessment would otherwise overwhelm the capacities of assessors. Group determination is more readily done in states that not only have accepted the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention, but also use a refugee definition that includes people fleeing indiscriminate or generalized violence, which are not covered in the 1951 Convention.

===Individual assessment===
For persons who do not come into the country as part of a bigger group, individual asylum interviews are conducted to establish whether the person has sufficient reasons for seeking asylum. Meanwhile, high numbers of asylum seekers necessitate governments to provide machine learning systems to assist both asylum seekers and immigration officers in performing fair and just assessments.

===Appeals===
In many countries, asylum applicants can challenge a rejection by challenging the decision in a court or migration review panel. In the United Kingdom, more than one in four decisions to refuse an asylum seeker protection are overturned by immigration judges.

==Rights of asylum seekers==

Whilst waiting for a decision asylum seekers have limited rights in the country of asylum. In most countries they are not allowed to work and in some countries not even to volunteer. In some countries they are not allowed to move freely within the country. Even access to health care is limited. In the European Union, those who have yet to be granted official status as refugees and are still within the asylum process have some restricted rights to healthcare access. This includes access to medical and psychological care. However, these may vary depending on the host country. For instance, under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act (&quot;Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz&quot;) in Germany, asylum seekers are outside primary care and are limited to emergency health care, vaccinations, pregnancy and childbirth with limitations on specialty care. Asylum seekers have greater chance of experiencing unmet health needs as compared to the general German population. Asylum seekers also have greater odds of hospital admissions and at least one visit to a psychotherapist relative to the German general population.

== Concerns in asylum-seeking processes ==

Research suggests cross-sector collaboration is key to assist refugees and asylum seekers resettle and integrate into receiving communities, workplaces and schools.

Non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for displaced persons to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As the immigration policy in many countries often focuses on the fight of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border controls, it deters displaced persons from entering territory in which they could lodge an asylum claim. The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force displaced persons to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at illegal entry.

In recent years, the public as well as policy makers of many countries are focusing more and more on refugees arriving through third country resettlement and pay less and less attention to asylum seekers and those who have already been granted refugee status but did not come through resettlement. Asylum seekers have even been referred to as &#x27;queue jumpers&#x27;, because they did not wait for their chance to be resettled.

Legal interpreters are assigned to assist asylum seekers throughout interviews and court proceedings. These legal interpreters reflect the training they received in the training program they were certified in. The accuracy of the legal interpretation may vary depending on the training received from the interpreter and potential biases they carry coming into the interpreting session. Lack of training in asylum settings may influence interpretation sessions.

Quality of life of asylum seekers and refugees is highly correlated with the mental health status. The presence of mental disorders like depression or PTSD is mainly due to the forced migration and the resettlement in host countries.

=== Challenges in Relaying Trauma and Experiences ===
Asylum seekers encounter significant challenges in effectively conveying their traumatic experiences during the asylum application process. A comprehensive study by Sarah C. Bishop, examining nonverbal communication in US asylum interviews and hearings, highlights several critical elements influencing asylum seekers&#x27; ability to articulate their narratives.

The study underscores the complexity of asylum seekers&#x27; narratives, often shaped by emotional distress and the need to recount traumatic events within strict timelines. This pressure contributes to fragmented storytelling. This case leads to difficulties in presenting a coherent account of their experiences.

Language barriers further compound these challenges. Asylum seekers&#x27; linguistic disparities and stress during interviews impede their ability to articulate experiences accurately. Stress-induced memory lapses contribute to incomplete or non-sequential storytelling, affecting the quality and coherence of their narratives.

Additionally, the study delves into nonverbal communication complexities, particularly regarding eye contact and credibility within asylum hearings. Cultural variations in eye contact influence credibility assessments, potentially leading to misinterpretations by immigration personnel. Differing cultural expectations impact asylum seekers&#x27; credibility assessments, potentially affecting the outcomes of their claims.

===Destitution===
Because asylum seekers often have to wait for months or years for the results of their asylum applications and because they are usually not allowed to work and only receive minimal or no financial support, destitution is a considerable risk.

Asylum seekers usually get some kind of support from governments whilst their application is processed. However, in some countries this support ends immediately once they are given refugee status. But the fact that they were given refugee status does not mean that they were already given all the documents they need for starting their new lives.
Long waiting times significantly reduce the likelihood to obtain a job and the social integration of refugees.

===Vacation===
Asylum seekers vacationing in home country has been argued as a reason for refusal of asylum.

=== Identity ===
Absence of identity documents or disputes of identity can make the demonstration of persecution for the right of asylum more complex.

==Refusal of asylum==

It often happens that the country neither recognizes the refugee status of the asylum seekers nor sees them as legitimate migrants and thus treats them as illegal aliens. If an asylum claim has been rejected, the asylum seeker is said to be refused asylum and called a failed asylum seeker. Some failed asylum seekers return home voluntarily. Depending on the country, failed asylum seekers are allowed to remain temporarily or are forcibly returned in line with non-refoulement. The latter are most often placed in immigration detention before being deported.

<text>Guillaume Durand, or William Durand (c. 1230 – 1 November 1296), also known as Durandus, Duranti or Durantis, from the Italian form of Durandi filius, as he sometimes signed himself, was a French canonist and liturgical writer, and Bishop of Mende.

==Life==
Durand was born at Puimisson, near Béziers, of a noble family of Languedoc. He studied law at Bologna, with Bernard of Botone, and by about 1264 was teaching canon law with success at Modena. Pope Clement IV, another Frenchman, called him to the pontifical court as a chaplain and auditor of the palace, and in 1274 he accompanied Clement&#x27;s successor, Pope Gregory X, to the Second Council of Lyons, the constitutions of which he helped draw up. As spiritual and temporal legate of the patrimony of St. Peter, he received in 1278, in the pope&#x27;s name, the homage of Bologna and the other cities of Romagna. Pope Martin IV made him vicar spiritual in 1281, then governor of Romagna and of the March of Ancona (1283). In the midst of the struggles between Guelfs and Ghibellines, Durand successfully defended the papal territories, both by diplomacy and by arms. Pope Honorius IV retained him in his offices, and although elected bishop of Mende in 1286, he remained in Italy until 1291. In 1293 he created a rite for all those who were taking up the cross to participate in the crusades, “to go in aid of the Holy Land”. In September 1294 he was present at Orleans at the Provincial Council presided over by Simon, Bishop of Bourges. In 1295 he refused the archbishopric of Ravenna, offered him by Pope Boniface VIII, but accepted the task of pacifying his former provinces of Romagna and the March of Ancona. In 1296 he withdrew to Rome, where he died. His tomb is in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

Durand&#x27;s nephew, also called Guillaume Durand, was also a canonist. Guillaume Durand the Younger, a later bishop of Mende, was an advocate of ecclesiastical reform at the Council of Vienne.

==Important works==
Durand&#x27;s principal work is the &quot;Speculum iudiciale&quot;, which was compiled in 1271, and revised in 1286 and 1291. It is a general explanation of civil, criminal, and canonical procedure, and also includes a survey of the subject of contracts. It is a remarkable encyclopaedic synthesis of Roman and ecclesiastical law, distinguished by its clarity, its method, and especially its practical sense, and it was long highly regarded in the courts as in the schools. It won Durand the nickname of &quot;Doctor Speculator&quot;, an obvious pun on the title of his work. It was commented upon by Giovanni d&#x27;Andrea (in 1346), and by Baldus. In 1306 Cardinal Béranger drew up an alphabetic table of its contents (&quot;Inventorium&quot;). There are many manuscripts of the &quot;Speculum&quot;, and several printed editions, of which the most usual is that of Turin in 1578 in 2 volumes, containing all additions among them those by Giovanni d&#x27;Andrea and tables. This edition was reproduced at Frankfurt in 1612 and 1668.

Another important work by Durand was the &quot;Rationale divinorum officiorum&quot;, a liturgical treatise written in Italy before 1286, on the origin and symbolic sense of Christian ritual. It presents a picture of the liturgy of the 13th century in the West, studied in its various forms, its traditional sources, and its relation to the church buildings and furniture. It long served as a major authority on medieval Latin liturgy and ran through various editions from its first printing in 1459. The other important works of Durand comprise:
*&quot;Repertorium iuris canonici&quot; (&quot;Breviarium aureum&quot;), a collection of citations from canonists on questions of controversy, often published along with the &quot;Speculum&quot;
*&quot;Commentarius in sacrosanctum Lugdunense concilium&quot; (ed. Fano, 1569), of especial value owing to Durand&#x27;s part in drawing up the council&#x27;s constitutions, and inserted by Pope Boniface VIII in the &quot;Sextus&quot;.

<doc id="276009" wikidata="Q366985" url="?curid=276009" title="Lake Simcoe">
<text>Lake Simcoe is a lake in southern Ontario, Canada, the fourth-largest lake wholly within the province, after Lake Nipigon, Lac Seul, and Lake Nipissing. At the time of the first European contact in the 17th century, the lake was called Ouentironk (&quot;Beautiful Water&quot;) by the native Wendat/Ouendat (Huron) people. It was also known as &quot;Lake Taronto&quot; until it was renamed by John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, in memory of his father, Captain John Simcoe of the Royal Navy. In Anishinaabemowin, the historical language of the First Nations living around this lake, namely Anishinaabek of Rama and Georgina Island First Nations, the lake is called Zhooniyaang-zaaga&#x27;igan, meaning &quot;Silver Lake&quot;.

==Toponymy==
Lake Simcoe&#x27;s name was given by John Graves Simcoe in 1793 in memory of his father, Captain John Simcoe. Captain Simcoe was born on 28 November 1710, in Staindrop, in County Durham, northeast England, and served as an officer in the Royal Navy, dying of pneumonia aboard his ship, HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot;, on 15 May 1759.

Historically, at the time of the first European contact in the 17th century, the lake was called &quot;Ouentironk&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Water&quot;) by the Wyandot (Huron) natives; The Wyandot name for the lake was rendered as &quot;Wentaron&quot; in European sources up until the 20th century.
A 1675 map by Pierre Raffeix referred to the lake with the French term &quot;Lac Taronto&quot; and a 1687 map by Lahontan called it &quot;Lake Taronto&quot;, while the name &quot;Tarontos Lac&quot; appeared on a 1678 map of New France by cartographer Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin. The term Taranto refers to an Iroquoian expression meaning gateway or pass. Taronto had originally referred to The Narrows, a channel of water through which Lake Simcoe discharges into Lake Couchiching. (Natural Resources Canada gives a related translation: &quot;it originated as the Mohawk phrase tkaronto, which means &quot;where there are trees standing in the water&quot;. According to several Mohawk speakers and aboriginal language expert John Steckley. Mohawks used the phrase to describe The Narrows, where Hurons and other natives drove stakes into the water to create fish weirs. Since then, many subsequent mapmakers adopted this name for it, though cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli is thought to have introduced the more commonly used spelling of &quot;Toronto&quot; in a map he created in 1695.

The name &#x27;Toronto&#x27; found its way to the current city through its use in the name for the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail (or Toronto Passage), a portage running between Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay, that passed through Lake Toronto, which in turn was used as the name for an early French fort located at the foot of the Toronto Passage, on Lake Ontario. The Severn River, its outlet stream, was once called &#x27;Rivière de Toronto&#x27; which flows into Georgian Bay&#x27;s Severn Sound, then called the &#x27;Baie de Toronto&#x27;.

Later French traders referred to it as &quot;Lac aux Claies&quot;, meaning &quot;Lake of Grids (or Trellises)&quot; in reference to the Huron fishing weirs in the lake. It was known by this name until the beginnings of Upper Canada, when it was renamed to Lake Simcoe.

==Geography==

The lake is bordered by Simcoe County, Durham Region, and York Region. The city of Barrie is located on Kempenfelt Bay, and Orillia is located at the entrance to Lake Couchiching. The watershed draining into the lake contains a population of roughly half a million people, including the northern portion of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).

The town of Georgina lies along the entire south shore of Lake Simcoe and consists of smaller residential towns and communities, including Keswick on Cook&#x27;s Bay, Sutton, Jackson&#x27;s Point, Pefferlaw, and Udora.

The town of Innisfil occupies the western shore south of Barrie and north of Bradford. Eastside Simcoe includes the towns of Beaverton, Brechin and Lagoon City.

Lake Couchiching was at one time thought of as a third bay of Simcoe, known as the Bristol Channel; however, the narrows between the two bodies of water separate them enough to consider this to be another lake. The narrows, known as &quot;where trees stand in the water&quot;, an interpretation of the word &#x27;Toronto&#x27;, was an important fishing point for the First Nations peoples who lived in the area, and the Mohawk term &quot;toran-ten&quot; eventually gave its name to Toronto by way of the portage route running south from that point, the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. Radiocarbon dating of surviving stakes reveals that the weirs at The Narrows were in use more than 4,000 years ago. The meaning of &quot;where trees stand in the water&quot;, is likely to have originated from Huron practice of driving stakes into the channel sediments to corral fish. Fresh-cut saplings placed in the water and sediments would have sprouted branches and leaves, persisting for some time, leading to a place &quot;where trees stand in the water&quot;.

===Islands===
Lake Simcoe contains a large island, Georgina, which along with Snake Island and Fox Island forms the reserve of the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation. The lake is dotted with several smaller islands, including Thorah Island (a cottage destination), Strawberry Island, Snake Island, Helmers Island and Fox Island. Pope John Paul II stayed on Strawberry Island for four days just before World Youth Day 2002 in Toronto. 

Before the completion of the Trent Severn Waterway, the water level on Lake Simcoe was quite low enabling residents to cross in wagons or walk in ankle deep water to the mainland. However, when it was completed, the water table increased by several feet. Grape Island on the north end the lake is located off of Orillia. To the east of Grape Island is Goffatt Island, a small and private island located within Ramara.

Georgina, Snake and Fox Islands are within York Region, Thorah is within Durham Region, where as Strawberry Island and Helmers Island are privately owned but within the boundaries of Ramara in Simcoe County. Grape is within Orillia and Goffatt is within Ramara with both owned privately by residents.

==Geology==
The lake is about long, wide and in area. Lake Simcoe is a remnant of a much bigger prehistoric lake known as Lake Algonquin. This lake&#x27;s basin also included Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Nipigon, and Lake Nipissing. The melting of an ice dam at the close of the last ice age greatly reduced water levels in the region, leaving the lakes of today.

The lake is located on Paleozoic limestone of the Ordovician period. However, due to deep deposits of glacial sediments, this bedrock only appears exposed along the lakeshore on Georgina Island. This rock, however, also appears along the shore of Lake Couchiching, where sediments are thinner. The outlet of the lake at the north end of Lake Couchiching is controlled by Precambrian bedrock which first makes its appearance about mid-way along this lake. As a result, the lake has persisted to the present, with the outlet-flow unable to cut down through the rock, and thereby draining the lake. This is unlike its one-time smaller sister-lake of &#x27;Lake Minesing&#x27; to the west, being a remnant of Lake Algonquin, and, later the Nipissing stage of Lake Huron. This lake&#x27;s outlet was founded on sediments located near Edenvale, which have largely been cut through, draining most of the lake. Today &#x27;Lake Minesing&#x27; exists as the Minesing Swamp, but it re-establishes itself for a short period each spring when spring run-off floods the basin.

Isostatic rebound from the retreat of the last glaciers results in a steady rise of Lake Simcoe, particularly at its south end, and is further responsible for the deep organic sediments that have accumulated in its one-time shallow southern arm, known as the Holland Marsh. Here, organic deposits created by vegetation have largely kept pace with the steady rise in water level, and today supports extensive market gardening. All rivers, and most streams, flowing into the lake have wide, deep, navigable mouths as a consequence of the rising waters drowning the river channels.

2017 data for the year prior from the NOAA shows the lake has a yearly average surface temperature of .

==Ecology==

When a lake is healthy, cold-water fish such as lake trout, herring, and whitefish are abundant and active. It is sometimes known as Canada&#x27;s ice fishing capital.

===Ecological issues===
Lake Simcoe has been victim to significant eutrophication. Lake Simcoe has seen a dramatic decline in some fish species, along with an increase in algae blooms and aquatic weed growth. Phosphorus emissions from both urban and rural sources have upset the lake&#x27;s ecosystem and fostered excessive aquatic plant growth, raising water temperatures, and decreasing oxygen levels, thereby rendering limited breeding grounds inhospitable.

Lake Simcoe has been victim to zebra mussel, purple loosestrife, black crappie, spiny water flea, round goby, rusty crayfish and Eurasian milfoil invasions.

The zebra mussel, which arrived in North American waters in 1985, originated in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea area and is thought to have been brought to North America in the ballast of foreign freighters. Zebra mussels are particularly harmful to Lake Simcoe because they increase the clarity of the water allowing sunlight to penetrate to the bottom of the lake, where more algae and aquatic weeds can grow, accelerating the eutrophication process.

The Rainbow Smelt are another introduced species and they were first observed in the early 1960s. They were believed to compete with native Lake Whitefish and be somewhat responsible for a decline in their populations.

Several initiatives, such as the Lake Simcoe Environmental Management Strategy (LSEMS), the Lake Simcoe Conservation Foundation, and the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, are making efforts to rectify some of the lake&#x27;s environmental woes. A local activist group, &quot;The Ladies of the Lake&quot;, are using the $250,000 they raised from the sale of a nude picture calendar to rally government, business, the school system, and the local citizenry to rescue the lake. Several towns and communities on the lakeshore depend on Lake Simcoe for their drinking water.

The Region of York is currently finalizing plans for a sewage treatment plant to be constructed on the shores of Lake Simcoe to be located on the Holland River in Cook&#x27;s Bay. This plant&#x27;s purpose is to support intensification of development in the Lake Simcoe watershed.

==Watershed==
A number of southern Ontario rivers flow, generally north, into the lake, draining of land. From the east, the Talbot River, part of the Trent–Severn Waterway, is the most important river draining into Lake Simcoe, connecting the lake with the Kawartha lakes system and Lake Ontario. From its connection to Lake Couchiching, the Severn River is the only drainage from the lake to Georgian Bay, part of Lake Huron (Simcoe itself is not one of the Great Lakes). The canal locks of the Trent-Severn Waterway make this connection navigable.

A number of creeks and rivers flow into the lake:

* Black River
* Bluffs Creek
* Beaver River
* Holland River
* Maskinonge River
* Pefferlaw River
* Talbot River
* White&#x27;s Creek
* Duclos Creek
* Burnie Creek
* Virginia CreekA
* Virginia CreekB
* Virginia CreekC
* Virginia CreekD

==Recreation==

The lake has little commercial activity, but sees many recreational uses. In the winter, it freezes over completely and hosts a number of ice fishing competitions, making it one of the most intensely fished lakes in Ontario. However, claims that it is one of the world&#x27;s largest lakes that freeze over completely in winter are pure speculation, and, in fact, spurious; Canada alone has a large number of lakes of the same size or larger that do the same.

In the summer, fishing is still an attraction; however, there are also a number of poker runs, jet-skiing, and other boating events. The lake is surrounded with summer cottages leading to heavy recreational and boating use in summer.

There are a number of beaches which attract visitors from the greater Toronto area, as Lake Simcoe has a reputation for cleaner and warmer water than nearby Lake Ontario beaches. Many of the beaches are used for kite surfing as well. Willow Beach in Georgina on the south shore is one of the largest and most popular public beaches on Lake Simcoe.

There are seven yacht clubs (sailing) around the lake, which host a number of regattas, and an active sailing community exists on the lake.

The lake also forms part of the Trent–Severn Waterway system that links Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay/Lake Huron.

Lake Simcoe is also well known for its scuba diving. The ship &quot;J. C. Morrison&quot; sank in 1857 and is a great dive site off Centennial Beach. There are also a number of other popular scuba diving entrance points popular among freshwater divers. Kempenfelt Bay is the most popular for scuba divers as it is the deepest. Visibility ranges from over to almost zero.

===Maritime enforcement===
Ontario Provincial Police, South Simcoe Police Service, York Regional Police, Durham Regional Police, and Barrie Police have marine units that patrol on the waters of the lake. Georgina Island Police patrol on Georgina, Fox and Snake Islands with some capability to respond to marine needs off these islands. As part of Orillia, Grape Island is policed by the OPP.

<doc id="276011" wikidata="Q131744" url="?curid=276011" title="List of cities and towns in Croatia">
<text>An urbanized area in Croatia can gain the status of &quot;grad&quot; (which can be translated as town or city as there is no distinction between the two terms in Croatian) if it meets one of the following requirements:
# is the center of a county (&quot;županija&quot;), or
# has more than 10,000 residents, or
# is defined by an exception (where the necessary historical, economic or geographic reasons exist)

A city (town) represents an urban, historical, natural, economic and social whole. The suburbs comprising an economic and social whole with the city, connected with it by daily migration movements and daily needs of the population of local significance, may also be included into the composition of a city as unit of local self-government.

Grad (city/town) is the local administrative equivalent of općina (translated as &quot;municipality&quot;), with the only distinction being that the former usually comprise urban areas whereas the latter commonly consist of a group of villages. Both municipalities and city/towns often comprise more than one settlement, as the administrative territory of a &quot;grad&quot; may include suburban villages or hamlets near the city/town in question. Settlements (&quot;naselja&quot;) are the third-level spatial units of Croatia, and the smallest unit for which the decennial census data are published by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics but are not administrative entities, i.e. they are governed by the municipal or city/town council of the local administrative unit they belong to.

Croatian cities are administratively subdivided into &quot;city districts&quot; (&quot;gradski kotari/gradske četvrti&quot;) and/or &quot;local committees&quot; (&quot;mjesni odbori&quot;) with elected councils. The City of Zagreb, as the capital, not being part of any county, is subdivided into both city districts and local committees.

*In December 1992 there were 70 cities and towns and 419 municipalities in Croatia organized into 20 counties (plus the city of Zagreb which is both a city and a county).
*In 2001 there were 122 cities and towns (excluding Zagreb) and 423 municipalities. This was the territorial division used for the 2001 census.
*In 2006 a revision was made, which listed a total of 127 cities and towns and 429 municipalities in Croatia. This division was used for the 2011 census.
*In 2013 the municipality of Popovača was upgraded to town, bringing the total to 128 cities and towns and 428 municipalities.

According to the Constitution, the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia, has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county.

==Tasks and organization ==
Cities (in English these would be called &quot;towns&quot;), within their self-governing scope of activities, perform the tasks of local significance, which directly fulfil the citizens&#x27; needs, and which were not assigned to the state bodies by the Constitution or law, particularly the tasks referring to urban design of settlements and dwelling, zoning and urban planning, communal activities, child care, social welfare, primary health care, personality development and primary education, culture, physical culture and sports, consumers protection, protection and improvement of the natural environment, fire and civil defence, local transport.

&quot;Big cities&quot; (&quot;big city&quot; is a Croatian legal term, in English these would be just &quot;cities&quot;), i.e. cities with more than 35,000 inhabitants that are also economic, financial, cultural, public health, scientific or traffic centres and cities that are county seats, in addition to these tasks, are also responsible for tasks regarding public roads maintenance and issuing of building and location permits.

=== City government ===
City council (&quot;Gradsko vijeće&quot;) is the representative body of citizens and the body of local self-government. The councillors are elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d&#x27;Hondt method. The executive head of the city is the mayor (&quot;gradonačelnik&quot;), also elected in direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) for a four-year term (together with one or two deputy mayors). The mayor (with the deputy mayor/s) can be recalled by a referendum. City administrative departments and services manage administrative procedures in their areas of jurisdiction. The mayor names heads (principals) of the departments and services, who are chosen on the basis of a public competition.

==List of cities and towns==
The following is a complete list of all officially designated 128 cities/towns in Croatia, sorted by population according to the 2021 population census. At the time of the 2001 census, there had been 123 cities/towns in the country and four former municipalities were administratively upgraded to towns prior to the 2011 census: Vodnjan (in 2003), Kutjevo, Otok, and Sveta Nedelja (in 2006). In addition, the table includes data for Popovača, also a former municipality which was re-designated as town in the administrative revision in April 2013.

The Municipal column in the table lists total population within the geographical boundary of the local administrative subdivision. This means that the figure often includes other smaller settlements such as villages or hamlets located on the outskirts or near the city/town proper. In contrast, the Town/City proper column lists only population of the city/town proper, without the smaller settlements which administratively belong to the city. Both numbers are given as in some cases the figures may vary dramatically (for example Velika Gorica with nearby settlements has a population of around 61,000 but the town proper has only 30,000 residents).

The town of Kaštela is a unique exception in that it only exists as an administrative unit - it is legally treated as an agglomeration of seven separate settlements with populations ranging from 3,000 to 7,000, none of which is actually called &quot;Kaštela&quot;. Its town council is located in Kaštel Sućurac.

Another set of exceptions arises from the special status of the City of Zagreb, which is considered both a county and a city, and is further subdivided into city districts, local committees and settlements. Unlike its other districts, the district of Sesvete still has the status of a standalone settlement with a population of about 55,000. This would make it a large city in itself, but it does not have the administrative status of a city.

<doc id="276013" wikidata="Q328959" url="?curid=276013" title="Localities of Iceland">
<text>Most municipalities in Iceland include more than one settlement. For example, four localities (Selfoss, Stokkseyri, Eyrarbakki, and Tjarnabyggð) can all be found in the municipality of Árborg.

A number of municipalities only contain a single locality, while there are also a few municipalities in which no localities exist. All localities in Iceland can only be located within a single municipality, i.e. they cannot straddle multiple municipality borders. Some municipalities, such as Hafnarfjörður and Akranes, also share the same name with a locality. However, these localities are not always situated in their namesake municipalities. In those cases, this does not necessarily mean that they there are no other localities included in that particular municipality. Even when they are the only locality there, they do not always encompass the span of that municipality&#x27;s entire land area.


== List of localities ==
The majority of the functions that are carried out by &quot;local governments&quot; actually happen at the municipal level. However, most settlements in Iceland are broken down further into the &quot;locality&quot; level, which are mainly used for information collection and statistical analysis purposes only—essentially, a census division.

<doc id="276014" wikidata="Q139655" url="?curid=276014" title="James E. Davis (New York politician)">
<text>James E. Davis (April 3, 1962 – July 23, 2003) was an American politician who served on the New York City Council from 2002 until his assassination.

==Early life==
Davis was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a corrections officer and a registered nurse. He was raised with his brother Geoffrey A. Davis. He spent his early childhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant before his family moved to Crown Heights.

He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Pace University in social science and youth agency administration. He became a corrections officer at Rikers Island after being beaten by two white police officers, and then became a police officer himself in 1991. In 1990, Davis had started an organization called &quot;Love Yourself Stop the Violence&quot; dedicated to stopping violence in urban America. The NYPD soon assigned Davis to the New York City Police Academy as an instructor, and he became a frequent guest on local radio and television programs.

==Political career==

Davis eventually qualified as a minister at Holy Trinity Baptist Church of Brooklyn and became a district leader and then a council member for Brooklyn&#x27;s 35th Council district in November 2001.

The template for his successful City Council bid had been established by previous races against Assemblyman and Democratic Kings County Chairman Clarence Norman Jr., who narrowly defeated him in 1998. The campaign against the politically powerful Norman—and Davis&#x27;s high-profile generally—ruffled feathers within the NYPD, and Davis was fired for violating a rule that prohibits paid city employees from engaging in electoral politics. In that November&#x27;s election, his name was on the ballot on the old Liberal Party of New York line, for which Davis was fired from the NYPD. After pursuing litigation against the police department, Davis&#x27;s claim that he never formally accepted the Liberal Party nomination was upheld and he was allowed to reclaim his job. He was not, however, permitted to return to his former detail at the police academy, instead being assigned to a night shift at a Brooklyn precinct.

His next campaign in 2001 was successful but would later be a factor in his murder. Othniel Askew had raised funds to run against him, but had failed to file the proper papers on time, which led to accusations of political chicanery and caused Askew to harbor a grudge against Davis.

==Assassination==

On July 23, 2003, Davis brought Askew to attend a council meeting at the council chambers in New York City Hall, with the intention of honoring him by introducing him from the balcony. The councilman and Askew were able to bypass the metal detectors, a courtesy offered to elected officials and their guests. Once in the balcony, and as the full council and dozens of attendees gathered into the chamber for the meeting, at 2:08 p.m., Askew fired a silver .40 caliber weapon at Davis, striking him several times in the torso. Davis, a retired police officer, was carrying a weapon, but it remained holstered. A plainclothes policeman, Richard Burt, on duty as bodyguard to Gifford Miller, Speaker of the City Council, then fired at Askew from the floor of the chamber, striking Askew five times. Paramedics arrived quickly, and attempted to revive both Davis and Askew before taking them to Beekman Downtown Hospital, where both men died. Askew had a history of violence. It was discovered after the murder that Askew had asked Davis to sign papers naming him as Davis&#x27;s replacement in case anything happened to Davis.

===Aftermath===
Davis&#x27;s brother Geoffrey announced that he would run for the seat formerly held by his brother. He was defeated by fellow Democrat Letitia James, running on the Working Families Party line.

== Legacy ==
===Memorial===
Davis was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Upon learning his killer&#x27;s ashes were also in Green-Wood, Davis&#x27;s family had his body exhumed and reinterred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens.

===&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode===
The murder incident would be used as the basis for &quot;City Hall&quot;, an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; which aired on February 11, 2004. However, in the adaptation, the dead councilman was an innocent bystander, with the second victim, a low-level bureaucrat who survived with a shoulder wound, as the true target.

<text>Randonneurs USA or &quot;RUSA&quot; is affiliated to Audax Club Parisien and coordinates and promotes the randonneuring style of cycling within the US. Many cycling events, or brevets, which are organized by local RUSA clubs in the United States are sanctioned by the Audax Club Parisien and therefore can be used to qualify for Paris–Brest–Paris and other long brevets around the world.

==History==
&quot;RUSA&quot; was formed in 1998 by Jennifer Wise, Johnny Bertrand and John Wagner, along with six others. 

*Members from the first year (as of October 1998)

==RUSA specific events==
In addition to the support for &quot;ACP&quot; events, &quot;RUSA&quot; offers several other events including &quot;RUSA-ONLY&quot; brevets. A very popular RUSA only event is the Permanent. 

The &quot;Permanent&quot; is a &quot;members-only&quot; event where previously a member would contact an individual Permanent Owner to sign up to do the Permanent and then eventually ride the Permanent. By the beginning of 2021, for insurance purposes RUSA became the owner of Permanent routes, and members now register online to ride a route (immediately after registration, if desired). The Permanent can be used to help complete other RUSA ONLY awards such as the R-12 or RUSA Distance Awards. 

A great way for a rider to get introduced to Randonneuring is by riding a Populaire, which is a shorter distance Brevet - 100-199 km in length. By doing so, newcomers get to know and learn about long distance rides style and rules of Randonneuring.

==Major brevets==
The longest brevets organised by RUSA include:
*Cascade 1200 (Seattle International Randonneurs)
*Colorado High Country 1200 (Rocky Mountain Cycling Club)
*Cracker Swamp 1200 (Central Florida Randonneurs)
*Endless Mountains 1240K Randonnée (PA Randonneurs)
*Florida Sunshine 1200k (Central Florida Randonneurs)
*Gold Rush Randonnée (Davis Bike Club)
*Last Chance 1200k Randonnée (Rocky Mountain Cycling Club)
*Taste of Carolina (Bicycle for Life)
*Texas Rando Stampede (Lone Star Randonneurs)

<text>Jean-Barthélemy Hauréau (; 9 November 1812 – 29 April 1896) was a 19th-century French historian, journalist and administrator.

== Education and appointments ==
Born in Paris, he was educated at the Louis-le-Grand and Bourbon colleges in his native city, and won high honours at his public examination. After graduating he became a journalist, and soon was a contributor to several democratic papers: &quot;La Tribune&quot;, &quot;Le National&quot;, &quot;Le Droit&quot;, and &quot;La Revue du Nord&quot;; at &quot;Le National&quot;, he was praised by Théophile Gautier as the &quot;tribune&quot; of romanticism. At the age of twenty he published a series of apologetic studies on the Montagnards — in later years, regretting his youthful enthusiasm, he attempted to destroy the studies. In 1838 he took the chief editorship of the &quot;Courrier de la Sarthe&quot; and was appointed librarian of the city of Le Mans, which position he retained until 1845, when he was dismissed on account of comments of his on the daring speech of the Mayor of le Mans to the Duke of Nemours. He returned to Paris and once more became one of the editors of &quot;Le National&quot;.

At this time he seemed destined for a political career, and after the revolution of 24 February 1848 was elected to the National Assembly; but close contact with revolutionary men and ideas cooled his old ardour. Throughout his life he opposed innovation, not only in politics and religion, but also in literature. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; he resigned his position as director of the manuscript department of the Bibliothèque Nationale, to which he had been appointed in 1848, and refused to accept an administrative post until after the fall of the empire. Having acted as director of the national printing press from 1870 to 1881, he retired, but in 1893 accepted the post of director of the Fondation Thiers. He was also a member of the council of improvement of the École des Chartes.

==Historical writing==
For over half a century he wrote on the religious, philosophical, and more particularly the literary history of the Middle Ages. Appointed librarian of the town of Le Mans in 1838, he was first attracted by the history of Maine, and in 1843 published the first volume of his &quot;Histoire littéraire du Maine&quot; (4 vols., 1843–1852), which he subsequently recast on a new plan (10 vols., 1870–1877). In 1845 he brought out an edition of vol. ii of Gilles Ménage&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de Sablé&quot;. He then undertook the continuation of the &quot;Gallia christiana&quot;, and produced vol. xiv (1856) for the province of Tours, vol. xv (1862) for the province of Besançon, and vol. xvi (1865–1870) for the province of Vienne. This work gained him admission to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1862).

In the &quot;Notices et extraits des manuscrits&quot; he inserted several papers which were afterwards published separately, with additions and corrections, under the title &quot;Notices et extraits de quelques manuscrits de la Bibliothèque nationale&quot; (6 vols., 1890–1893). To the &quot;Histoire littéraire de la France&quot; he contributed a number of studies, among which must be mentioned that relating to the sermon-writers (vol. xxvi), whose works, being often anonymous, raise many problems of attribution.

Among his other works were the remarkable &quot;Histoire de la philosophie scolastique&quot; (1872–1880); &quot;Les Mélanges poétiques d&#x27;Hildebert de Lavardin&quot; (1852); an edition of the Works of Hugh of St Victor (1886); a critical study of the Latin poems attributed to St Bernard (1870); and &quot;Bernard Délicieux et l&#x27;Inquisition albigeoise&quot; (1877). To these must be added his contributions to the &quot;Dictionnaire des sciences philosophiques&quot;, Didot&#x27;s &quot;Biographie générale&quot;, the &quot;Bibliothèque de l&#x27;École des Chartes&quot;, and the &quot;Journal des savants&quot;.

From the time of his appointment to the Bibliothèque Nationale up to the last days of his life he was engaged in making abstracts of all the medieval Latin writings (many anonymous or of doubtful attribution) relating to philosophy, theology, grammar, Canon law, and poetry, carefully noting on cards the first words of each passage.

He died in Paris. After his death this index of &quot;incipits&quot;, arranged alphabetically, was presented to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and a copy was placed in the manuscript department of the Bibliothèque Nationale.

But of all the work of the industrious and wise writer, the one which especially contributed to its reputation is his continuation of the &quot;Gallia Christiana&quot; of the Benedictines. This work was started and continued until the 13th volume by the Benedictine of the Abbaye de Saint-Maur. Between 1856 and 1870 Haureau added three more volumes, written in Latin to maintain the unity of the work. The Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres has several times awarded its own Prix Gobert to this work of high scholarship (not to be confused with the Grand prix Gobert of the Académie française).

<doc id="276034" wikidata="Q773999" url="?curid=276034" title="Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others">
<text>The Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others was approved by the United Nations General Assembly on 2 December 1949, and entered into force on 25 July 1951. The preamble states:

&quot;Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family, and the community&quot;

As of December 2013, 82 states were party to the convention (see map). An additional 13 states had signed the convention, but had not yet ratified it.

The convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem, in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms &quot;white slave traffic&quot; and &quot;women&quot;, using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language. To fall under the provisions of the 1949 convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.

==Provisions==
The convention requires state parties to punish any person who &quot;procures, entices, or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person&quot;, &quot;exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person&quot; (Article 1), or runs a brothel or rents accommodations for prostitution purposes (Article 2). It also prescribes procedures for combating international traffic for the purpose of prostitution, including extradition of offenders.

Furthermore, state parties are required to abolish all regulations that subject prostitutes &quot;to special registration or to the possession of a special document or to any exceptional requirements for supervision or notification&quot; (Article 6). And also, they are required to take the necessary measure for the supervision of employment agencies in order to prevent persons seeking employment, in particular women and children, from being exposed to the danger of prostitution (Article 20).

A dispute between the parties relating to the interpretation or application of the convention may, at the request of any one of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the International Court of Justice (Article 22).

==Status==
A number of countries who have ratified the convention expressed reservations in relation to the referral of disputes to the ICJ, and some countries have not ratified the convention at all because of their objection to the presence of the article.

One of the main reasons the convention has not been ratified by many countries is that it also applies to voluntary prostitution, because of the presence of the term &quot;even with the consent of that person&quot; in Article 1. For example, in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Greece, Turkey, and other countries, voluntary prostitution is legal and regulated as an &quot;occupation&quot;.

The Trafficking Protocol (2000) to the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime has used a different definition of &quot;trafficking&quot; to that in the 1949 convention, and has been ratified by many more countries.

The Centre for Human Rights, specifically the secretariat of the Working Group on Slavery, in close co-operation with the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs of the Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, actively monitors the convention.

<doc id="276041" wikidata="Q1996502" url="?curid=276041" title="Palomino">
<text>Palomino is a genetic color in horses, consisting of a gold coat and white mane and tail; the degree of whiteness can vary from bright white to yellow. The palomino color derived from the inter-breeding of Spanish horses with those from the United States. Genetically, the palomino color is created by a single allele of a dilution gene called the cream gene working on a &quot;red&quot; (chestnut) base coat. Palomino is created by a genetic mechanism of incomplete dominance, hence it is not considered true-breeding. However, most color breed registries that record palomino horses were founded before equine coat color genetics were understood as well as they are today, therefore the standard definition of a palomino is based on the visible coat color, not heritability nor the underlying presence of the dilution gene.

Due to their distinct color, palominos stand out in a show ring, and are much sought after as parade horses. They were particularly popular in movies and television during the 1940s and 1950s. One of the most famous palomino horses was Trigger, known as &quot;the smartest horse in movies&quot;, the faithful mount of the Hollywood cowboy star Roy Rogers. Another famous palomino was Mister Ed (real name Bamboo Harvester) who starred on his own TV show in the 1960s. A palomino was also featured in the show &quot;&quot; (1995–2001). Xena&#x27;s horse Argo was portrayed by a palomino mare named Tilly. In today&#x27;s horse breeding the palomino color can be created by crossing a chestnut with a cremello.

&quot;Palomino&quot; is a Spanish word meaning &quot;juvenile pigeon&quot; (the diminutive of &quot;paloma&quot;, pigeon) and its equine usage refers to the color of such birds.

==Description==

Palomino horses have a yellow or gold coat, with a white or light cream mane and tail. The shades of the body coat color range from cream to a dark gold.

Unless also affected by other, unrelated genes, palominos have dark skin and brown eyes, though some may be born with pinkish skin that darkens with age. Some have slightly lighter brown or amber eyes. A heterozygous cream dilute (CR) such as the palomino must not be confused with a horse carrying champagne dilution. Champagne (CH) dilutes are born with pumpkin-pink skin and blue eyes, which darken within days to amber, green or light brown, and their skin acquires a darker mottled complexion around the eyes, muzzle, and genitalia as the animal matures.

A horse with rosy-pink skin and blue eyes in adulthood is most often a cremello or a perlino, a horse carrying two cream dilution genes.

Sooty palomino horses may have darker hairs in the mane, tail and coat. The summer coat of a palomino is usually a slightly darker shade than the winter coat.
==Colors confused with palomino==
Many non-palominos may also have a gold or tan coat and a light mane and tail.

*Chestnut with flaxen mane and tail: Lighter chestnuts with a light cream mane and tail carry a flaxen gene, but not a cream dilution. For example, the Haflinger breed has many light chestnuts with flaxen that may superficially resemble dark palomino, but there is no cream gene in the breed.
*Cremellos carry two copies of the cream gene and have a light mane and tail but also a cream-colored hair coat, rosy pink skin and blue eyes.
*The champagne gene is the most similar palomino mimic, as it creates a golden-colored coat on some horses, but golden champagnes have light skin with mottling, blue eyes at birth, and amber or hazel eyes in adulthood.
*Horses with a very dark brown coat but a flaxen mane and tail are sometimes called &quot;chocolate palomino&quot;, and some palomino color registries accept horses of such color. However, this coloring is not genetically palomino. There are two primary ways the color is created. The best-known is a liver chestnut with a flaxen mane and tail. The genetics that create light flaxen manes and tails on otherwise chestnut horses are not yet fully understood, but they are not the same as the cream dilution. The other genetic mechanism is derived from the silver dapple gene, which lightens a black coat to dark brown, and affects the mane and tail even more strongly, diluting to cream or near-white.
* Buckskins have a golden body coat but a black mane and tail. Buckskin is also created by the action of a single cream gene, but on a bay coat.
*Dun horses have a tan body with a darker mane and tail plus primitive markings such as a dorsal stripe down the spine and horizontal striping on the upper back of the forearm.
*The pearl gene in a homozygous state creates a somewhat apricot-colored coat with pale skin. When crossed with a single cream gene, the resulting horse, often called a &quot;pseudo-double-dilute&quot;, appears visually to be a cremello.

==Color breed registries==

In the United States, some palomino horses are classified as a color breed. However, unlike the Appaloosa or the Friesian, which are distinct breeds that also happen to have a unique color preference, Palomino color breed registries often accept a wide range of breed or type if the animals are properly golden-colored. The Palomino cannot be a true horse breed, however, because palomino color is an incomplete dominant gene and does not breed &quot;true&quot;. A palomino crossed with a palomino may result in a palomino about 50% of the time, but could also produce a chestnut (25% probability) or a cremello (25% probability). Thus, palomino is simply a partially expressed color allele and not a set of characteristics that make up a &quot;breed&quot;.

Because registration as a palomino with a color breed registry is based primarily on coat color, horses from many breeds or combination of breeds may qualify. Some breeds that have palomino representatives are the American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse, Morgan and Quarter Horse. The color is fairly rare in the Thoroughbred, but does in fact occur and is recognized by The Jockey Club. Some breeds, such as the Haflinger and Arabian, may appear to be palomino, but are genetically chestnuts with flaxen manes and tails, as neither breed carries the cream dilution gene. However, in spite of their lack of cream DNA, some palomino color registries have registered such horses if their coat color falls within the acceptable range of shades.

While the color standard used by palomino organizations usually describes the ideal body color as that of a &quot;newly minted gold coin&quot; (sometimes mistakenly claimed to be a penny), a wider a body color range is often accepted, ranging from a cream-white color to a deep, dark, chocolate color (&quot;chocolate palomino&quot;) that may actually be silver dapple or liver chestnut with a flaxen mane and tail. 
===Requirements for registration===
In the United States, there are two primary color breed registries for Palomino-colored horses: the Palomino Horse Association (PHA), and the Palomino Horse Breeders of America (PHBA).

The Palomino Horse Association (PHA) registers palomino horses of any breed and type &quot;on color and conformation&quot;. The shade of color considered ideal by the PHA is the color of a gold coin, but shades of palomino from light to dark gold are accepted. The mane and tail are required to be white, silver, or ivory, but up to 15% dark or reddish-brown hair is accepted. In the interest of breeding palomino horses, the PHA also registers full double-dilute blue-eyed cremellos, erroneously called &quot;cremello palominos&quot; by the PHA. Horses that are not recorded by any other registry of unknown pedigree are accepted if their color meets the PHA definition of &quot;palomino&quot;.

The Palomino Horse Breeders of America (PHBA) has stricter requirements. To be accepted by the PHBA, in addition to color, a horse must have the general structure appropriate to the breeds of light riding type recognized by the PHBA. The adult height of the PHBA horse should be , and the horse must not show draft horse or pony characteristics. An individual that does not meet the height requirements may still be accepted if it is registered in one of the breed registries recognized by the PHBA. The PHBA usually requires horses or both parents of the horse to be registered by or eligible for registration with certain recognized breed registries, including those for the American Quarter Horse, Paint, Appaloosa, Saddlebred, Morgan, Holsteiner, Arabian, assorted part-Arabian registries, Pinto (horse division only), Thoroughbred, and assorted gaited horse breeds. Horses with PHBA-registered parents are also eligible even if they are not recorded with any other breed registry. In some situations, mares and geldings may be registered without pedigree on account of their conformation and color only, but stallions must always have pedigrees that are &quot;verified in fact&quot;.

The ideal PHBA body color is the shade of &quot;a United States gold coin&quot;. The mane and tail must be naturally white, and may not have more than 15% black, brown or off-colored hairs. Brown or dark primitive markings are not accepted. PHBA also does not accept horses that are gray or show color characteristics of Paints, pintos, Appaloosas or cremellos or perlinos. The skin must be dark, other than pink skin on the face connected to a white marking. The PHBA will not accept a horse for regular registration if it has all three characteristics of a double-dilute cream: light (or pink) skin over the body; white or cream-colored hair over the body; and eyes of a bluish cast. White markings on the face and legs may not exceed certain limits. Leg white may not be higher than the level of the elbow or the stifle, white on the face may not extend past the throatlatch. Spotting and characteristics of the Leopard complex and the various pinto patterns are not accepted, and body spots of less than a 4-inch diameter may be allowed. Horses with non-dark skin on the body, white or creamy coat and pink skin around the eyes are not accepted. Spots of pink skin visible in the muzzle or around the eyes, under the tail and between the hind legs are not accepted. An exception is made for horses registered with the American Saddlebred Horse Association, which may have skin of any color. Accepted eye colors are black, brown, blue and hazel. However, horses with blue or partially blue eyes are accepted only if their registration certificate from a recognized breed association mentions the eye color; they are also accepted on horses of unknown pedigree if they are gelded or spayed.

<doc id="276044" wikidata="Q1245518" url="?curid=276044" title="Paul Meyer (philologist)">
<text>Marie-Paul-Hyacinthe Meyer (17 January 1840, Paris – 7 September 1917, Saint-Mandé), was a French philologist.

== Biography ==
Meyer was born in Paris and educated at the Lycée Louis le Grand and the École des Chartes, specializing in the Romance languages.

In 1863 he joined the manuscript department of the Bibliothèque Nationale. He was keeper of the national archives from 1866 to 1872. In 1876 he became professor of the languages and literatures of southern Europe at the Collège de France. In 1882 he was made director of the École des Chartes, and a year later was nominated a member of the Academy of Inscriptions. He was one of the founders of the &quot;Revue critique&quot; (1865), and a founder and the chief contributor to &quot;Romania&quot; (1872).

Paul Meyer began with the study of old Provençal literature, but subsequently did valuable work in many different departments of romance literature, and ranked as the chief authority on the French language of his era.

He was a member of the Institute of France, and an associate of the British Academy.

==Works==
*&quot;Rapports sur les documents manuscrits de l&#x27;ancienne littérature de la France conservés dans les bibliothèques de la Grande Bretagne&quot; (1871)
*&quot;Recueil d&#x27;anciens textes bas-latins, provençaux et français&quot; (2 parts, 1874–1876)
*&quot;Alexandre le Grand dans la littérature française du Moyen âge&quot; (2 vols., 1886).
*&quot;L&#x27;Apocalypse en français au XIIIe siècle (Paris MS fr. 403)&quot; (1900-1, with Léopold Delisle)

He edited several old French texts for the Société des anciens textes français, the Société de l&#x27;histoire de France and independently. Among these may be mentioned:
*&quot;Aye d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (1861), with Guessard
*&quot;Flamenca&quot; (1865)
*the &quot;Histoire&quot; of Guillaume le Maréchal (3 vols., 1892–1902)

*&quot;Fragments d&#x27;une vie de Saint Thomas de Canterbury&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Guillaume de la Barre&quot; (1894).

==Honors==
*He became honorary professor at the College of France in 1906.
*Commander in the Legion of Honor

<text>The phrase sustainable industries is related to the development of industrial processes in a sustainable way. The phrase refers to greening of energy intensive industries such as the textiles, steel, cement, and paper industries.

== Origin ==

Sustainability is a social goal for individuals to co-exist on the Earth including economic, social, and environmental deminsions. A Sustainable industry would allow for growth in all three deminsions while maintaining the quality of the environment and countering major environmental issues.

A report was released in 1987 by the United Nations called Our Common Future in which the concept of sustainable development was listed for the first time along with its guiding principles. Then, there is a mention of the phrase &quot;sustainable industries&quot; appeared in 1990 in a story about a Japanese group reforesting a tropical forest to help create sustainable industries for the local populace.

Soon after, a study entitled “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy” by Michael Renner of the Worldwatch Institute was published, using the term &quot;sustainable industries&quot;. This 1991 report concluded, &quot;Contrary to the jobs-versus-owls rhetoric that blames environmental restrictions for layoffs, the movement toward an environmentally sustainable global economy will create far more jobs than it eliminates. The chief reason: non-polluting, environmentally sustainable industries tend to be intrinsically more labour intensive and less resource intensive than traditional processes.&quot; Among the features of sustainable industry offered in the paper were energy efficiency, resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations, safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, low waste production processes, and the use of safe and environmentally compatible materials. Some of the benefits, however, would be offset by higher prices (due to labor costs) and a theoretically larger population needed to perform the same amount of work, increasing the agricultural and other loads on the system. In 1992 the Rio Earth Summit led to thinking about achieving global sustainability by acting locally. This was called Agenda 21, and including creating local food banks, community gardens, clean water sanitation programs, and ensuring that all children have access to quality education.

In February 2003 the business magazine Sustainable Industries was first published, offering news and analysis of core industries such as clean energy and green building. By 2012 the company had expanded to include digital media and event production with the Sustainable Industries Economic Forum in the U.S. Sustainable Industries merged with Triple Pundit in 2011. Then in 2013 Sustainable Industries stopped publishing under its masthead. In 2015 the United Nations adopting the Sustainable Development Goals, which is a 15-year plan that addresses 17 global interconnected issues, leading to a more sustainable future.

== Development ==
The development of these industries requires a major shift in consumption patterns towards the purchase of environmentally friendly goods. The barriers that need to be removed in order for these goals to be reached include high prices, gaps in consumer awareness, and bias in purchasing behaviors. The technology to shift to green industries already exists but often times the price is too high to for industries to invest in them. Industrial development requires a critical amount of demand for consumers. As income grows demand begins to shift to more sophisticated goods, therefore industrial development will cause a surge of new industries. The expansion of industries will allow for an increase in product efficiency, lower prices, and creation of a mass market. As industries emerge and disappear a new source of income is available for consumers, workers, and entrepreneurs. The cheaper and higher quality goods have positive impact on the surrounding society.

Sustainable businesses consider a wide range of environmental, social, and economic factors when making their business decisions and monitor their impact to make sure short-term profits don&#x27;t turn out to be an issue in the long-term. Sustainable initiatives gain public support and are financially performing well.

== Examples ==
Sustainable industry strategies are unique to each type of industry and there is no right way to do it however they all tie into common business goals and values. These values could be:

* Optimizing supply chains and reducing greenhouse emissions
* Using renewable energy resources to power facilities
* Sponsoring education for youth and the local community
* Using sustainable materials in manufacturing

== Key Aspects ==
The key ingredient to sustainable industries is Green consumption, which stems from &quot;the desire to safeguard resources for future generations while also enhancing their quality of life.&quot; Sustainable development for businesses is a form of protection, allowing them to overcome adversity, become more stable, and maintain societal values. There are four key reasons why sustainability is important for businesses. First, It ensures economic sustainability as the living standards are improving without future economic crises. Second, it ensures social sustainability as it encompasses human health, justice, education, and providing opportunities for everyone within a society to be equal. Third, it ensures environmental sustainability and aims to maximize our resources while conserving and protecting our beautiful environment. Lastly, it is beneficial for the business, and their advertising as individuals are willing to pay more for something that contributes to the safety and longevity of our economy, environment, and society.

Sustainable industries are constantly developing and innovating their infrastructure to meet the needs of society without destroying the environment for future generations. Sustainable development calls for more responsible consumption and production patterns. By adopting various different energy efficient technologies and diversifying our energy resources through renewables, businesses pose less effects to our environment and our health.

<text>The hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum) is a species of hawk moth found across temperate regions of Eurasia. The species is named for its similarity to hummingbirds, as they feed on the nectar of tube-shaped flowers using their long proboscis while hovering in the air; this resemblance is an example of convergent evolution. 

The hummingbird hawk-moth was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. As of 2018, its entire genome and mitogenome have been sequenced.

==Distribution==

The hummingbird hawk-moth is distributed throughout the northern Old World from Portugal to Japan, but it breeds mainly in warmer climates (southern Europe, North Africa, and points east). Three generations are produced in a year in Spain. There is evidence that the population in the British Isles is actively expanding its range, as numbers have been consistently increasing. In addition, it is believed that this population is becoming resident instead of migratory, as warmer temperatures due to climate change are allowing individuals to overwinter.

It is a strong flier, dispersing widely in the summer. However it rarely survives the winter in northern latitudes (e.g. north of the Alps in Europe, north of the Caucasus in Russia).

Moths in the genus &quot;Hemaris&quot;, also of the family Sphingidae, are known as &quot;hummingbird moths&quot; in the US, and &quot;bee moths&quot; in Europe. This sometimes causes confusion between this species and the North American genus.

==Life cycle==
Two or more broods are produced each year. The adult may be encountered at any time of the year, especially in the south of the range, where there may be three or four broods. It overwinters as an adult in a crevice among rocks, trees, and buildings. On very warm days it may emerge to feed in mid-winter. Unlike other moths, they have no sexual dimorphism in the size of their antennal lobes.

===Ova===
The glossy pale green ova (eggs) are spherical with a diameter. They are said to look like the flower buds of the host plant &quot;Galium&quot;, and that is where the female lays them. They hatch 6 to 8 days after laying. Up to 200 eggs may be laid by one female, each on a separate plant.

===Larvae===
Newly hatched larvae are clear yellow, and in the second instar assume their green coloration. The larva is green with two grey stripes bordered in cream along the sides and with a horn at the rear end typical of sphingids. The horn is purplish red, changing to blue with an orange tip in the last instar. They feed fully exposed on the top of the host plant and rest in among a tangle of stems. Although dependent on warmth and sun, the larval stage can be as rapid as 20 days.
===Pupae===
The pupae are pale brownish with a prominent, keeled proboscis, and two sharp spines at the end of the cremaster. They are enclosed in loose silken cocoons among the host plant debris or on the ground among leaf litter.
===Adults===
The forewings are brown, with black wavy lines across them, while the hindwings are orange with a black edge. The abdomen is quite broad, with a fan-tail of setae at the end. The wingspan is .

In the southern parts of its range, the hummingbird hawk-moth is highly active even when temperatures are high, and thoracic temperatures above have been measured. This is among the highest recorded for hawk-moths, and near the limit for insect muscle activity.

==Behaviour==
Its long proboscis () and its hovering behavior, accompanied by an audible humming noise, make it look remarkably like a hummingbird while feeding on flowers. Like hummingbirds, it feeds on flowers which have tube-shaped corollae. It should not be confused with the moths called hummingbird moths in North America, genus &quot;Hemaris&quot;, members of the same family and with similar appearance and behavior.
The resemblance to hummingbirds is an example of convergent evolution. It flies during the day, especially in bright sunshine, but also at dusk, dawn, and even in the rain, which is unusual for even diurnal hawkmoths. &quot;M. stellatarum&quot; engages in free hovering flight, which allows more maneuverability and control than fixed-wing flight, despite high energetic cost. Like many large insects, it relies upon Johnston&#x27;s organs for body positioning information.

== Vision ==

The hummingbird hawkmoth&#x27;s visual abilities have been studied extensively, and they have demonstrated a relatively good ability to learn colours. They have a trichromatic visual system, and are most sensitive to wavelength in the range of 349-521 nm. They have been shown to discriminate a wavelength difference as small as 1–2 nm between sources. This discrimination is even more precise than &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, or the western honey bee. Among other flower visitors, their visual system is similar to &quot;Papilio xuthus&quot;, or the Asian swallowtail butterfly, and &quot;Deilephila elpenor&quot;, the nocturnal elephant hawkmoth. Their food preference is based mainly on visual identification, while &quot;D. elpenor&quot; preference relies upon olfactory identification. Compared to &quot;D. elpenor&quot;, &quot;M. stellatarum&quot; have a much smaller number of ommatidia, but a larger optic lobe volume to provide more visual processing tissue.

==Habitat and host plants==
Hummingbird hawk-moths can be easily seen in gardens, parks, meadows, bushes, and woodland edge, where the preferred food plants grow (honeysuckle, red valerian and many others).

Their larvae usually feed on bedstraws or madders (&quot;Rubia&quot;) but have been recorded on other Rubiaceae and &quot;Centranthus&quot;, &quot;Stellaria&quot;, and &quot;Epilobium&quot;.

Adults are particularly fond of nectar-rich flowers with a long and narrow calyx, since they can then take advantage of their long proboscis and avoid competition from other insects. Flowers with longer tubes typically present the feeding animal a higher nectar reward. Proboscis length is thought to have been evolutionarily impacted by the length of flower feeding tubes. Examples of such plants include &quot;Centranthus&quot;, &quot;Jasminum&quot;, &quot;Buddleia&quot;, &quot;Nicotiana&quot;, &quot;Primula&quot;, &quot;Viola&quot;, &quot;Syringa&quot;, &quot;Verbena&quot;, &quot;Echium&quot;, &quot;Phlox&quot;, and &quot;Stachys&quot;. They are reported to trap-line, that is, to return to the same flower beds at about the same time each day.

==In culture==
Hummingbird hawk-moths have been seen as a lucky omen. In particular, a swarm of the moths was seen flying across the English Channel on D-Day, the day of the Normandy landings in the Second World War. These moths, along with other moths, are in the family Sphingidae because their larvae were thought to resemble the Egyptian Sphinx. The They Might Be Giants song &quot;The Bee of the Bird of the Moth&quot; is about the hummingbird moth.

<text>Shlomo Kleit (1891–1962) was a leader of the Yiddishist / Socialist movement in Lithuania.

Kleit, who was a tailor by profession, became active in the General Jewish Labour Bund in Vilna (Vilnius, Lithuania), during the First World War, under the German occupation of the city, from 1915 to 1918. Kleit was active in the Jewish anti-Tsarist revolutionary movement, and the anti-German underground during those years. After World War I he was elected as the Socialist vice-president of the Vilna Kehilla. Kleit left Lithuania for political reasons and lived in Berlin, Cairo, Tel Aviv, Southern France and Toronto. With the assistance of Yaakov (Yankel) Pat, the international Bundist leader, Kleit went to the United States in 1927 and there worked as a teacher in the Arbeter Ring schools until his death.

During and after World War II, Kleit worked to rescue Jews from the Holocaust and to bring survivors into the United States from Cuba and possibly other countries. There is some evidence to indicate that the circle of groups and individuals included Hashomer Hatzair, returning war veterans, non-Jewish pilots and engineers and (with inconclusive evidence) mobsters such as Meyer Lansky and (somewhat questionably) Lucky Luciano.

Among Kleit&#x27;s colleagues in Jewish education were Leo Dashefsky, Leah Vevetches, Pesach Simon and Michel Gelbart.

<text>The Sphingidae are a family of moths commonly called sphinx moths, also colloquially known as hawk moths, with many of their caterpillars known as hornworms. It includes about 1,450 species. It is best represented in the tropics, but species are found in every region. They are moderate to large in size and are distinguished among moths for their agile and sustained flying ability, similar enough to that of hummingbirds as to be reliably mistaken for them. Their narrow wings and streamlined abdomens are adaptations for rapid flight. The family was named by French zoologist Pierre André Latreille in 1802.

Some hawk moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth or the white-lined sphinx, hover in midair while they feed on nectar from flowers, so are sometimes mistaken for hummingbirds. This hovering capability is only known to have evolved four times in nectar feeders: in hummingbirds, certain bats, hoverflies, and these sphingids (an example of convergent evolution). Sphingids have been studied for their flying ability, especially their ability to move rapidly from side to side while hovering, called &quot;swing-hovering&quot; or &quot;side-slipping&quot;. This is thought to have evolved to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.

Sphingids are some of the faster flying insects; some are capable of flying at over . They have wingspans from to over .

==Description==

Sphingid&#x27;s antennae are generally not very feathery, even in males. They lack tympanal organs, but members of the group Choerocampini have hearing organs on their heads. They have a frenulum and retinaculum to join hindwings and forewings. The thorax, abdomen, and wings are densely covered in scales. Some sphingids have a rudimentary proboscis, but most have a very long one, which is used to feed on nectar from flowers. Most are crepuscular or nocturnal, but some species fly during the day. Both males and females are relatively long-lived (10 to 30 days). Prior to flight, most species shiver their flight muscles to warm them up, and, during flight, body temperatures may surpass .

In some species, differences in form between the sexes is quite marked. For example, in the African species &quot;Agrius convolvuli&quot; (the convolvulus or morning glory hawk-moth), males have thicker antennae and more mottled wing markings than females. Only males have both an undivided frenular hook and a retinaculum. Only males have a partial comb of hairs along with their antennae. Females attract males with pheromones. The male may douse the female with a pheromone before mating.

===Behavior===
Some species fly only for short periods either around dusk or dawn, while other species only appear later in the evening and others around midnight, but such species may occasionally be seen feeding on flowers during the day. A few common species in Africa, such as the Oriental beehawk (&quot;Cephonodes hylas virescens&quot;), &quot;Macroglossum hirundo&quot;, and &quot;Macroglossum trochilus&quot;, are diurnal.

A number of species are known to be migratory, all in the Sphingini and Macroglossinae, and specially in the genera &quot;Agrius&quot;, &quot;Cephonodes&quot;, &quot;Macroglossum&quot;, &quot;Hippotion&quot; and &quot;Theretra&quot;.

===Flight===
In studies with &quot;Manduca sexta&quot;, moths have dynamic flight sensory capabilities due to their antennae. The antennae are vibrated in a plane so that when the body of the moth rotates during controlled aerial maneuvers, the antennae are subject to the inertial Coriolis forces that are linearly proportional to the angular velocity of the body. The Coriolis forces cause deflections of the antennae, which are detected by the Johnston&#x27;s organ at the base of each antenna, with strong frequency responses at the beat frequency of the antennae (around 25 Hz) and at twice the beat frequency. The relative magnitude of the two frequency responses enables the moth to distinguish rotation around the different principal axes, allowing for rapid course control during aerial maneuvers.


==Life cycle==
Most species are multivoltine, capable of producing several generations a year if weather conditions permit. Females lay translucent, greenish, flattened, smooth eggs, usually singly on the host plants. Egg development time varies highly, from three to 21 days.

Sphingid caterpillars are medium to large in size, with stout bodies. They have five pairs of prolegs. Usually, their bodies lack any hairs or tubercules, but most species have a &quot;horn&quot; at the posterior end, which may be reduced to a button, or absent, in the final instar. Many are cryptic greens and browns, and have countershading patterns to conceal them. Others are more conspicuously colored, typically with white spots on a black or yellow background along the length of the body. A pattern of diagonal slashes along the side is a common feature. When resting, the caterpillar usually holds its legs off the surface and tucks its head underneath (praying position), which, resembling the Great Sphinx of Giza, gives rise to the name &quot;sphinx moth&quot;. Some tropical larvae are thought to mimic snakes. Larvae are quick to regurgitate their sticky, often toxic, foregut contents on attackers such as ants and parasitoids. Development rate depends on temperature, and to speed development, some northern and high-altitude species sunbathe. Larvae burrow into the soil to pupate, where they remain for two to three weeks before they emerge as adults.

In some sphingids, the pupa has a free proboscis, rather than being fused to the pupal case as is most common in the macrolepidoptera. They have a cremaster at the tip of the abdomen. Usually, they pupate off the host plant, in an underground chamber, among rocks, or in a loose cocoon. In most species, the pupa is the overwintering stage.

==Food plants==

===Larvae===
Sphingid larvae tend to be specific feeders, rather than generalists. Compared to similarly sized saturniids, sphingids eat soft young leaves of host plants with small toxic molecules, and chew and mash the food into very small bits. Some species can tolerate quite high concentrations of specific toxins. Tobacco hornworms (&quot;Manduca sexta&quot;) detoxify and rapidly excrete nicotine, as do several other related sphinx moths in the subfamilies Sphinginae and Macroglossinae, but members of the Smerinthinae that were tested are susceptible. The species that are able to tolerate the toxin do not sequester it in their tissues; 98% was excreted. However, other species, such as &quot;Hyles euphorbiae&quot; and &quot;Daphnis nerii&quot;, do sequester toxins from their hosts, but do not pass them on to the adult stage.

===Adults===

Most adults feed on nectar, although a few tropical species feed on eye secretions, and the death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth steals honey from bees. Night-flying sphingids tend to prefer pale flowers with long corolla tubes and a sweet odor, a pollination syndrome known as &quot;sphingophily&quot;. Some species are quite general in visitations, while others are very specific, with the plant only being successfully pollinated by a particular species of moth. Orchids frequently have such specific relations with hawk moths and very long corolla tubes. The comet orchid (&quot;Angraecum sesquipedale&quot;), a rare Malagasy flower with its nectar stored at the bottom of a tube, was described in 1822 by Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, and later, Charles Darwin famously predicted there must be some specialized moth to feed from it:

Alfred Russel Wallace published a sort of &quot;wanted poster&quot; (properly, a drawing in a book) of what this lepidopteran might look like, and, concurring with his colleague, added:

The predicted sphingid was discovered 21 years later and described as a subspecies of the one African species studied by Wallace: &quot;Xanthopan morganii praedicta&quot;, for which, the subspecific name &quot;praedicta&quot; (&quot;the predicted one&quot;) was given. The Madagascan individuals had a pink, rather than white, breast and abdomen and a black apical line on the forewing, broader than in mainland specimens. Molecular clock models using either rate- or fossil-based calibrations imply that the Madagascan subspecies &quot;X. m. praedicta&quot; and the African subspecies &quot;X. m. morgani&quot; diverged 7.4 ± 2.8 Mya (million years ago), which overlaps the divergence of &quot;A. sesquipedale&quot; from its sister, &quot;A. sororium&quot;, namely 7.5 ± 5.2 Mya. Since both these orchids have extremely long spurs, longspurs likely existed before that and were exploited by long-tongued moths similar to &quot;Xanthopan morganii praedicta&quot;. The long geological separation of subspecies &quot;morgani&quot; and &quot;praedicta&quot; matches their morphological differences in the color of the breast and abdomen.

==Relationships and species==

The Sphingidae is sometimes assigned its own exclusive superfamily, Sphingoidea, but is alternatively included with the more encompassing Bombycoidea. Following Hodges (1971) two subfamilies are accepted, namely the Sphinginae and Macroglossinae. Around 1,450 species of hawk moths are classified into around 200 genera. Some of the best-known hawk moth species are:
* Privet hawk moth (&quot;Sphinx ligustri&quot;)
* White-lined Sphinx (&quot;Hyles lineata&quot;)
* Death&#x27;s-head hawk moth (&quot;Acherontia atropos&quot;)
* Lime hawk moth (&quot;Mimas tiliae&quot;)
* Poplar hawk moth (&quot;Laothoe populi&quot;)
* Convolvulus hawk moth (&quot;Agrius convolvuli&quot;)
* Catalpa sphinx (&quot;Ceratomia catalpae&quot;)
* Hummingbird hawk-moth (&quot;Macroglossum stellatarum&quot;)
* Elephant hawk moth (&quot;Deilephila elpenor&quot;)
* Vine hawk moth (&quot;Hippotion celerio&quot;)
* Spurge hawk moth (&quot;Hyles euphorbiae&quot;)
* Oleander hawk moth (&quot;Daphnis nerii&quot;)
* Pandora sphinx moth (&quot;Eumorpha pandorus&quot;)
* Tomato worm (&quot;Manduca quinquemaculata&quot;)
* Tobacco hornworm (&quot;Manduca sexta&quot;)

<text>Brian Michael Stanislaus Hoban (7 October 1921 in British Guiana – 6 July 2003), was a teacher of classics, and Headmaster of Harrow School from 1971–81.

His father died when he was a small child and he spent two years in an orphanage. In 1934 he won a scholarship to Charterhouse, where he remained until the onset of World War II in 1939. He spent the war as a captain with the Westminster Dragoons, and was mentioned in dispatches.

From 1946–49 he was a student of classics at University College, Oxford. In 1947 he married Jasmine Holmes, the daughter of his Charterhouse house master. From 1949–52 he was an assistant master at Uppingham School teaching classics. From 1952–59 he was an assistant master at Shrewsbury School teaching classics. From 1960–64 he was Headmaster of St Edmund&#x27;s School, Canterbury.

From 1964–71, he was Headmaster of Bradfield College. In 1971 he was named Headmaster of Harrow. He headed Harrow at a difficult time for British public schools generally, due to the political environment and financial pressures. Despite sometimes public criticism, Hoban responded with cost-saving measures, whilst refurbishing houses. During his tenure at Harrow, numbers slipped below 700 only three times. He oversaw many important building projects, including the new Central Feeding block; the New Knoll boarding house; and new physics and maths schools. He retired in 1981.
==Death==
Hoban died on 6 July 2003, aged 81.

She began her career in journalism in the 1970s, writing for several publications, most notably &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Maynard contributed to &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Harrowsmith&quot; magazines in the 1980s, while also beginning a career as a novelist with the publication of her first novel, &quot;Baby Love&quot; (1981). Her second novel, &quot;To Die For&quot; (1992), drew on the Pamela Smart murder case and was adapted by Gus Van Sant into the film &quot;To Die For&quot; in 1995. Maynard received significant media attention in 1998 with the publication of her memoir &quot;At Home in the World&quot;, in which she describes her relationship with J. D. Salinger.

Maynard has published novels in a wide range of literary genres, including fiction, young adult fiction, and true crime. Her sixth novel, &quot;Labor Day&quot; (2009), was adapted into the 2013 film &quot;Labor Day&quot;, directed by Jason Reitman. Her recent novels include &quot;Under the Influence&quot; (2016), &quot;Count the Ways&quot; (2021), &quot;The Bird Hotel&quot; (2023), and &quot;How the Light Gets In&quot; (2024).

==Early life==
Maynard was born in Durham, New Hampshire, to Fredelle (née Bruser), a journalist, writer, and English teacher, and Max Maynard, a painter and professor of English at the University of New Hampshire (and brother of theologian Theodore Maynard). Her father was born in India to English missionary parents and later moved to Canada; her mother was born in Saskatchewan to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Maynard has an older sister, Rona.

Maynard attended the Oyster River school district and Phillips Exeter Academy. She won Scholastic Art and Writing Awards in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, and 1971. In her teens, she wrote regularly for &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine. She entered Yale University in 1971 and sent a collection of her writings to the editors of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. They asked her to write an article about growing up in the 1960s, which was published under the title &quot;An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s April 23, 1972, issue. After the article was published, Maynard received a letter from fiction writer J. D. Salinger, then 53 years old, who complimented her writing and warned her of the dangers of publicity.

== Relationship with Salinger and &quot;At Home in the World&quot;==
In spring 1972, Maynard and Salinger exchanged letters during her freshman year at Yale. By July, Maynard had given up her summer job writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; to move in with Salinger in Cornish, New Hampshire. Salinger and his wife had divorced in 1967. By September 1972, Maynard had given up her scholarship to Yale and dropped out. While living with Salinger for eight months, until March 1973, Maynard wrote her first book, the memoir &quot;Looking Back: A Chronicle of Growing Up Old in the Sixties&quot;, which was published in 1973, soon after Maynard and Salinger ended their relationship.

Maynard withheld information about their relationship until her 1998 memoir &quot;At Home in the World&quot;. The memoir, an account of her entire life up to that point, is best known for its in-depth retelling of her relationship with Salinger, whom she portrays as a predator. At its publication, many reviewers furiously panned the book, such as Jonathan Yardley from the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; who called it &quot;indescribably stupid&quot;. 

During the same year, she auctioned the letters Salinger had written her. Software developer Peter Norton bought them for $156,500 and returned them to Salinger.

In 2021, Maynard wrote about the relationship in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in connection with the TV series &quot;Allen v. Farrow&quot;: &quot;I was groomed to be the sexual partner of a narcissist who nearly derailed my life&quot;. She went into detail about the other relationships with teenagers Salinger had had at the same time, adding, &quot;When he sent me away less than a year later with words of contempt and disdain, I believed the failure was mine, and that I was no longer worthy of his love or even respect.&quot; Of the reception of her memoirs, she wrote, &quot;I was accused of trying to sell books, to make money from my brief and inconsequential connection to a great man&quot;, adding, &quot;one writer, Cynthia Ozick—hardly alone among celebrated authors, weighing in with her condemnation—portrayed me as a person who, in possession of no talent of my own, had attached myself to Salinger to &#x27;suck out&#x27; his celebrity.&quot;

==Journalism==
After moving out of Salinger&#x27;s house in 1973, Maynard bought a house in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. From 1973 to 1975, she contributed commentaries to a series called &quot;Spectrum&quot; on CBS Radio. In 1975, she joined the staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a general assignment reporter and feature writer. She left &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1977 when she married Steve Bethel. They moved to New Hampshire and had three children, Audrey, Charlie, and Wilson.

From 1984 to 1990, Maynard wrote the weekly syndicated column &quot;Domestic Affairs&quot;, dealing with marriage, parenthood, and family life. She worked as book reviewer and columnist for &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Harrowsmith&quot; magazine. In 1989, when Maynard&#x27;s marriage ended, more than half the newspapers that ran her &quot;Domestic Affairs&quot; column dropped it.

In 1986, Maynard helped lead the opposition to the construction of the nation&#x27;s first high-level nuclear waste dump in New Hampshire, with ground zero in Hillsborough, where she lived with her family. Maynard described this campaign in a May 1986 &quot;New York Times&quot; cover story. She wrote, &quot;The US Department of Energy named part of New Hampshire as a candidate for the first high-level nuclear waste &#x27;repository&#x27; (i.e., DUMP) on the planet.&quot; Maynard and others rallied at town meetings and convoyed to Concord, and later that year, a law was passed prohibiting a nuclear waste dump in New Hampshire. To date, Maynard considers stopping the nuclear waste dump one of her greatest accomplishments.

== Fiction ==
Maynard published her first novel, &quot;Baby Love&quot;, in 1981. Her 1992 novel &quot;To Die For&quot; drew from the Pamela Smart murder case and was adapted into a 1995 film, also called &quot;To Die For&quot;, directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Nicole Kidman, Matt Dillon, and Joaquin Phoenix. In the late 1990s, she wrote to her readers in an online discussion forum, &quot;The Domestic Affairs Message Board&quot;.

She published two books of young adult fiction: &quot;The Usual Rules&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Cloud Chamber&quot; (2005). Her true crime book &quot;Internal Combustion&quot; (2006) deals with the case of Nancy Seaman, a Michigan resident convicted in 2004 of killing her husband. The novel &quot;Labor Day&quot; was published in 2009 and adapted into a movie, written and directed by Jason Reitman and starring Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin. Her other novels include &quot;The Good Daughters&quot; (2010), &quot;After Her&quot; (2013), and &quot;Under the Influence&quot; (2016).

In summer 2021, Maynard published &quot;Count the Ways&quot;, a well-received novel about home, parenthood, love, and forgiveness. That autumn, she won The &quot;Grand Prix de Littérature Américaine&quot; 2021 for &quot;Où vivaient les gens heureux&quot; (&quot;Count the Ways&quot;), published in France in August 2021 by Philippe Rey in a translation by Florence Lévy-Paoloni. 

In 2023, the 50th anniversary of &quot;Looking Back: A Chronicle of Growing Up Old in the Sixties&quot; was noted, with Maynard recording an audio version of the book. She said: &quot;On every page, I read words written by my younger self that, if I could, I would have changed. The girl I used to be back then was naive and opinionated, frequently a prim know-it-all. In the pages of what purported to be the story of her life so far, she was also keeping a large secret. In the end though, as the days of recording came to an end, a rush of pure, tender protectiveness for that girl overtook me. I wished I could reach through the pages I was reading out loud and put my arms around that girl, tell her to be careful of her body, her gifts, her precious and breakable heart. As I finished reading the final paragraph into the microphone, I realized I was weeping.&quot;

In May 2023, Maynard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bird Hotel&quot; was published by Arcade. On August 24, 2023, Philippe Rey published it in France under the title &quot;L&#x27;hôtel des oiseaux&quot;, translated by Florence Lévy-Paoloni.

Maynard&#x27;s novel &quot;How the Light Gets In,&quot; published in June 2024 by William Morrow, is a sequel. It follows the characters of &quot;Count the Ways&quot; (2021) into the current American climate.

== Personal life ==
Maynard married Steve Bethel in 1977 and divorced him in 1989. They had three children together: daughter Audrey, a social worker, and sons Charlie, a DJ/music producer known as Captain Planet, and Wilson, an actor known for &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and &quot;All Rise&quot;. After the divorce, Maynard and her children moved to Keene, New Hampshire.

Maynard and her sister, Rona, a writer and retired editor of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; magazine, collaborated on an examination of their sisterhood. Rona Maynard&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was published in 2007. On August 12, 2023, Joyce and Rona Maynard shared the stage for a premiere event, &quot;The Maynard Sisters In Conversation&quot;, at The Toadstool Bookshop in Keene.

Maynard has written about her experience of an international adoption and disruption, and has served as an advocate and supporter for adoptive families and children experiencing challenges related to international adoption.

On July 6, 2013, she married lawyer Jim Barringer. Barringer died on June 16, 2016, of pancreatic cancer, 19 months after his diagnosis. Their relationship and his death is the subject of her 2017 memoir &quot;The Best of Us&quot;.

Maynard returned to Yale as a sophomore in 2018 to complete her undergraduate education. During the pandemic, she left Yale again, calling herself a &quot;two-time dropout&quot;. She resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<doc id="276069" wikidata="Q2445840" url="?curid=276069" title="Totnes Castle">
<text>Totnes Castle is one of the best preserved examples of a Norman motte and bailey castle in England. It is situated in the town of Totnes on the River Dart in Devon. The surviving stone keep and curtain wall date from around the 14th century. From after the Norman Conquest of 1066 it was the &quot;caput&quot; of the Feudal barony of Totnes.

== History ==
The castle occupies a commanding position atop a large hill above the town, and guards the approach to three valleys.

The first castle on this site is believed to have been built by the Breton Juhel of Totnes (also known as Judhael) who was one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s lieutenants. The feudal barony of Totnes was granted to him in 1068, and in order to cement his control over the area he constructed a fortification and founded Totnes Priory within the town. This first construction probably consisted of a wooden palisade and tower. On the death of King William I, Juhel lost his lands, possibly as a result of his support for the Rebellion of 1088. The feudal barony of Totnes was then granted to Roger de Nonant, whose descendants appear to have held it for the next three generations. Following this it came into the possession of William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, who is probably responsible for constructing the first stone shell keep and walls on the site.

By 1326, the castle had fallen into ruin and was under the control the de la Zouch family.
During this period a royal order was made for the repair of the fortifications. As a result, the castle was re-fortified with a new shell keep, using Devonian limestone and red sandstone, a stable was constructed and a constable appointed. Following the Wars of the Roses it once again fell into disrepair. The castle was occupied for a period during the Civil War but saw no notable action.

== Occupants of the Castle ==

Totnes Castle has a history spanning several centuries. It all began in 1067 when Juhel, a Norman Knight, constructed and inhabited the castle. Sixteen years later, in 1083, Roger de Nonant seized control of the castle. The year 1205 saw William de Braose, the 3rd Lord of Bramber and a descendant of Juhel, reclaim the castle, although it is unlikely that he resided there. Instead, it was his son, Reginald de Braose, who likely erected the first stone castle on the site. Subsequently, in 1326, the de la Zouch clan assumed ownership of the castle and undertook extensive rebuilding, transforming its structure. Fast forward to 1485, when Sir Richard Edgecomb became the new owner of Totnes Castle. Finally, in 1764, Edward Seymour, the 9th Duke of Somerset, and his family took up residence at the castle. During their tenure, they introduced leisure facilities like a tennis court and a tea room.

==Preservation==
Since 1984 the castle has been under the stewardship of English Heritage. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.

<text>Blood Simple is a 1984 American independent neo-noir crime film written, edited, produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and starring John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya and M. Emmet Walsh. Its plot follows a Texas bartender who is having an affair with his boss’s wife. When his boss discovers the affair, he hires a private investigator to kill the couple. It was the directorial debut of the Coens and the first major film of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who later became a director, as well as the feature-film debut of McDormand.

The film&#x27;s title is derived from Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot; (1929), in which the Continental Op muses: “This damned burg&#x27;s getting me. If I don&#x27;t get away soon I&#x27;ll be going blood-simple like the natives.” Stylistically, the film has been noted for its blending elements of neo-noir, pulp crime stories and low-budget horror films. In 2001, a director&#x27;s cut was released, the same year that it was ranked No. 98 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

==Plot==

Texas bartender Ray and housewife Abby drive through a downpour at night, discussing Abby&#x27;s bad marriage to Ray&#x27;s boss, Julian Marty. They have sex at a motel. Loren Visser, a private detective, takes photos of the tryst and delivers them to Marty. When a caller informs the couple they are being watched, Abby grabs some belongings, including a pistol Marty gave her. Ray goes to the bar to demand his back pay from Marty, who tells Ray that Abby will betray him as she did Marty, and when confronted will say, &quot;I haven&#x27;t done anything funny.&quot;

After a botched attempt to kidnap Abby, Marty offers Visser $10,000 to kill her and Ray. Visser tells Marty to go fishing and he will call him when the job is done. Visser breaks into Ray&#x27;s home and steals Abby&#x27;s gun. He shows Marty photos of the murdered couple, one of which Marty secretes in his safe while retrieving the $10,000. Visser double crosses Marty and shoots him with Abby&#x27;s gun. He drops the gun and grabs the money but forgets his cigarette lighter as he leaves.

It is revealed that Visser doctored the photos to appear that Abby and Ray had been shot. Ray discovers Marty&#x27;s body, accidentally discharging Abby&#x27;s gun when he steps on it. He puts the gun in Marty&#x27;s pocket and the body in his car. Marty is still alive, albeit barely. Ray begins to bury Marty in a shallow grave when Marty aims the gun and pulls the trigger three times, falling on an empty chamber each time. Marty screams as Ray takes the gun and finishes burying him.

The next morning, Ray tries to explain to Abby that he &quot;cleaned it all up.&quot; Abby says, &quot;I haven&#x27;t done anything funny,&quot; which leads to an argument. Visser telephones but does not speak when Abby picks up. She assumes and tells Ray that it was Marty. Ray places her gun on a table as he leaves. Meurice, another bartender, tells Ray about a phone message Marty left regarding money stolen from the safeMarty&#x27;s cover for the $10,000 he paid Visser.

While burning the doctored photos, Visser realizes that Marty kept one, and that he left his lighter. His attempt to break into the safe is thwarted by Abby, who thinks Ray damaged the safe and realizes Marty might be dead. She has a nightmare of Marty warning her that Ray will kill her as well. She confronts Ray, who tells her Marty was still alive when he buried him.

Ray opens the safe and discovers the doctored photo. He goes to Abby&#x27;s apartment to warn her. Visser kills Ray with a rifle shot from a rooftop across the street. Abby smashes her lightbulb and hides in the bathroom.

Visser enters the apartment and searches Ray for the lighter, and finds Abby has climbed out of the window into the next apartment. She stabs him with Ray&#x27;s knife, pinning his hand to the sill. As she backs away, Visser empties his gun into the wall, then punches through it to remove the knife. Returning to her apartment, Abby picks up her gun and shoots Visser through the bathroom door. She says, &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid of you, Marty,&quot; and Visser, lying wounded, laughs and responds, &quot;Well, ma&#x27;am, if I see him, I&#x27;ll sure give him the message.&quot;

== Production ==
===Development===
After writing the screenplay, the Coen brothers shot a preemptive dummy theatrical trailer for &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, which showed &quot;a man dragging a shovel alongside a car stopped in the middle of the road, back towards another man he was going to kill&quot; and &quot;a shot of backlit gun holes in a wall.&quot; The trailer featured actor Bruce Campbell, playing the Julian Marty role, and was shot by recent film school graduate Barry Sonnenfeld.

After completing the trailer, the Coens began exhibiting it with the hope of persuading investors to help fund a full-length feature film. Daniel Bacaner was one of the first people to invest money in the project. He also became its executive producer and introduced the Coens to other potential backers. The entire process of raising the necessary $1.5 million took a year.

===Filming===
&quot;Blood Simple&quot; was shot in several locations in the towns of Austin and Hutto, Texas, over a period of eight weeks in the fall of 1982. The film spent a year in postproduction and was completed by 1983.

&quot;Blood Simple&quot; was Frances McDormand&#x27;s screen debut. All Coen brothers films are co-produced and co-directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, although Ethan was credited as the sole producer and Joel the sole director until 2004. The Coens share editing credit under the pseudonym Roderick Jaynes.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical response===
While &quot;Blood Simple&quot; was only a modest box-office success, it was a huge critical success. It holds a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Brutally violent and shockingly funny in equal measure, &quot;Blood Simple&quot; offers early evidence of the Coen Brothers&#x27; twisted sensibilities and filmmaking ingenuity.&quot; 

Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;Black humor, abundant originality and a brilliant visual style make Joel Coen&#x27;s &quot;Blood Simple&quot; a directorial debut of extraordinary promise. Mr. Coen, who co-wrote the film with his brother Ethan, works in a film noir style that in no way inhibits his wit, which turns out to be considerable.&quot; She cites a &quot;long, late-night tracking shot from one end of the Neon Boot bar to another actually tracks along the surface of the bar itself—and when there is a drunk passed out on the bar, the camera simply lifts up and flies over him, then continues on its route.&quot;

Pauline Kael called it &quot;a crude, ghoulish story with thriller themes,&quot; but was effusive about the performance of M. Emmet Walsh as Visser.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert each gave it a positive review on &quot;At the Movies&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert wrote: &quot;A lot has been written about the visual style of “Blood Simple,” but I think the appeal of the movie is more elementary. It keys into three common nightmares: (1) You clean and clean, but there’s still blood all over the place; (2) You know you have committed a murder, but you are not sure quite how or why; (3) You know you have forgotten a small detail that will eventually get you into a lot of trouble.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $2.7 million worldwide. Its first big public viewing was the USA Film Festival in Dallas, followed by the Sundance Film Festival, where it received the Grand Jury Prize. The brothers took the film to the Toronto Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Festival. They were very proud of their film, particularly in light of having raised the funds using their self-made trailer.

===Accolades===
* Sundance Film Festival - Grand Jury Prize: U.S. Dramatic (1985)
* 1st Independent Spirit Awards - Best Director (tied with Martin Scorsese for &quot;After Hours&quot;) and Actor (M. Emmet Walsh)

In &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Christopher Orr writes: &quot;It all began here, and not merely for the Coens themselves. &quot;Blood Simple&quot; was the first feature starring Joel Coen’s soon-to-become wife, Frances McDormand; the first scored by Carter Burwell, who’s collaborated—often, as here, magnificently—with the Coens on all their subsequent scores; and the first shot by cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who also worked on the Coens’ next two films before embarking on his own directorial career... It is no small miracle—and a testament to the Coens themselves—that so many exceptional talents connected so early in their respective careers.&quot;

===In popular culture===
The film was referenced in a 1992 episode (&quot;Master Ninja II&quot;) of the cult satirical sci-fi TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; as well as a 2017 episode (&quot;Backfire&quot;) of the TV series &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;.

Some audio extracts of this film are used in the song &quot;Quotation For Listening&quot;, by On Thorns I Lay on their album &quot;Egocentric&quot;, released in 2003.

==Home media==
The original MCA Home Video VHS tape and LaserDisc was released on October 10, 1985, with a 96-minute running time. The film was released on Universal Pictures Home Entertainment VHS for a second time in 1995 with a 99-minute run time. Unusual for such an exercise, the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; is some three minutes shorter than the original 1985 theatrical release. The Coens reduced the run time with tighter editing, shortening some shots and removing others altogether. Additionally, they resolved long-standing rights issues with the music; the original theatrical version of the film made prominent use of The Four Tops&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s the Same Old Song&quot; (1965); the Coens had replaced it with Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; (1966) for the 1995 U.S. home video edition on VHS. The Director&#x27;s Cut reinstated the Four Tops track.

Universal Home Video released a DVD version of the film in 2001, and again in 2005 as part of a DVD box set titled &quot;The Coen Brothers Collection&quot;. A Blu-ray edition was released in 2011 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

In 2016, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD, featuring a new 4K digital transfer supervised and approved by Barry Sonnenfeld and the Coens, along with various new special features. In 2024, The Criterion Collection released the film on 4K Ultra HD for the first time as a combo pack which includes the 2016 Blu-ray disc as well.

==Soundtrack==


Carter Burwell wrote the film&#x27;s score, the first of his collaborations with the Coen brothers. &quot;Blood Simple&quot; was also the first feature-film score for Burwell, and after his work on this film, he became a much-in-demand composer in Hollywood. As of 2024, he had scored sixteen of the Coen brothers&#x27; films.

The score for &quot;Blood Simple&quot; is a mix of solo piano and electronic ambient sounds. One track, &quot;Monkey Chant&quot;, is based on kecak, the &quot;&quot;Ramayana&quot; Monkey Chant&quot; of Bali.

In 1987, seven selections from Burwell&#x27;s &quot;Blood Simple&quot; score were released on a 17-track album that also features selections from the soundtrack of the Coens&#x27; next film, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987).

&quot;Blood Simple&quot; selections on the 1987 album:
# &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; (2:40)
# &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (3:33)
# &quot;Chain Gang&quot; (4:47)
# &quot;The March&quot; (3:34)
# &quot;Monkey Chant&quot; (1:04)
# &quot;The Shooting&quot; (2:52)
# &quot;Blood Simpler&quot; (1:22)

Other songs from the film that are not on the album:

<text>Railway signalling (), or railroad signaling (), is a system used to control the movement of railway traffic. Trains move on fixed rails, making them uniquely susceptible to collision. This susceptibility is exacerbated by the enormous weight and inertia of a train, which makes it difficult to quickly stop when encountering an obstacle. In the UK, the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 introduced a series of requirements on matters such as the implementation of interlocked block signalling and other safety measures as a direct result of the Armagh rail disaster in that year.

Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network (e.g. a signalman or stationmaster) to the train crew. The set of rules and the physical equipment used to accomplish this determine what is known as the &quot;method of working&quot; (UK), &quot;method of operation&quot; (US) or &quot;safe-working&quot; (Aus.). Not all these methods require the use of physical signals, and some systems are specific to single-track railways.

The earliest rail cars were hauled by horses or mules. A mounted flagman on a horse preceded some early trains. Hand and arm signals were used to direct the &quot;train drivers&quot;. Foggy and poor-visibility conditions later gave rise to flags and lanterns. Wayside signalling dates back as far as 1832, and used elevated flags or balls that could be seen from afar.

== Timetable operation ==
The simplest form of operation, at least in terms of equipment, is to run the system according to a timetable. Every train crew understands and adheres to a fixed schedule. Trains may only run on each track section at a scheduled time, during which they have &#x27;possession&#x27; and no other train may use the same section.

When trains run in opposite directions on a single-track railway, meeting points (&quot;meets&quot;) are scheduled, at which each train must wait for the other at a passing place. Neither train is permitted to move before the other has arrived. In the US, the display of two green flags (green lights at night) is an indication that another train is following the first and the waiting train must wait for the next train to pass. In addition, the train carrying the flags gives eight blasts on the whistle as it approaches. The waiting train must return eight blasts before the flag carrying train may proceed.

The timetable system has several disadvantages. First, there is no positive confirmation that the track ahead is clear, only that it is scheduled to be clear. The system does not allow for engine failures and other such problems, but the timetable is set up so that there should be sufficient time between trains for the crew of a failed or delayed train to walk far enough to set warning flags, flares, and &quot;detonators&quot; or &quot;torpedoes&quot; (UK and US terminology, respectively) to alert any other train crew.

A second problem is the system&#x27;s inflexibility. Trains cannot be added, delayed, or rescheduled without advance notice.

A third problem is a corollary of the second: the system is inefficient. To provide flexibility, the timetable must give trains a broad allocation of time to allow for delays, so the line is not in the possession of each train for longer than is otherwise necessary.

Nonetheless, this system permits operation on a vast scale, with no requirements for any kind of communication that travels faster than a train. Timetable operation was the normal mode of operation in North America in the early days of the railroad.

=== Timetable and train order ===
With the advent of the telegraph in 1841, a more sophisticated system became possible because this provided a means whereby messages could be transmitted ahead of the trains. The telegraph allows the dissemination of any timetable changes, known as &quot;train orders&quot;. These allow the cancellation, rescheduling and addition of train services.

North American practice meant that train crews generally received their orders at the next station at which they stopped, or were sometimes handed up to a locomotive &#x27;on the run&#x27; via a long staff. Train orders allowed dispatchers to set up meets at sidings, force a train to wait in a siding for a priority train to pass, and to maintain at least one block spacing between trains going the same direction.

Timetable and train order operation was commonly used on American railroads until the 1960s, including some quite large operations such as the Wabash Railroad and the Nickel Plate Road. Train order traffic control was used in Canada until the late 1980s on the Algoma Central Railway and some spurs of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Timetable and train order was not used widely outside North America, and has been phased out in favour of radio dispatch on many light-traffic lines and electronic signals on high-traffic lines. More details of North American operating methods is given below.

A similar method, known as &#x27;Telegraph and Crossing Order&#x27; was used on some busy single lines in the UK during the 19th century. However, a series of head-on collisions resulted from authority to proceed being wrongly given or misunderstood by the train crew - the worst of which was the collision between Norwich and Brundall, Norfolk, in 1874. As a result, the system was phased out in favour of token systems. This eliminated the danger of ambiguous or conflicting instructions being given because token systems rely on objects to give authority, rather than verbal or written instructions; whereas it is very difficult to completely prevent conflicting orders being given, it is relatively simple to prevent conflicting tokens being handed out.

== Block signalling ==


Trains cannot collide with each other if they are not permitted to occupy the same section of track at the same time, so railway lines are divided into sections known as &quot;blocks&quot;. In normal circumstances, only one train is permitted in each block at a time. This principle forms the basis of most railway safety systems. Blocks can either be fixed (block limits are fixed along the line) or moving blocks (ends of blocks defined relative to moving trains).

=== History of block signalling ===
On double tracked railway lines, which enabled trains to travel in one direction on each track, it was necessary to space trains far enough apart to ensure that they could not collide. In the very early days of railways, men (originally called &#x27;policemen&#x27;, which is the origin of UK signalmen being referred to as &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;bobby&quot; or &quot;officer&quot;, when train-crew are speaking to them via a signal telephone) were employed to stand at intervals (&quot;blocks&quot;) along the line with a stopwatch and use hand signals to inform train drivers that a train had passed more or less than a certain number of minutes previously. This was called &quot;time interval working&quot;. If a train had passed very recently, the following train was expected to slow down to allow more space to develop.

The watchmen had no way of knowing whether a train had cleared the line ahead, so if a preceding train stopped for any reason, the crew of a following train would have no way of knowing unless it was clearly visible. As a result, accidents were common in the early days of railways. With the invention of the electrical telegraph, it became possible for staff at a station or signal box to send a message (usually a specific number of rings on a bell) to confirm that a train had passed and that a specific block was clear. This was called the &quot;absolute block system&quot;.

Fixed mechanical signals began to replace hand signals from the 1830s. These were originally worked locally, but it later became normal practice to operate all the signals on a particular block with levers grouped together in a signal box. When a train passed into a block, a signalman would protect that block by setting its signal to &#x27;danger&#x27;. When an &#x27;all clear&#x27; message was received, the signalman would move the signal into the &#x27;clear&#x27; position.

The absolute block system came into use gradually during the 1850s and 1860s and became mandatory in the United Kingdom after Parliament passed legislation in 1889 following a number of accidents, most notably the Armagh rail disaster. This required block signalling for all passenger railways, together with interlocking, both of which form the basis of modern signalling practice today. Similar legislation was passed by the United States around the same time.

Not all blocks are controlled using fixed signals. On some single track railways in the UK, particularly those with low usage, it is common to use token systems that rely on the train driver&#x27;s physical possession of a unique token as authority to occupy the line, normally in addition to fixed signals.

=== Entering and leaving a manually controlled block ===
Before allowing a train to enter a block, a signalman must be certain that it is not already occupied. When a train leaves a block, they must inform the signalman controlling entry to the block. Even if the signalman receives advice that the previous train has left a block, they are usually required to seek permission from the next signal box to admit the next train. When a train arrives at the end of a block section, before the signalman sends the message that the train has arrived, they must be able to see the end-of-train marker on the back of the last vehicle. This ensures that no part of the train has become detached and remains within the section. The end of train marker might be a coloured disc (usually red) by day or a coloured oil or electric lamp (again, usually red). If a train enters the next block before the signalman sees that the disc or lamp is missing, they ask the next signal box to stop the train and investigate.

=== Permissive and absolute blocks ===
Under a permissive block system, trains are permitted to pass signals indicating the line ahead is occupied, but only at such a speed that they can stop safely should an obstacle come into view. This allows improved efficiency in some situations and is mostly used in the USA. In most countries it is restricted to freight trains only, and it may be restricted depending on the level of visibility.

Permissive block working may also be used in an emergency, either when a driver is unable to contact a signalman after being held at a danger signal for a specific time, although this is only permitted when the signal does not protect any conflicting moves, and also when the signalman is unable to contact the next signal box to make sure the previous train has passed, for example if the telegraph wires are down. In these cases, trains must proceed at very low speed (typically or less) so that they are able to stop short of any obstruction. In most cases, this is not allowed during times of poor visibility (e.g., fog or falling snow).

Even with an absolute block system, multiple trains may enter a block with authorization. This may be necessary in order to split or join trains together, or to rescue failed trains. In giving authorization, the signalman also ensures that the driver knows precisely what to expect ahead. The driver must operate the train in a safe manner taking this information into account. Generally, the signal remains at danger, and the driver is given verbal authority, usually by a yellow flag, to pass a signal at danger, and the presence of the train in front is explained. Where trains regularly enter occupied blocks, such as stations where coupling takes place, a subsidiary signal, sometimes known as a &quot;calling on&quot; signal, is provided for these movements, otherwise they are accomplished through train orders.

=== Automatic block ===
The invention of train detection systems such as track circuits allowed the replacement of manual block systems such as absolute block with automatic block signalling. Under automatic block signalling, signals indicate whether or not a train may enter a block based on automatic train detection indicating whether a block is clear. The signals may also be controlled by a signalman, so that they only provide a &quot;proceed&quot; indication if the signalman sets the signal accordingly and the block is clear.

=== Fixed block ===
Most blocks are &quot;fixed&quot;, i.e. they include the section of track between two fixed points. On timetable, train order, and token-based systems, blocks usually start and end at selected stations. On signalling-based systems, blocks start and end at signals.

The lengths of blocks are designed to allow trains to operate as frequently as necessary. A lightly used line might have blocks many kilometres long, but a busy commuter line might have blocks a few hundred metres long.

A train is not permitted to enter a block until a signal indicates that the train may proceed, a dispatcher or signalman instructs the driver accordingly, or the driver takes possession of the appropriate token. In most cases, a train cannot enter the block until not only the block itself is clear of trains, but there is also an empty section beyond the end of the block for at least the distance required to stop the train. In signalling-based systems with closely spaced signals, this overlap could be as far as the signal following the one at the end of the section, effectively enforcing a space between trains of two blocks.

When calculating the size of the blocks, and therefore the spacing between the signals, the following have to be taken into account:
* Line speed (the maximum permitted speed over the line-section)
* Train speed (the maximum speed of different types of traffic)
* Gradient (to compensate for longer or shorter braking distances)
* The braking characteristics of trains (different types of train, e.g., freight, high-speed passenger, have different inertial figures)
* Sighting (how far ahead a driver can see a signal)
* Reaction time (of the driver)

Historically, some lines operated so that certain large or high speed trains were signalled under different rules and only given the right of way if two blocks in front of the train were clear.

=== Moving block ===

Under a moving block system, computers calculate a safe zone around each moving train that no other train is allowed to enter. The system depends on knowledge of the precise location and speed and direction of each train, which is determined by a combination of several sensors such as radio frequency identification along the track, ultra-wideband, radar, inertial measurement units, accelerometers and trainborne speedometers (GNSS systems cannot be relied upon because they do not work in tunnels). Moving block setups require instructions to be directly passed to the train instead of using lineside signals. This has the advantage of increasing track capacity by allowing trains to run closer together while maintaining the required safety margins.

== Centralized traffic control ==

Centralized traffic control (CTC) is a form of railway signalling that originated in North America. CTC consolidates train routing decisions that were previously carried out by local signal operators or the train crews themselves. The system consists of a centralized train dispatcher&#x27;s office that controls railroad interlockings and traffic flows in portions of the rail system designated as CTC territory.

== Train detection ==
Train detection refers to the presence or absence of trains on a defined section of line.

=== Track circuits ===
The most common way to determine whether a section of line is occupied is by use of a track circuit. The rails at either end of each section are electrically isolated from the next section, and an electric current is fed to both running rails at one end. A relay at the other end is connected to both rails. When the section is unoccupied, the relay coil completes an electrical circuit, and is energized. However, when a train enters the section, it short-circuits the current in the rails, and the relay is de-energized. This method does not explicitly need to check that the entire train has left the section. If part of the train remains in the section, the track circuit detects that part.

This type of circuit detects the absence of trains, both for setting the signal indication and for providing various interlocking functions—for example, preventing points from being moved while a train is approaching them. Electrical circuits also &quot;prove&quot; that points are locked in the appropriate position before the signal protecting that route can be cleared. UK trains and staff working in track circuit block areas carry track circuit operating clips (TCOC) so that, in the event of something fouling an adjacent running-line, the track circuit can be short-circuited. This places the signal protecting that line to &#x27;danger&#x27; to stop an approaching train before the signaller can be alerted.

=== Axle counters ===
An alternate method of determining the occupied status of a block uses devices located at its beginning and end that count the number of axles that enter and leave the block section. If the number of axles leaving the block section equals those that entered it, the block is assumed to be clear. Axle counters provide similar functions to track circuits, but also exhibit a few other characteristics.
In a damp environment an axle counted section can be far longer than a track circuited one. The low ballast resistance of very long track circuits reduces their sensitivity.
Track circuits can automatically detect some types of track defect such as a broken rail.
In the event of power restoration after a power failure, an axle counted section is left in an undetermined state until a train has passed through the affected section. A track circuited section immediately detects the presence of a train in section.

== Fixed signals ==
On most railways, physical signals are erected at the lineside to indicate to drivers whether the line ahead is occupied and to ensure that sufficient space exists between trains to allow them to stop.

=== Mechanical signals ===
Older forms of signal displayed their different aspects by their physical position. The earliest types comprised a board that was either turned face-on and fully visible to the driver, or rotated so as to be practically invisible. While this type of signal is still in use in some countries (e.g., France and Germany), by far the most common form of mechanical signal worldwide is the semaphore signal. This comprises a pivoted arm or blade that can be inclined at different angles. A horizontal arm is the most restrictive indication (for &#x27;danger&#x27;, &#x27;caution&#x27;, &#x27;stop and proceed&#x27; or &#x27;stop and stay&#x27; depending on the type of signal).

To enable trains to run at night, one or more lights are usually provided at each signal. Typically this comprises a permanently lit oil lamp with movable coloured spectacles in front that alter the colour of the light. The driver therefore had to learn one set of indications for daytime viewing and another for nighttime viewing.

Whilst it is normal to associate the presentation of a green light with a safe condition, this was not historically the case. In the very early days of railway signalling, the first coloured lights (associated with the turned signals above) presented a white light for &#x27;clear&#x27; and a red light for &#x27;danger&#x27;. Green was originally used to indicate &#x27;caution&#x27; but fell out of use when the time interval system was discontinued. A green light subsequently replaced white for &#x27;clear&#x27;, to address concerns that a broken red lens could be taken by a driver as a false &#x27;clear&#x27; indication. It was not until scientists at Corning Glassworks perfected a shade of yellow without any tinges of green or red that yellow became the accepted colour for &#x27;caution&#x27;.

Mechanical signals are usually remotely operated by wire from a lever in a signal box, but electrical or hydraulic operation is normally used for signals that are located too distant for manual operation.

=== Colour light signals ===

On most modern railways, colour light signals have largely replaced mechanical ones. Colour light signals have the advantage of displaying the same aspects by night as by day, and require less maintenance than mechanical signals.

Although signals vary widely between countries, and even between railways within a given country, a typical system of aspects would be:
*Green: Proceed at line speed. Expect to find next signal displaying green or yellow.
*Yellow: Prepare to find next signal displaying red.
*Red: Stop.

On some railways, colour light signals display the same set of aspects as shown by the lights on mechanical signals during darkness.

=== Route signalling and speed signalling ===
&quot;Route signalling&quot; and &quot;speed signalling&quot; are two different ways of notifying trains about junctions.

Under route signalling, a driver is informed which route the train will take beyond each signal (unless only one route is possible). This is achieved by a &quot;route indicator&quot; attached to the signal. The driver uses their route knowledge, reinforced by speed restriction signs fixed at the lineside, to drive the train at the correct speed for the route to be taken. This method has the disadvantage that the driver may be unfamiliar with the required speed over a junction onto which they have been diverted due to some emergency condition. Several accidents have been caused by this alone. For this reason, in the UK, where all lines are route signalled, drivers are only allowed to drive on routes that they have been trained on and must regularly travel over the lesser used diversionary routes to keep their route knowledge up to date.

Many route signalling systems use &quot;approach control&quot; (see below) to inform a driver of an upcoming change of route.

Under speed signalling, the signal aspect informs the driver at what speed they may proceed over a junction, but not necessarily the route the train will take. Speed signalling requires a far greater range of signal aspects than route signalling, but less dependence is placed on drivers&#x27; route knowledge, although the need for drivers to learn the route is not eliminated as speed signalling does not usually inform drivers of speed limit changes outside junctions. Usually speed limit signs are used in addition to speed signals, with the driver following whichever shows the lower speed.

Many systems have come to use elements of both systems to give drivers as much information as possible. This can mean that speed signalling systems may use route indications in conjunction with speed aspects to better inform drivers of their route; for example, route indications may be used at major stations to indicate to arriving trains to which platform they are routed. Likewise, some route signalling systems indicate approach speed using theatre displays so that drivers know what speed they must travel.
=== Approach release ===
When the train is routed towards a diverging route that must be taken at a speed significantly less than the mainline speed, the driver must be given adequate prior warning.

Under &quot;route signalling&quot;, the aspects necessary to control speed do not exist, so a system known as &quot;approach release&quot; is often employed. This involves holding the junction signal at a restrictive aspect (typically &quot;stop&quot;) so that the signals on the approach show the correct sequence of caution aspects. The driver brakes in accordance with the caution aspect, without necessarily being aware that the diverging route has in fact been set. As the train approaches the junction signal, its aspect may clear to whatever aspect the current track occupancy ahead permits. Where the turnout speed is the same, or nearly the same, as the mainline speed, approach release is unnecessary.

Under &quot;speed signalling&quot;, the signals approaching the divergence display aspects appropriate to control the trains speed, so no &quot;approach release&quot; is required.

There is also a system of &quot;flashing yellows&quot; used in the UK that allows trains to approach a diverging route at higher speed. This informs the driver that the route ahead is set onto a diverging line. With the advent of faster modern day trains and junctions a better system for advising drivers was required and so the following system was developed way back in the early 1980s. The system has been refined over the years, now being used internationally and it is also used on lower speed 3-aspect signalling systems where the &quot;single flashing yellow&quot; is the driver&#x27;s first indication.

On the 4-aspect system, if the route through the junction is clear the junction signal will display a single &quot;steady yellow&quot; aspect together with an illuminated junction indicator showing the selected route.

The signal prior to the junction signal will now show a &quot;single flashing yellow&quot; aspect and the signal prior to that one will display &quot;two flashing yellow&quot; aspects. The driver&#x27;s route knowledge tells them permissible speed across the diverging junction, and they will begin to slow the train upon seeing the &quot;two flashing yellows&quot;. The flashing signals tell the driver that the route through the junction is set and is clear, but that beyond that the first signal on the diverging route is &quot;red&quot; so they must be prepared to stop there.

As the train approaches the junction signal, the signal may &quot;step up&quot; to a less restrictive aspect (single &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;two yellows&quot; or &quot;green&quot;) depending on how far ahead the line is clear.

=== Speed-controlled approach ===

Some systems in the world use mechanical speed control systems in conjunction with signalling to ensure the speed of a train is limited to a specific value, in order to ensure the train is travelling at a speed in which it is able to stop before an obstruction. These systems most often use mechanical train stop devices (a small arm coming up from the rails that will apply the brakes of a train when run over) to &quot;trip&quot; the brakes of a train that is travelling too fast. Normally, once a train reaches a certain point on the tracks, it sets off a timer, when the timer runs out the train stop arm will lower, allowing a train to go past uninterrupted. The timing is designed so that if the train is travelling at the intended speed (or slower) then the train will be able to continue without issue, but if the train is travelling too fast, then the Train Stop will trip the train and bring it to a halt. This system can be used to ensure a train is travelling at a certain speed, which allows designers to be confident that shorter signal overlaps will be sufficient, and thus employment of this system can help to greatly improve capacity of a railway line.

The system is most often used on approach to dead end junctions to stop trains from crashing into the buffers at the end, as has happened in places such as Moorgate. It is also used on high traffic lines to allow for higher capacity, such as the City Circle Railway in Sydney, where it was used on the western half from 1932 to allow 42 trains per hour to traverse the line in each direction, each station would have multiple train stops along the length of the platforms that would progressively lower to ensure an arriving train would not crash into the departing train, less than 100 meters ahead. This system was modified in the early 1990s, so that an arriving train would not be able to enter the platform until the previous train had departed, however the trips continue to be used to overcome the signal overlap normally required.

These systems are often used in conjunction with &quot;progressive speed signalling&quot; (see below).

=== Progressive speed signalling ===
&quot;Progressive speed signalling&quot; refers to systems that impose speed restrictions on cautionary aspects. On systems that do not have progressive speed signalling, aspects warning of an upcoming red signal do not force the driver to take any action; it is up to their own judgment when to start slowing down in preparation to stop at the red signal. With progressive speed signalling, each cautionary aspect before a red signal imposes a successively lower speed limit on the driver. It should not be confused with speed signalling as used at junctions; progressive speed signalling can be used in conjunction with route signalling.

== Safety systems ==
A train driver failing to respond to a signal&#x27;s indication can be catastrophic. As a result, various auxiliary safety systems have been devised. Any such system requires installation of some degree of train borne and wayside equipment. Some systems only intervene in the event of a signal being passed at danger (SPAD). Others include audible and/or visual indications inside the driver&#x27;s cab to supplement the line side signals. Automatic brake application occurs if the driver should fail to acknowledge a warning. The most advanced train control systems have no driver at all relying on computers to drive the system entirely such as Skytrain in Vancouver, Canada and the metro system in Doha, Qatar.

In-cab safety systems are of great benefit during fog, when poor visibility would otherwise require that restrictive measures be put in place. Safety systems are also important in urban rail where it is impossible to see around corners in subway and metro tunnels. On-board and wayside computers can track trains around tight corners at higher speeds ensuring safety.

== Cab signalling ==
Cab signalling is a subsystem that communicates signalling information into the train cab such as driving position, speed and failure alarms. Cab signaling units are important human factors engineering subsystems in modern train signalling systems.

If there is an active cab, the orientation of the train is decided, i.e. the side of the active cab is considered as the front of the train. In modern systems, a train protection system is overlaid on top of the cab signalling system and will automatically apply the brakes and bring the train to a stop if the driver fails to control the speed of the train in accordance with the system&#x27;s safety requirements. Cab signalling systems rely on tachometers, accelerometers, ultra-wideband units, inertia measurement units, track circuits, to transponders that communicate with the cab, and communication-based train control systems.

== Interlocking ==
In the early days of the railways, signalmen were responsible for ensuring any points (US: switches) were set correctly before allowing a train to proceed. Mistakes, however, led to accidents, sometimes with fatalities. The concept of the mechanical interlocking of point switches, signals and other appliances was introduced to improve safety. This prevents a signalman from operating appliances in an unsafe sequence using mechanical means, such as clearing a signal while one or more sets of points are not set correctly for the route. Early interlocking systems used mechanical devices both to operate the signalling appliances and to ensure their safe operation.

Beginning around the 1930s, electrical relay interlockings were used. Since the mid 1980s, new interlocking systems have tended to be of the electronic variety. Microprocessors decide what point switch movements are permissible. Modern interlocking systems and subsystems allow and prohibit certain point switch positions to enhance train safety.

== Operating rules ==

Operating rules, policies and procedures are used by railroads to enhance safety. Specific operating rules often differ from country to country, and there may even be differences between separate railroads within the same country.

=== Argentina ===
The Argentinian operating rules are described in the &quot;Reglamento interno técnico de operaciones [R.I.T.O.]&quot; (&quot;technical operating rule-book).&quot;

=== Australia ===

The application of operating rules in Australia is called &quot;Safeworking&quot;. The &quot;method of working&quot; for any particular region or location is referred-to as the &quot;Safeworking system&quot; for that region. Operating rules differ between states, although attempts are being made to formulate a national standard.

=== North America ===

In North America, and especially the United States, operating rules are called &quot;method of operation&quot;. There are five main sets of operating rules in North America:
*Canadian Rail Operating Rules (CROR), used by most Canadian railways, with the exception of Canadian National Railway&#x27;s US operations, which uses a modified, proprietary version of the GCOR, known as USOR (United States Operating Rules)
*General Code of Operating Rules (GCOR), used by many Class I railroads, Class II railroads, and Short-line railroads in the United States
*Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC), used by many railroads in the Northeast US
*Class I Norfolk Southern uses a unique set of operating rules.
*Class I CSX Transportation uses a unique set of operating rules.

=== United Kingdom ===

The operating rulebook for the United Kingdom is called the &quot;GE/RT8000 Rule Book&quot;, more commonly known simply as &quot;The Rule Book&quot; by railway employees. It is controlled by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), which is independent from Network Rail or any other train operating company or freight operating company. Most heritage railways operate to a simplified variant of a British Railways rule book.

=== Finland ===

The signalling system used on the railway network in Finland comprises color-light signals and fixed signs. It is used together with the EBICAB 900, an automatic train control system better known as JKV, .

=== Italy ===

In Italy, railway signalling is described in a particular instruction called &quot;Regolamento Segnali&quot; (&quot;Signal Regulation&quot;).

=== India ===
The Indian operating rules, called the &quot;General Rules&quot;, are common for all zonal railways of Indian Railways and can be amended only by the Railway Board. Subsidiary rules are added to the General Rules by zonal railways, which do not infringe upon them. Corrections are brought about from time to time through correction slips.

=== Japan ===

Japanese signalling was initially based on British railway signalling practice, and Japanese railway signalling continues to be based on the UK route signalling system for junctions. However, as signalling has advanced to meet the requirements of the system, progressive speed signalling is used outside of junctions.

=== Hong Kong ===
Hong Kong Railway signalling originated from the British railway signalling principle, and continues to be based on the principles to develop rulebooks and procedures under the operating organisation MTR.

<text>Iznogoud (; from &quot;is no good&quot; pronounced with a French accent) is a French comics series featuring an eponymous character, created by the comics writer René Goscinny and comics artist Jean Tabary. The comic series chronicles the life and times of Iznogoud, the Grand Vizier of the Caliphate of Baghdad at an undefined period. His greatest desire is to replace the Caliph, leading him to repeatedly utter the phrase &quot;I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph&quot; (dethrone him), a phrase that has been adopted in French and some other European languages to characterize overly ambitious people. Iznogoud is supported by his dimwitted yet faithful servant, Wa&#x27;at Alahf (from &quot;what a laugh&quot;).

After the death of Goscinny in 1977 Tabary continued with writing the character. The stories have been translated into several languages, including English, and the title has been adapted to animated and live-action film.

So far 30 graphic novels featuring Iznogoud have been published in French, with at least 26 of those published in English and a number of other languages. In 1974-1979, and again since 2021, &quot;Iznogoud&quot; also ran as a political-satirical newspaper comic, &quot;L&#x27;Ignoble Iznogoud Commente L&#x27;Actualité&quot;, with jokes referring directly to French politics and current events. Iznogoud was also adapted into a cartoon series produced by Saban Entertainment, with 52 episodes to its name, again with most of them having been translated to other languages as well.

==Publication history==
The series made its debut in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Record&quot; on 15 January 1962 under the title, &quot;Les aventures du Calife Haroun el Poussah&quot;. It was eventually recognised that the wicked supporting character ought to be the focus of the strip, and it was renamed &quot;Iznogoud&quot;. In 1968, it resumed serial publication in Goscinny&#x27;s &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine.

Goscinny&#x27;s taste for sharp satirical writing keeps the repetitive format of the stories constantly fresh, making Iznogoud one of the most popular anti-heroes in the French comic strip world. Goscinny&#x27;s skill with puns, made famous in &quot;Astérix&quot;, is also evident in &quot;Iznogoud&quot;. Most of the puns in the original French make little sense if translated directly into English, requiring of translators (Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge in the case of the English translations) to find creative solutions for equivalent puns while still keeping within the spirit of the original text.

When Goscinny died in 1977, Tabary eventually decided to carry on the work himself, just as Albert Uderzo did with &quot;Asterix&quot;. While the Goscinny period was characterized by &quot;albums&quot; comprising several short-length tales each, Tabary turned the series in a new direction, by dedicating every new album entirely to a single story, larger and much more detailed, usually revolving around a new unique concept.

In 1987 a game was produced by Infogrames entitled &quot;Iznogoud&quot;. The series was adapted to animated film in 1995 with a cartoon TV series, where the caliph is referred to as a sultan. A live-action &quot;Iznogoud&quot; film starring Michaël Youn and Jacques Villeret, &quot;Iznogoud: Calife à la place du calife&quot;, was released in France in February 2005.

The publisher Cinebook Ltd is currently publishing English language translations of the books in the Iznogoud series. The first book in the series, &quot;The Wicked Wiles of Iznogoud&quot;, was published in March 2008. Further volumes continue to appear at approximately six month intervals. In India, Euro Books published the English versions of 12 Iznogoud titles in 2009.

==Synopsis==
Iznogoud is Grand Vizier to the Caliph of Baghdad, Haroun El Poussah (Haroun El Plassid in English, a pun on the historical Caliph, Harun al-Rashid; &quot;poussah&quot; is roughly translated as &quot;oaf&quot;). His sole aim in life is to overthrow the Caliph and take his place. This is frequently expressed in his famous catchphrase, &quot;I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph&quot; (), which has passed into everyday French for qualifying over-ambitious people who want to become chief. Iznogoud is always assisted in his plans by his faithful but dimwitted henchman, Dilat Larath (Wa&#x27;at Alahf in English; meaning &quot;to have a good laugh&quot;).

===Supporting characters===
Goscinny and Tabary occasionally make appearances themselves. In one episode, Tabary uses a magical time-travelling closet to help Iznogoud seize the Caliph title. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical calendar that lets him travel in time when he rips off its pages. He rips too many and he is transported to the 20th century, inside the studio of Tabary. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical drawing paper set that makes anybody or anything drawn on it disappear once the paper is torn apart. Unfortunately, the drawing needs to be realistic, and Iznogoud is a poor artist. In search of an art teacher, he meets Tabary, renamed &quot;Tabary El-Retard&quot; ( meaning &quot;delay&quot;).

There are occasionally &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; moments, as when Iznogoud travels in a country in a mirror, and all is reversed, including text in balloons. Tabary is shown complaining to Goscinny about going through this frustrating &quot;reversal&quot; work, and even threatens him with a gun, to convince him into making a non-reversed &quot;translated&quot; version. They also appear debating after a contemporary crowd demands that they make Iznogoud caliph.

Other recurring characters include Sultan Pullmankar (Sultan Streetcar in English), the Caliph&#x27;s neighbour who is described as a touchy man with a powerful army. Iznogoud often tries to provoke Pullmankar to become angry at the Caliph, in order to instigate a war. However, Pullmankar never gets angry with the caliph, only with Iznogoud.

The crew of Redbeard, another comics series published in Pilote, appears in &quot;A Carrot for Iznogoud&quot;, as it did in many stories of René Goscinny&#x27;s most famous creation Asterix.

==References in society==
Notably, the character has also made his mark on French popular culture and public life. Wanting to become &quot;Caliph in the Caliph&#x27;s place&quot; has become a popular expression in French, describing people perceived as over-ambitious. The &quot;Prix Iznogoud&quot; (Iznogoud Award) was created in 1992 and is given each year to &quot;a personality who failed to take the Caliph&#x27;s place&quot;, chosen among prominent French figures who have recently known spectacular failures. The award has been given to various personalities, amongst them Édouard Balladur (1995), Nicolas Sarkozy (1999) and Jean-Marie Messier (2002). The jury is headed by politician André Santini, who gave the award to himself after failing to become president of the Île-de-France in the 2004 regional elections.

<text>Cranwell is a village in the civil parish of Cranwell, Brauncewell and Byard&#x27;s Leap, in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated approximately north-west from Sleaford and south-east from Lincoln. The principal through road, the B1429 between the A15 to the east and the A17 to the west, joins the village to RAF Cranwell. The appropriate civil parish is called Cranwell, Brauncewell and Byard&#x27;s Leap with a population of 2,827 at the 2011 census.

==Climate==
The British Isles experience a temperate, maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters. Lincolnshire&#x27;s position on the east of the British Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and it is one of the driest counties in the UK. In Cranwell, the average daily high temperature peaks at in July and a peak average daily mean of occurs in July. The lowest daily mean temperature is in January; the average daily high for that month is and the daily low is (the latter also occurs in February). The East of England tends to be sheltered from strong winds relative to the north and west of the country. Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the East of England than elsewhere; Sleaford (within of Cranwell) suffered them in 2006 and 2012, both causing damage to property.

==History==
During the medieval period the parish was originally governed as part of the ancient Flaxwell Wapentake in the North Kesteven division of Lincolnshire. The name Cranwell is thought to mean the spring or stream frequented by cranes or herons.

The village centres on the remains of the village cross. The cross is a 14th-century market cross (or buttercross) from which important matters of public moment were announced. The cross, which is listed as a scheduled monument, had restoration work carried out by a Mr CH Fowler between 1903 and 1904.

Cranwell manor was held by the Thorold family from the 16th century for over three hundred years. The manor house was demolished in 1816 and the Hall Farm&#x27;s farmhouse was erected on the site. The Thorold family moved to a new mansion at Syston Park. In 1871 Sir John Thorold is recorded as owning all the land in Cranwell with the exception of the church glebelands and a single farmstead that was under the ownership of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.
In 1682, Sir William and his wife Lady Anne Thorold are recorded as establishing a charity that gave about £8 and 2 shillings (£8.10) per year for the poor, to be distributed on Lady Day (25 March and then considered to be New Year&#x27;s Day). The parish also benefited from the will of Lady Margaret Thorold who granted £15 a year to apprentice four boys from the village. With the Poor Law Amendment Act reforms of 1834, the parish became part of the Sleaford Poor Law Union group of parishes.

The population of the village in 1801 was recorded as being just 88 people and even by 1911 had only risen to 184. The village only grew and has continued to expand since the opening of the aviation training facility and now stands in the region of 3,000 residents.

Cranwell railway station, on a single track branch line from Sleaford, opened in 1917 and served the naval aviation training facility then known as RNAS Daedalus, later to become RAF Cranwell. The branch line was closed in 1956 and the track removed. However, the original station building still stands and is in use as the current RAF main guardroom. Engine sheds in a small goods yard area closer to the village were demolished and the land re-used for housing.

In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 2191. On 1 April 1931 the parish was abolished and merged with Byards Leap to form &quot;Cranwell and Byards Leap&quot;.

==Religious sites==
Standing near to the cross is the village&#x27;s parish church. Dedicated to St Andrew, the church originates circa the 10th century, the village possibly dates from the time of King Alfred (849-899). The church consists only of a nave and chancel with, above the former, a bellcote, much of the masonry is Norman but parts date back to Saxon times. The fittings include 17th century bench-ends and a Perpendicular rood screen.
Mounted on corbels in the north aisle are the remains of a hogsback grave. The carvings on these stones are either Saxon or Norse (Ringerike). The stones are unique to Lincolnshire and are probably the finest of their type in the country. In the stonework in the porch is the incised outline of a pilgrim&#x27;s shoe and the year 1728, and on the right-hand door pillar are six carved figures believed to depict ancient May King and Queen ceremonial costumes. The churchyard includes a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery with 131 graves from First and Second World Wars.

==Education==
As early as 1682, Sir William and Lady Anne Thorold funded a charity that provided £3 each year for the education of poor children from within the parish. The first true school built in Cranwell opened in 1850 by public subscription and provided facilities for up to 35 children.

The current Cranwell Primary School is housed in a modern building and has approximately 300 children on the roll between the ages of 4–11. The school is a Foundation school and is non-denominational.

There are no secondary schools in the village and children instead travel to Lincoln, Grantham or Sleaford.

==RAF College Cranwell==

Just over one mile to the west of the village is Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and RAF Cranwell with its two associated airfields. The northern airfield is the older, being used for light aircraft and airships from 1916 and remains as a grassed field used regularly by gliders and light aircraft. The southern airfield is much larger with two paved runways and abuts the A17 road, this was first used as a flying training base in 1917. The paved runways were built in 1954, to make way for the jet aircraft, Meteor and Vampire.

Cranwell does not have a public house. It does, however, have a members only social club. This dates back to when the cadets training at RAF Cranwell during the Second World War used to come into the village to try to buy alcohol. The members only club was introduced as a deterrent to them, being only temporary residents in the area they were therefore unable to gain membership. To this day, no pub has ever opened its doors to the public, even though the reasons for not having one have long since become obsolete.

==Other uses of the name Cranwell==
The surname Cranwell occurs in Buckinghamshire and Essex (at least), it appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. A few very small farms and hamlets are named Cranwell in Bucks.

<doc id="276080" wikidata="Q1421961" url="?curid=276080" title="Idée fixe (psychology)">
<text>In psychology, an idée fixe is a preoccupation of mind believed to be firmly resistant to any attempt to modify it, a fixation. The name originates from the French &quot;idée&quot; , &quot;idea&quot; and &quot;fixe&quot; , &quot;fixed.&quot;

==Background==
According to intellectual historian Jan E. Goldstein, the initial introduction of &quot;idée fixe&quot; as a medical term occurred around 1812 in connection with monomania. The French psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol considered an &quot;idée fixe&quot; – in other words an unhealthy fixation on a single object – to be the principal symptom of monomania. The term &quot;idée fixe&quot; had already seeped from psychiatric discourse into literary language before Hector Berlioz employed it in a musical context in his programmatic &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; (subtitled &quot;Episode in the Life of an Artist...&quot;) of 1830 to denote a recurring melodic theme that references the composer&#x27;s own romantic obsession (or erotomania) with the actress Harriet Smithson. Especially around the 1820s and 1830s, the concepts of &quot;idée fixe&quot; and monomania became firmly associated with the Romantic movement in literature, and fixated protagonists feature in a variety of contemporary novels and plays, ranging from the serious to the almost humorous.

As originally employed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, &quot;idée fixe&quot; described a more specific condition with respect to &quot;monomania&quot; (a term denoting a wider range of pathologies that did not stem only from a single fixation). A second difference is that the victim of &quot;idée fixe&quot; was understood to be unaware of the unreality of their frame of mind, while the victim of monomania might be aware. At that time, &quot;idée fixe&quot; was discussed as a form of neurosis or monomania.
According to Goldstein, the original medical diagnosis of &quot;monomania&quot; &quot;denoted an &quot;idée fixe&quot;, a single pathological preoccupation in an otherwise sound mind.&quot;

The idea of monomania as a diagnostic category was further developed by Esquirol in his work &quot;Des Malades Mentales&quot; (1839) and was coupled to the &quot;idée fixe&quot; by Wilhelm Griesinger (1845) who viewed &quot;every single &quot;idée fixe&quot; [as] the expression of a deeply deranged psychic individuality and probably an indicator of an incipient form of mania&quot;.

The &quot;pathologicalization&quot; of political convictions was used to discredit political anarchists. The further historical evolution of &quot;idée fixe&quot; was much entangled with the introduction of psychologists into legal matters such as the insanity defense, and is found in a number of texts.

==Development of the concept==
The concept of &quot;idées fixes&quot; has been expanded and refined by Emil Kraepelin (1904), Carl Wernicke (1906), and Karl Jaspers (1963), evolving into a concept of &quot;overvalued ideas&quot;. An overvalued idea is a false or exaggerated and sustained belief that is maintained with much less than delusional intensity (i.e., the individual is able to acknowledge the possibility that the ideas may not be true).

==Modern usage==
In most contexts, &quot;idée fixe&quot; refers to an obsession or a passion one fixates on. However, the term also has a pathological dimension, denoting serious psychological issues. The pathology is what is denoted in psychology and law.

&quot;Idée fixe&quot; began as a parent category of obsession, and as a preoccupation of mind the &quot;idée fixe&quot; resembles today&#x27;s obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Although the afflicted person can think, reason and act like other people, they are unable to stop a particular train of thought or action. However, in obsessive–compulsive disorder, the person recognizes the absurdity of their obsession or compulsion, which may not be the case with an &quot;idée fixe&quot; (normally being a delusion). Today, the term &quot;idée fixe&quot; does not denote a specific disorder in psychology, and does not appear as a technical designation in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM). It is still used as a descriptive term, appearing in dictionaries of psychology.

==In literature==
An example of an idée fixe is in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;:

Although Herman Melville&#x27;s Captain Ahab may come to mind as another famous example of &quot;idée fixe&quot;, and it is sometimes referred to this way, more often Ahab&#x27;s obsession is referred to as &quot;monomania&quot; (the more inclusive term), and Melville himself does that. It would seem from the description of Ahab&#x27;s possession that &quot;idée fixe&quot; applies quite accurately, as the following description suggests:

However, what makes &quot;monomania&quot; the better term is that &quot;Captain Ahab ... has an inkling of his true state of mind: &#x27;my means are sane, my motive and my object mad.

The words &quot;idée fixe&quot; also occur explicitly: for example, in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes:

and in Abraham B. Yehoshua&#x27;s novel about the Mani family through six generations:

and in the account of the war on terror by George Bush&#x27;s counter-terrorism chief Richard A. Clarke:

==Legal implications==
Possibly the best example of the role of &quot;idée fixe&quot; in an insanity defense today is its use in identifying paranoid personality disorder.

<text>Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae (), named for their robust and agile hunting skills and excellent eyesight. They live mostly in solitude, hunt alone, and usually do not spin webs. Some are opportunistic hunters, pouncing upon prey as they find it or chasing it over short distances; others wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow. Wolf spiders resemble nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders carry their egg sacs by attaching them to their spinnerets, while the Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps. Two of the wolf spider&#x27;s eight eyes are large and prominent; this distinguishes them from nursery web spiders, whose eyes are all of roughly equal size. This can also help distinguish them from the similar-looking grass spiders.

==Description==

The many genera of wolf spiders range in body size (legs not included) from less than . They have eight eyes arranged in three rows. The bottom row consists of four small eyes, the middle row has two very large eyes (which distinguishes them from the Pisauridae), and the top row has two medium-sized eyes. Unlike most other arachnids, which are generally blind or have poor vision, wolf spiders have excellent eyesight.

The &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; is a retroreflective tissue found in eyes. This reflective tissue is only found in four secondary eyes of the wolf spider. Flashing a beam of light over the spider produces eyeshine; this eyeshine can be seen when the lighting source is roughly coaxial with the viewer or sensor. The light from the light source (e.g., a flashlight or sunlight) has been reflected from the spider&#x27;s eyes directly back toward its source, producing a &quot;glow&quot; that is easily noticed. Wolf spiders possess the third-best eyesight of all spider groups, bettered by jumping spiders of the family Salticidae (which can distinguish colors) and the huntsman spiders of the family Sparassidae.
Wolf spiders are unique in the way that they carry their eggs. The egg sac, a round, silken globe, is attached to the spinnerets at the end of the abdomen, allowing the spider to carry her unhatched young with her. The abdomen must be held in a raised position to keep the egg case from dragging on the ground. Despite this handicap, they are still capable of hunting. Another aspect unique to wolf spiders is their method of care of young. Immediately after the spiderlings emerge from their protective silken case, they clamber up their mother&#x27;s legs and crowd onto the dorsal side of her abdomen. The mother carries the spiderlings for several weeks before they are large enough to disperse and fend for themselves.

Because they depend on camouflage for protection, they do not have the flashy appearance of some other kinds of spiders. In general, their coloration is appropriate to their favorite habitat.

&quot;Hogna&quot; is the genus with the largest of the wolf spiders. Among the &quot;Hogna&quot; species in the U.S., the nearly solid dark brown &quot;H. carolinensis&quot; (Carolina wolf spider) is the largest, with a body that can be more than long. It is sometimes confused with &quot;H. helluo&quot;, which is somewhat smaller and different in coloration. The underside of &quot;H. carolinensis&quot; is solid black, but the underside of &quot;H. helluo&quot; is variegated and has reds, oranges, and yellows with shades of black.

Some members of the Lycosidae, such as &quot;H. carolinensis&quot;, make deep, tubular burrows in which they lurk much of the time. Others, such as &quot;H. helluo&quot;, seek shelter under rocks and other shelters as nature may provide. As with spiders in general, males of almost any species can sometimes be found inside homes and buildings as they wander in search for females during the autumn.

Wolf spiders play an important role in natural population control of insects and are often considered &quot;beneficial bugs&quot; due to their predation of pest species within farms and gardens.

===Venom===

Wolf spiders inject venom if continually provoked. Symptoms of their bites include swelling and mild pain. In the past, necrotic bites have been attributed to some South American and Australian species, but further investigation has indicated that those problems that did occur were probably due to bites by members of other families or did not induce those effects.

== Evolutionary history ==
Wolf spiders likely originated after the K–Pg extinction event sometime in the late Paleocene, with most main subfamilies likely originating during the Eocene and Early Oligocene between 41 and 32 million years ago.

==Habitats==
Wolf spiders are found in a wide range of coastal and inland habitats. These include shrublands, woodland, wet coastal forests, alpine meadows, suburban gardens, and homes. Spiderlings disperse aerially; consequently, wolf spiders have wide distributions. Although some species have very specific microhabitat needs (such as stream-side gravel beds or montane herb fields), most are wanderers without permanent homes. Some build burrows which can be left open or have a trap door (depending on species). Arid-zone species construct turrets or plug their holes with leaves and pebbles during the rainy season to protect themselves from flood waters. Often, they are found in man-made locations such as sheds and other outdoor equipment.

==Mating behavior==
Many species of wolf spiders possess very complex courtship behaviors and secondary sexual characteristics, such as tufts of bristles on their legs or special colorations, which are most often found on the males of the species. These sexual characteristics vary by species and are most often found as modifications of the first pair of legs. First-leg modifications are often divided into elongated bristles on the legs, increased swelling of leg segments, or the full elongation of the first pair of legs compared to the other three pairs. Some mating behaviors are common between wolf spider genera, and many more that are species-specific. In the most commonly studied genus of wolf spiders, &quot;Schizocosa&quot;, researchers found that all males engage in a seismic component of their courtship display, either stridulation, or drumming their forelegs on the ground, but some also dependent on visual cues in their courtship display, as well as the seismic signaling, such as waving the front two legs in the air in front of the female, concluding that some &quot;Schizocosa&quot; species rely on multimodal courtship behaviors.

The Lycosidae comprise mainly wandering spiders, and as such, population density and male-to-female sex ratio puts selective pressures on wolf spiders when finding mates. Female wolf spiders that have already mated are more likely to eat the next male that tries to mate with them than those that have not mated yet. Males that have already mated have a higher probability of successfully mating again, but females that have already mated have a lower probability of mating again.

==Relationship to humans==
Though wolf spiders do bite humans, their bites are not dangerous. Wolf spider bites often result in mild redness, itching, ulcers, and if the bite wound is not cleaned it could lead to infection. However, wolf spiders usually only bite when they feel threatened or mishandled. 

Wolf spiders have been found to be a vital source of natural pest control for many people&#x27;s personal gardens or even homes, since the wolf spider preys on perceived pests such as crickets, ants, cockroaches, and in some cases lizards and frogs. In recent years, wolf spiders have been utilized as pest control in agriculture to reduce the amount of pesticides needed on crops. A notable example is the use of wolf spiders in cranberry bogs as a means of controlling unwanted crop destruction.

==In culture==
South Carolina designated the Carolina wolf spider (&quot;Hogna carolinensis&quot;) as the official state spider in 2000 due to the efforts of Skyler B. Hutto, a third-grade student at Sheridan Elementary School in Orangeburg.

At the time, South Carolina was the only U.S. state that recognized a state spider. In 2015, efforts began to name an official state spider for neighboring North Carolina.

<text>Robert Clark Seger ( ; born May 6, 1945) is an American retired singer, songwriter, and musician. As a locally successful Detroit-area artist, he performed and recorded with the groups Bob Seger and the Last Heard and the Bob Seger System throughout the 1960s, breaking through with his first album, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot; (which contained his first national hit &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;) in 1969. By the early 1970s, he had dropped the &#x27;System&#x27; from his recordings and continued to strive for broader success with various other bands. In 1973, he put together the Silver Bullet Band, with a group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful on the national level with the album &quot;Live Bullet&quot; (1976), recorded live with the Silver Bullet Band in 1975 at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the studio album &quot;Night Moves&quot;. On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on several of Seger&#x27;s best-selling singles and albums.

A roots rock musician known for his raspy, powerful voice, Seger is one of the best-known artists of the heartland rock genre, with his songs often concerning love, women, and blue-collar themes. He has recorded many hits, including &quot;Night Moves&quot;, &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, &quot;Mainstreet&quot;, &quot;Still the Same&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot;, &quot;Against the Wind&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Accomp&#x27;ny Me&quot;, &quot;Shame on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Roll Me Away&quot;, &quot;Like a Rock&quot;, and &quot;Shakedown&quot;, the last of which was written for the 1987 film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; and topped the &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. He also co-wrote the Eagles&#x27; number-one hit &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, and his recording of &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001.

With a career spanning six decades, Seger has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the world&#x27;s best-selling artists of all time. Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012. Seger was named &quot;Billboard&quot; 2015 Legend of Live honoree at the 12th annual &quot;Billboard&quot; Touring Conference &amp; Awards, held November 18–19 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. His farewell tour took place in 2018 and 2019.

== Early years ==
Seger was born at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Charlotte and Stewart Seger. At age five, he moved with his family to Ann Arbor. He had an older brother, George.

Seger&#x27;s father, a medical technician for Ford Motor Company, played several instruments and Seger was exposed to music from an early age. Seger was also exposed to frequent arguments between his parents that disturbed the neighborhood at night. In 1956, when Seger was 10 years old, his father abandoned the family and moved to California. The remaining family soon lost their comfortable middle-class status and struggled financially.

Seger attended Tappan Junior High School (now Tappan Middle School) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and graduated in 1963 from Ann Arbor High School, now known as Pioneer High School. He ran track and field in high school. Seger also went to Lincoln Park High School for a time.

Regarding his early musical inspirations, Seger has stated, &quot;Little Richard – he was the first one that really got to me. Little Richard and, of course, Elvis Presley.&quot; &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; by The Del-Vikings, a hit in 1957, was the first record he bought.

== Regional favorite and first national hit: 1961–1976 ==

=== The Decibels and The Town Criers ===
Bob Seger arrived on the Detroit music scene in 1961 fronting a three-piece band called the Decibels. The band included Seger on guitar, piano, keyboards, and vocals, Pete Stanger on guitar, and R.B. Hunter on drums. All of the members attended Ann Arbor High. The Decibels recorded an acetate demo of a song called &quot;The Lonely One&quot;, at Del Shannon&#x27;s studio in 1961. As well as being Seger&#x27;s first original song, &quot;The Lonely One&quot; was Seger&#x27;s first song to be played on the radio, airing only once on an Ann Arbor radio station. In 2021, a recording of &quot;The Lonely One&quot; resurfaced, and was broadcast (with permission from Seger) twice on WCSX-FM in Detroit, on the mornings of March 15 and 16.

After the Decibels disbanded, Seger joined the Town Criers, a four-piece band with Seger on lead vocals, John Flis on bass, Pep Perrine on drums, and Larry Mason on lead guitar. The Town Criers, covering songs like &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, began gaining a steady following. Meanwhile, Seger was listening to James Brown and said that, for him and his friends, &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; was their favorite record following its release in 1963. Seger was also influenced by the music of The Beatles, once they hit American shores in 1964. In general, he and local musician friends such as Glenn Frey (later a member of the Eagles) bought into the premises of 1960s pop and rock radio, with its hook-driven hits; he later recalled himself and Frey thinking at the time, &quot;You&#x27;re nobody if you can&#x27;t get on the radio.&quot;

=== Doug Brown &amp; The Omens ===
As the Town Criers began landing more gigs, Seger met a man named Doug Brown, backed by a band called The Omens. Seger joined Doug Brown &amp; The Omens, who had a bigger following than the Town Criers. While Brown was the primary lead vocalist for the group, Seger would take the lead on some songs—covering R&amp;B numbers. With this group, Seger first appeared on an officially released recording: the 1965 single &quot;TGIF&quot; backed with &quot;First Girl&quot;, credited to Doug Brown and The Omens. Seger later appeared on Doug Brown and The Omens&#x27; parody of Barry Sadler&#x27;s song &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; which was re-titled &quot;Ballad of the Yellow Beret&quot; and mocked draft evaders. Soon after its release, Sadler and his record label threatened Brown and his band with a lawsuit, and the recording was withdrawn from the market.

While Seger was a member of The Omens, he met his longtime manager Edward &quot;Punch&quot; Andrews, who at the time was partnered with Dave Leone running the Hideout franchise, which consisted of four club locations from Clawson to Rochester Hills, where local acts would play, and a small-scale record label. Seger began writing and producing for other acts that Punch managed, such as the Mama Cats and the Mushrooms (with Frey). Seger and Brown were then approached by Punch and Leone to write a song for the Underdogs, another local band who recently had a hit with a song called &quot;Man in the Glass&quot;. Seger contributed a song called &quot;East Side Story&quot;, which was not successful.

=== The Last Heard ===
Seger decided to record &quot;East Side Story&quot; and officially left the Omens (though he did retain Brown as a producer). As Bob Seger and the Last Heard, Seger released his version of the song with Hideout Records in January 1966, and it became his first big Detroit hit. The single (backed with &quot;East Side Sound&quot;, an instrumental version of &quot;East Side Story&quot;) sold 50,000 copies, mostly in the Detroit area, and led to a contract with Cameo-Parkway Records. Though the name &quot;The Last Heard&quot; originally referred to the collection of Omens and Town Criers who recorded &quot;East Side Story&quot; with Seger, it soon became the name of Seger&#x27;s permanent band, which consisted of former Town Crier Pep Perrine on drums, Carl Lagassa on guitar, and Dan Honaker on bass. Following &quot;East Side Story&quot;, the group released four more singles: the James Brown-inspired holiday single &quot;Sock It to Me Santa&quot;, the Dylan-esque &quot;Persecution Smith&quot;, &quot;Vagrant Winter&quot;, and perhaps the most notable, &quot;Heavy Music&quot;, released in 1967. &quot;Heavy Music&quot;, which sold even more copies than &quot;East Side Story&quot;, had the potential to break out nationally when Cameo-Parkway suddenly went out of business. It was a top 100 hit in Canada, where it topped out on the national RPM charts at ; in the US, it just missed the Hot 100, peaking on the &quot;bubbling under&quot; chart at . The song would stay in Seger&#x27;s live act for many years to come.

=== The Bob Seger System ===
After Cameo-Parkway folded, Seger and Punch began searching for a new label. In the spring of 1968, Bob Seger &amp; the Last Heard signed with major label Capitol Records, turning down Motown Records, who offered more money than Capitol. Seger felt that Capitol was more appropriate for his genre than Motown.

Capitol changed the name of the band to The Bob Seger System. In the transition between labels, guitarist Carl Lagassa left the band, and keyboard player Bob Schultz joined. The System&#x27;s first single with Capitol was the anti-war message song &quot;2 + 2 = ?&quot;, which reflected a marked change in Seger&#x27;s political attitudes from &quot;The Ballad of the Yellow Beret&quot;. The single was again a hit in Detroit and hit number 1 on radio stations in Buffalo, New York and Orlando, Florida, but went unnoticed almost everywhere else, and failed to chart nationally in the US. The single did, however, make the Canadian national charts, peaking at .

The second single from The Bob Seger System was &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;. It was a major hit in Michigan, and it also became Seger&#x27;s first national hit, peaking at . The song&#x27;s success led to the release of an album of the same title in 1969. The &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot; album reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart. Glenn Frey had his first studio gig singing back-up and playing guitar on &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;.

Seger was unable to follow up on this success. For the next album, singer-songwriter Tom Neme joined The System, ultimately writing and singing the majority of the tunes featured, for which the group was heavily criticized. The album called &quot;Noah&quot; (1969), failed to chart at all, leading Seger to briefly quit the music industry and attend college. He returned the following year and put out the System&#x27;s final album, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Mongrel&quot;, this time without Neme. Bob Schultz left the band as well, being replaced by Dan Watson. &quot;Mongrel&quot;, with the powerful single &quot;Lucifer&quot;, was considered to be a strong album by many critics and Detroit fans, but failed to do well commercially.

The Bob Seger System was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2006.

=== Solo ===
After &quot;Mongrel&quot; (1970) failed to live up to the success of &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot; (1969), The System dissipated. For a short period following the breakup, Seger had ambitions to be a one-man act. In 1971, he released his first solo album, the all-acoustic &quot;Brand New Morning&quot;. The album was a commercial failure and led to his departure from Capitol Records.

Seger, having regained an eye for bands, began playing with the duo Teegarden &amp; Van Winkle, who in 1970 had a hit single with &quot;God, Love, and Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. Together they recorded &quot;Smokin&#x27; O.P.&#x27;s&quot; (1972), released on Punch Andrews&#x27; own Palladium Records. The album mainly consisted of covers, spawning a minor hit with a version of Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot; ( the US), though it did feature &quot;Someday&quot;, a new Seger original, and a re-release of &quot;Heavy Music&quot;. The album reached 180 on the Billboard 200.

After spending most of 1972 touring with Teegarden &amp; Van Winkle, Seger left the duo to put together a new backing band, referred to as both My Band and the Borneo Band, made up of musicians from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Jamie Oldaker, Dick Sims, and Marcy Levy were all members of My Band before joining Eric Clapton&#x27;s backing band. In 1973, Seger put out &quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot;, recorded partly with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, a renowned group of session musicians who had recorded with the likes of J. J. Cale and Aretha Franklin. According to Seger, there was a financial misunderstanding with the musicians: they offered to record him &quot;for $1500 a side&quot;, which he took to mean $1500 per album side. When he found out that they meant $1500 per song, he left after recording three songs but resolved to work with them in the future. &quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot; featured the studio version of Seger&#x27;s later live classic &quot;Turn the Page&quot;; &quot;Rosalie&quot;, a song Seger wrote about CKLW music director Rosalie Trombley (and which was later recorded by Thin Lizzy); and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working&quot;, a song originally by Van Morrison, a strong influence on Seger&#x27;s musical development. Despite the strength of Seger&#x27;s backup musicians, the album only reached 188 on the US charts and has since faded into obscurity. Even so, &quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot; and its supporting tour mark the beginnings of Seger&#x27;s long-time relationships with future Silver Bullet Band saxophonist Alto Reed, powerhouse female vocalist Shaun Murphy, and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Over the tour, My Band would prove to be unreliable, which frustrated Seger. By the end of 1973, Seger had left My Band in search of a new backing band. Throughout 1974–75, Seger continued to perform in local venues around his hometown while known as the Bob Seger Group including one renowned concert in Davisburg, Michigan, called the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;.

=== The Silver Bullet Band ===

In 1974, Seger formed the Silver Bullet Band. Its original members were guitarist Drew Abbott, drummer and backing vocalist Charlie Allen Martin, keyboardist and backing vocalist Rick Manasa, bass guitarist Chris Campbell, and saxophonist and backing vocalist Alto Reed. With this new band sitting in occasionally, Seger released the album &quot;Seven&quot; (1974), which contained the Detroit-area hard-rock hit &quot;Get Out of Denver&quot;. This track was a modest success and charted at nationally.

In 1975, Seger returned to Capitol Records and released the album &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot;, with help from the Silver Bullet Band (with new keyboardist Robyn Robbins replacing Manasa) on his cover of the Tina Turner penned &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Katmandu&quot; which was featured in the 1985 movie &quot;Mask&quot; starring Cher (in addition to being another substantial Detroit-area hit) was Seger&#x27;s first real national break-out track since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;. Although it just missed the US Pop Top 40 – peaking at – the song received strong airplay in several markets nationwide including Detroit.

In April 1976, Seger and the Silver Bullet Band released the album &quot;Live Bullet&quot;, recorded over two nights in Detroit&#x27;s Cobo Arena in September 1975. It contained Seger&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; as well as Seger&#x27;s classic take on life on the road, &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, from &quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot;. It also included his late 1960s successful releases – &quot;Heavy Music&quot; and &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;. Critic Dave Marsh later wrote that &quot;&quot;Live Bullet&quot; is one of the best live albums ever made ... In spots, particularly during the medley of &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot;/&quot;Beautiful Loser&quot; on side one, Seger sounds like a man with one last shot at the top.&quot; An instant best-seller in Detroit, &quot;Live Bullet&quot; began to get attention in other parts of the country, selling better than Seger&#x27;s previous albums, getting progressive rock radio and album-oriented rock airplay, and enabling Seger to headline more shows. But Seger still had a popularity imbalance; in June 1976, he was a featured performer at the Pontiac Silverdome outside Detroit in front of nearly 80,000 fans, but one night later played to fewer than a thousand people in Chicago.

== Peak of success: 1976–1987 ==

Seger finally achieved his commercial breakthrough with his October 1976 album &quot;Night Moves&quot;. The title track, &quot;Night Moves&quot; was critically and commercially well-received, becoming a hit on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and receiving airplay on AOR radio. The album also featured the songs &quot;Mainstreet&quot; (written about Ann Arbor&#x27;s Ann Street), a hit ballad that emphasized Seger&#x27;s rock credibility as well as guitarist Pete Carr&#x27;s lead guitar line, and &quot;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&quot;, which peaked at on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Night Moves&quot; was Seger&#x27;s first top-ten album in the Billboard album chart, and as of 2006 was certified at 6 million copies in the United States, making it the biggest-selling studio album of his entire career. The success of &quot;Night Moves&quot; also bolstered sales of Seger&#x27;s previous releases. Seger&#x27;s 1975 release &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot; would eventually sell two million copies and the 1976 album &quot;Live Bullet&quot; would go on to sell six million copies in the United States. &quot;Live Bullet&quot; would eventually be cited as one of the greatest live albums of all time.

In February 1977, Silver Bullet Band drummer Charlie Allen Martin was hit by a car from behind while walking on a service road and was left unable to walk. David Teegarden, previous drummer for Seger on his 1972 album &quot;Smokin&#x27; O.P.&#x27;s&quot; was his replacement. Despite the loss of Martin, Seger&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; was also a success. The first single, &quot;Still the Same&quot;, reached on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;. &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot; reached on the same chart, while the ballad &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot; reached . &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot; was a major hit again when it was covered in 1983 by country music superstar Kenny Rogers and pop singer Sheena Easton. Notably, it topped &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Songs and peaked at and on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Adult Contemporary and Hot 100 charts respectively. &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot;, a song from George Jackson and Thomas E. Jones III that Seger substantially rewrote the lyrics for, peaked at on the Hot 100, but achieved greater popularity after being featured in the 1983 Tom Cruise film &quot;Risky Business&quot;, in which Tom Cruise&#x27;s character dances in his underwear to the song. It has since been ranked the second-most played Jukebox Single of all time, behind Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;Crazy&quot;. &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001. Seger has since remarked that not taking one-third of writing credit on his recording was, financially, &quot;the dumbest thing I ever did&quot;.

Seger also co-wrote the Eagles&#x27; hit song &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; from their 1979 album &quot;The Long Run&quot;; their collaboration about Seger&#x27;s and Glenn Frey&#x27;s shared early lives in Detroit.

In 1980, Seger released &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (with ex-Grand Funk Railroad member Craig Frost replacing Robyn Robbins on keyboards) and it became his first and only album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The first single &quot;Fire Lake&quot; featured Eagles Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmit, and Glenn Frey on backing vocals and Muscle Shoals guitarist Pete Carr on 12-string acoustic. Fire Lake reached on the Hot 100, while the title song &quot;Against the Wind&quot; reached as a single and even crossed over to the Top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;You&#x27;ll Accompany Me&quot; became the third hit single from the record, reaching . &quot;Against the Wind&quot; would also win two Grammy Awards. As of 2006, both &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; and &quot;Against the Wind&quot; had sold over 5 million copies each in the United States.

The live 1981 album &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; encapsulated this three-album peak of Seger&#x27;s commercial career. Seger&#x27;s take on Eugene Williams&#x27; &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Live My Life Without You&quot; became a Top Five hit from &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; and the album would go on to sell 4 million copies.

Seger released the acclaimed &quot;The Distance&quot; in December 1982. During the recording of this album, Silver Bullet guitarist Drew Abbott left the band due to his frustration with Seger&#x27;s frequent use of session musicians in the studio and was replaced by Dawayne Bailey. After the album&#x27;s release, David Teegarden also left the band due to internal conflict and was replaced by ex-Grand Funk drummer Don Brewer. Critically praised for representing a more versatile sound than that of his recent material, &quot;The Distance&quot; spawned numerous hits beginning with Rodney Crowell&#x27;s &quot;Shame on the Moon&quot;. It was the biggest hit of the Silver Bullet Band&#x27;s entire career, hitting on the Adult Contemporary chart and holding at for four consecutive weeks – behind Patti Austin and James Ingram&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Come to Me&quot; and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot; – on the Hot 100. It also crossed over to on &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Singles chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Even Now&quot;, just missed the Top 10, and &quot;Roll Me Away&quot; peaked at . The driving album track &quot;Making Thunderbirds&quot; was a popular music video filmed in Detroit and well-received on MTV. Seger&#x27;s multi-platinum sales dropped off at this point, with &quot;The Distance&quot; peaking at and selling only 1.9 million copies in the United States. &quot;The Distance&quot; was belatedly released on 8-track tape; Capitol reportedly had no plans to do so, but Seger, claiming that many of his fans still used 8-track players in their vehicles, requested that the label also release the album in the waning format.

In 1984, Seger wrote and recorded the power rock ballad &quot;Understanding&quot; for the film soundtrack &quot;Teachers&quot;. The song was another Top 20 hit for Seger in late 1984. In 1986, he wrote and recorded &quot;Living Inside My Heart&quot; for the film soundtrack of &quot;About Last Night...&quot;.

Seger was no longer as prolific, and several years elapsed before his next studio album, &quot;Like a Rock,&quot; emerged in the spring of 1986. The fast-paced &quot;American Storm&quot; was another Top-20 single aided by a popular music video featuring actress Lesley Ann Warren, and &quot;Like a Rock&quot; followed, reaching on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. Later, it would become familiar to many Americans through its association with a long-running Chevrolet ad campaign (something Seger explicitly chose to do to support struggling American automobile workers in Detroit). Seger&#x27;s 1986–1987 American Storm Tour was his self-stated last major tour, playing 105 shows over nine months and selling almost 1.5 million tickets. &quot;Like a Rock&quot; reached and eventually sold over three million copies, although it has never been certified above platinum.

On March 13, 1987, Bob Seger &amp; the Silver Bullet Band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to the music industry, located at 1750 Vine Street.

In 1987, Seger recorded the song &quot;Shakedown&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;. A synth-driven pop-rock song, it was Seger&#x27;s first and only hit on the pop singles chart. The song had originally been intended for fellow Detroiter Glenn Frey, but when Frey lost his voice just before the recording session, he asked Seger to take his place. Seger changed the verses of the song but kept the chorus the same. The song earned Seger an Academy Award nomination as co-writer in the Best Original Song category the following year.

== Later years: 1988–present ==
Bob Seger&#x27;s next record was 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Fire Inside&quot;, at a time when glam metal, grunge and alternative rock were taking the forefront. His new music found little visibility on the radio or elsewhere. The same was true of 1995&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot;, although the album was certified gold (500,000 copies sold). However, in 1994, Seger released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;; the compilation album was his biggest-ever record in terms of sales, selling nearly 10 million copies in the United States . Seger did go back on the road again for a 1996 tour, which was successful and sold the fourth-largest number of tickets of any North American tour that year. (Seger was once known for his concerts in small venues, as witnessed with his appearance at the 18th Amendment in Omaha, Nebraska.)

Seger took a sabbatical from the music business for about ten years to spend time with his wife and two young children. In 2001 and 2002, Seger won the prestigious Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race aboard his sailboat &quot;Lightning&quot;. He subsequently sold the boat. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2004. Fellow Detroiter Kid Rock gave the induction speech and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm proclaimed that date Bob Seger Day in his honor. In 2005, Seger was featured singing with 3 Doors Down on the song &quot;Landing in London&quot; from their &quot;Seventeen Days&quot; album.

Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005.

Seger&#x27;s first new album in eleven years, titled &quot;Face the Promise&quot;, was released in 2006. In its first 45 days, it sold more than 400,000 copies. The album sold over 1.2 million copies, returning Seger to platinum status and staying on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for several months. His supporting tour was also eagerly anticipated, with many shows selling out within minutes. Showing that Seger&#x27;s legendary appeal in Michigan had not diminished, all 10,834 tickets available for his first show at Grand Rapids&#x27; Van Andel Arena sold out in under five minutes; three additional shows were subsequently added, each of which also sold out.

In 2009, Seger released a compilation album titled &quot;Early Seger Vol. 1&quot;, which contained archival material from the 1970s and 1980s, including some fully or partially re-recorded tracks from his albums &quot;Smokin&#x27; O.P.&#x27;s&quot; (1972) and &quot;Seven&quot; (1974) and some never-before-released songs. The album was initially only available for purchase at Meijer stores and then later for download at BobSeger.com. Seger contributed piano and vocals on Kid Rock&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Born Free&quot;. Seger staged a successful arena tour during 2011, accompanied by the release of a two-CD compilation album, &quot;Ultimate Hits: Rock and Roll Never Forgets&quot;.
On May 28, 2011, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder proclaimed that date as Bob Seger Day for his more than 50 years of sharing his celebrated musical talents with fans all over the world.

On December 30, 2011, before a sell-out crowd at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Seger closed another tour. On October 30, 2011, he told AnnArbor.com director, Bob Needham, he was returning to the studio to complete another new album for release in the fall of 2012, followed by another supporting tour.

On June 14, 2012, Seger was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. On January 10, 2013, Seger announced another tour in the US and Canada.

Seger performed a duet of &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; with John Fogerty on Fogerty&#x27;s album &quot;Wrote a Song for Everyone&quot;, released in 2013.

Seger&#x27;s 17th studio album, &quot;Ride Out&quot; was released on October 14, 2014. &quot;Ride Out&quot; was accompanied by a highly successful arena tour of the United States and Canada.

On December 22, 2016, Seger performed &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; as the Kennedy Center honored the Eagles. A few weeks later, on January 18, 2017, Seger gave away the single &quot;Glenn Song&quot; on his website as a tribute marking the first anniversary of the death of Eagles founding member Glenn Frey, with whom Seger was close friends. Starting on August 24, 2017, Seger embarked on a 32-city &quot;Runaway Train&quot; tour that was originally scheduled to conclude on November 17, 2017, in Chicago. This tour included a show on September 22, 2017, at The Palace of Auburn Hills (Michigan), which was the last event to be held at that venue. The same day, Seger announced his new studio album, &quot;I Knew You When&quot;, and released &quot;Busload of Faith&quot;, a cover of the Lou Reed song from the 1989 album &quot;New York&quot;, as the first single taken from the album. &quot;I Knew You When&quot; was released on November 17, 2017, which would have marked the last day of Seger&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Train&quot; tour. However, due to &quot;an urgent medical issue with his vertebrae&quot;, all concert dates starting September 30 had to be postponed. Of the 32 scheduled tour dates, Seger could complete 13 and had to postpone 19.

On September 18, 2018, Seger announced his final tour. Named the &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot; tour, it included postponed dates from the 2017 tour as well as additional shows, and was scheduled to kick off on November 21 at the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, MI. The tour ended on November 1, 2019, after which Seger retired. Silver Bullet Band saxophonist Alto Reed died one year later, on December 30, 2020, aged 72.

Seger came out of retirement on October 22, 2023, to perform at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville for the induction of Patty Loveless, playing her 1997 song &quot;She Drew a Broken Heart.&quot; Loveless sang a duet with Seger in &quot;The Answer&#x27;s The Question&quot; in Seger&#x27;s &quot;Face the Promise&quot; album in 2006.

=== Legacy ===
Lincoln Park declared November 17, 2017, &quot;Bob Seger Day&quot; in the city. Mayor Thomas Karnes called Seger the voice of the city for their generation. Seger attended school there in his youth and performed at the city&#x27;s bandshell in the 1960s. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Seger at number 181 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== Personal life ==
Seger&#x27;s first marriage to Renee Andrietti in 1968 lasted for &quot;one day short of a year&quot;. He had a long-term relationship with Jan Dinsdale from 1972 until 1983. In 1987, he married actress Annette Sinclair and they divorced one year later. He married Juanita Dorricott in 1993, in a small private setting at The Village Club, in Bloomfield Hills; they have two children.

===Views===
Politically, Seger has characterized himself as a centrist: &quot;[I&#x27;m] right down the middle&quot;, he remarked. He supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. He tackled antiestablishment themes in early songs such as &quot;2 + 2 = ?&quot; (1968) and &quot;U.M.C. (Upper Middle Class)&quot; (1974), according to Brian McCollum of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. On his 2014 album &quot;Ride Out&quot;, he addressed topics such as gun violence and wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Your World&quot; about climate change. On the subject, he said, &quot;There are a lot of culprits in climate change, and everybody&#x27;s responsible, myself included. Nobody gets a free pass on this one. We&#x27;ve got to change our ways and change them fast.&quot;

He has considered President Barack Obama to be the favorite president of his lifetime; he met him at the 2016 Kennedy Center Honors and thanked Obama for his &quot;wisdom and dignity.&quot;

<doc id="276088" wikidata="Q639239" url="?curid=276088" title="Brat Pack">
<text>Brat Pack is a nickname given to a group of young actors who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented coming-of-age films in the 1980s. The term &quot;Brat Pack&quot;, a play on &quot;Rat Pack&quot; from the 1950s and 1960s, was first popularized in a 1985 &quot;New York&quot; magazine cover story, which described a group of highly successful film stars in their early twenties. David Blum wrote the article after witnessing several young actors being mobbed by groupies at Los Angeles&#x27; Hard Rock Cafe. The group has been characterized by the partying of members such as Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson.

==Genesis of the name==
David Blum&#x27;s &quot;New York&quot; story, titled &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Brat Pack&quot;, ran on June 10, 1985. It was originally supposed to be just about Emilio Estevez, but one night, Estevez invited Blum to hang out with him, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, and others at the Hard Rock Cafe. It was a typical night out for the group, who had gotten close while filming &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. That night, Blum decided to change the article&#x27;s focus to an entire group of young actors at the time. The &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; crew members did not like Blum and sensed that he was jealous of the actors&#x27; success.

Blum thought of the term the day after meeting the group, while thinking about a friend of his who was following Grace Jones to different restaurants and referred to his experience as following the &quot;fat pack&quot;. At this instant, Blum felt like he was following the &quot;Brat Pack&quot;: &quot;I wouldn’t call it an inspiration exactly. I did think it was pretty clever [...] these guys definitely fit the bill.&quot;

When the piece ran, the actors all felt betrayed, especially Estevez. The article mentioned people in several films but focused on Estevez, Lowe, and Nelson, and portrayed those three negatively. The &quot;Brat Pack&quot; label, which the actors disliked, stuck for years afterward. Before the article ran, they had been regarded as talented individuals; after the article, all of them were grouped together and regarded as unprofessional.

Some actors went on the Phil Donahue show and called Blum an &quot;unethical jerk&quot;. During the show, Richard Schickel said &quot;I really thought that was a scurrilous article... I really think this is a kind of scuzz journalism... I’ve been around journalism a long time. I look at a piece like that, and I say, this is really slob work, and he was out to get you.&quot; After the show, in the Chicago Sun-Times, Rob Lowe reminded that &quot;He’s not Hunter Thompson or Tom Wolfe, he’s David Blum living in a cheap flat&quot;, and Sean Penn added &quot;Sometimes writers, like actors, like anybody, do their work to impress three or four of their cool friends in SoHo&quot;.

With the increased negative attention to them, the actors soon stopped socializing with one another. On the group&#x27;s camaraderie, Ally Sheedy later said the article &quot;just destroyed it. I had felt truly a part of something, and that guy just blew it to pieces.&quot;

In 1987, Blum wrote an unapologetic article on the matter, stating &quot;I do have one thing they don&#x27;t. A job at a magazine. And that entitles me to the freedom of the press&quot;, and mentioning that he could not copyright the term &quot;Brat Pack&quot; even though he had also written an initial plot for a Brat Pack movie. According to Susannah Gora, Blum later admitted that he should not have written the article.

==Alleged members==
An appearance in one or both of the ensemble casts of two specific films released in 1985—John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;—is often considered the prerequisite for being a core Brat Pack member. With this criterion, the most commonly cited members include: 

* Emilio Estevez: Identified by Blum&#x27;s original article as the &quot;unofficial president&quot; of the Brat Pack. 
* Rob Lowe
* Andrew McCarthy
* Demi Moore
* Judd Nelson
* Molly Ringwald
* Ally Sheedy
* Anthony Michael Hall
After &quot;Brat Pack&quot; quickly became a common term to identify this young bunch of actors, other actors with similar films and traits were commonly associated with the made-up group:

*James Spader
*Robert Downey Jr.
*Jon Cryer
*John Cusack
*Joan Cusack

The initial &quot;New York&quot; article covered a group of actors larger, or more inclusive, than the currently understood meaning of the term &quot;Brat Pack&quot;. While listed in the article as &quot;official&quot; members, they are loosely associated with the group&#x27;s core members.

*Matthew Broderick
*Tom Cruise
*Timothy Hutton
*Matt Dillon
*Nicolas Cage
*Sean Penn
*Matthew Modine
*Charlie Sheen

==Legacy==
During the late 1980s, several of the Brat Pack actors had their careers mildly derailed by problems relating to drugs, alcohol, and in Lowe&#x27;s case, a sex tape. According to Susannah Gora, &quot;Many believe they could have gone on to more serious roles if not for that article. They were talented. But they had professional difficulties, personal difficulties after that.&quot; By the 21st century, the term &quot;Brat Pack&quot; had lost its negative connotation.

The films themselves have been described as representative of &quot;the socially apathetic, cynical, money-possessed and ideologically barren eighties generation.&quot; They made frequent use of adolescent archetypes, were often set in the suburbs surrounding Chicago, and focused on middle-class teenage angst. According to author Susannah Gora, these films &quot;changed the way many young people looked at everything from class distinction to friendship, from love to sex and fashion to music.&quot; They are considered &quot;among the most influential pop cultural contributions of their time.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; as the best high school movie ever made. On VH1&#x27;s 2006 list of the 100 greatest teen stars, Molly Ringwald was ranked No. 1, Rob Lowe was ranked No. 2, Anthony Michael Hall was ranked No. 4, Ally Sheedy was ranked No. 34, and Andrew McCarthy was ranked No. 40.

In 2020, Estevez expressed frustration at the persistence of the &quot;Brat Pack&quot; name, saying &quot;That [term] will be on my tombstone ... It&#x27;s annoying because Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon have worked together more than any of us have. We just made two movies and somehow it morphed into something else.&quot;

In June 2024, the documentary film &quot;Brats&quot; was released reflecting on the careers and lasting impact of the Brat Pack. Released by Hulu, the film was directed by and stars McCarthy, and features interviews with Estevez, Lowe, Moore, and Sheedy, as well as original article author David Blum and various frequent collaborators.

==Filmography==
Beyond the two primary films, there is no generally accepted list of &quot;Brat Pack&quot; movies. While Blum&#x27;s article credits &quot;Taps&quot; as the first Brat Pack movie, the list of movies below represents the more traditional filmography, with each movie including at least two core members in starring roles:

Other 1980s films, many with similar coming-of-age themes, that starred only one core Brat Pack actor with one or more close contributors include:
* &quot;Tex&quot; (1982) with Emilio Estevez and Matt Dillon
* &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983) with Ally Sheedy and Matthew Broderick
* &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1983) with Ally Sheedy and Sean Penn
* &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984) with Emilio Estevez and Olivia Barash
* &quot;No Small Affair&quot; (1984) with Demi Moore and Jon Cryer
* &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; (1985) with Andrew McCarthy and Mary Stuart Masterson
* &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985) with Anthony Michael Hall and Robert Downey Jr.
* &quot;One Crazy Summer&quot; (1986) with Demi Moore and John Cusack
* &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; (1986) with Anthony Michael Hall and Jenny Wright
* &quot;Youngblood&quot; (1986) with Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze
* &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot; (1987) with Molly Ringwald and Robert Downey Jr.
* &quot;Less than Zero&quot; (1987) with Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, Robert Downey Jr., and James Spader
* &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1987) with Andrew McCarthy and James Spader
* &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot; (1988) with Anthony Michael Hall and Robert Downey Jr.
* &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988) with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, and Kiefer Sutherland
* &quot;Kansas&quot; (1988) with Andrew McCarthy and Matt Dillon
* &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1989) with Demi Moore and Sean Penn
* &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990) with Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland
* &quot;Bad Influence&quot; (1990) with Rob Lowe and James Spader

Some films have been dubbed &quot;Brat Pack movies&quot; despite having no stars from the core membership, including 1984&#x27;s &quot;Red Dawn&quot; with C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Harry Dean Stanton, Patrick Swayze, and Lea Thompson, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; which starred Matthew Broderick with Grey and Sheen in supporting roles and 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; with Kiefer Sutherland and Jami Gertz in key roles.

== Later acting careers ==
Many of the Brat Pack members have continued to act past the 1980s.

<doc id="276092" wikidata="Q3942018" url="?curid=276092" title="Chanterelle">
<text>Chanterelle is the common name of several species of fungi in the genera &quot;Cantharellus&quot;, &quot;Craterellus&quot;, &quot;Gomphus&quot;, and &quot;Polyozellus&quot;. They are orange, yellow or white, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, most species have rounded, forked folds that run almost all the way down the stipe, which tapers down from the cap. Many species emit a fruity aroma and often have a mildly peppery taste.

Chanterelles are found in Eurasia, North America, and Africa, typically growing in forested areas. They initially gained popularity as an edible mushroom in the 18th century via their inclusion in French cuisine.

==Taxonomy==
At one time, all yellow or golden chanterelles in western North America had been classified as &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;. Using DNA analysis, they have since been shown to be a group of related species. In 1997, the Pacific golden chanterelle (&quot;C. formosus&quot;) and &quot;C. cibarius&quot; var. &quot;roseocanus&quot; were identified, followed by &quot;C. cascadensis&quot; in 2003, &quot;C. californicus&quot; in 2008, and &quot;C. enelensis&quot; in 2017. &quot;C. cibarius&quot; var. &quot;roseocanus&quot; occurs in the Pacific Northwest in Sitka spruce forests, as well as Eastern Canada in association with &quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
The name chanterelle originates from the Greek &quot;kantharos&quot; meaning &quot;tankard&quot; or &quot;cup&quot;, a reference to their general shape. Its German name, &quot;&quot;, refers to its peppery taste.
== Description ==
The mushrooms are orange, yellow or white, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, most species have rounded, forked folds that run almost all the way down the stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from the cap. Many species emit a fruity aroma, reminiscent of apricots, and often have a mildly peppery taste.

=== Similar species ===
The false chanterelle (&quot;Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca&quot;) has a similar appearance and can be confused with the chanterelle. Distinguishing factors are that false chanterelles have true gills, while chanterelles have folds. Additionally, color can help distinguish the two; the true chanterelle is uniform egg-yellow, while the false chanterelle is more orange in hue and graded, with darker center. The true chanterelle&#x27;s folds are typically more wrinkled or rounded, and randomly forked. Though once thought to be hazardous, it is now known that the false chanterelle is edible but not especially tasty, and ingesting it may result in mild gastrointestinal distress. The poisonous species in the genus &quot;Omphalotus&quot; (the jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushrooms) have been misidentified as chanterelles, but can usually be distinguished by their well-developed, unforked true gills. Species of &quot;Omphalotus&quot; are not closely related to chanterelles. Other species in the closely related genera &quot;Cantharellus&quot; and &quot;Craterellus&quot; may appear similar to the golden chanterelle.

&quot;Cantharellus pallens&quot; has sometimes been defined as a species in its own right, but it is normally considered to be just a variety (&quot;C. cibarius var. pallens&quot;). Unlike &quot;true&quot; &quot;C. cibarius&quot; it yellows and then reddens when touched and has a weaker smell. Eyssartier and Roux classify it as a separate species but say that 90% of the chanterelles sold in French markets are this, not &quot;C. cibarius&quot;.

Similarly, the very pale &quot;C. alborufescens&quot;, which reddens easily and is found in Mediterranean areas, and northern of Iran is sometimes distinguished as a separate variety or a separate species.

==Species==
An incomplete listing of species that have been called chanterelles includes:
* &quot;Cantharellus cascadensis&quot; 
* &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;, which has been split into several species
* &quot;Cantharellus cinnabarinus&quot;
* &quot;Cantharellus enelensis&quot;
* &quot;Cantharellus formosus&quot;
* &quot;Cantharellus lateritius&quot;
* &quot;Cantharellus minor&quot;
* &quot;Cantharellus roseocanus&quot;
* &quot;Cantharellus subalbidus&quot;
* &quot;Craterellus cinereus&quot;
* &quot;Craterellus cornucopioides&quot;
* &quot;Craterellus ignicolor&quot;
* &quot;Craterellus tubaeformis&quot;
* &quot;Craterellus odoratus&quot;
* &quot;Gomphus clavatus&quot;
* &quot;Polyozellus multiplex&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==

Chanterelles are common in Eurasia, North America (including Central America) and Africa. In the American Pacific Northwest, they can be found from July to November. They tend to grow in clusters in mossy coniferous forests, but are also often found in mountainous birch forests and among grasses and low-growing herbs. In central Europe, the golden chanterelle is often found in beech forests among similar species and forms. In the UK, they may be found from July through December.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw chanterelle mushrooms are 90% water, 7% carbohydrates, including 4% dietary fiber, 1.5% protein, and have negligible fat. A 100 gram reference amount of raw chanterelles supplies 38 kilocalories of food energy and the B vitamins, niacin and pantothenic acid, in rich content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV), 27% DV of iron, with moderate contents (10-1 of riboflavin, manganese, and potassium (table).

When exposed to sunlight, raw chanterelles produce a rich amount of vitamin D2 (35% DV) – also known as ergocalciferol.

=== Culinary ===
Though records of chanterelles being eaten date back to the 16th century, they first gained widespread recognition as a culinary delicacy with the spreading influence of French cuisine in the 18th century, when they began appearing in palace kitchens. For many years, they remained notable for being served at the tables of nobility. Nowadays, the usage of chanterelles in the kitchen is common throughout Europe and North America. In 1836, the Swedish mycologist Elias Fries considered the chanterelle &quot;as one of the most important and best edible mushrooms.&quot;

Chanterelles as a group are generally described as being rich in flavor, with a distinctive taste and aroma difficult to characterize. Some species have a fruity odor, others a more woody, earthy fragrance, and still others can even be considered spicy. The golden chanterelle is perhaps the most sought-after and flavorful chanterelle, and many chefs consider it on the same short list of gourmet fungi as truffles and morels. It therefore tends to command a high price in both restaurants and specialty stores.

There are many ways to cook chanterelles. Most of the flavorful compounds in chanterelles are fat-soluble, making them good mushrooms to sauté in butter, oil or cream. They also contain smaller amounts of water- and alcohol-soluble flavorings, which lend the mushrooms well to recipes involving wine or other cooking alcohols. Many popular methods of cooking chanterelles include them in sautés, soufflés, cream sauces, and soups. They are not typically eaten raw, as their rich and complex flavor is best released when cooked.

Chanterelles are also well-suited for drying, and tend to maintain their aroma and consistency quite well. Some chefs profess that reconstituted chanterelles are actually superior in flavor to fresh ones, though they lose in texture whatever they gain in flavor by becoming more chewy after being preserved by drying. Dried chanterelles can also be crushed into flour and used in seasoning in soups or sauces. Chanterelles are also suitable for freezing, though older frozen chanterelles can often develop a slightly bitter taste after thawing.

One mushroom guide asserts, &quot;Chanterelles are often dirty, and when washed they soak up water like a sponge...[try] dry-sauteeing...it concentrates their flavor while allowing you to wash them.&quot;

==In culture==
In January 2024, the California golden chanterelle became the official mushroom of that state.
