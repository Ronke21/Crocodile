<text>On December 22, 1984, Bernhard Goetz () shot four youths on a New York City Subway train in Manhattan after they allegedly tried to rob him. All four victims survived, though one, Darrell Cabey, was paralyzed and suffered brain damage as a result of his injuries. Goetz fled to Bennington, Vermont, before surrendering to police nine days after the shooting. He was charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and several firearms offenses. A jury subsequently found Goetz guilty of one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm and acquitted him of the remaining charges. For the firearm offense, he served eight months of a one-year sentence. In 1996, Cabey obtained a $43 million civil judgment against Goetz after a civil jury ruled Goetz as liable, equivalent to $ million today.

The incident sparked a nationwide debate on crime in major U.S. cities, the legal limits of self-defense, and the extent to which the citizenry could rely on the police to secure their safety. Questions of what impact race—and racism—had on Goetz, the public reaction, and the criminal verdict were hotly contested. Goetz was dubbed the &quot;Subway Vigilante&quot; by the New York press; to his supporters, he came to symbolize frustrations with the high crime rates of the 1980s. The incident has been cited as leading to successful National Rifle Association campaigns to loosen restrictions for concealed carrying of firearms.
==Incident==
In the early afternoon of December 22, 1984, four youths from the Bronx—19-year-olds Barry Allen, Troy Canty, and Darrell Cabey, and 18-year-old James Ramseur—boarded a downtown 2 train (a Broadway–Seventh Avenue express). Canty would later testify that the victims were en route to steal from video arcade machines in Manhattan. 37-year-old Bernhard Goetz boarded the train at the 14th Street station in Manhattan. At the time, about fifteen to twenty other passengers were in a R22 subway car, the seventh car of the ten-car train. Those involved and witnesses disagree what happened next. 

Troy Canty asked Goetz how he was, and shortly thereafter stood up, approached Goetz, and made some overture for money: According to Canty he alone approached Goetz, and said, &quot;Can I have $5?&quot; According to Goetz, Canty was joined by another of the teens and Canty said, &quot;Give me five dollars&quot; in a &quot;normal tone&quot; of voice with a smile on his face. In 1986, the NY Court of Appeals concluded from grand jury evidence that Goetz pulled a handgun and fired four shots at the four youths, initially striking three of them. After initially opening fire, Goetz then bent down to Cabey, who was cowering on the ground, and said, &quot;You don&#x27;t look so bad. Here&#x27;s another,&quot; and shot once again, missing. Cabey&#x27;s spine was severed, resulting in brain damage and partial paralysis.

Shortly after the shooting, the train conductor entered the car and loudly exclaimed, &quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot; He approached Goetz and asked what happened. Goetz pointed to the north end of the car and then told him, &quot;I don&#x27;t know ... they tried to rob me and I shot them.&quot; The conductor then went to the passengers to check if they were injured before returning to Goetz and asked if he was a police officer, which Goetz denied, and he then asked Goetz for the gun, which Goetz refused to turn over.

==Shooter==
Bernhard Hugo Goetz was born November 7, 1947, in the Kew Gardens, Queens neighborhood to German immigrants. His father was Lutheran and his mother was Jewish before converting to Lutheranism. While growing up, Goetz lived with his parents and three older siblings in Upstate New York, where his father ran a dairy farm and a bookbinding business. Goetz attended boarding school in Switzerland before returning to the United States to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering and nuclear engineering from New York University. Goetz then moved to Orlando, Florida, where his family had relocated, and worked at his father&#x27;s residential development business. After a divorce, Goetz moved back to New York City, where he started an electronics business out of his Greenwich Village apartment.

According to Goetz, in early 1981, he was the victim of a robbery at the Canal Street subway station. Goetz reported that three Black teenagers had smashed him into a plate-glass door and thrown him to the ground, injuring his chest and knee. Goetz was involved in a struggle with one of the teenagers until police arrived; that individual accused Goetz of assaulting him. To his frustration, Goetz was detained for six hours, while the person he accused was released in two and a half hours. Goetz subsequently applied for a permit to carry a concealed handgun, on the basis of routinely carrying valuable equipment and large sums of cash, but his application was denied on the grounds of &quot;insufficient need&quot;. He bought the 5-shot .38-caliber revolver he would ultimately use in the shooting during a trip to Florida.

Goetz was known to use racist language: his neighbor Myra Friedman reported overhearing Goetz having said, &quot;The only way we&#x27;re going to clean up this street is to get rid of the spics and niggers&quot; at a community meeting eighteen months before the shooting. Friedman&#x27;s account was excluded from the criminal jury trial, but in a subsequent civil action, Goetz admitted to having used both epithets at a neighborhood meeting.
==Goetz&#x27;s flight, surrender, and interrogation==

After the shooting, Goetz took a cab back to his 14th Street home before renting a car and driving north to Bennington, Vermont; he then burned the distinctive blue jacket he had been wearing and scattered the pieces of his gun in the woods. Goetz stayed at various hotels in New England for several days.

On December 26, an anonymous hotline caller told New York City police that Goetz matched the gunman&#x27;s description, owned a gun, and had been assaulted previously. On December 29, Goetz called his neighbor, Myra Friedman, who told him that police had come by his apartment looking for him and had left notes asking to be contacted as soon as possible. Goetz told Friedman he had felt as though he was in a &quot;combat situation&quot;, needing to &quot;think more quickly than [his] opposition.&quot;

Goetz returned to New York City on December 30, turned in the car, picked up some clothing and business papers at his apartment, rented another car, and drove back to New England. Shortly after noon the next day, he walked into the Concord, New Hampshire police headquarters and told the officer on duty, &quot;I am the person they are seeking in New York.&quot; Once the officer realized that Goetz was a genuine suspect, Goetz was &quot;Mirandized&quot; and elected to talk to the police. The Concord police made an audio recording of Goetz&#x27;s interview. New York police detectives Susan Braver, Michael Clark, and Dan Hattendorf subsequently interviewed Goetz, and a two-hour video recording of that interview was made. Both interviews were played at the criminal trial.

Goetz told police that he felt that he was being robbed and was at risk of violence, and he explained he had been both mugged once before and nearly mugged several times: &quot;I&#x27;ve been in situations where I&#x27;ve shown the gun. ... The threat, when I was surrounded, and at that point, showing the gun would have been enough, but when I saw this one fellow [Canty], when I saw the gleam in his eye ... and the smile on his face ... and they say it&#x27;s a joke and lot of them say it&#x27;s a joke.&quot; Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, &quot;My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible.&quot; Goetz also said that, after firing four shots, he moved to Cabey and said, &quot;You seem to be doing all right, here&#x27;s another,&quot; before shooting him again.

Later in the tape, Goetz said, &quot;If I had more bullets, I would have shot them all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets.&quot; He added, &quot;I was gonna&#x27;, I was gonna&#x27; gouge one of the guys&#x27; [Canty&#x27;s] eyes out with my keys afterwards&quot;, but said he stopped when he saw the fear in his eyes. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press.

==Legal aftermath==
===Criminal case===
Goetz was brought back to Manhattan on January 3, 1985, and arraigned on four charges of attempted murder, with bail set at $50,000. He was held in protective custody at the Rikers Island prison hospital. Refusing offers of bail assistance from the public and from his family, he posted bail with his own funds and was released on bond January 8.

==== Indictments ====

Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau asked a grand jury to indict Goetz on four counts of attempted murder, four of assault, four of reckless endangerment, and one of criminal possession of a weapon. On January 25, the grand jury refused to indict Goetz on the more serious charges, voting indictments only for unlawful gun possession—one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, for carrying in public the loaded unlicensed gun used in the subway shooting, and two counts of possession in the fourth degree, for keeping two other unlicensed handguns in his home.

In March 1985, Morgenthau announced that the state had obtained new evidence—an unnamed witness—and sought leave to convene a second grand jury; Judge Stephen Crane granted Morgenthau&#x27;s motion. Morgenthau granted immunity to Troy Canty and James Ramseur, which he had previously declined to do, allowing them to testify before the second grand jury. The second grand jury indicted Goetz on charges of attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and weapons possession. In January 1986, Judge Crane granted a motion by Goetz to dismiss these new indictments. Judge Crane dismissed the charges on two grounds: First, he held that the prosecutor had erred when instructing the grand jury that, for Goetz&#x27;s actions to be protected by New York&#x27;s self-defense statute, they would have to be objectively reasonable. Second, he found that Canty and Ramseur &quot;strongly appeared&quot; to have perjured themselves.

The prosecution appealed the case, maintaining that a self-defense justification required objective reasonableness and that the statements Judge Crane relied on did not indicate perjury or require dismissal. In July 1986, after an appellate division upheld Judge Crane&#x27;s dismissal, the New York Court of Appeals reversed the appellate division and reinstated the charges. The high court clarified that a defendant&#x27;s subjective perception of imminent danger does not, by itself, justify the use of force; instead, it held, that belief must be both subjectively held &quot;and&quot; objectively reasonable. Additionally, the court held that Judge Crane&#x27;s perjury finding was &quot;speculat[ive]&quot; and &quot;particularly inappropriate&quot;: &quot;[A]ll that has come to light is hearsay evidence that conflicts with part of Canty&#x27;s testimony. There is no statute or controlling case law requiring dismissal of an indictment merely because, months later, the prosecutor becomes aware of some information which may lead to the defendant&#x27;s acquittal.&quot;

==== Trial ====
In December 1986, jury selection began and in April 1987, the trial commenced before a Manhattan jury of ten Whites and two Blacks, six of whom had been victims of street crime. Goetz was represented by Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker. Goetz conceded that he had shot the four youths, but he asserted that his actions were justified by section 35.15(2) of New York&#x27;s justification statute, which, with non-relevant exceptions, permitted the use of deadly force when actor &quot;reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force ... or ... is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery&quot;.

Both prosecution and defense agreed that the jury would be required to consider several factual questions, including (1) whether the teenagers had acted as a group or as individuals, (2) whether Goetz had shot Cabey after the immediate threat was over, and (3) whether Goetz was threatened.

As to whether Goetz had been threatened, Canty testified that he was merely panhandling when he asked Goetz for $5. Ramseur testified that Canty approached Goetz alone and that he, Allen, and Cabey remained seated, but Ramseur&#x27;s testimony was stricken after he professed his belief that Goetz would be acquitted regardless of the evidence and eventually refused to answer Slotnick&#x27;s questions. Neither Goetz nor Cabey testified, and Allen took the Fifth Amendment. Amanda Gilbert, a witness, testified that Cabey, after being shot, told her, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything. He shot me for nothing,&quot; but her testimony was stricken as hearsay. The defense called police officer Peter Smith, who testified that, after he arrived on the scene, Canty had told him that the group was planning to rob Goetz. On cross examination, the prosecution pointed out that Smith had failed to report the statement to his superiors or to a reporter when giving a television interview.

Another point of contention at trial was whether Goetz had shot at least some of the men in the back. For the defense, Dominick DiMaio, Suffolk County&#x27;s former medical examiner, testified that Allen, Canty, Cabey, and Ramseur had been standing in a semi-circle around Goetz when he opened fire. But the county&#x27;s then-current medical examiner, Charles Hirsch, offered rebuttal testimony that it was medically impossible to determine how the victims were positioned when shot, and he also found that the bullets that hit Allen and Cabey had traveled from back to front, suggesting that both had been shot in the back. Ballistics expert Joseph Quirk, for the defense, testified that Allen had been shot while ducking rather than while running away. On cross examination, Quirk conceded that the prosecution&#x27;s theory was also consistent with the evidence, and, after being shown a photograph of a bullet-entry wound in Allen&#x27;s back, Quirk admitted that he had based his theory as to Allen on incorrect information provided to him by the defense.

Specifically related to Goetz&#x27;s shooting of Cabey, the parties contested whether Cabey had been struck by the fourth or fifth shot and whether, if the fifth, Goetz had paused before firing. According to the prosecution, Goetz shot the seated Cabey at point-blank range with his fifth bullet; the defense argued that Goetz had fired all five shots in short order and Cabey had been hit by the fourth shot before collapsing. One witness testified that, consistent with Goetz&#x27;s since-recanted police statement, Goetz opened fire before approaching to within &quot;two to three feet&quot; of a seated Cabey; the witness demonstrated how Goetz stood directly in front of Cabey and fired downward shooting Cabey in the stomach. But the eight other witnesses who testified on the matter reported that all shots came in &quot;rapid succession&quot;—one said the firing lasted &quot;about a second&quot;, and none of those eight testified that they had observed Goetz standing in front of Cabey.

==== Verdict and post-verdict appeal ====

Goetz was acquitted of the attempted-murder and first-degree-assault charges and convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree for carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon in a public place. Goetz was originally sentenced to 6 months in jail, 1 year&#x27;s psychiatric treatment, five years&#x27; probation, 200 hours community service, and a $5,000 fine. But Goetz appealed the conviction and sentence. As to the conviction, Goetz argued that the judge&#x27;s jury instructions improperly discouraged jury nullification; the appellate division and New York Court of Appeals rejected that argument. As to the sentence, Goetz argued that the state&#x27;s gun laws required, at minimum, a one-year sentence. (Under New York&#x27;s then-existing law, a defendant sentenced to 6 months would have been required to serve, at minimum, 90 days, while a defendant sentenced to 1 year would be eligible for release after 60 days.) On this point, the appellate court agreed, overturning the sentence. On remand, Judge Crane sentenced Goetz to 1-year incarceration and a $5,000 fine. Goetz ultimately served 8 months, receiving credit for good behavior.

=== Civil litigation ===

==== &quot;Cabey v. Goetz&quot; ====
A month after the shootings, Cabey, represented by William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, filed a civil suit against Goetz. The civil case was tried in 1996. Unlike Goetz&#x27;s criminal jury, which was predominantly White and from Manhattan, the civil jury was half African American and entirely from the Bronx. Additionally, crime in New York City had fallen substantially since the criminal trial.

While race had only been subliminally addressed in the criminal trial, Cabey&#x27;s civil-trial attorneys explicitly argued that Goetz had been motivated by race. Goetz admitted to previous use of racial language and to smoking PCP-laced marijuana during the 1980s. For the defense, Jimmy Breslin testified that, in a 1985 hospital-bed interview, Cabey, while denying his own involvement, said that Allen, Canty, and Ramseur intended to rob Goetz because he looked like &quot;easy bait,&quot; but Cabey&#x27;s attorneys pointed out that Cabey had suffered brain damage prior to the interview and that Breslin&#x27;s column described Cabey as &quot;confused.&quot;

The jury found that Goetz had acted recklessly and had deliberately inflicted emotional distress on Cabey. Jurors awarded Cabey $43 million–$18 million for pain and suffering and $25 million in punitive damages. Goetz subsequently filed for bankruptcy, saying that legal expenses had left him almost penniless. A United States bankruptcy court judge ruled that the $43 million judgment was .

Because Goetz was only &quot;sporadically employed as an electrical engineering consultant,&quot; the expectation was that 10% of Goetz&#x27;s income for the next 20 years would be garnished. Stephen Somerstein, one of Cabey&#x27;s attorneys, expressed some optimism that a portion of any book deal Goetz signed could contribute to the judgment. In 2000, Kuby told reporters that he had hired a firm specializing in debt collection to pursue Goetz, but he noted that Goetz &quot;appear[ed] to be living in voluntary squalor.&quot; Asked in 2004 whether he was making payments on the judgment, Goetz responded &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve paid a penny on that&quot;, and referred any questions on the subject to his attorney.

==== Goetz&#x27;s defamation claims ====
In 1990, Goetz filed a defamation action against Cabey; his mother, Sherry; and his attorneys, Kunstler and Kuby. The suit was dismissed.

In 1994, Goetz filed another defamation action related to &quot;My Life as a Radical Lawyer&quot;, a book by Kunstler, published by Carol Communications, Inc. Amongst other claims, Goetz objected to the book&#x27;s description of him as a &quot;paranoid&quot; &quot;murderous vigilante&quot; who had &quot;developed a hatred for blacks.&quot; Goetz specifically objected that the book&#x27;s description of him as a racist hurt his &quot;good name, reputation, feelings, and public standing.&quot; The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that the statements complained of were, varyingly, protected opinion (rather than actionable fact statements), not defamatory, or substantially true.

== Public reaction ==
The shootings initially drew considerable support from the public. A Daily News-WABC-TV poll released in January 1985 showed 49 percent of the 515 New Yorkers questioned approved of Goetz&#x27;s actions, while only 31 percent disapproved. A special hotline set up by police to seek information was swamped by calls supporting the shooter and calling him a hero. In March, Morgenthau reported that the letters his office received were running 3 to 1 in Goetz&#x27;s favor. The same month, a Gallup poll interviewing 1,009 adults found that 57% of respondents approved of Goetz&#x27;s shootings and two-thirds said that Goetz had acted in self defense. But, compared to the January poll, Goetz&#x27;s support among African Americans had dipped considerably: while only 36% of Black respondents disapproved of his actions in the January poll, 53% reported disapproval in the March poll. Questions of what impact race had on Goetz&#x27;s thinking, the public&#x27;s reaction, and the verdict by the (predominately White) criminal jury became hotly debated. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that, during the criminal trial, demonstrators outside the courtroom chanted &quot;Bernhard Goetz, you can&#x27;t hide; we charge you with genocide.&quot;

Initial sources differed in reporting the sequence of shots fired, timing of shots, whether Cabey was shot once or twice, and whether any of the men Goetz shot were armed. Some reports, picking up on Goetz&#x27;s statement to the police, suggested that Cabey had been shot twice, but later reporting revealed that he had been shot only once, in the left side. Additionally, early reports suggested that the teenagers had approached Goetz carrying &quot;sharpened&quot; screwdrivers; those reports, too, were found to be false: The screwdrivers—Cabey carried two and Ramseur carried one—were not sharpened and, based on the available testimony, were not removed from Cabey&#x27;s or Ramseur&#x27;s pockets—no witnesses reported seeing screwdrivers, and Goetz repeatedly denied he was threatened with them. When Canty testified at Goetz&#x27;s criminal trial, he said they were to be used to break into video arcade change boxes and not as weapons.

Supporters viewed Goetz as a hero for standing up to his attackers and defending himself in an environment where the police were increasingly viewed as ineffective in combating crime. The Guardian Angels, a volunteer patrol group of mostly Black and Hispanic teenagers, collected thousands of dollars from subway riders toward a legal defense fund for Goetz. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a right-leaning civil rights organization, supported Goetz. CORE&#x27;s director, Roy Innis (who had lost two of his sons to inner-city gun violence and would later be elected to the executive board of the NRA), offered to raise defense money, saying that Goetz was &quot;the avenger for all of us&quot;. A legal group founded by the NRA—the Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund—donated $20,000 to Goetz&#x27;s defense. Harvard Professor of Government James Q. Wilson explained the broad sentiment by saying, &quot;It may simply indicate that there are no more liberals on the crime and law-and-order issue in New York City, because they&#x27;ve all been mugged.&quot; Professor Stephen L. Carter bemoaned the public&#x27;s initial reaction to the shooting, arguing, &quot;The tragedy of the Goetz case is that a public barely aware of the facts was rooting for him to get away with it. The tragedy is that a public eager to identify transgressors in advance decided from the start that Mr. Goetz was a hero and that his black victims deserved what they got.&quot;

While race was never explicitly mentioned at the criminal trial, Professor George P. Fletcher argued that Goetz&#x27;s criminal-defense team—which referred to the men Goetz shot as &quot;savages,&quot; &quot;predators,&quot; and &quot;vultures&quot;—made a &quot;covert appeal to racial bias,&quot; which, he argued &quot;came out most dramatically in [a re-enactment] of the shooting.&quot; In the courtroom re-enactment, four &quot;fit and muscular&quot; Black members of the Guardian Angels were asked to portray the four teenagers Goetz shot and surround Goetz. Professor Bennett Capers agreed that the use of the four &quot;large black men&quot; to stand in for the &quot;four black youths&quot; was, effectively, a &quot;backdoor race-ing.&quot; As to the criminal verdict, Benjamin Hooks, director of the NAACP, called the outcome &quot;inexcusable,&quot; adding, &quot;It was proven—according to his own statements—that Goetz did the shooting and went far beyond the realm of self-defense. There was no provocation for what he did.&quot; Representative Floyd Flake agreed, saying, &quot;I think that if a black had shot four Whites, the cry for the death penalty would have been almost automatic.&quot;

United States Attorney Rudolph Giuliani met with black political and religious leaders calling for a Federal civil-rights investigation. C. Vernon Mason, an attorney and spokesperson for the group, said, &quot;We have come to the Federal Government as [B]lack people traditionally have done to seek redress when it is clear that state and local authorities have either failed to act or are incapable of acting.&quot; After an investigation, Giuliani ultimately determined that Goetz had acted out of fear, which he distinguished from a &quot;racial motivation.&quot; In a 2007 interview with Stone Phillips of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, Goetz admitted that his fear may have been enhanced due to the fact that the four men he shot were black.

==Subsequent developments==
After reaching an all-time peak in 1990, crime in New York City dropped dramatically through the rest of the 1990s. New York City crime rates by 2014 were comparable to those of the early 1960s.

Darrell Cabey fell into a coma after the shooting; he suffered irreversible brain damage and was paralyzed from the waist down. In 1985, the Bronx District Attorney determined that Cabey had the mental capacity of an eight-year-old. Goetz accused Cabey of exaggerating his injuries. Goetz questioned Cabey as to his injuries in two depositions and was unable to elicit an answer longer than a single sentence; when asked, Cabey denied having previously heard the name &quot;Bernie Goetz&quot;.

Troy Canty entered drug-rehabilitation and vocational-training programs. One of Canty&#x27;s attorneys, Scott H. Greenfield reported that Canty planned to attend culinary school.

In March 1985, James Ramseur reported to police that two men apparently hired by Goetz kidnapped and attempted to murder him. The following day, after detectives played back to Ramseur the emergency 911 recording reporting the kidnapping, Ramseur admitted it was his voice on the call and to fabricating the report. Ramseur explained it was merely to test police response when a Black person was a crime victim, and was not prosecuted for this hoax. Ramseur was convicted in 1986 of the 1985 rape and robbery of a young pregnant woman. Conditionally released in 2002, Ramseur returned to prison for a parole violation in 2005; he finished his sentence in July 2010. On December 22, 2011, the shooting&#x27;s 27th anniversary, James Ramseur died at age 45 of a drug overdose in an apparent suicide.

In 1989, Barry Allen was charged with robbing a 58-year-old man of $54. In 1991, he was convicted and sentenced to 3.5 to 7 years.

Goetz achieved celebrity status after the shooting. In 2001, he unsuccessfully ran for mayor of New York City; amongst other issues, Goetz advocated for a vegetarian menu in New York City schools, jails, and hospitals. In 2004, Goetz was interviewed by Nancy Grace on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, where he stated his actions were good for New York City and forced the city to address crime. In 2005, Goetz unsuccessfully ran for public advocate; he described the subway shooting on his campaign website. In late 2013, Goetz was arrested for allegedly attempting to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer. After Goetz&#x27;s attorney moved for dismissal on speedy-trial grounds, a judge agreed that prosecutors took 14 days too long to prosecute the case, and it was dismissed in September 2014.

In 2023, African-American civil rights leader Al Sharpton and former assistant district attorney Mark Bederow compared the Goetz case to the killing of Jordan Neely.

==In popular culture==
Bernie Goetz is briefly mentioned in Billy Joel&#x27;s 1989 song &quot;We Didn’t Start The Fire&quot;.

The protagonist (the Joker) of the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot; is partly inspired by Goetz. Todd Phillips, who wrote, produced and directed the film, grew up in New York City and remembered the 1984 subway shooting from his youth.

<text>Ventilator is a 2016 Indian Marathi-language comedy drama film written and directed by Rajesh Mapuskar and produced by Priyanka Chopra. The film features an ensemble cast of more than 100 actors, including Ashutosh Gowariker, Jitendra Joshi, Sulbha Arya and Sukanya Kulkarni. It tells the story of the Kamerkar family, whose eldest and most beloved member goes into a coma and is put on a medical ventilator a few days before the Ganesh Chaturthi festival celebrations.

Mapuskar conceived the film after one of his family members was hospitalised and put on a ventilator; he started writing the script after noting the reaction of his family members, trying to treat the difficult situation with humour. On its completion, he approached several producers, who were sceptical and tried to discourage him from making it in Marathi. Later, Chopra accepted it to produce under her production company Purple Pebble Pictures.

The film was released on 4 November 2016 in Maharastra and several other cities in India. &quot;Ventilator&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, garnering praise for its direction, screenplay, cast performances, music and its treatment of humour and emotion. Made on a small budget of 35 million (US$550,000), the film was a commercial success, earning 250 million (US$4 million) at the box office. , &quot;Ventilator&quot; is the 10th highest-grossing Marathi film of all time.

&quot;Ventilator&quot; won three awards at the 64th National Film Awards; Best Director for Mapuskar, Best Editing and Best Sound Mixing. The film was nominated in 16 categories at the 2017 Filmfare Marathi Awards; including Best Film, Best Director for Mapuskar, Best Actor for Joshi, Best Supporting Actor for Gowariker and Best Supporting Actress for Kulkarni. It won five categories, including Best Screenplay. The film was remade in Gujarati in 2018 under the same title.

== Plot ==
Every year, the Kamerkar family assembles in their ancestral village to celebrate the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. Three days before the festival, a doyen of the family—the much-loved and respected Gajanan Karmerkar who is fondly known as Gajju Kaka—goes into a coma. He is put on life support—a medical ventilator—in a Mumbai hospital. Gajanan&#x27;s nephew, Raja Kamerkar, a popular Bollywood film director, receives this news from his father during a screening of his film starring Priyanka Chopra, who suggests Raja leave for the hospital. Gajju Kaka has been very kind to Raja, who is having some issues with his own father. On his way to the hospital, Raja tells everyone, including the family in the village. Although his relatives are worried about Gajju Kaka, they are also worried about the upcoming festivities. Gajju Kaka&#x27;s death during the festival would mean a period of mourning, spoiling their festive plans.

All of the family members and their neighbours visit Gajju Kaka in the hospital, praying to Lord Ganesha for his quick recovery. Gajanan&#x27;s wife Manda and their son Prasanna are happy to see Raja at the hospital, while others are excited about Raja&#x27;s upcoming film and his popularity. Raja meets everyone in the hospital, most of whom are occupied with concerns other than Gajju Kaka&#x27;s health. Raja is amused by the chaos around the family members and their different attitudes to the situation. Even in this difficult time, Prasanna is busy with political endeavours and his plans to win a competition to prove himself to his boss. Meanwhile, Pritam, Prassana&#x27;s and Raja&#x27;s cousin from the village, is on his way with his uncle (Gajanan&#x27;s older, unmarried brother), his mother, father, wife and other relatives.

Prasanna has a dysfunctional relation with his father Gajanan, of which all the family members are aware. On the contrary, Prasanna&#x27;s sister Sarika shares a deep relationship with their father. Manda reminds Prasanna that Gajanan had always loved him and that Prassana should have been there for him. Prasanna&#x27;s boss dismisses him and gives his job to his assistant. The family from the village arrives; they learn about the ventilator and are shocked to know that he will always depend upon it. Prasanna decides to keep Gajanan on the ventilator until the following afternoon and the family understands. Raja, who had problems with his own father, asks Prasanna to go to Gajanan&#x27;s ward and see him for the last time. Prasanna reveals his anger towards his father and how he could not be like &quot;his favourite Raja&quot;, and that Gajanan never understood him and overlooked him in favour of his sister Sarika.

The next day, Raja and Prasanna&#x27;s cousin Lata arrives from the United States with her husband and their young son. The child has drawn a family tree, which he shows to the whole family. He asks Prasanna about his father; Prasanna tells the child his father never loved him. After overhearing this, Raja&#x27;s father and Gajanan&#x27;s brother remind Prasanna about his father&#x27;s difficulties after Prasanna was born with a thin nostril, and contrary to Prasanna&#x27;s belief, how much Gajanan loved him. This changes Prassana&#x27;s mind; he rushes to the ward to ask the doctors to keep his father on the ventilator as he makes peace with Gajanan. He rejoins his mother and sister, and they all hug each other. This gives confidence to Raja, who tries to bury his misunderstanding with his own father. While still on the ventilator, Gajanan is seen smiling.

== Production ==
&quot;Ventilator&quot; was directed by Rajesh Mapuskar and produced by Priyanka Chopra under her production company Purple Pebble Pictures. Chopra&#x27;s mother Madhu Chopra also served as producer on the film and looked after its production. It was distributed by Zee Studios.

Mapuskar had the idea for the film when a family member was hospitalised and put on a medical ventilator. According to the director, the word &quot;ventilator&quot; became a part of his daily life and he began to follow the stories of the people undergoing medical treatment. In an interview with Scroll.in, Mapuskar recalled how relatives of people who were under medical treatment made efforts &quot;to treat life with humour in the face of death. That’s how the story was born in my mind, and I began to write it&quot;. After completing the script, he approached several filmmakers, who thought it was &quot;a great script&quot; but were sceptical of producing it. He revealed that these people tried to discourage him from making it in Marathi, since his debut film &quot;Ferrari Ki Sawaari&quot; (2013) was in Hindi. They thought going from Hindi to Marathi would be a downgrade. However, he was confident the film would be a Marathi production. He said &quot;It makes economic sense to make the film in Marathi, where better scripts are accepted and projects are wrapped up in record time&quot;.

At the same time, Priyanka Chopra set up Purple Pebble Pictures and was looking for content-driven, regional cinema scripts. After reading the script, Chopra was impressed and immediately agreed to produce the film under her production company. She said, &quot;It&#x27;s one single moment that defines the best of the film. It is funny, ironical and a deeply moving tale that will leave you laughing and crying. I am very lucky to have such a talented collection of actors coming together for my debut Marathi production.&quot; Rajesh Mapuskar believed that having Chopra as producer helped to create a larger market for the film. When the director approached Ashutosh Gowariker with the script, he assumed Mapuskar wanted him to produce the film. However, despite liking the script, he declined after learning that he wanted Gowariker to act. Gowariker, who had last acted in a film 18 years earlier, was shocked at the idea of returning to acting. He was also busy with his own directorial venture. After six months, Rajesh Mapuskar approached him again; Gowariker insisted on an audition so he could be rejected. He finally agreed after getting a phone call from Chopra, who insisted he do the film.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on 10 February 2016 in Mumbai. Sonal Kharade designed the costumes for the entire cast, Savita Singh handled the cinematography and Nikhil S. Kovale was in charge of the art direction. Filming of the hospital scenes began in May 2016; most of the film was shot in the Kurla&#x27;s Kohinoor Hospital, where a daycare unit was converted into an ICU. Chopra filmed her cameo appearance and the music video for &quot;Baba&quot; in a three-day schedule which was completed on 2 July 2016. The filming was completed in 34 days. Rameshwar S. Bhagat edited the film while Alok De did the sound mixing.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack album consists of four original songs composed by the duo Rohan Gokhale and Rohan Pradhan. The lyrics were written by Manoj Yadav, and Shantaram Mapuskar co-wrote one of song&#x27;s lyrics with Yadav. The music was digitally released on 7 October 2016 by Zee Music Company. It was released on physical media on 21 October 2016 at an event in Mumbai.

Priyanka Chopra also recorded a song titled &quot;Baba&quot; for the film, making her Marathi singing debut, which was released on 3 November 2016. The music directors wanted her to record a female version but she was apprehensive about singing in Marathi. However, she later decided to record the song as she found the composition &quot;powerful and moving&quot;. This song was not used in the film but as a promotional song with a music video that featured Chopra recording the song in a studio and several scenes from the film.

== Release ==
The first poster of the film was unveiled by Priyanka Chopra on 31 August 2016 on her Instagram account. Between 7 October 2016 to 11 October 2016, two teaser trailers—which were deemed &quot;promising&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; by the media—were released. Following the teasers, a three-minute-long trailer was released on 18 October 2016; this was well-received by the media and audiences, with NDTV noting the trailer &quot;promises both laugh-out-loud moments and also instances that move you&quot;. The music video of &quot;Baba&quot; was used to promote the film.

&quot;Ventilator&quot; premiered at the 18th Mumbai Film Festival on 24 October 2016. Made on a small budget of 35 million (US$550,000), &quot;Ventilator&quot; was released on 4 November 2016 in Maharashtra, and accompanied by English subtitles in several other cities including Gujarat, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It opened to a positive response at the box office, did good business in its first weekend and continues to perform well in its first week. The film continued to do well in its second weekend; revenues held up well despite the Indian government&#x27;s surprise currency demonetisation and other big-budget Bollywood and regional films. The film was a commercial success, earning 250 million (US$4 million) at the box office. , &quot;Ventilator&quot; is the 10th highest-grossing Marathi film of all time.

Distributed by Everest Entertainment, it was released on DVD on 26 April 2017 in all regions in a single-disc pack. A VCD version was released at the same time. The film&#x27;s Blu-ray version was released on 6 June 2017. The world television premiere occurred on 29 January 2017 on Zee Marathi.

== Reception ==
&quot;Ventilator&quot; has received widespread critical acclaim from critics. Rachit Gupta of &quot;Filmfare&quot; gave it 4 stars out of 5, calling it an &quot;achievement in handling extended ensemble casts and genuine human emotions with great effect&quot;, and said it &quot;serves up humour, anger, hatred, envy, sorrow, regret and myriad human emotions with flawless impact. You’ll laugh and cry through this film at the drop of many a hat.&quot; Gupta added, &quot;Ventilator is one of the most honest and emotional films of the year. It&#x27;s a Marathi film worth treasuring. It&#x27;s an Indian film worth celebrating.&quot; ABP Majha also gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5, praising the film&#x27;s direction, writing, casting, music and sound design.

Mihir Bhanage, writing for &quot;The Times of India&quot;, also gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, &quot;The list of must-watch Marathi films of recent times just registered an addition in the form of &#x27;Ventilator&#x27;. This Priyanka Chopra production is a beautiful journey of relationships, emotions, misunderstandings and priorities that are a part of many families.&quot; Hemant Waje of Rediff.com gave the film 3.5 out of 5, calling it &quot;a refreshing family drama&quot; and saying the characterisation is its biggest strength: &quot;Rajesh Mapuskar has made sure that he uniquely introduces each and every character and their relationship, forming a strong base for the film. He allows each one to express themselves.&quot;

Kunal Guha of &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; gave a rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that Mapuskar handled the film carefully while trying his best to contain the story and characters from stretching the limits of exaggeration: &quot;While he largely succeeds, he should be credited for elaborately examining the unexpressed emotions in relationships—and doing so amidst the cacophony of various other parallel tracks—without allowing either to shadow the other.&quot; He also praised the performances, particularly that of Joshi, whom he said &quot;furnishes his character&#x27;s state of mind immaculately&quot;. R. M. Vijayakar from &quot;India-West&quot; awarded the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote that &quot;with its subtle as well as biting satire&quot;, the film &quot;grabs your emotional plexus and makes you love and cherish life and your loved ones all over again&quot;. Vijayakar praised Mapuskar&#x27;s &quot;masterly control of his script&quot;, and said that despite &quot;the crackling undercurrent of humor&quot;, the film was a tearjerker and that &quot;there will be lumps in the throat and tears in the eyes of those susceptible&quot;.

&quot;Hindustan Times&quot; writer Gulshankumar Wankar gave a rating of 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;a delightful, well-written family drama&quot; in which the director &quot;successfully conveys his message about a father-son bond without going over the top&quot; and &quot;takes you inside the hospital and makes you sit with each character&quot;. Wankar also praised the performance of the cast, calling them &quot;remarkable&quot;, and saying &quot;Sukanya Kulkarni Mone and Jitendra Joshi play their characters of Gaju kaka’s children to perfection&quot;. A critic from the Indo-Asian News Service gave the film 3.5 stars and termed it a &quot;heart warming saga&quot; while writing, &quot;we get another Marathi film of deep emotional worth, which challenges our long standing notions of the joint family system without the crutches of cynicism and self-loathing&quot;. Film critic Prachi Pinglay-Plumber of &quot;Outlook&quot; gave the film a rating of 3 out of 4, praising the open ending, and writing, &quot;The premise lends itself beautifully to chaos, comedy and dollops of emotion ... you have a film that has all of the above boxes ticked&quot;.

== Accolades ==
== Remake ==
Soon after the release and success of the film, Mapuskar said the producers had received several offers to remake &quot;Ventilator&quot; in other languages, including Bengali, Tamil, Punjabi and Gujarati. In August 2017, it was announced &quot;Ventilator&quot; will be remade in Malayalam with Chopra serving as a producer. The Gujarati remake &quot;Ventilator&quot; was released on 14 September 2018.

In early September 2017, it was announced it would be adapted into a Gujarati play directed by theatre actor Rajesh Joshi, with Mapuskar serving as a creative consultant.

<text>Kansas City International Airport (originally Mid-Continent International Airport) is a public airport in Kansas City, Missouri, located northwest of Downtown Kansas City in Platte County, Missouri. The airport was opened in 1972 and a new complex in the airport was completed in 2023, replacing the old one. MCI replaced Kansas City Municipal Airport (MKC) in 1972, with all scheduled passenger airline flights moved from MKC to MCI. It serves the Kansas City Metropolitan Area and is the primary passenger airport for much of western Missouri and eastern Kansas.

The airport covers and has three runways. The airport has always been a civilian airport and has never been assigned an Air National Guard unit. Since the 2020 pandemic shutdown, the number of peak-day scheduled aircraft departures has been steadily recovering. , there were 303 daily arrivals and departures. Nonstop service was offered to 47 airports, including Cancún, Montego Bay, San José del Cabo, and Toronto.

Since opening in 1972, MCI has more than doubled its footprint, from 4,500 acres to 10,680 acres today. Excluding military airfields and general aviation airports, MCI ranks sixth in the United States in terms of overall acreage for a commercial/public airport, after Denver International Airport at 33,531 acres, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport at 17,207 acres, Southwest Florida International Airport at 13,555 acres, Dulles International Airport at 13,000 acres, and Orlando International Airport at 11,605 acres.

MCI is also a former hub for Braniff, Eastern, Midwest, Trans World, and Vanguard.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Kansas City Industrial Airport was built after the Great Flood of 1951 destroyed the facilities of both of Kansas City&#x27;s airlines, Mid-Continent Airlines and TWA, at Fairfax Municipal Airport. The facilities were across the Missouri River from the city&#x27;s main Kansas City Municipal Airport, which was not as badly damaged. TWA&#x27;s main overhaul base was a former B-25 bomber factory at Fairfax, and TWA commercial flights flew out of the main downtown airport.

Subsequently Kansas City planned to build an airport with room for runways and knew the downtown airport would not be large enough.

Kansas City already owned Grandview Airport south of the city with ample room for expansion, but the city chose to build a new airport north of the city away from the Missouri River following lobbying by Platte County native Jay B. Dillingham, president of the Kansas City Stockyards, which had also been destroyed in the flood. TWA moved its Fairfax plant to the new airport and also its overseas overhaul operations at New Castle County Airport in Delaware.

The site just north of the then-unincorporated hamlet of Hampton, Missouri, was picked in May 1953 (with an anticipated cost of $23 million) under the guidance of City Manager L.P. Cookingham. Ground was broken in September 1954. The first runway opened in 1956; at about the same time the city donated the southern Grandview Airport to the United States Air Force to become Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base.

TWA&#x27;s Kansas City Overhaul Base at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s was Kansas City&#x27;s largest employer, with 6,000 employees.

Although Mid-Continent merged with Braniff in 1952, Kansas City named the new airport on the basis of Mid-Continent&#x27;s historic roots of serving the Mid-continent Oil Field. Mid-Continent had renamed from Hanover Airlines in 1938 after moving its headquarters from Sioux City, Iowa, to Kansas City when it began service to Tulsa and other cities in the oil field.

In 1954, TWA signed an agreement to move its overhaul base to the airport; the city was to build and own the $18 million-base and lease it to TWA. However, the downtown airport continued to be Kansas City&#x27;s passenger airport; a 1963 Federal Aviation Agency memo called the downtown airport &quot;one of the poorest major airports in the country for large jet aircraft&quot; and recommended against spending any more federal money on it.

Along with the cramped site, there were doubts that the downtown site could handle the new Boeing 747. Jets had to make steep climbs and descents to avoid the downtown skyscrapers on the 200-ft (60-m) Missouri River bluffs at Quality Hill, east of the approach course a mile or two south of the south end of the runway, and downtown Kansas City was in the flight path for takeoffs and landings, resulting in a constant roar downtown. Mid-Continent was surrounded by open farmland.

On July 1, 1965, Continental Airlines Flight 12 overran the runway while landing at Kansas City Municipal Airport. The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that the pilots of the Boeing 707 had landed properly within the touchdown zone for their ILS approach, and though deploying spoilers, thrust reversers, and brakes, the remaining runway distance was too short for them to safely stop in heavy rain and tailwind conditions. Though having attempted to improve the runway surface and braking performance, the Airline Pilots Association said that many commercial pilots continued to &quot;blacklist&quot; the airport. A new airport, with longer runways, would be required to satisfy regulatory runway safety area requirements.

===TWA&#x27;s &quot;Airport of the Future&quot;===
In 1966, voters in a 24:1 margin approved a $150 million bond issue following a campaign by Mayor Ilus W. Davis to move the city&#x27;s main airport to an expanded Mid-Continent. The city had considered building its new airport north of downtown Kansas City in the Missouri River bottoms, as well as locations in southern Jackson County, Missouri, but decided to stick with the property it already owned.

The airport property was in an unincorporated area of Platte County until the small town of Platte City, Missouri, annexed the airport during construction. Kansas City eventually annexed the airport. Kivett and Myers designed the terminals and control tower; it was dedicated on October 23, 1972, by U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew. After a few finishing touches, MCI officially opened for business on November 11, 1972 at 1:22 am. Labor strife and interruptions raised its cost to $250 million. Kansas City renamed the airport Kansas City International Airport (although it kept MCI as its airport code). TWA, Braniff, and everyone moved to MCI.

Many design decisions were driven by TWA, which envisioned the facility as its hub, with 747s and Supersonic Transports whisking people from America&#x27;s heartland to all points on the globe. Streets around the airport included Mexico City Avenue, Brasília Avenue, Paris Street, London Avenue, and Tel Aviv Avenue. TWA vetoed concepts to model the airport on Washington–Dulles and Tampa, because those two airports had people movers, which it deemed too expensive. TWA insisted on &quot;Drive to Your Gate&quot; with flight gates from the roadway (signs along the roadway showed the flights leaving each gate). The single-level terminals had no stairs, similar to a plan that would be built at Dallas/Fort Worth.

TWA&#x27;s vision for the future of flight that had been pioneered by the TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport in New York City (which also featured cars close to the gates design) proved troublesome almost from the start. The terminals turned out to be unfriendly to the 747 since passengers spilled out of the gate area into the halls. When security checkpoints were hardened after 9/11, they were difficult and expensive to implement since passenger seating areas had to be walled off from the main concourses. As a result, passenger services were nonexistent downstream of the security checkpoint in the gate area. No restrooms were available, and shops, restaurants, newsstands, ATMs or any other passenger services were not available without exiting the secure area and being re-screened upon re-entry.

Shortly after the airport opened, TWA asked that the terminals be rebuilt to address these issues. Kansas City, citing the massive cost overruns on a newly built airport to TWA specification, refused, prompting TWA to move its hub to St. Louis.

===Post-9/11===
After the establishment of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in 2001, MCI was one of five airports where the TSA has experimented with using independent contractors to inspect travelers. The airport uses AKAL Security, an independent contractor that conforms to TSA&#x27;s recruiting and training standards. TSA supervises these independent contractors, but they are not federal employees.

A $258 million terminal renovation was completed in November 2004. Improvements included, amongst other things, increasing the size of each structural bay to provide larger spaces for vestibules, concessions, retail and public seating as well as new bathrooms inside security. Following the renovations, all three terminals included blue terrazzo floors. In May 2007, the final portion of the project, a new rental car facility and additional art fixtures, were completed.

In March 2010, the Transportation Security Administration announced that the airport would be one of the first in the United States to have full-body scanners, with the first one used at the Southwest Airlines screening area beginning in the summer of 2010.

Terminal A was closed on January 8, 2014, and demolished in 2019. Forty mosaic medallions from the terminal were preserved.

Icelandair launched a seasonal route to Reykjavík, Kansas City&#x27;s first transatlantic flight, in May 2018. The airline operated the service with Boeing 757s. In the wake of the Boeing 737 MAX groundings, Icelandair decided to make changes to its network to increase profitability; these included severing the link to Kansas City. The last flight departed in September 2019.

In March 2019, the old Terminal A was demolished to make way for a new single terminal. Designed by SOM Architects, the $1.5 billion project was the largest single infrastructure project in Kansas City’s history.

In early 2020, Kansas City International Airport suspended all international flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport lifted all COVID-19 travel restrictions in March 2022.
The airport&#x27;s new terminal opened on February 28, 2023. It features spacious gate areas and nearly 50 local and national food and beverage options. The terminal opened with 40 gates and the ability to expand up to 50 gates in the future. Two moving walkways expedite transfers between the two concourses to make navigating the airport easier. Consolidated and flexible security checkpoints were designed to accommodate changes in passenger volume. A new 6,200-space garage was built adjacent to the terminal to allow convenient covered parking near the terminal. The new facility also utilizes Amazon One, a technology that allows people to pay using their palm.

Also occurring on February 28, 2023 was the permanent closure of terminals B and C, what with the opening of the new single terminal. Fifty mosaic medallions from the two former terminals were preserved. In February 2024, the Kansas City Council approved a $17.5 million contract with St. Louis-based Spirtas Wrecking Company to demolish old terminals B and C. Demolition work began July 15, 2024, and was expected to last 10 weeks. MCI said the entire project is expected to take 10 months.

The amount of international flights has increased, with Southwest Airlines having commenced nonstop seasonal services to San José del Cabo and Montego Bay.

Air Canada announced in late 2024 that they would be terminating the route between Kansas City and Toronto for 2025 summer season due to low demand and issues with their Airbus A220 fleet. Air Canada has plans to revisit the route in 2026.

In 2024, MCI set an all-time record with 12,121,778 passengers served, breaking the record set in 2000 with 11.9 passengers travelling through the airport.

=== Airport code ===
The city government has requested – but the airport has been unable – to change its original FAA location identifier of MCI for Mid-Continent, which had already been registered on navigational charts. Further complicating requests to change the designation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at the time reserved all call letters with &quot;K&quot; or &quot;W&quot; for radio and television stations, so KCI was not viable. The &quot;W&quot; and &quot;K&quot; restrictions have since been lifted, but the FAA is reluctant to change names that have appeared on navigational charts. The &quot;KCI&quot; IATA designation is also already assigned to another airport, Kon Airport in East Timor. Nearby New Century AirCenter also carries the IATA code JCI (although the FAA refers to it as IXD and the ICAO as KIXD), which could also lead to confusion.

==Facilities==

===Terminal===

The airport has a single terminal with 40 gates and two concourses: Concourse A has 13 gates (A1–A20) and Concourse B has 27 gates (B40–B69). Non precleared international arrivals are processed at gates A12, A14, and A16. The terminal has works of public art from 28 commissioned artists funded through a percent for art program. The terminal is connected to an adjacent seven-story parking garage with 6,219 spaces; it includes parking stalls with electric vehicle chargers. Off-site parking is offered with a shuttle bus.

===Ground transportation===
The airport is near major highways Interstate 29 and Interstate 435. The airport has a consolidated rental car facility and each terminal has four rental car shuttle bus stops operated by First Transit and REM Inc. The Kansas City Area Transportation Authority has public bus service to the airport from Downtown Kansas City that runs every hour. Plans for a fixed rail connection to the airport date back to the 1960s; in preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the city government commissioned plans for improved transit service to the airport. Several private scheduled shared shuttle services operate from MCI to regional cities (including Saint Joseph, Missouri; Columbia, Missouri; Topeka, Kansas; Lawrence, Kansas); and military bases (Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; and Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri).

==Accidents and incidents==
* April 13, 1987 Buffalo Airways (of Waco, TX) Flight 721 operated by Burlington Air Express cargo flight from Wichita Mid-Continent Airport descending in a thick fog with half-mile visibility clipped a 950-ft-high ridge short of the runway. All four occupants were killed, the deadliest accident in the airport&#x27;s history.
* September 8, 1989 USAir Flight 105 from Pittsburgh International Airport clipped four power lines above the ground east of Runway 27 after making adjustments after being told by the MCI controller that lights were out on the south side of the airport. The flight then landed in Salina, Kansas. None of the 64 persons on board were injured.
* February 16, 1995 Air Transport International Flight 782, McDonnell Douglas DC-8 flight to Westover Metropolitan Airport, which had aborted a take off six minutes before because of loss of directional control, crashed on Runway 1L on another take-off because of failure of the directional control when its tail hit the runway. All three on board were killed. To date, this is the most recent fatal accident to occur on or near airport property.
* August 21, 2001 At 01:11 am, an America West Airlines Boeing 737-300 operating as Flight 598 from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport touched down on Runway 27 to the left of the center line during severe weather. The first officer in command failed to correct for leftward drift and the aircraft exited the runway approximately 1,000 feet after touchdown. Both engines were destroyed by foreign object debris, but the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. No fatalities and only one injury were reported by the 53 passengers and 6 crew.
* July 16, 2014 An Embraer E170 scheduled to operate US Airways Flight 3408 to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport veered off runway 19L while conducting a high-speed taxi for maintenance purposes. Neither of the two maintenance crew on board were injured. No passengers were on board at the time of the incident.

===Wildlife strikes===
In 2009, the airport was reported as having the highest number of wildlife strikes of any airport in the US, based on take-offs and landings (57 per 100,000). FAA records showed 146 strikes in 2008, up from 37 in 2000.

The Kansas City Aviation Department issued a press release on October 15, 2009, outlining its Wildlife Hazard Management Plan created in 1998 to reduce wildlife strikes, including removal of of trees, zero tolerance for Canada geese, ensuring grain crops are not grown with of the runways, and harassing wildlife to keep it clear of the airport. Furthermore, in 2007, the airport elected to enact a policy of 100% submitting wildlife strike reports to the FAA/USDA National Strike Database. When birds are involved in a strike, whether reported by an aircraft owner or operator, or the bird was found on the runway, feathers or DNA samples are recovered and sent to the Smithsonian Institution for positive identification. This documentation is conducted regardless of whether the strike occurred on or off the airfield.

In the reporting period of January 1990 to September 2008, none of the encounters resulted in injury to people and all of the airplanes landed safely. The report listed the most serious incidents.
* February 25, 1999 A Learjet 35 approaching Downtown Kansas City Airport struck a flock of snow geese over MCI. One hit the copilot&#x27;s window, and one was ingested into an engine, shutting it down. It landed safely.
* March 4, 1999 A DC-9 landing at the airport struck a flock of snow geese, ingesting geese in both engines and shutting one down. The airplane landed safely.
* April 28, 2000 A Boeing 727 on take-off struck a Canada goose, destroying an engine. It returned safely.
* June 10, 2005 A DC-9 on takeoff struck an American kestrel, stalling an engine. It returned safely.
* March 31, 2006 A Boeing 737 struck a medium to large bird and damaged an engine on take-off. It returned safely.
* November 14, 2009 Frontier Airlines Flight 820, an Airbus A319, to Denver, struck a flock of Canada geese shortly after take-off, resulting in loss of power to an engine. The airplane made a safe return to MCI.

<text>Methcathinone (α-[[methyl]][[amino]]-[[propiophenone]] or ephedrone) (sometimes called &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;jeff&quot; or &quot;catnip&quot; or &quot;M-Kat&quot; or &quot;kat&quot; or &quot;intash&quot;) is a monoamine alkaloid and psychoactive stimulant, a substituted cathinone. It is used as a recreational drug due to its potent stimulant and euphoric effects and is considered to be addictive, with both physical and psychological withdrawal occurring if its use is discontinued after prolonged or high-dosage administration. It is usually snorted, but can be smoked, injected, or taken orally.

Methcathinone is listed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the United States&#x27; Controlled Substances Act, and as such it is not considered to be safe or effective in the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, or cure of any disease, and has no approved medical use. Possession and distribution of methcathinone for the purpose of human consumption is illegal under any/all circumstances in the United States and is either illegal or highly regulated in most jurisdictions worldwide.

==History==
Methcathinone was first synthesized in 1928 in the United States and was patented by Parke-Davis in 1957. It was used in the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s as an anti-depressant (under the name &quot;Эфедрон&quot;—&quot;ephedrone&quot;). Methcathinone has long been used as a drug of abuse in the Soviet Union and Russia.

Circa 1994, the United States government recommended to the UN Secretary-General that methcathinone should be listed as a Schedule I controlled substance in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1995, following US advice, China added the drug to its list of prohibited substances and discontinued its pharmaceutical use.

It is currently a Schedule III drug in Canada along with codeine, anabolic steroids, and testosterone. It is legal to possess in Canada, but illegal to purchase. Methcathinone used to have the nick-name &quot;bath salts&quot;, to avoid restrictions on importation.

==Chemistry==

Methcathinone is a beta-keto &quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine and is closely related to the naturally occurring compounds, cathinone and cathine. It is also very closely related to methamphetamine, differing by only the β-ketone substituent and differing from amphetamine by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.

Methcathinone possesses a chiral carbon atom, and therefore &quot;two&quot; enantiomers are possible. When it is made semi-synthetically from pseudo/ephedrine as a starting material, then only a single enantiomer is produced. Given that the chiral center has an alpha hydrogen and adjacent the carbonyl group, the molecule will racemize in solution via an enol intermediate. This process is known as keto–enol tautomerism.

Methcathinone production utilizes the oxidation of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, the former being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of pseudoephedrine to methcathinone requires little chemistry experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is most commonly used as the oxidant.

In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using potassium permanganate is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant ; however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with chromium (VI) compounds, which are far more toxic than permanganate compounds.

Methcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its ketone group, which is substituted with a hydroxyl group, yielding pseudoephedrine, in the reverse of the typical synthesis reaction. Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the Rβ-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of freebase methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound.

== Effects ==

Methcathinone hydrochloride increases spontaneous rodent locomotor activity, potentiates the release of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, and causes appetite suppression. Users can easily forget to consume fluids leading to increased thirst and dehydration. The effects of methcathinone are similar to those of methamphetamine, initially deemed to be less intense by the inexperienced user, and often more euphoric. The effects have been compared to those of cocaine, since it commonly causes hypertension (elevated blood pressure) and tachycardia (elevated heart rate).

Reported effects include:

* Feelings of euphoria
* Increased alertness
* Slurred speech
* Shaking of the limbs
* Increased heart rate
* Increased blood pressure, risk of stroke or heart attack
* Increased empathy and sense of communication
* Both decreased and increased sexual function and desire
* Bruxism
The effects of methcathinone usually last from four to six hours.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Methcathinone is a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). Methcathinone has very strong affinities for the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Its affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) is less than that of methamphetamine.

The C=O bond at the &quot;Rβ&quot;-position (directly right of the phenyl ring) is slightly polar, and as a result the drug does not cross the lipid blood–brain barrier quite as well as amphetamine. Nevertheless, it is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Chronic high dosage use may result in acute mental confusion ranging from mild paranoia to psychosis. These symptoms typically disappear quickly if use is stopped.

Anecdotal reports have provided some information on patterns of methcathinone use. The most common route of administration is via nasal insufflation (snorting). Other routes of administration include &quot;oral&quot;, IV injection and smoking.

==Illicit usage==
Methcathinone binges resemble amphetamine binges in that the user may not sleep or eat, and takes in little in the way of liquids. The methcathinone binge is followed by long periods of sleep, excess eating, long-lasting nosebleeds (insufflation of methcathinone is corrosive to the nasal mucosa in the same manner as methamphetamine) and, in some cases, depression.

==Addiction==
In preclinical studies, methcathinone hydrochloride produces an abuse potential similar to that of the amphetamines.

Methcathinone can be highly psychologically addictive, and can produce a methamphetamine-like withdrawal.

In drug discrimination studies, methcathinone hydrochloride evokes responses similar to those induced by both dextroamphetamine sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride.

==Intravenous usage==
Injecting this substance has been associated with symptoms similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease (manganism) due to the compound manganese dioxide which is a byproduct of synthesis with permanganate.

==Legal status==
The Convention on Psychotropic Substances lists methcathinone as a Schedule I substance which restricts its use for government-approved medical and scientific uses.

=== Australia ===
Methcathinone is a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2021). A Schedule 9 substance is defined as a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, methcathinone is listed as a Class B drug with no clinical uses.

=== United States ===
In the United States, methcathinone is listed as a Schedule I drug, for which there is no clinical use.

=== Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, methcathinone is listed as a Level I substance of the Opium Law, for which there is no clinical use.

<text>David Shepard Smith Jr. (born January 14, 1964) is an American former broadcast journalist. He served as chief general news anchor and host of &quot;The News with Shepard Smith&quot; on CNBC, a daily evening newscast launched in late September 2020; but his program was canceled in November 2022. Smith is best known for his 23-year career at the Fox News Channel, which he joined at its 1996 inception and where he served as chief anchor and managing editor of the breaking news division. Smith hosted several programs in his tenure at Fox, including Fox Report, &quot;Studio B&quot; and &quot;Shepard Smith Reporting.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the son of Dora Ellen Anderson, an English teacher, and David Shepard Smith Sr., a cotton merchant. He attended Marshall Academy in Holly Springs. After high school, his parents separated and he moved to Florida with his mother. He studied journalism at the University of Mississippi, where he left two credits shy of a degree to take a reporter job in Panama City, Florida. Smith delivered the university&#x27;s 155th commencement address on May 10, 2008.

==Career==
===Local television===
Smith began his career in television with WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida, and then with WJHG-TV in Panama City Beach, Florida. After reporting jobs at WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, WSVN in Miami and WCPX-TV (now WKMG-TV) in Orlando, Smith became a correspondent for &quot;A Current Affair&quot;.

===Fox News===
After working as a correspondent for Fox affiliate service News Edge, Smith joined Fox News Channel at its inception in 1996. At Fox News, Smith reported on the death of Princess Diana in 1997, President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1998 impeachment trial, the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, the 2001 execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the death of Michael Jackson in 2009.

In 2003, &quot;The Fox Report with Shepard Smith&quot; was ranked third among the top five U.S. cable news programs, and Smith tied for second with Dan Rather and Peter Jennings as the most-trusted news anchor on both network and cable news. On November 19, 2007, Smith signed a three-year contract for $7–$8 million per year. He renewed his contract with Fox on October 26, 2010, for another three years. On September 12, 2013, he became managing editor of Fox News breaking news division and the host of &quot;Shepard Smith Reporting&quot;.

In September 2012, while covering live helicopter footage of an Arizona police chase of a man after a carjacking, the man shot himself live while Smith was narrating. After a commercial break Smith apologized and told the audience that it was &quot;due to human error&quot;. Fox would later be sued for the incident by the man&#x27;s wife after her children saw the video.

In November 2017, Smith infuriated some Fox viewers when he countered the Uranium One conspiracy theory, which claims that the Obama administration intervened corruptly in a deal allowing a Russian company to buy Uranium One, a Canadian company with uranium mining interests in the US in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. Smith&#x27;s reporting put him at odds with colleague and Fox prime time host Sean Hannity, who had supported the claim against Hillary Clinton.

On March 15, 2018, Fox News signed Smith to a multi-year contract. On October 11, 2019, he announced on &quot;Shepard Smith Reporting&quot; that he was leaving the network.

In a 2021 interview with Christiane Amanpour on her eponymous show on CNN, he stated that his presence on Fox had become &quot;untenable&quot; due to the &quot;falsehoods&quot; and &quot;lies&quot; intentionally spread on the network&#x27;s shows.

===CNBC===
On July 8, 2020, the business and economic news network CNBC announced Smith would join the network as chief general news anchor and chief general breaking news anchor. Smith served as the host of &quot;The News with Shepard Smith&quot;, a primetime general news program that airs weekdays at 7:00 pm. ET and launched on September 30, 2020. According to a CNBC press release, the program &quot;[aims] to go beyond financial markets, &#x27;to tell rich, deeply reported stories across the entire landscape of global news.&#x27;&quot; CNBC had previously aired a similarly named program in the same time slot, hosted by Brian Williams and later John Seigenthaler, from 2002 to 2004. His program was canceled in November 2022 and he left CNBC that month.

===Post-Fox career===
In a speech to the International Press Freedom Awards on November 21, 2019, Smith warned of authoritarian governments that make it dangerous and difficult for journalists to do their jobs, saying autocrats have learned to use online tools and social media to shore up their power. At the event, Smith gave $500,000 to the host organization, the Committee to Protect Journalists.

===Appearances in film===
Smith appeared as himself in the 1997 film &quot;Volcano&quot;.

Video of Smith anchoring on Fox during the opening moments of the March 2003 Iraq War was used in the film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. Additionally, archive footage of Smith anchoring &quot;Shepard Smith Reporting&quot; covering the 2016 US presidential election was used in the 2019 docudrama &quot;Bombshell&quot;.

==Personal life==
Smith married Virginia Donald, a University of Mississippi classmate, in 1987. They divorced in 1993 with no children.

In 2017, Smith publicly announced he is gay and has a long-time boyfriend. In a speech at the University of Mississippi, Smith would say, &quot;...it wasn’t until seven, or eight, or nine years ago, I started living my truth ... And when I told the truth, I guess it was considered that I outed myself. I didn’t even think about it because I didn’t think I was in.&quot;

<text>Buffalo Niagara International Airport is in Cheektowaga, New York, United States. The airport serves Buffalo, New York and Niagara Falls, New York in the United States, and the southern Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, Canada. It is the third-busiest airport in the state of New York and the busiest inside of the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area. It is about east of Downtown Buffalo and southeast of Toronto (although driving distance is ). The airport covers .

==History==

Buffalo Niagara International Airport opened as Buffalo Municipal Airport in 1926 on former farmland, making it one of the country&#x27;s oldest public airports. The original airport included a small terminal building, one hangar, and four cinder runways, each long by wide. Passenger and mail service began in December 1927, with service to Cleveland. A WPA-built Art Deco V-shaped terminal with a large cylindrical tower opened in 1939, replacing the original terminal. At this time, the airport had four paved runways: Runway 5/23 was long, Runway 13/31 (now 14/32) was long, Runway 1/19 was long, and Runway 8/26 was long. All of the runways were wide. Runways 1–19 and 8–26 were closed in the 1950s, and Runway 13–31 was renamed Runway 14–32.

The terminal&#x27;s first expansion was completed in 1955. This addition expanded the terminal to 11 gates, tripled the terminal&#x27;s square footage and added a restaurant and lounge. In 1959, the airport was acquired by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority from the City of Buffalo and renamed Greater Buffalo International Airport.

The terminal received another overhaul in 1961 that added a new control tower and a concourse for American Airlines. The first scheduled jet service was American Boeing 727 service to/from New York in 1965; Runway 5–23 was extended northeast from to later that year. In 1968, an auxiliary terminal building, West Terminal, was announced. Construction began in 1969 and it opened in 1971 with nine gates. During this time, an all-new airport to be located in Wheatfield, New York was in the planning stages and so the West Terminal was intended to have a ten-year life expectancy.

Despite the addition of the West Terminal, the 1939 terminal, now named East Terminal, received another expansion and renovation completed in 1973. New ticket lobbies were built for American Airlines and United Airlines, the original portion was turned into a baggage claim area and jetways were added for the first time. An expansion and renovation of West Terminal was announced in 1977 and completed in 1982. Two gates were added, the front of the terminal received a two-story addition, new ceilings were installed, and the original blue exterior was repainted gray. This configuration of the airport remained for the next fifteen years.

A large Curtiss-Wright plant once existed at the Airport. In 1940, the company broke ground on the plant on the southeast side of the airport and dedicated it in August 1941. The building was sold to Westinghouse in 1946 after the end of World War II. Westinghouse sold the facility to Buffalo developer Paul Snyder in 1985, who attempted to repurpose the building as the Buffalo Airport Center industrial park. This was not successful and the building was shuttered in 1991. After sitting vacant for nearly a decade, the facility was demolished in 1999 to allow Runway 14/32 to be lengthened. In 2006 the main runway was repaved and extended , its first major upgrade since 1980 and the secondary runway was extended .

In 2008 some local residents made a short-lived attempt to rename the airport to &quot;Buffalo Tim Russert International Airport&quot; after popular news commentator and Buffalo native Tim Russert, who had died that year.

===Current terminal===
In 1991 it was decided a new terminal would make more sense than continued renovations. Construction of the new building designed by the Greater Buffalo International Airport (GBIA) Design Group, a joint venture composed of Kohn Pederson Fox Associates, CannonDesign, and William Nicholas Bodouva began in 1995 in between the two existing terminals.

The new $56 million terminal (at newly named Buffalo-Niagara International Airport) opened on November 3, 1997, with 15 gates. The old terminals were demolished immediately to allow expansion. The new building was expanded in 2001, increasing the number of gates to 24. The entire terminal has a total floor area of .

=== Latest expansion===
In late 2017 the terminal began an $80 million renovation and expansion with more than of new space as part of the airport&#x27;s 2013 master plan. The expansion will create secure walkways on the east and west side of the terminal for arriving passengers and relocate the central exit walkway to eliminate bottlenecks with departing passengers on the second floor. This will also create expanded curbside space for arriving and departing passengers. The renovation will also replace the baggage claim area&#x27;s three flat plate baggage carousels with four sloped plate carousels, doubling the current capacity. Preparations began in December 2018, and groundbreaking and major construction began in February 2019. The renovations were completed in 2021. As part of the master plan, this expansion allows for the creation of a new pier south of the current east concourse.

==Infrastructure==

===Runways===
Buffalo Niagara International Airport is at elevation and has two runways.

===Emergency services===
Buffalo Airport Fire Department responds to all fire and emergency medical aid calls in the terminal complex and adjacent property. The airport was formerly served by Buffalo Fire Department Engine 7 (crash-fire-rescue unit) until 1981 and was transferred to the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority. A new $11 million fire station was completed in 2017. The facility is off of Amherst Villa Road. It is triple the size of the old station and includes a training facility and other amenities.

===Other facilities===
Signature Flight Support is the FBO for the airport. It provides private charter flights and other services, including fueling and ground handling, to many of the scheduled airlines that operate from the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. It also provides aircraft maintenance service from its FAA approved repair station to airlines, corporate and general aviation customers. It is on the airport&#x27;s north side. Prior to Tac Air taking over FBO operations in October 2020, Prior Aviation was the FBO.

===Airspace===
The airspace above Buffalo is prone to high flight traffic due to its proximity to Toronto Pearson International Airport, Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. Most of these flights are inbound or outbound from destinations in the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and South America. Aircraft descending into the Toronto area use waypoints in Buffalo as part of a Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) from the south. These aircraft are still well above and do not affect the air traffic of Buffalo.

==Service history==
The April 1957 OAG shows 96 weekday departures: 55 American, 28 Capital, 10 Mohawk and 3 Allegheny. Nonstops didn&#x27;t reach past Boston, New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago; Buffalo didn&#x27;t get a nonstop beyond Chicago until Mohawk started Minneapolis in 1970. Continental tried Denver for a few months in 1987–88, American tried DFW a couple of times, and Northwest started Minneapolis in 1987—no others until Southwest started Phoenix and Las Vegas in October 2000.

When the federal government deregulated the airlines in 1978, Buffalo was served by four airlines: three &quot;trunk carriers&quot; (American Airlines, United Airlines, Eastern Air Lines) and one &quot;local service carrier&quot; (Allegheny Airlines). American and United used the East Terminal, and Allegheny and Eastern used the West Terminal.

During the &quot;glory years&quot; for mainline-sized jet service at U.S. medium-size airports in the 1970s and 1980s, Buffalo regularly hosted widebody passenger jets. American Airlines DC-10s flew to Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport and other points. Eastern Air Lines Lockheed L-1011s and Airbus A300s flew to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Eastern&#x27;s flights often did &#x27;tag-on&#x27; hops to Toronto Pearson International Airport due to legal restrictions on flights between the United States and Canada. Buffalo still hosts many mainline passenger jets, but scheduled flights are usually narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft. Today, Buffalo hosts wide-body charter flights for the Buffalo Bills or their National Football League opponents.

Shortly after deregulation of the U.S. airline industry, American and United began reducing service at medium-sized Northeastern markets such as Buffalo. Many other airlines entered the Buffalo market and the 1980s saw a riot of new airline service as the industry began to take its post-deregulation shape. Most of these carriers did not survive the decade.

The most prominent new carrier at Buffalo was People Express Airlines, a low-fare carrier founded in 1981 with a hub at Newark International Airport. Buffalo, along with Norfolk, Virginia and Columbus, Ohio was one of the original three cities served by People from Newark. The airline grew rapidly into a major carrier and at its peak ran over 10 flights per day from Buffalo to Newark. Too-rapid growth including a purchase of the original Frontier Airlines led to People&#x27;s demise in 1987. They were bought and assimilated by Continental Airlines.

Other carriers at Buffalo included:
* Trans World Airlines (TWA), which served Buffalo around 1979–1981 during a short-lived hub in Pittsburgh.
* Republic Airlines, a Minneapolis-based carrier that ran flights from Buffalo to its hub at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport starting in 1984 and that was bought by Northwest Airlines in 1986.
* Empire Airlines, a regional carrier based in Utica that built a hub at Syracuse Hancock International Airport after deregulation and ran regional jet and turboprop flights in the Northeast.
* Mall Airways, a small regional carrier based at Albany International Airport, operated flights from Buffalo to their Albany hub in the mid-1980s.
* Piedmont Airlines, a pre-deregulation local service carrier from North Carolina that built a hub at Baltimore/Washington International Airport after deregulation and ran flights to the Northeast, Southeast, and Florida, and was bought by USAir in 1987 and merged into them in 1989.
* Independence Air, a low-cost carrier serving primarily the East Coast, operated eight flights daily from Buffalo to their hub at Washington Dulles International Airport from July 2004 until it ceased operations in January 2006.

In 1986–1987 the US airline industry went through a series of buyouts and mergers, and by the end of 1989 most domestic air service in the US was provided by six &quot;legacy carriers.&quot; At the end of the 1980s, airlines at Buffalo were mostly this six and their regional affiliates: American, United, Continental, USAir, Northwest and Delta Air Lines. During the 1990s, with People Express swallowed by Continental, these carriers kept fares high and enplanements stagnant at Buffalo.

===Low fare service===
At the beginning of the 21st century, Buffalo Niagara International Airport grew with the addition of low-cost carriers Southwest and JetBlue. Due to the &quot;Southwest Effect&quot;, Buffalo Niagara International Airport exceeded the 5 million passenger mark in 2006. Previous estimates by the NFTA had projected 3.8 million passengers for 2006, and it would be 2020 before the 5 million passenger plateau would be reached. Buffalo is the largest airport by passenger traffic in Upstate New York and now averages 4.5–5.5 million passengers per year. Another addition to the low cost carriers was Frontier, which began service from Buffalo in 2017.

===Canadian travelers===
The proximity of Buffalo Niagara International Airport to the 9.2 million residents of the Golden Horseshoe region (which includes the metropolitan areas of Greater Toronto and Hamilton) in Ontario makes it a very popular airport for Canadians traveling to U.S. destinations. Despite the existence of four international airports in the region that provide cross-border flights (Toronto-Pearson, Toronto-Billy Bishop, Hamilton and Kitchener-Waterloo), one in three passengers utilizing Buffalo are from Canada and in 2012, 47 percent of all passengers were from Canada. This is due to air fares for US-bound Canadian flights being generally higher due to added customs and immigration surcharges, the value difference of Canadian and U.S. currency, and other taxes and fees. Several passenger shuttle services operate from the airport to cities in Southern Ontario, and to Toronto-Pearson and Hamilton airports.

Due to past U.S. COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions that required COVID-19 testing for international arrivals via air travel, Toronto-based professional sports teams were similarly using the airport as a travel hub, having their players transported by bus from Toronto since land crossings and domestic flights were not subject to testing.

==Airlines and destinations==
On average there are over 100 flights per day, with nonstop service to 31 airports across the United States. Seasonally, the airport offers international flights to the Dominican Republic and Mexico.

The airport is served by the Kensington Expressway (NY Route 33), which ends at the airport. Route 33 intersects with the New York State Thruway, Interstate I-90, about from the airport and then continues directly into downtown Buffalo with a total drive time of approximately 10–15 minutes.

==Accidents and incidents==

* September 11, 1942 – A Curtiss P-40 Warhawk crashed into the Curtiss-Wright Plant 2 building on the corner of Genesee Street and Sugg Road (Holtz Road) in Cheektowaga. The plane entered the roof of the building landing near the tool crib, trapping several employees. 14 deaths and 33 injuries were reported along with many acts of heroism by employees. The plane was reported to have been at when fire started to consume the cockpit. The pilot tried in vain to save the plane but was forced to parachute to safety, landing near Walden Avenue and Union Road. The plane plunged to earth, landing back near the airport. It is said that the impact was so great that the engine was planted into the cement floor of the factory. A marker can be found in the Long Term parking lot of Buffalo Niagara International Airport.
* January 21, 1954: American Airlines Flight 767, a Convair CV-240, crashed soon after taking off from Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The left engine failed, causing the pilot to attempt a return to the airport. A successful wheels up landing was made southeast of the airport south of 2478 George Urban Blvd. in Depew. No deaths and few injuries were reported.
* On August 2, 1958 – A Blue Angels jet flown by Lt. John R. Dewenter landed, wheels up at Buffalo Niagara International Airport after experiencing engine troubles during a show in Clarence. The Grumman F-11 Tiger landed on Runway 23 but exited airport property, coming to rest in the intersection of Genesee Street and Dick Road, nearly hitting a gas station. Lt. Dewenter was uninjured and the plane was a total loss.
* On December 16, 1972, a private Cessna 421 crashed into the homes at 116 and 121 Diane Drive in Cheektowaga, New York near the airport. The crash killed three on board and three on the ground, and at least four people on the ground were injured.
*July 20, 1977 - A mail plane operated by Corporate Air and bound for Rochester crashed through the roof of the Westinghouse Electric Corp. plant in Cheektowaga, killing the pilot and critically injuring a plant employee. The pilot of the plane, identified by officials as Eugene Snyder, was taken to St. Joseph Intercommunity Hospital in Cheektowaga, where he died shortly before 12:30 am.
*February 18, 1998 – A twin engine Beechcraft chartered by Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross, a candidate for governor, carrying McCaughey Ross and three staff, crashed on take-off, with minor injuries. An FAA investigation determined that soggy conditions at the airport likely prevented the aircraft from catching fire.
* February 12, 2009 – Colgan Air Flight 3407, a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 operating under contract with Continental Connection, crashed into a home on Long Street in Clarence Center. The flight from Newark Liberty International Airport was only approximately away from the airport when it crashed. All 49 passengers and crew members on board the aircraft died in the incident, along with one person on the ground. Two others who were in the home at the time of the accident escaped alive. Minutes before the accident, the crew had reported &quot;significant ice buildup&quot; on the wings and the windshield, and an NTSB official said that the aircraft had experienced &quot;severe pitch-and-roll excursions&quot; 40 seconds prior to the crash. This was the first fatal accident of an airliner on US soil in almost three years after the crash of Comair Flight 5191. The crash was attributed to an aerodynamic stall caused by the crew&#x27;s failure to monitor their airspeed.
* August 14, 2014 – N706GS, a 2013 Piper PA-28, crashed upon takeoff from runway 23. The short flight reached an altitude of 200–300 feet before landing on BNIA property and ending up in a premium parking lot southwest of the terminal. The occupants, Bing Shen, 39; his six-year-old son; and the pilot, certified flight instructor Anastasiia Goldowsky, were treated and released from Erie County Medical Center. The flight was a plane for hire scheduled for an afternoon of sightseeing.
* April 22, 2015 – SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, en route from O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago to Bradley International Airport in Hartford, made an emergency landing after one passenger reportedly lost consciousness.
* June 8, 2015 – Mesa Airlines Flight 3796, a Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-700, operated by United Express, skidded off of Runway 32 into a grass area, due to high winds. The plane departed from Dulles International Airport. There were no injuries.
* February 13, 2019 – United Airlines Flight 1442 to Newark Liberty International Airport struck a passenger jet bridge at Gate 9 while taxiing for takeoff. Strong winds and blowing snow were reported as the cause. There were no injuries among the 158 passengers on board.
* October 2, 2020 — A Socata TBM-850 en route to Buffalo, Niagara from Manchester-Boston crashed near Corfu, New York after suffering radio failures in the aircraft from Boston Center. The aircraft crashed 17 miles east from the destination airport after beginning its initial descent. Both occupants were fatally injured.

<doc id="290181" wikidata="Q914069" url="?curid=290181" title="Toyota Land Cruiser">
<text>The , also sometimes spelt as LandCruiser, is a series of four-wheel drive vehicles produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. It is Toyota&#x27;s longest running series of models. , the sales of the Land Cruiser totalled more than 10 million units worldwide.

Production of the first generation of the Land Cruiser began in 1951. The Land Cruiser has been produced in convertible, hardtop, station wagon and cab chassis body styles. The Land Cruiser&#x27;s reliability and longevity have led to huge popularity, especially in Australia, where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive vehicle. Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outbackconsidered to be one of the toughest operating environments in both temperature and terrain. In Japan, the Land Cruiser was once exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called &quot;Toyota Store&quot;.

Since 1990, the smaller variation of the Land Cruiser has been marketed as the Land Cruiser Prado. Described as a &#x27;light-duty&#x27; version of the Land Cruiser by Toyota, it features a different design compared to the full-size model and, up until 2023, it remains the only comfort-oriented Land Cruiser available with a short-wheelbase 3-door version.

As of 2023, the full-size Land Cruiser was available in many markets. Exceptions include the United States (since 2021 where the smaller Land Cruiser Prado has been sold under the Land Cruiser name since 2024), Canada (since 1996), Malaysia (which receives the Lexus LX instead), Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Brazil, and most of Europe. In Europe, the only countries where the full-size Land Cruiser is officially sold are Gibraltar, Moldova, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Land Cruiser is hugely popular in the Middle East, Russia, Australia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, New Caledonia,and Africa. It is used by farmers, the construction industry, non-governmental and humanitarian organizations, the United Nations, national armies (often the pickup version), and irregular armed groups who turn them into &quot;technicals&quot; by mounting machine guns in the rear. In August 2019, cumulative global sales of the Land Cruiser family surpassed 10 million units.

== Origin ==
In 1936, the Imperial Japanese Army introduced the Kurogane Type 95 four wheel drive reconnaissance car. However, in a separate development, in 1941, the Japanese government asked Toyota to develop a light truck for the military. And after the Empire of Japan occupied the Philippines, during 1941–1942, a captured Bantam GP (or Willys MB) was sent to Japan for assessment and testing. Japanese military authorities subsequently requested that Toyota produce a similar vehicle, albeit with an altered external appearance.

The prototype Model AK led to the Yon-Shiki Kogata Kamotsu-Sha (四式小型 貨物 車 &quot;type 4 compact cargo-truck&quot;). The half-ton truck featured an upright front grille, flat front wheel arches that angled down and back (like the later FJ40), headlights mounted above the wheel arches on either side of the radiator, and a folding windshield.

Production AK10 vehicles were powered by the , 4-cylinder Type C engine from the Toyota Model AE sedan coupled to a three-speed manual transmission and a two-speed transfer gearbox. Unlike the U.S. Jeep, the AK10 had limited use and photographs of it in the battlefield are rare.

In June 1954, responding to claims of trademark violation by the Willys Company that produced the original Jeep, then Director of Technology Hanji Umehara renamed the vehicle &quot;Land Cruiser.&quot;

The postwar Toyota &quot;Jeep&quot; BJ is completely different from the AK10 and inherits no mechanical parts from it. However, a lot of lessons learned while developing the AK10 were applied when developing the BJ.

== Lineage ==
Toyota divided the Land Cruiser family into three series. The most basic version is the &#x27;heavy-duty&#x27; series, which prioritizes functionality, durability and off-road capabilities over comfort or technology. It is also characterised by flatter steel body panels and a near vertical greenhouse. Models considered as &#x27;heavy-duty&#x27; by Toyota are the BJ, FJ, 20, 40 and 70 series.

The &#x27;station wagon&#x27; series of the Land Cruiser has more emphasis on comfort and interior space. The &#x27;station wagon&#x27; series first appeared in 1967 as the 55 series Land Cruiser Station Wagon, which was conceived as a four-wheel drive vehicle for recreational use with sufficient space to carry an entire family – a format that was popular with customers in the U.S., and later commonly known as sport utility vehicles. Models considered as part of the &#x27;station wagon&#x27; series are the 55, 60, 80, 100, 200, and 300 series.

Since the 70 series, the &#x27;light-duty&#x27; series has been offered. Primarily tuned for the European market, it was intended to be a more comfortable version of the &#x27;heavy-duty&#x27; series by adopting coil spring suspension, while being smaller and more affordable than the &#x27;station wagon&#x27; series. Since 1990, the &#x27;light-duty&#x27; series gained an additional moniker for some markets, Prado, coinciding with the release of the 90 series Land Cruiser that was designed to be more comfort oriented. &#x27;Light-duty&#x27; models included the 70 wagon, 90, 120, 150 and 250 series.

Availability of these series varies by market. Until 2021, the U.S. and Canada received the &#x27;station wagon&#x27; model, but switched to the smaller &#x27;light-duty&#x27; model with the release of the 250 series in 2023. Most of Europe received the &#x27;light-duty&#x27; model, while only several European countries also received the &#x27;station wagon&#x27; model.

=== BJ and FJ (1951) ===

==== History ====
In 1950, the Korean War created demand for a military light utility vehicle. The United States government ordered 100 vehicles with the then-new Willys specifications and tasked Toyota to manufacture them. The Toyota &quot;Jeep&quot; BJ prototype was developed in January 1951. This came from the demand for military-type utility vehicles, much like the British Land Rover Series 1 that was developed in 1948. The Jeep BJ was larger than the original U.S. Jeep and more powerful courtesy of its Type B 3.4-litre six-cylinder OHV Four-stroke petrol engine which generated a power output of at 3,600 rpm and of torque at 1,600 rpm. It had a part-time four-wheel drive system like the Jeep. However, and unlike the Jeep, the Jeep BJ had no low-range transfer case. In July 1951, Toyota&#x27;s test driver Ichiro Taira drove the next generation of the Jeep BJ prototype up to the sixth stage of Mount Fuji, the first vehicle to climb that height. The test was overseen by the National Police Agency (NPA). Impressed by this feat, the NPA quickly placed an order for 289 of these off-road vehicles, making the Jeep BJ their official patrol car.

For the first two years, manufacture was exclusively to order and in small volumes. In 1953, however, regular production of the &quot;Toyota Jeep BJ&quot; began at the Toyota Honsya Plant (rolling chassis assembly). The body assembly and painting was done at Arakawa Bankin Kogyo KK, later known as ARACO (now an affiliate of Toyota Auto Body Company). The &quot;Toyota Jeep BJ&quot; Series was introduced in the following variants:
* BJ-T (Touring),
* BJ-R (Radio),
* BJ-J (Cowl-chassis for a fire-engine).

In June 1954, the name &quot;Land Cruiser&quot; was coined by the technical director Hanji Umehara. &quot;In England we had another competitor – Land Rover. I had to come up with a name for our car that would not sound less dignified than those of our competitors. That is why I decided to call it &#x27;Land Cruiser&#x27;&quot;, he recalls. The name had already been used on the Studebaker Land Cruiser which was produced from 1934 to 1954. The , 3.9 L Type F petrol engine was added to the Land Cruiser range for the first time, originally only in the fire-engine chassis. The models were renamed:
* BJ-T (Touring),
* BJ-R (Radio),
* BJ-J (Cowl-chassis for a fire-engine),
* FJ-J (Cowl-chassis for a fire-engine).

=== J20 (1955) ===

==== History ====
* 1955The second generation of the Land Cruiser called the 20 Series was introduced. It was designed to have a more civilian appeal than the BJ for export reasons. It also had more stylish bodywork and a better ride courtesy of longer four-plate leaf springs which had been adapted from the Toyota Light Truck. It had a more powerful 3.9 L six-cylinder Type F petrol engine, but adopted the previous generation&#x27;s three-speed gearbox. The interior of the vehicles were made more comfortable by moving the engine forward. The 20 Series still had no low range transfer case, but had synchromesh on the third and fourth gears.
* 1958FJ25 production commenced in Brazil; this being the first Toyota vehicle built outside Japan. These were sold as the &quot;Toyota Bandeirante&quot; from January 1962 when the Toyota petrol engine was replaced with a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine. The word &quot;bandeirante&quot; means &quot;flag carrier&quot; in Portuguese. The FJ25 models were built until August 1968 in Brazil. Production numbers were fairly low; in 1965, the production total was 961 vehicles.
* 1959The Land Cruiser first imported into Australia by B&amp;D Motors as the FJ25/28 cab chassis with Australian made bodies. The Land Cruiser was the first Japanese vehicle to be regularly exported to the country. A small number of Land Cruisers were initially used in the Snowy Mountains Scheme by contractor Theiss Constructions.

==== J30 ====
The J30 was only produced for 9 months from February to October of 1960. The full model code is FJ35-V (a left hand drive LV also exists). It is built on a J20 chassis with the main difference being a 4 door wagon style body (today known as a SUV) built by Gifu Auto Body Co. The vehicle has an overall length of 4615mm (181.8in), a wheel base of 2650mm (104.3in), and sits 5 people. All FJ35s come equipped with the Toyota F engine and a 4 speed manual transmission with selectable 4 four wheel drive. The J40 based wagon is called the FJ45-V/LV and uses the exact same Gifu built body as the J30. It’s thought only 60 were built and none are publicly known to have survived.

=== J40 (1960) ===

==== History ====
* 1960The 20 Series was upgraded to the now classic 40 Series. Toyota made many production changes by buying new steel presses. Mechanically, the FJ40 was given a new , 3.9 L F engine and the Land Cruiser finally received low-range gearing, but continued the three-speed main gearbox.
* 1965Global production surpassed 50,000 vehicles. The Land Cruiser was the best selling Toyota vehicle in the United States.
* 1968The 100,000th Land Cruiser was sold worldwide. Brazilian J40 production, as the Bandeirante, commenced in September. The Bandeirante has a Mercedes-Benz built diesel engine generating a power output of .
* 1972The 200,000th Land Cruiser was sold.
* 1973The 300,000th Land Cruiser was sold. The first diesel Land Cruiser was introduced for export based on a long wheelbase with a six-cylinder H engine.
* 1974A four-cylinder 3.0 L B diesel engine was offered. The introduction of this engine boosted sales in Japan by putting the Land Cruiser in a lower tax compact freight-car category as compared to the 3.9 L petrol version. 
Note: the new B diesel engine was different from the B petrol engine used in the original BJ.
* 1975The 3.9 L petrol engine was replaced by a larger, more powerful 4.2 L 2F unit and the FJ55 received front disc brakes. The 3.6 L H diesel engine was optional in some markets in the HJ45.
* 1976FJ40 Land Cruiser (United States version) received front disc brakes like the FJ55. The Toyota Land Cruiser Association was founded in California.
* 1977The Irish Army took delivery of the first of 77 FJ45 Land Cruisers. Although fast, reliable, and with good off-road performance, the vehicle tended to rust excessively in the wet Irish climate. A few which did not succumb to the effects of weather were repainted in gloss olive green and survive as ceremonial gun tractors at military funerals.
* 1978The first BJ/FJ40 and FJ55 models were officially sold in West Germany with both diesel (BJ40) and petrol engines (FJ40/55).
* 1979FJ40 (United States-version) was updated this year with a new wider, square bezel surrounding the headlights. Power steering and cooler were offered in FJ40 for the first time. The diesel engine was improved, evolving into the 3.2 L 2B unit but only in Japanese markets.
* 1980The H diesel engine (HJ45) was replaced by the 4.0 L 2H engine (now with chassis code HJ47).
* 1981The Diesel version received front disc brakes and the more powerful 3.4 L 3B engine, and the LWB BJ45 with 3B engine was added to the range.
* 1983The last FJ40s imported to the U.S. were 1983 models (mid-1982 to mid-1983). It is unknown how many were imported by Toyota, but many guess the number to be around 300. The 1983 FJ40s typically bring a premium for their rarity, though they are not much different from 1982 models (mid-1981 to mid-1982).
* 1984The North American market was limited to Canada with the BJ42, which had a 5-speed (overdrive) transmission that was widely sought. The original cost was around .

=== J70 (1984) ===


==== History ====
* 1984J70 was introduced as a soft-top, hard-top, Fibre-reinforced plastic top, utility, cab-chassis, and Troop Carrier (inward facing rear seats). The petrol engine was replaced with a 4.0 L 3F engine. The 70 Light had a four-wheel coil spring solid-axle suspension for better ride quality. This lighter-duty version of the Land Cruiser had the 22R 2.4 L four-stroke petrol engine, which actually were the 2L and 2L-T (turbocharged) 2.4 L diesel engines commonly found in the Toyota Hilux. The 70 Light was sold in some markets as the Bundera or the Landcruiser II, later called 70 Prado. The 70 Prado eventually became popular and evolved into the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (J90). An automatic transmission (A440F) was introduced making it the first four-wheel drive Japanese vehicle with an automatic transmission.
* 1990New generation of diesel engines was introduced for the Land Cruiser including a 3.4 L five-cylinder SOHC naturally aspirated engine (1PZ), and a 4.2 L six-cylinder SOHC naturally aspirated engine (designated the 1 HZ).
* 1993 to 1996The KZ 3.0 L turbocharged diesel engine replaced the LJ in the 70 series in European markets where this model was known as the KZJ70. 
* 1993An advanced 24-valve, 4.5 L six-cylinder petrol engine, 1FZ-FE was introduced.
* 1999Toyota updated the 70 series in several ways. The solid front axle received coil-spring suspension. The rear leaf springs were lengthened for increased ride comfort and wheel travel. The six-bolt wheels were replaced with five-bolt wheels. Several smaller modifications to the drivetrain provided increased durability. The long-wheel-base models received new designations: 78 for the troop carrier, and 79 for the pickup.
* 2002HDJ79 was introduced to Australia with the 1HD-FTE 4.2 L six-cylinder 24-valve turbo-diesel EFI engine.
* 2007Toyota&#x27;s first turbo-diesel V8 engine, the 1VD-FTV was introduced in some countries for the 70 Series Land Cruiser. Other modifications include the addition of a 4-door medium-wheel-base model (the 76) and an updated front-end on all models.
* 2012The 79 Double Cab pickup was introduced in the South African markets (with the 4.2 L diesel or 4.0 L petrol engines) and in the Australian market (with 4.5 L V8 Diesel engine).
* 2014 to 2015The 30th Anniversary Series 70 sold in Japan as a 4-door wagon or 4-door pickup with the 1GR-FE V6 petrol engine and 5-speed manual transmission.
*2023 70 Series is re-introduced to Japan. Sold with the 1GD 4 cylinder turbo diesel engine in similar configurations as before, including 4-door wagon, 2-door pickup, 4-door pickup, and 3-door troop carrier models.

The Sixth and Seventh generations of the Land Cruiser are still being produced and sold in African and Latin American regions. Production of the Land Cruiser in Venezuela ended in 2008.

The 70 series is also still marketed in Australia as 4-door wagon, 2-door &#x27;Troop Carrier&#x27;, 2-door cab-chassis and 4-door cab-chassis.

The 70 series is also still being marketed in the Middle East as a 2-door and 4-door version as an SUV, and a 2-door and 4-door version as a pickup, and it is very popular there along with the regular Land Cruiser.

== Station Wagon series ==

=== J50 (1967) ===

The Land Cruiser 55 was produced from 1967 to 1980. Toyota refers to the FJ55G and FJ55V as the first &quot;real&quot; station wagon (now known as a sport utility vehicle) in the Land Cruiser series, thus marking the beginning of the station wagon body style. It was the first Land Cruiser to have fully enclosed box frame members. Of all the Land Cruiser wagons sold in the U.S., including the FJ45, it is the only one to not have hatch and tailgate in the rear, but rather a tailgate only with an electrically operated window that can be retracted into the tailgate.

==== History ====
* 1967Production of the FJ55 began. The FJ55 was a 4-door station wagon version based on the FJ40&#x27;s Drive-train, replacing the 4-Door FJ45V (I). It was colloquially known as the &quot;Moose&quot;. It has also been referred to as a &quot;pig&quot; or an &quot;iron pig&quot;. The FJ55 had a longer wheelbase (at ) and was mainly designed to be sold in North America and Australia. Fire engine versions were also available, using the regular front clip but with open bodywork and no doors.
* 1975January 1975 saw the F series engine being replaced by the 2F engine. Unusual for Toyota, the model designation (e.g. FJ55) did not change, except in Japan, where it was changed to FJ56.
* July 1980Production ends.

=== J60 (1980) ===

The Land Cruiser 60 series was produced from 1980 through 1990, for most markets but the Cumana Plant in Venezuela continued production until 1992 for their local market. It is a front engine, four-door wagon which can seat five to eight people. The 60 series was available in the following exterior colours: Alpine White, Brown, Desert Beige, Freeborn Red, Royal Blue; and in the following metallic exterior colours: Charcoal Gray, Cognac, Gray-Blue, Rootbeer, Sky Blue, Stardust Silver.

==== History ====
* 1980The 60 series was introduced. While still retaining the rugged off-road characteristics of previous Land Cruisers, the 60 was designed to better compete in the emerging sport utility vehicle market. The 60 was given a variety of creature comforts like air conditioning, a rear heater and an upgraded interior. The FJ60&#x27;s &quot;2F&quot; petrol engine was left unchanged from the &quot;40&quot; series while the six-cylinder 4.0 L 2H and the four-cylinder 3.4 L 3B diesel engines were added to the lineage. Less equipped versions were also available in many markets. In Europe this model was sold as the Land Cruiser Wagon Van.
* 1981Land Cruiser sales surpassed 1 million and a high-roof version was introduced. The 60 series was introduced to South Africa when a stock Land Cruiser competed in the Toyota 1000 km Desert Race in the punishing wilds of Botswana.
* 1984This was the final year for the 40 series.
* 1984Alongside the 60 series, the 70 series was introduced.
* 1985The direct-injection 12H-T turbo-diesel engine was introduced.
* 1988The petrol engine was upgraded in some countries to a 4.0 L 3F-E EFI engine or to a 4.0 L 3F carburettor engine. The FJ62G VX-Series was introduced, allowing the Land Cruiser to be sold in Japan as a passenger vehicle. In US-specs, the 3F-E produces .
* 1992Last FJ62 with a 4.0 L 3F carburettor engine was built in Venezuela which was the only country producing the vehicles after production ended in Japan in 1990.

=== J80 (1990) ===

The Land Cruiser 80 series was unveiled in October 1989 at the Tokyo Motor Show and launched in early 1990. It had swing-out back doors, which were replaced by a tailgate and hatch in 1994. The Land Cruiser was nicknamed the Burbuja (Bubble) in Colombia and Venezuela due to its roundness. The J80 was initially offered in two versions in these countries: the fully loaded VX and an entry-level model that included a vinyl interior with optional air conditioning. In 1996, the entry model was upgraded to a medium-equipped model named Autana, including cloth upholstery, standard air conditioning and power driver seat. The name is a reference to the Tepui mesa Autana, a spectacular plateau and cave system along the Guiana Shield craton. Land Cruiser sales reached 2 million vehicles.

==== History ====
* 1990The 80 series station wagon was introduced, replacing the 60 series. All 80s sold in North America and Europe now have a full-time four-wheel drive system. In Japan, Africa, and Australia, a part-time system was still available. 80s produced between 1990 and 1991 had an open centre differential which was lockable in 4HI and automatically locked in 4LO. From 1992 onward, vehicles with anti-lock brakes had a viscous coupling that sent a maximum of 30% torque to the non-slipping axle. The differential was lockable in 4HI and automatically locked in 4LO.
* 1990A new generation of diesel engines were introduced, adding to the engines available in the 80 series. The 80 series came with either a (3F-E) six-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine, a six-cylinder SOHC naturally aspirated diesel engine, (1HZ), or a 1HD-T direct injection turbo diesel.
* 1991By mid-1991, the 3F-E engine was introduced to the Australian market, a fuel injected version of the 3F engine.
* 1993An advanced 24-valve, 4.5 L six-cylinder petrol engine, 1FZ-FE was introduced. Larger brakes were added from October 1992 and the total wheelbase was made slightly longer. Front and rear axle lockers (code k294) were available as an option. The High Pinion Electric Locking front differential became available in the US models. In May 1993, Toyota began using R134 refrigerant in the air conditioning system. Serial numbers lower than JT3DJ81xxxxx38947 use the R12 refrigerant.
* 1994A limited edition called the Land Cruiser Blue Marlin (FZJ80) was introduced to the Australian market. They have 4.5 L straight-6 petrol engines with double-overhead cams, an automatic or manual transmission and at 4,600 rpm. The car is blue from the Blue Marlin fish and they have the Blue Marlin logo throughout the car. Some of the features that the Blue Marlin included were altimeters, power windows, disc brakes, leather gear knob and steering wheel, central locking, leather trim, chrome handles and sidesteps, 16-inch alloy wheels, limited-slip differential, anti-lock brakes (ABS), power steering, CD or cassette players, fender flares, and a limited edition bull bar. Only 500 were made.
* 1995Driver and passenger airbags were introduced as were adjustable shoulder-belt anchors and an anti-lock braking system. The &quot;T O Y O T A&quot; badge was replaced with the modern, ovoid Toyota logo.
* 1996In the Dakar Rally, a pair of Land Cruisers finished first and second in the unmodified production class. North American and British models adopted anti-lock brakes and airbags as standard equipment. The Land Cruiser was withdrawn from Canada this year and from then on would only be sold in said market as the Lexus LX.
* 1997A limited run of Land Cruiser 80 was built specifically for collectors and is therefore called the Land Cruiser Collector&#x27;s Edition. The Collector&#x27;s Edition has Collectors Edition badging, &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; embroidered floor mats, automatic climate control, wheels with the &quot;D&quot; windows painted dark grey and special grey side moldings along with black pearl badging. The Collector&#x27;s Edition was only available for the 1997 model year and the package was added to many of the available body colours.
* 1997A total of 4,744 FZJ80 Land Cruisers were sold in the United States as &quot;40th Anniversary Limited Edition&quot; models. They were available in 2 colours; Antique Sage Pearl (often referred to as Riverrock, Pewter, or Grey) and Emerald Green. The 40th Anniversary models included apron badges, a serial number badge on the centre console, black pearl exterior badges, &quot;40th Anniversary Limited Edition&quot; embroidered floor mats, automatic climate control, two-tone tan and brown leather interiors, and wheels with the &quot;D&quot; windows painted dark gray. Many were manufactured with the optional electric front and rear locking differentials, keyless entry, port-installed roof racks and running boards. There are some examples that did not have many of these optional extras. This was the last year for the electric locking front differentials. For UK and Irish markets, to avoid confusion with the Land Cruiser Prado being introduced, the full size Land Cruiser would be renamed Land Cruiser Amazon with the Prado being named the Land Cruiser Colorado.
* 2007Last 80-Series models were built in Venezuela which was the only country producing the vehicles after production ended in Japan in 1997.

=== J100 (1998) ===

==== Development ====
In January 1998, the 100 series Land Cruiser was introduced to replace the eight-year-old 80 series. The 100 series was previewed in October 1997 as the &quot;Grand Cruiser&quot; at the 32nd Tokyo Motor Show. Development began in 1991 under code name 404T, with the final design being frozen in mid-1994.

There are two distinct versions of the 100-series, the &quot;100&quot; and the &quot;105&quot;. The two versions look very similar, but there are significant differences under the bodywork. Despite these differences and official model names, both the 100 and 105 are collectively known as the &quot;100 series&quot;.

The &quot;105&quot; carried over the majority of its chassis and power train from the 80-series with coil suspended solid axles front and rear, and straight-6 petrol and diesel engines. These models were only sold in African, Australian, Russian, and South American markets.

In 1998, a suspension system combining Active Height Control (AHC) and Skyhook TEMS Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension on the Land Cruiser J100 was introduced.

==== Specifications ====
The &quot;100&quot; models were fitted with a slightly wider chassis, independent front suspension (IFS) and two new engines. The change to IFS was a first for a Land Cruiser, and was made (in combination with rack-and-pinion steering) to improve on-road handling. However, it also limited the vehicle&#x27;s off-road capability and durability; hence, the decision to offer the solid-axle 105 models alongside the IFS 100 models in some markets was made. 

Despite the 100 and 105 bodies being very similar, there are some exterior visual indications between both models. The most obvious is the front end of the vehicle often appearing lower than the rear on the 100 models, due to the IFS. The other indicator is the design of the wheels: the 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have dished wheels. This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider axle track to allow for the IFS system.

The introduction of a V8 engine was also a first for a Land Cruiser, and was specifically intended to improve sales in the North-American market, where it was the only engine available. In Australia, the 100 V8 was initially only available in the range-topping GXV model, while entry and mid-range models were the 105 powered by the 1FZ-FE I6 petrol, or 1HZ diesel engines. The new 1HD-FTE turbo-diesel 100 was added to the Australian range in October 2000 after being available in Europe and the UK since the vehicle&#x27;s launch in 1998. The automotive press in Australia were critical of Toyota&#x27;s decision to offer the acclaimed 1HD-FTE engine only in combination with IFS. Australian 4WD Monthly magazine stated &quot;We will never forgive Toyota for going independent at the front with the mighty 4.2 turbo-diesel&quot;.

The 100 series offered a selectable rear axle differential locker available as an option for model years 1998-1999.

The 100 series formed the basis for the Lexus LX 470, which was also sold in Japan as the Toyota Cygnus.

The 100 series was called the Toyota Land Cruiser Amazon in the UK and Ireland from 1998 to 2007.

In 2000, Toyota celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Land Cruiser with commemorative models offered in several countries. Total global production to date was 3.72 million vehicles.

In 2002, Toyota introduced Night View, the first worldwide series-production active automotive night vision system, on the Toyota Land Cruiser Cygnus and Lexus LX 470. This system uses the headlight projectors emitting near infrared light aimed like the car&#x27;s high-beam headlights and a CCD camera then captures that reflected radiation, this signal is then processed by a computer which produces a black-and-white image which is projected on the lower section of the windshield. It was also the first Toyota vehicle with roll-over sensor and control logic.

The 100 series remained in production until late 2007, with several minor facelifts such as headlights, tail lights, front grille, rear spoiler and specification changes introduced over the years.

==== Engines ====

&quot;*This engine was not introduced in Australia until 2000.&quot;

The 100-series is generally considered a durable and reliable vehicle, however there have been three known issues identified, generally for vehicles operating in harsh conditions:
* The IFS 100-series gained a reputation for front suspension failures in operating conditions where the front suspension was prone to hitting the bump stops. Several companies produce strengthened lower wishbones to prevent cracks from developing.
* Both the IFS 100 and live-axle 105 models have been reported to be suffering from broken front differential centres when driven in harsh conditions. The most common front differential failures in IFS models are reported in vehicles produced between mid-1997 and mid-1999 (i.e., the model years 1998 and 1999), when Toyota fitted the 100 Series IFS with a 2-pinion front differential (the pinion gear would flex away from the ring gear under shock loads). In 1999 (model year 2000) the IFS Landcruiser received a 4-pinion front differential that was more robustfewer failures were reported.

=== J200 (2007) ===

==== Development ====
In 2002, a five-year development plan on a successor to the 100-series platform commenced under Sadayoshi Koyari and Tetsuya Tada. By 2004, ten years after the design selection of its predecessor in 1994, a final production design was settled on for the 2008 J200. Prototype related tests were conducted for over two years between 2004 and early 2007.

The redesigned Toyota Land Cruiser was introduced in late 2007. Known as the 200 Series, it is also sold alongside the platform-sharing Lexus LX 570 in some markets. The frame and platform is newly developed, bigger brake rotors and calipers were added and the front suspension was strengthened. The underbelly is also protected by skid plates. The roof pillars were redesigned to better protect occupants in a rollover.

The vehicle entered production in September 2007 and was available for sale from September or November, depending on country. It became available in Venezuela for sale in early November of the same year under the local nickname of &quot;Roraima&quot; (taken from Mount Roraima).

==== Specifications ====
The 200 Series, offered numerous features and upgrades over its predecessor not limited to the cosmetic changes made to the body and interior, including:
* Smart EntryA sensor is triggered when the remote is brought near the vehicle, allowing the user to simply touch the door handle to open it.
* Smart StartStart/Stop push button for ignition; a key is not required.
* 4-zone climate control on Sahara models, with outlet vents increased from 18 to 28
* 10 airbags (VX &amp; Sahara)
* A stronger and lighter frame

Various driver assist technologies not offered on previous models are included as standard, including:
* CRAWL, a four-wheel drive control system that operates like an off-road cruise control, automatically maintaining a low uniform vehicle speed using brakes and throttle
* Downhill Assist Control
* Multi-terrain anti-lock braking system (ABS)
* Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), allows for greater wheel articulation
* An optional rear-view camera (VX)
* Leather seats are available in full option (VX)

Engine and transmission improvements include:
* An all new optional V8 diesel engine, the Toyota VD engine (a twin-turbocharged version of the engine used in the 70 Series since 2007).
* Automatic transmission included as standard across all levels of trim of the 200 Series, a five-speed manual transmission is offered only with the 4.0 L GX models (in selected regions). A five-speed automatic gearbox is assigned to the 4.7 L petrol models, while the 4.5 L diesel models receive a six-speed automatic.
For the 2013 model year, Toyota added all previously optional safety and luxury options as standard. The Land Cruiser now gets push-button start, HID headlights with beam level adjustment, a power moonroof, automatic rain sensing windshield wipers, heated and ventilated (perforated leather) front and only heated rear seats, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, Bluetooth, rear-view camera with parking sensors, navigation system, HD radio and Entune. Another new feature is the Multi-terrain Select system which helps control wheelspin and brake lockup giving the selectable choices of: Rock, Rock &amp; Dirt, Mogul, Loose Rock, and Mud &amp; Sand and with an addition to the Multi-terrain Select system a feature known as adaptive Anti-lock Braking system which adapts to the condition of the road like mud or sand and efficiently uses the ABS to reduce braking distance on any type of terrain.

==== Markets ====
In Japan, the Land Cruiser had an update in 2009 when it received the 4.6 L V8 1UR-FE engine and the gearbox was replaced with a 6-speed automatic. Although the new 4608 cc 1UR-FE is smaller than the old 4663 cc 2UZ-FE engine, the power has been increased from , torque increased from and fuel consumption improved from (Japan 10·15 mode measurement).

Updates to the front fascia, grill, bonnet, headlamps (with daylight running lamps), rear tail lamps and bumpers were the main exterior highlights of the facelift. Interior changes included a new multimedia system and interface with larger screens front and back, as well as refreshed interior styling.

In February 2019, Toyota introduced a Heritage edition of the Land Cruiser at the Chicago Auto Show as part of the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the FJ40. Toyota built only 1200 vehicles which were only available as a 5-seater sold in the United States. Sales are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2019 for the 2020 model year.

=== J300 (2021) ===

==== Development ====
The J300 series Land Cruiser was unveiled on 9 June 2021. Its development was led by Toyota chief engineer Takami Yokoo. Built on the body-on-frame GA-F platform, the frame itself was redesigned to reduce weight and increase rigidity. The total weight of the vehicle was reduced by compared to its predecessor. Other improvements claimed include lowered center of gravity, weight distribution, and an improved suspension structure.

==== Specifications ====
Exterior dimensions including the total length, total width, and wheelbase, as well as both the departure and approach angles have been kept largely same as the previous model to retain its off-road performance. It carries over the approach angle of 32 degrees from its predecessor. The departure angle can reach up to 26.5 degrees depending on the version, while ground clearance measures . Toyota has equipped the vehicle with an adaptive variable suspension (AVS), an upgraded Electronic Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (E-KDSS), a more advanced Multi-Terrain Select system with Deep Snow and Auto modes, and a Multi-Terrain Monitor system which incorporates an underbody camera.

For this generation, Toyota ceased to offer V8 engine options in favour of a &quot;V35A-FTS&quot; twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine producing and , and a 3.3-litre &quot;F33A-FTV&quot; twin-turbocharged V6 diesel engine producing and . A 4.0-litre naturally-aspirated V6 engine is carried over from the previous model.

A GR Sport/GR-S variant is also available for the first time. It is shorter than the standard model, and uses more body adhesive to enhance structural rigidity. The GR Sport model also offers front and rear differential locking, as opposed to only centre locking in the standard 300 Series.

== Land Cruiser Se Concept (2023) ==
The Land Cruiser Se is a monocoque-based three-row battery electric concept SUV using the Land Cruiser nameplate showcased at the 2023 Japan Mobility Show.

== Sales ==

Figures for the United States for 2024 and beyond are for the model based on the J250 series Land Cruiser Prado.

== Use by military forces and militant groups ==


Owing to its durability and reliability, the Land Cruiser, along with the smaller Toyota Hilux, has become popular among military forces and used as a military light utility vehicle. The vehicles are also popular with militant groups in war-torn regions. U.S. counter-terror officials enquired of Toyota how the extremist group Islamic State had apparently acquired large numbers of Toyota Land Cruisers and Hiluxes. Mark Wallace, the CEO of the Counter Extremism Project said, &quot;Regrettably, the Toyota Land Cruiser and Hilux have effectively become almost part of the ISIS brand.&quot;

<text>The Araneomorphae (also called the Labidognatha or &quot;true spiders&quot;) are an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguishable by chelicerae (fangs) that point diagonally forward and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), where they point straight down. Araneomorphs comprise the vast majority (about 93%) of living spiders.

== Distinguishing characteristics ==
Most spider species are Araneomorphae, which have fangs that face towards each other, increasing the orientations that they can employ during prey-capture. They have fewer book lungs (when present) – usually one pair – and the females typically live one year. 

The Mygalomorphae have fangs that face towards the ground, and which are parallel to the long axis of the spider&#x27;s body, thus they have only one orientation they can employ during prey capture. They have two pairs of book lungs, and the females often live many years.

== Spiders included ==
Almost all of the familiar spiders are included in the Araneomorphae group, one major exception being the tarantulas. There are a few other Mygalomorphae species that live around homes or gardens, but they typically are relatively small and not easily noticed.

The Araneomorphae, to the contrary, include the weavers of spiral webs; the cobweb spiders that live in the corners of rooms, and between windows and screens; the crab spiders that lurk on the surfaces of flowers in gardens; the jumping spiders that are visible hunting on surfaces; the wolf spiders that carpet hunting sites in sunny spots; and the large huntsman spiders.

== Systematics ==
In older schemes, the Araneomorphae were divided into two lineages, the &quot;Hypochilae&quot; (containing only the family Hypochilidae), and the &quot;Neocribellatae&quot;. The Neocribellatae were in turn divided into the Austrochiloidea, and the two series Haplogynae and Entelogynae, each containing several superfamilies. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the haplogynes in particular are not a monophyletic group. A 2020 study suggested the relationships among the major groups were as shown in the following cladogram.

The blue bar to the right shows the former Haplogynae in the sense of Coddington (2005).

<text>The green sandpiper (Tringa ochropus) is a small wader (shorebird) of the Old World.

The green sandpiper represents an ancient lineage of the genus &quot;Tringa&quot;; its only close living relative is the solitary sandpiper (&quot;T. solitaria&quot;). They both have brown wings with little light dots and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids.

Given its basal position in &quot;Tringa&quot;, it is fairly unsurprising that suspected cases of hybridisation between this species and the common sandpiper (&quot;A. hypoleucos&quot;) of the sister genus &quot;Actitis&quot; have been reported.

==Taxonomy==
The green sandpiper was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Tringa ochropus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;ochropus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;okhros&quot;, &quot;ochre&quot;, and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This species is a somewhat plump wader with a dark greenish-brown back and wings, greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts. The back is spotted white to varying extents, being maximal in the breeding adult, and less in winter and young birds. The legs and short bill are both dark green.

It is conspicuous and characteristically patterned in flight, with the wings dark above and below and a brilliant white rump. The latter feature reliably distinguishes it from the slightly smaller but otherwise very similar solitary sandpiper (&quot;T. solitaria&quot;) of North America.

In flight it has a characteristic three-note whistle.

==Distribution and migration==

The green sandpiper breeds across subarctic Europe and east across the Palearctic and is a migratory bird, wintering in southern Europe, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and tropical Africa. Food is small invertebrate items picked off the mud as this species works steadily around the edges of its chosen pond.

This is not a gregarious species, although sometimes small numbers congregate in suitable feeding areas. Green sandpiper is very much a bird of freshwater, and is often found in sites too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view.

==Breeding==
It lays 2–4 eggs in an old tree nest of another species, such as a fieldfare (&quot;Turdus pilaris&quot;). The clutch takes about three weeks to hatch.

==Status==
Widely distributed and not uncommon, the green sandpiper is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN on a global scale. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Tringa is a genus of waders, containing the shanks and [[Tattler (bird)|tattlers]]. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1599. They are mainly freshwater birds, often with brightly coloured legs as reflected in the English names of six species, as well as the specific names of two of these and the green sandpiper. They are typically associated with northern hemisphere temperate regions for breeding. Some of this group—notably the green sandpiper—nest in trees, using the old nests of other birds, usually thrushes.

The willet and the tattlers have been found to belong in &quot;Tringa&quot;; these genus changes were formally adopted by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 2006.

The present genus in the old, more limited sense was even further subdivided into &quot;Tringa&quot; proper and &quot;Totanus&quot;, either as subgenera or as full genera. The available DNA sequence data suggests however that neither of these is monophyletic and that the latter simply lumps together a number of more or less closely related apomorphic species. Therefore, it seems unwarranted to recognize &quot;Totanus&quot; even as a subgenus for the time being.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Tringa&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The type species is the green sandpiper (&quot;Tringa ochropus&quot;).

===Species===
The genus contains 13 species.










==Systematics and evolution==
The shanks&#x27; and tattlers&#x27; closest relatives are sandpipers of the genera &quot;Actitis&quot; and &quot;Xenus&quot;. Together with these, they are related to the phalaropes, as well as the turnstones and calidrids. The large genus &quot;Tringa&quot; and the two very small genera which are most closely related form a phylogeny similar to the situation found in many other shorebird lineages such as calidrids, snipes and woodcocks, or gulls.

The same study has indicated that some morphological characters such as details of the furcula and pelvis have evolved convergently and are no indicators of close relationship. Similarly, the leg/foot color wildly varies between close relatives, with the spotted redshank, the greater yellowlegs, and the common greenshank for example being more closely related among each other than to any other species in the group; the ancestral coloration of the legs and feet was fairly certainly drab buffish as in e.g. the green sandpiper. On the other hand, the molecular phylogeny reveals that the general habitus and size as well as the overall plumage pattern are good indicators of an evolutionary relationship in this group.

The Nordmann&#x27;s greenshank, a rare and endangered species, was not available for molecular analyses. It is fairly aberrant and was formerly placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Pseudototanus&quot;. It appears closest overall to the &quot;semipalmata-flavipes&quot; and the &quot;stagnatilis-totanus-glareola&quot; groups, though it also has some similarities to the greater yellowlegs and common greenshank.

===Fossil record===
Fossil shanks are known since the Miocene, possibly even since the Eo-/Oligocene some 33-30 million years ago (mya) which would be far earlier than most extant genera of birds. However, it is uncertain whether &quot;Tringa edwardsi&quot; indeed belongs into the present-day genus or is a distinct, ancestral form. The time of the &quot;Tringa&quot;-&quot;Actitis&quot;-&quot;Xenus&quot;-&quot;Phalaropus&quot; divergence has been tentatively dated at 22 mya, the beginning of the Miocene; even if the dating is largely conjectural, it suggests that &quot;T. edwardsi&quot; does indeed not belong into the modern genus. Molecular dating—which is not too reliable, however—indicates that the diversification into the known lineages occurred between 20 and 5 mya. The fossil record contains species formerly separated in &quot;Totanus&quot; from the Early Miocene onwards. Although these are usually known from very scant remains, the fact that apparently apomorphic &quot;Tringa&quot; as well as a putative phalarope are known from about 23-22 mya indicates that the shank-phalarope group had already diverged into the modern genera by the start of the Miocene. The biogeography of living and fossil species—notably, the rarity of the latter in well-researched North American sites—seems to suggest that &quot;Tringa&quot; originated in Eurasia. Time and place neatly coincide with the disappearance of the last vestiges of the Turgai Sea, and this process may well have been a major factor in the separation of the genera in the shank-phalarope clade. Still, scolopacids are very similar osteologically, and many of the early fossils of presumed shanks require revaluation.

<text>Guantánamo (, , ) is a municipality and city in southeast Cuba and capital of Guantánamo Province.

Guantánamo is served by the Caimanera port near the site of a U.S. naval base. The area produces sugarcane and cotton wool. These are traditional parts of the economy.

==History==

The city was founded in 1797 in the area of a farm named &quot;Santa Catalina&quot;. The toponym &quot;Guantánamo&quot; means, in Taíno language, &quot;land between the rivers&quot;.

==Geography==
The municipality is mountainous in the north, at Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, where it overlays the Sierra Maestra (mountains), and borders the Windward Passage of the Caribbean Sea in the south. It is crossed by the Bano, Guantánamo, Yateras, Guaso, San Andrés, and Sabanalamar rivers. The city is spread with a square plan and is crossed in the middle by the Carretera Central highway. Guantánamo Bay is a natural harbour south of it.

The municipality borders with El Salvador, Niceto Pérez, Caimanera, Yateras, Manuel Tames, and Sagua de Tánamo; this one in Holguín Province. It includes the villages of Argeo Martínez, Arroyo Hondo, Glorieta, Las Lajas, and Paraguay.

Prior to 1976 it was divided into the barrios and villages Arroyo Hondo, Baitiquirí, Bano, Bayate, Caimanera, Camarones, Caridad, Corralillo, Cuatro Caminos, Filipinas, Glorieta, Gobierno, Guaso, Hospital, Indios, Isleta, Jaibo Abajo, Las Lajas, Macurijes, Mercado, Ocujal, Parroquia, Palma de San Juan, Rastro, Tiguabos, and Vínculo. After 1976 reform part of municipal territory was split in the municipalities of El Salvador, Niceto Pérez, Caimanera, and San Antonio del Sur.

===United States Naval Base===

About 15 km away from the city lies the Guantánamo Bay, a superior natural harbor which has been utilized by the United States since 1898, when it was captured from Spain in the Battle of Guantánamo Bay. Cuba leased it to the U.S. in 1903 in fulfillment of a commitment made in the 1903 Cuban–American Treaty of Relations, and remains the site of a US Navy base, as well as the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Guantánamo had a population of 222,781. With a total area of , it has a population density of .

===Notable Guantanameros===
Notable natives of Guantánamo include athletes Joel Casamayor, Erislandy Lara, Yuriorkis Gamboa, Yumileidi Cumbá, Jaime Jefferson, Yargelis Savigne, Dayron Robles, Luis Delís, gymnast Annia Hatch, Broadway and movie actress Olga Merediz, musician Diamela del Pozo, cosmonaut Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez, journalist Iliana Hernández and Major League Baseball player Luis Robert Jr. of the Chicago White Sox.

==Transport==
===Car===
The city is served by the Carretera Central highway, and is the eastern terminus of the A1 motorway, that is mainly under construction and will link Guantánamo with Havana. 
===Railway===
In July 2019, Cuba received its first new train cars in over four decades from China for the route between Havana and Guantanamo. The journey takes 15 hours. A round trip ticket from Havana to Guantanamo trip starts at 200 Cuban pesos ($8, €7).

===Airport===
Guantanamo&#x27;s commercial airport, the Mariana Grajales Airport, is served by one airline, Cubana. It is located near the villages of Las Lajas and Paraguay.

==The song &quot;Guantanamera&quot;==
&quot;Guantanamera&quot; (Spanish: &quot;from Guantánamo [feminine]&quot;, thus &quot;woman from Guantánamo&quot;) is perhaps the best known Cuban song and that country&#x27;s most noted patriotic song. In 1966, a version by American vocal group The Sandpipers, based on an arrangement by Pete Seeger, became an international hit. The song was later also one of Cuban superstar singer Celia Cruz&#x27;s biggest hits.

<text>Elizabeth Anne Ford (; formerly Warren; April 8, 1918 – July 8, 2011) was first lady of the United States from 1974 to 1977, as the wife of President Gerald Ford. As first lady, she was active in social policy, and set a precedent as a politically active presidential spouse. She was also second lady of the United States from 1973 to 1974, when her husband was vice president.

Throughout her husband&#x27;s time in the office of the presidency, she maintained high approval ratings, and was considered to be an influential first lady. Ford was noted for raising breast cancer awareness following her 1974 mastectomy. In addition, she was a passionate supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). As a supporter of abortion rights, and a leader in the women&#x27;s rights movement, she gained fame as one of the most candid first ladies in history, commenting on the hot-button issues of the time, such as feminism, equal pay, the Equal Rights Amendment, sex, drugs, and abortion. Surveys of historians conducted by the Siena College Research Institute have shown that historians regard Ford to be among the best and most courageous American first ladies.

Following her years in the White House, Ford continued to lobby for the ERA, and remained active in the feminist movement. Soon after leaving office, she raised awareness of addiction when she sought help for, and publicly disclosed, her long-running struggle with alcoholism and substance abuse. After recovering, she founded, and served as the first chair of, the board of directors of the Betty Ford Center, which provides treatment services for people with substance use disorders. Ford also became involved in causes related to HIV/AIDS. For years after leaving the White House, Ford continued to enjoy great influence and popularity, continuing to rank in the top ten of Gallup&#x27;s annual most admired woman poll every year through 1991.

Ford was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush in 1991. She was also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal as a co-recipient with President Ford in 1998.

==Early life and career==
Ford was born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, the third child and only daughter of Hortense (née Neahr; 1884–1948) and William Stephenson Bloomer Sr. (1874–1934), who was a travelling salesman for Royal Rubber Co. She was called Betty as a child.

Hortense and William married on November 9, 1904, in Chicago. Betty&#x27;s two older brothers were Robert (d. 1971) and William Jr. After the family lived briefly in Denver, Colorado, she grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she graduated from Central High School.

In 1926, when Bloomer was eight years old, her mother, who valued social graces, enrolled her in the Calla Travis Dance Studio in Grand Rapids, where Ford was taught ballet, tap dancing, and modern movement. She developed a passion for dance, and she decided she wanted to pursue a career in the field. At the age of 14, she began modeling clothes and teaching children popular dances, such as the foxtrot, waltz, and big apple, to earn money in the wake of the Great Depression. She worked with children with disabilities at the Mary Free Bed Home for Crippled Children. She studied dance at the Calla Travis Dance Studio, graduating in 1935. While she was still in high school, she started her own dance school, instructing both youth and adults.

Growing up, she was subject to teasing about her surname, with other kids in school calling her &quot;Betty Pants&quot; (a play on &quot;bloomers&quot; being a name for a type of lower-body garment). Bloomer disliked the surname.

When Ford herself began the process of recovering from her own alcoholism, she disclosed to the public that both her father and her brother Bob had suffered from alcoholism as well.

When Bloomer was 16, her father died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the family&#x27;s garage while working under their car, despite the garage doors being open. He died the day before his 60th birthday. It was never confirmed whether his death had been accidental or a suicide. With her father&#x27;s passing, her family lost its primary breadwinner, and her mother began working as a real estate agent to support the family. Her mother&#x27;s actions in the wake of her father&#x27;s passing are said to have been formative for her views in support of equal pay and gender equality.

In 1936, after graduating from high school, Bloomer proposed continuing her study of dance in New York City, but her mother refused on account of the relatively recent loss of her husband. She instead attended the Bennington School of Dance in Bennington, Vermont, for two summers, where she studied under director Martha Hill with choreographers Martha Graham and Hanya Holm. After being accepted by Graham as a student in 1940, Bloomer moved to New York to live in Manhattan&#x27;s Chelsea neighborhood; she worked as a fashion model for the John Robert Powers firm in order to finance her dance studies. She joined Graham&#x27;s auxiliary troupe and eventually performed with the company at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

Bloomer&#x27;s mother was opposed to her pursuing a career in dance and insisted that she return home, and, as a compromise, they agreed that Bloomer would return home for six months and, if she still wanted to return to New York City at the end of that time, her mother would not protest further. Bloomer became immersed in her life in Grand Rapids and did not return to New York. Her mother remarried, to family friend and neighbor Arthur Meigs Godwin, and Bloomer lived with them. She got a job as assistant to the fashion coordinator for Herpolsheimer&#x27;s, a local department store. She also organized her own dance group and taught dance at various sites in Grand Rapids, including the Calla Travis Dance Studio. She further taught ballroom dancing lessons for children with visual impairment and hearing loss and gave weekly dance lessons to African American children.

===Marriage to William G. Warren===
In 1942, Elizabeth Bloomer married William G. Warren, whom she had known since she was 12. At the time they married, Warren worked for his own father in insurance sales. Shortly after they married, he began to sell insurance for another company. He later worked for the Continental Can Company, and after that for the Widdicomb Furniture Company. The couple moved frequently because of his work. At one point, they lived in Toledo, Ohio, where Elizabeth was employed at the department store Lasalle &amp; Koch as a demonstrator, a job that entailed being a model and saleswoman. She worked a production line for a frozen food company in Fulton, New York. When they returned to Grand Rapids, she worked again at Herpolsheimer&#x27;s, this time as the fashion coordinator. She had, three years into the marriage, concluded that their relationship was a failure. She desired to have a family with children and was unhappy with the frequent moves between cities she had experienced in her marriage. Warren was an alcoholic and diabetic, and was in poor health. Shortly after she decided to file for divorce, Warren fell into a coma. She paused her divorce, and supported him, living at Warren&#x27;s family&#x27;s home for the next two years as his health recovered. During these two years, she lived upstairs while he was nursed downstairs. She worked jobs in order to support both herself and Warren. This experience has been credited with further cementing Ford&#x27;s understanding of gender-based income inequalities between individuals doing the same work. After he recovered, they were divorced on September 22, 1947.

===Marriage to Gerald Ford and motherhood===

In August 1947, she was introduced by mutual friends to Gerald Ford, a lawyer and World War II veteran who had just resumed his legal practice after returning from Navy service, and was planning to run for the United States House of Representatives. They married on October 15, 1948, at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids. Gerald Ford was in the middle of his campaign. In the first of adjustments for politics, he had asked her to delay the wedding until shortly before the primary election because, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Jerry was running for Congress and wasn&#x27;t sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer.&quot; For their honeymoon, the two briefly traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they attended a college football game between the Michigan Wolverines and the Northwestern Wildcats, before driving to Owosso, Michigan, to attend a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee Thomas Dewey. The Fords would ultimately be married for the next 58 years, until Gerald Ford&#x27;s death. An anecdote that was later reported was that, when Gerald Ford left Grand Rapids for Washington, D.C., Betty Ford&#x27;s new sister-in-law Janet Ford remarked to her, &quot;with Jerry, you&#x27;ll never have to worry about other women. Your cross will be his work.&quot;


Betty and Gerald Ford had four children together: Michael Gerald Ford (born 1950), John Gardner Ford (nicknamed Jack; born 1952), Steven Meigs Ford (born 1956), and Susan Elizabeth Ford (born 1957).

The Fords lived in Washington, D.C. after his election, until the spring of 1955, when the Fords moved into a house they constructed in the D.C. suburb of Alexandria, Virginia. Gerald Ford had ambitions to rise to the rank of speaker of the house, and therefore maintained a busy travel schedule, regularly crisscrossing the United States to fundraise and campaign on behalf of other Republicans in hopes that they would, in turn, provide him with the support he&#x27;d eventually need to become speaker. This meant that Gerald Ford was away from home for roughly half the year, placing a great burden on Ford to raise their children. As a mother, Ford never spanked or hit her children, believing that there were better, more constructive ways to deal with discipline and punishment.

Ford served as a parent-teacher association member, Sunday school teacher at Immanuel Church-on-the-Hill, and a Cub Scout &quot;den mother&quot;. She regularly drove her children around to their activities, such as her sons&#x27; Little League Baseball games and her daughter&#x27;s dance classes. She was also involved in her husband&#x27;s political career by fulfilling the commitments expected of congressional spouses to help elevate her husband&#x27;s regard among his House colleagues. She accompanied her husband to congressional and White House events, as well as on some trips abroad, and made herself available to newspaper and magazine articles. Ford also posed for newspaper publicity photographs and was a clothing model for charity fashion shows, after a Republican had urged her to do so since they felt that Democratic Party spouses had far outnumbered Republican spouses in such publicity-generating activity. Ford also volunteered for local charitable organizations, including serving as the program director of the Alexandria Cancer Fund Drive. Ford also held active membership in groups such as the 81st Congress Club and National Federation of Republican Women.

Ford&#x27;s busy life took a toll. In 1964, a pinched nerve on the left side of Ford&#x27;s neck sent her to the hospital for two weeks. After her pinched nerve, she began suffering several effects, including muscle spasms, periphrasic neuropathy, numbing the left side of her neck, and arthritis on her shoulder and arm. She would be given prescription medication, including Valium. Ford would ultimately develop an addiction to prescription medication (and would ultimately confront and recover from this addiction in 1978). Ford&#x27;s health problems and the stress of her husband&#x27;s career (which saw him frequently away from their household) compounded, particularly after her husband&#x27;s career became even more demanding after he became House minority leader in January 1965. In 1965, Ford suffered a significant nervous breakdown, erupting in severe crying that had appeared inexplicable to others. This led her to seek psychiatric assistance. Ford had weekly meetings with a psychiatrist approximately between August 1965 and April 1967. Ford received support from her family and managed to resume a busy lifestyle. However, notably, Ford had not yet managed to address her increasing prescription pain medication dependency, which sometimes saw her taking as many as twenty pills in a single day. Nor had she yet addressed her relationship with alcohol, which she, at the time, believed was typical consumption.

Ford accompanied her husband on a trip to mainland China in 1972. That same year, her husband brought up the possibility that he might retire from congress in 1977, which would make the 1974 United States House of Representatives election the last he would run in. This prospect elated Ford. Such talk was due to her husband seeing it as unlikely that he would ever fulfill his ambition of becoming speaker of the House in light of the Republican Party&#x27;s failure to win a majority in the 1972 United States House of Representatives elections.

==Second Lady of the United States (1973–1974)==

Spiro Agnew resigned as vice president on October 10, 1973. Two days later, on October 12, 1973, President Richard Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to serve as vice president. Ford felt an obligation to attend her husband&#x27;s testimony at his confirmation hearings. During his testimony, Gerald Ford was questioned about attending psychiatric care. After this, Betty Ford was transparent with the news media that she had received psychiatric care. She explained that, while her husband had attended two sessions with a psychiatric doctor, those sessions were for her care, and not care of his own. Gerald Ford was confirmed as vice president by the United States Congress on December 6, 1973, and he took the oath of office before a joint session of the United States Congress while placing his hand upon a bible that Betty Ford held. With her husband assuming the office of vice president, Ford became the second lady of the United States.

Before the end of December, Ford played a role in establishing the Republican Women&#x27;s Federal Forum, partnering with Barbara Bush, whose husband George H. W. Bush was chairman of the Republican National Committee at the time. The organization sought to bring together political spouses and female government federal employees to discuss current party activates and ideas about legislation. Ford also, in a television interview with Barbara Walters, expressed her support for the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s Roe v. Wade decision ruling abortion as constitutionally protected. Ford remarked, &quot;I agree with the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling. I think it&#x27;s time to bring abortion out of the backwoods and put it in the hospitals, where it belongs.&quot; Disregarding criticism to her stance, Ford would remark, &quot;Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have said it, but I couldn&#x27;t lie. That&#x27;s the way I feel.&quot;

The media &quot;broke&quot; the story that Ford had a previous marriage and had been divorced, initially reporting it as a secret revelation. However, Ford simply responded by giving the explanation that it was not something that she had tried to hide, but rather, something that she had only neglected to share with the news media because none of them had broached the subject in their previous questions to her. This response proved effective in killing the speculation that she was covering-up her past and earned her some admiration in the media. At one point, Ford disclosed to the public that her husband had previously promised her that he would retire from the House of Representatives in 1976 in order to return to private legal practice and dedicate more time to his family. Ford became overwhelmed by the media attention she received and became somewhat reclusive for a period early into her time as second lady. However, by the spring of 1974, Ford was seen as embracing her position as second lady, becoming less reclusive and more active. Ford would, ultimately, for most of the nine months that she was second lady, be a high-profile public figure.

As she became a more active second lady, Ford adopted an objective of promoting the arts. In April 1974, she made her first official solo trip as second lady when she spent two-days visiting the states of Georgia and Tennessee to help in publicizing the &quot;ARTRAIN&quot;, which was a traveling exhibit of art, visual displays, and performance pieces housed in six railway cars, and which was to travel through small towns across the southern United States. Ford was the most prominent national supporter of the project. Her candor on this trip received a positive reception by the news media. Among those that she met on the two-day trip was Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn. The Carters would ultimately go on to be the Fords&#x27; successors as president and first lady after Jimmy Carter defeated President Ford in the 1976 United States presidential election. On May 31, 1973, Ford made her first major speech when she gave a commencement address to the graduates of the Westminster Choir College. This set a contrast with First Lady Pat Nixon, who routinely rejected invitations to give formal speeches. Ford was also observed to be upgrading her wardrobe, adding designer clothing. In addition to the arts, Ford also gave focus to projects helping the disabled during her time as second lady.

On March 12, 1974, the Fords hosted a state dinner for King Hussein of Jordan after president Nixon, with a week&#x27;s notice, asked Vice President Ford to take over for him in hosting the already-scheduled state dinner. The dinner was held in the John Quincy Adams Drawing Room, one of the Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the United States Department of State headquarters at the Harry S Truman Building.

In June 1974, Ford attended the funeral of Alberta Williams King, the assassinated mother of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Other Nixon administration official figures did not attend, continuing with other obligations. Ford was the only individual in attendance at the funeral not directly ingrained in the civil rights movement or black politics, with the exception of Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. Ford&#x27;s attendance at the funeral was, in actuality, a break from the administration. Ford had believed it to be of great importance for the administration to show an expression of direct concern pertaining to the assassination, while Nixon&#x27;s staff disagreed with her. Ford also broke from the administration in giving her support to the prospect of federally-funded child daycare, which the Nixon administration opposed.

Ford had an extremely busy schedule by July 1974. Magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; were planning to publish spreads on Ford in upcoming issues. With her husband, as vice president, tasked with heavily campaigning on behalf of his party for the 1974 midterm elections, Ford occasionally hit the campaign trail herself. Ford had declared that she would be accompanying her husband at campaign functions, &quot;when he wants me to.&quot; The Fords had planned to make a diplomatic trip to European nations after the midterm elections.

Both Betty and Gerald Ford refused to comment on speculation that President Nixon might be forced out of office due to the Watergate scandal. Ford did indirectly indicate her willingness to step into the role of first lady by affirming that she would make any sacrifices required for her husband to carry out his constitutional obligations, but also opined that it would be traumatic if the nation had to endure a president being forced from office. Ford also publicly expressed admiration and friendship toward First Lady Pat Nixon.

==First Lady of the United States (1974–1977)==
On August 9, 1974, after the resignation of Richard Nixon (who was facing the prospect of likely impeachment and removal from office), Gerald Ford ascended to the position of president of the United States and Betty Ford became the first lady of the United States. As was the case during Gerald Ford&#x27;s vice presidential swearing-in, Betty Ford held the Bible upon which he placed his hand while taking his oath of office. In his remarks at his inauguration, Gerald Ford remarked, &quot;I am indebted to no man and only one woman, my dear wife, Betty, as I begin this very difficult job.&quot;

===Public image, influence, and candor===

At the time her husband assumed the presidency, reporters speculated on what kind of first lady Ford would be, as they thought her predecessor, Pat Nixon, as noted by one reporter, to be the &quot;most disciplined, composed first lady in history.&quot; Ford ultimately became a popular and influential first lady. In the opinion of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and several presidential historians, &quot;Mrs. Ford&#x27;s impact on American culture may be far wider and more lasting than that of her husband, who served a mere 896 days, much of it spent trying to restore the dignity of the office of the president.&quot; She was regarded to be the most politically outspoken first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, whom she regarded as a role model. Active in social policy, Ford broke new ground as a politically active presidential spouse.

Repeatedly speaking out on women&#x27;s issues, Ford was a leader in championing the changing status of women in American society. Ford surprised the media and the public by explicitly supporting a woman&#x27;s right to an abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), and grass roots activism. Ford took these stances despite recognizing that they created a political risk of conservative backlash against her husband. However, not everything Ford did as first lady broke tradition. Ford also enjoyed the traditional role as hostess of the White House and on a daily basis spent most of her energy on the family, health, and serving as a surrogate for her husband on the political campaign trail.

Steinhauer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Ford as &quot;a product and symbol of the cultural and political times—doing the Bump dance along the corridors of the White House, donning a mood ring, chatting on her CB radio with the handle First Mama—a housewife who argued passionately for equal rights for women, a mother of four who mused about drugs, abortion and premarital sex aloud and without regret.&quot; Ford was open about the benefits of psychiatric treatment and spoke understandingly about marijuana use and premarital sex. The &quot;New York News Service&quot; wrote that Ford was, &quot;constitutionally incapable of uttering &#x27;no comment&#x27; or otherwise fudging an answer.&quot; As first lady, remarking on her honest candor and the sometimes-controversial remarks it resulted in, Ford declared, &quot;I am not very good at making up stories.&quot; In another instance, she commented, &quot;it&#x27;s just impossible for me to lie and look someone in the eyes and talk to them. This is my problem.&quot; While President Ford never attempted to silence his wife, some of his senior staff resented her independent candor. Margaret Brown Klapthor later wrote of Ford&#x27;s candor, &quot;she has the self-confidence to express herself with humor and forthrightness whether she speaks to friends, to the press or to a multitude.&quot;
Ford filmed an interview with the television news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; which was broadcast on August 10, 1975. The broadcast of the interview saw strong interest from the public. After the interview aired, a number of Ford&#x27;s remarks in this interview on hot-button issues generated particularly immense media attention. Due to conservative backlash from Ford&#x27;s comments on premarital sex, marijuana use, and abortion in the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, President Ford initially quipped to her that her comments had lost him a large number of votes. However, polling would show that her comments were accepted by many Americans.

In 1975, when &quot;Time&quot; named the &quot;American women&quot; as its &quot;Person of the Year&quot;, the magazine profiled Ford as one of eleven women selected to represent &quot;American women&quot;. That same year, &quot;People&quot; named Ford one of the three most intriguing people in America. In 1977, the World Almanac included Ford in its ranking of the 25 most-influential American women. In January 1976, Ford made a cameo appearance on the popular television program &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

The Fords were among the more openly affectionate first couples in United States history. Neither was shy about their mutual love and equal respect, and they were known to have a strong personal and political partnership. This open affection was evident from the beginning of Gerald Ford&#x27;s presidency. Ford was observed audibly telling her husband &quot;I love you&quot; following a kiss they shared right after he was sworn in as president. Later that day, President Ford was caught momentarily patting Betty&#x27;s buttocks before the press gathered outside of their Virginia residence. Weeks later, when the Fords moved from their Virginia residence into the White House their king size bed was photographed being moved into the White House, which prompted Betty to quip that they had been outed for breaking the tradition of first couples keeping separate bedrooms in the White House. Early into her time in the White House, during a televised tour of the White House, Ford once again noted that she and her husband shared the same bed. In a 1975 interview with &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, Ford remarked that she was asked just about everything, except for how often she and the president had sex. &quot;And if they&#x27;d asked me that I would have told them,&quot; she said, adding that her response would be, &quot;as often as possible.&quot;

====Popularity====
Ford was popular with the American public. Her overall approval rating was, at times, as high as 75%. Ford&#x27;s popularity often was higher than her husband&#x27;s. Ford said, during her husband&#x27;s failed 1976 presidential campaign, &quot;I would give my life to have Jerry have my poll numbers.&quot; This reflects a common trend of American first ladies often being more popular than the presidents to whom they are married.

Ford ranked as one of the top-10 most admired women in the results of Gallup&#x27;s annual most admired man and woman poll every year from 1974 (the year her husband first became president) through 1991, with the exception of Gallup having not conducted such a poll in 1976 (the final full year of her husband&#x27;s presidency). The poll gauges Americans&#x27; most admired men and women without providing respondents any pre-arranged list of names. In 1974, Ford placed second in the poll. She placed first in 1975. In 1977, the year her husband left office, she placed fourth. After her tenure as first lady ended, she would top the poll for a second time in 1978, the year she had established herself as an advocate for people with drug and alcohol dependence. Contrarily to her, while President Ford ranked in the top-10 positions of most admired men in multiple years, he never managed to top it.

In &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;&#x27;s annual readers&#x27; poll of most admired women, Ford placed second in 1974 and first in 1975. By late-1975, Harris found Ford to have established herself as one of America&#x27;s most popular first ladies. In January 1976, the editors of the &quot;New York News Service&quot; wrote that Ford was, &quot;one of the most charming and popular First Ladies ever to occupy the White House&quot;.

====Ranking in Gallup&#x27;s annual poll of &quot;Most Admired Women&quot;====
=====Approval polling=====
===Social policy and political activism===
During her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women&#x27;s rights and was a prominent force in the Women&#x27;s Movement of the 1970s. Her active political role prompted &quot;Time&quot; to call her the country&#x27;s &quot;Fighting First Lady&quot; and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the &quot;American Women&quot; as the magazine&#x27;s 1975 Person of the Year. On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, &quot;would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.&quot;

Ford avidly supported the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. In her September 4, 1974 press conference, Ford declared her support for it. Ford lobbied state legislatures to ratify the amendment, and took on opponents of the amendment. Ford utilized phone calls, letter-writing, and telegrams as means of lobbying in support of the ERA.

Ford was also unapologetically pro-abortion rights. In a 1975 interview with the news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Ford called &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; a &quot;great, great decision&quot;. Ford&#x27;s abortion position differed from the political platform of the Republican Party. For a long time, it was unclear whether Gerald Ford shared his wife&#x27;s pro-abortion rights viewpoint. In December 1999, he told interviewer Larry King that he, too, was pro-abortion rights and had been criticized for that stance by conservative forces within the Republican Party.

Ford successfully lobbied her husband to, in 1975, sign an executive order to establish the National Commission on the Observance of International Women&#x27;s Year. Ford also, unsuccessfully, lobbied her husband to appoint the first woman to the Supreme Court of the United States or as a running mate in the 1976 election. Ford took personal credit for the appointment of Carla Anderson Hills as secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

In May 1975, during a four-day trip, Ford met with former Prime Minister of the Republic of Vietnam Nguyễn Cao Kỳ to discuss Southeast Asian refugees. Afterwards, Ford stated she was impressed with the conduct of the refugees.

Ford&#x27;s involvement in political issues received some conservative criticism. Phyllis Schlafly accused Ford of acting improperly by intervening in state affairs. Some women protested Ford&#x27;s lobbying for the ERA by carrying placards outside of the White House reading &quot;Betty Ford, Get Off the Phone&quot;. On June 30, 1976, Ford attended the opening of &quot;Remember the Ladies&quot;, a Revolutionary War-era women&#x27;s exhibit. She drew boos from demonstrators against the Equal Rights Amendment in stating, &quot;This exhibit about neglected Americans should give us strength and courage to seek equal rights for women today.&quot;

===Health and breast cancer awareness===


Weeks after Ford became first lady, she underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer on September 28, 1974, after having been diagnosed with the disease. Ford decided to be open about her illness because &quot;There had been so much cover-up during Watergate that we wanted to be sure there would be no cover-up in the Ford administration.&quot; Her openness about her cancer and treatment raised the visibility of a disease that Americans had previously been reluctant to talk about.

Adding to heightened public awareness of breast cancer were reports that several weeks after Ford&#x27;s cancer surgery, Happy Rockefeller, the wife of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, also had a mastectomy. The spike in women self-examining after Ford went public with the diagnosis led to an increase in reported cases of breast cancer, a phenomenon known as the &quot;Betty Ford blip&quot;.

After her mastectomy, Ford received chemotherapy treatments and saw regular checkups. White House Physician William M. Lukash claimed in a March 1975 statement that Ford was suffering no side effects from her chemotherapy.

In March 1975, Ford temporarily cut back her schedule after suffering a flareup of her chronic arthritis.

===The arts===
As First Lady, Ford was an advocate of the arts. She successfully lobbied her husband to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to choreographer and dancer Martha Graham in 1976. She received an award from Parsons The New School for Design in recognition of her style.

===State dinners===

Despite the brevity of her husband&#x27;s presidency (roughly two and a half years), he hosted 33 state dinners, the fifth most state dinners of any United States president. The first of these came only a week into Ford&#x27;s presidency, hosting King Hussein of Jordan on August 16, 1974. Once she became first lady, it fell to Ford to arrange this already-scheduled dinner. She found out of this upcoming dinner and her responsibility for planning it through a phone call she received within 24-hours after her husband&#x27;s swearing-in as president. As previously mentioned, the Fords had hosted a state dinner for King Hussein months earlier, during Gerald Ford&#x27;s vice presidency, on March 12, 1974, after president Nixon asked then-Vice President Ford to take over for him in hosting a planned dinner for the King. At the first state dinner that she arranged as first lady, Ford revived dancing as an activity of White House state dinners. The Nixons had previously removed dancing from the state dinners during Nixon&#x27;s presidency. At the state dinners of the Ford presidency, the president and first lady always led off the dancing, and dancing often lasted beyond midnight.

The Fords opted to have eclectic array of guests at their state dinners, including notable celebrities from the entertainment industry. The Fords&#x27; children often also attended the dinners they hosted.

During their final year in the White House, the Fords hosted eleven state dinners. This large number of state dinners was, in part, due to great interest from foreign dignitaries in visiting the United States for a state dinner amid the United States Bicentennial celebrations. Ford made the decision that year to erect a tent in the White House Rose Garden to host dinners outside. For state dinners held using this tent, the receptions, entertainment, and dancing portions of the evenings were still held inside of the White House.

Among the most notable state dinners the Fords hosted was a July 7, 1976 state dinner honoring Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. This dinner was part of the American bicentennial celebrations, and was held in tent on the South Lawn of the White House.

Of the state dinners she planned, Ford said, &quot;From the beginning, Jerry and I tried to make the White House a place where people could have fun and enjoy themselves. Most of all we wanted the state dinners to express the very best about America, particularly during the bicentennial year.&quot;

Dishes that Ford particularly liked serving at state dinners included wild rice, Columbia River salmon, soufflé, and flambé. The state dinners that Ford planned as first lady made a deliberate effort to showcase American ingredients. By late 1974, Ford had shifted to exclusively serving wine that was American-cultivated at state dinners. The November 12, 1974 state dinner for Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky saw the first instance in which a wine from the Fords&#x27; home state of Michigan was served at a White House state dinner, with wine from the Tabor Hill Winery being served. It was not until 2016, during the presidency of Barack Obama, that a Michigan wine would again be served at a White House state dinner.

===Diplomatic trips===
Ford accompanied her husband abroad on several diplomatic trips. Among the nations that Ford accompanied her husband to were China, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia.

Ford did not take any solo trips abroad as first lady. She is the most recent first lady not to have done so. The first instance of a first lady conducting one had been Eleanor Roosevelt in 1942. Ford&#x27;s recent predecessor Lady Bird Johnson was among other first ladies that did not conduct solo trips abroad.

During the Fords&#x27; 1976 trip to mainland China, when being shown an exhibition by a Chinese arts college dance group, Ford decided to join the dancers. Photos of this moment were published widely in the American press, resulting in Betty Ford somewhat upstaging President Ford in the press.

===Philanthropic causes===
Ford supported numerous charities as first lady. Ford assisted in fundraising for the little-known Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, D.C., whose patients were predominantly African American. She also fundraised for No Greater Love, in appreciation of its work benefiting Children of Vietnam War MIA and POWs. She served as the honorary president of the National Lupus Foundation, regarding lupus as a disease which impacted women, yet received minimal public attention. Her philanthropic support additionally placed a specific focus on charities serving children with special needs.

===Role in the 1976 presidential campaign===
In November 1975, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ford&#x27;s husband&#x27;s advisors, who had previously worried her outspoken comments would hurt him in the 1976 presidential election, were now recognizing her popularity and desiring for her to have a greater role in the campaign. Ford ultimately played an important role in the 1976 election campaign. Ford made campaign appearances and delivered speeches across the United States.

Ford was also used, both by Ford supporters and detractors, as a symbol of liberal Republicanism, with her politics contrasting with the Republican Party&#x27;s conservative and moderate wings.

During the campaign, many Ford supporters wore campaign buttons with phrases like &quot;Betty&#x27;s Husband for President in &#x27;76&quot; and &quot;Keep Betty in the White House&quot;. The use of Ford in such a manner to promote her husband&#x27;s candidacy was not the work of the campaign itself, but rather, produced by supporters outside of the campaign organization. The campaigns of the previous three presidents that sought election to an additional term (Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon) had needed to manufacture campaign publicity involving their first ladies (Mamie Eisenhower, Lady Bird Johnson, and Pat Nixon). In contrast, there was tremendous organic excitement for Betty Ford among supporters of the campaign.

Ford campaigned actively both during primary elections and the general election. A contrast was publicly drawn between Ford and Nancy Reagan, the wife of Ford&#x27;s primary election challenger Ronald Reagan. Reagan had contrasting views on issues such as drug experimentation by teenagers and the Equal Rights Amendment (which she opposed passing). Many of Ford&#x27;s views were aligned-with, or even more liberal than, Rosalynn Carter, the wife of Ford&#x27;s Democratic general election opponent Jimmy Carter.

During the primaries, Ford recorded radio advertisements on behalf of the campaign that were broadcast in New Hampshire. She also traveled to Iowa before its caucus, and delivered a speech on behalf of the president (who had been unable to make his planned appearance) in which she labeled herself as being his political partner. The campaign made a deliberate effort, ahead of the 1976 Republican National Convention, of sending Ford to liberal and moderate-leaning states and not more conservative states in the western and southern United States.

Between Labor Day and election day, for the general election campaign, Ford conducted multi-stop speaking tours, during which she visited western states (including California, Colorado, Texas, and Utah) as well was northern midwest states including Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

The heavy campaigning placed a strain on Ford&#x27;s health. During the general election, her busy campaign activity saw the reigniting of her pinched nerve. However, even after this, Ford continued with her planned campaign schedule.

After Gerald Ford&#x27;s defeat by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election, she delivered her husband&#x27;s concession speech because he had lost his voice while campaigning. The speech was delivered on the day after the election. This is the only time that a major United States presidential candidate&#x27;s spouse has delivered their concession on their behalf.

After her husband&#x27;s narrow defeat, there was some anecdotal speculation that Ford may have both have helped to alienate conservative Republicans from voting for her husband and at the same time helped attract him support from liberal and moderate Republicans, Democrats, and independents.

===Departure from the White House===

During the period after the election, Ford postponed scheduled plans to give her slated successor, Rosalynn Carter, a tour of the White House. Unknown to Carter at the time, this was likely due to Ford&#x27;s fragility caused by her prescription drug abuse. When Ford attempted to postpone the plans a second time, President-elect Carter called the White House and threatened to make a fuss in the news if the tour was not held as planned. Ford capitulated and gave a brief, but cordial, tour of the White House to Rosalynn Carter on November 22, 1976, coinciding with President-elect Carter&#x27;s White House meeting with President Ford.

On January 19, 1977, her last full day as first lady, Betty Ford used her training as a Martha Graham dancer to jump up on the Cabinet Room table. White House photographer David Hume Kennerly took a photo of her on the table. Gerald Ford did not know about or see the photo until 1994. A Ford family friend said that President Ford &quot;about fell off his chair&quot; when he saw the photo for the first time. The photo was subsequently published and is regarded as an &quot;iconic&quot; photograph of Ford&#x27;s time as First Lady. Kennerly has touted the image as both capturing Ford&#x27;s personality and being a symbolic image showing the feminist first lady posing in what had been a space occupied predominantly by white men.

==Post–White House life and career==
After leaving the White House in 1977, Ford continued to lead an active public life. In addition to founding the Betty Ford Center, she remained active in women&#x27;s issues, taking on numerous speaking engagements and lending her name to charities for fundraising. Many of Ford&#x27;s most significant contributions as an activist came following the Fords&#x27; departure from the White House.

In 1977, the Fords moved to Rancho Mirage, California.

In March 1977, Ford signed with NBC News to appear in two news specials within the following two years and to serve as a contributor to &quot;Today&quot;, and jointly signed a publishing deal alongside her husband to for their forthcoming memoirs. In June 1977, Ford was a speaker at the Arthritis Association Convention. In September of that year, Ford traveled to Moscow for a television program taping and to serve as hostess for &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. In November 1977, Ford appeared at the opening session of the National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston, Texas.

===Recovery from alcoholism and prescription drug addiction ===
Ford had suffered from a dependency on prescription medication and from alcoholism prior even to her husband&#x27;s presidency. Ford had, particularly, become addicted to prescription medication (opioid analgesics) that she had been originally prescribed in the early 1960s to treat a pinched nerve. Ford took doses of this medication in excess of her prescription. In her 1987 memoir she reflected on these addictions, writing, &quot;I liked alcohol, it made me feel warm. And I loved pills. They took away my tension and my pain&quot;. The fact that Ford had, for years, been given tranquilizers to treat a pinched nerve in her neck was public knowledge as far back as her time as second lady. During her time as first lady, there had even been some private speculation that Ford might have been suffering from substance abuse, as her friends and members of the press had observed occasional slurred speech from Ford.

After the Fords left the White House, her addictions became more evident to her family and appeared life-threatening. On April 1, 1978, her family staged an intervention. In order to be at Betty Ford&#x27;s intervention, President Ford had made last minute cancellations of numerous appearances that he had been scheduled to make on the East Coast. In making these cancellations, the former president cited &quot;personal and family reasons&quot;. The intervention forced Betty Ford to acknowledge the negative impact that her addiction was having on her health and family relationships. She agreed that day to detox from her medicine. She also, ultimately, agreed to attend rehab at the Naval Regional Medical Center in Long Beach, California. Ford registered herself at the hospital on April 11, 1978.

As she had previously been with her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, Ford was transparent with the public about her addictions and admittance to rehab. Ford&#x27;s transparency was praised by experts in drug abuse treatment, who predicted that it would make a major and positive impact. The week she entered rehab, Ford disclosed her addiction to prescription medication. Days later, Ford also disclosed to the public that she had come to realize that she was additionally an alcoholic. She disclosed her alcoholism through a statement that a family spokesman read on her behalf at a press conference (at which Ford was not herself present) held outside of the hospital. In this statement, Ford disclosed, &quot;I have found I am not only addicted to the medication I have been taking for my arthritis, but also to alcohol&quot;. In this statement, she also praised the reputation of the hospital&#x27;s addiction treatment program, and declared her pleasure to have the opportunity to attend the treatment. The statement also declared, &quot;I expect this treatment and fellowship to be a solution for my problems. I embrace it, not only for me, but all the many others who are here to participate.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Ford&#x27;s disclosure of alcoholism came as a surprise to a number of Ford&#x27;s close friends, who had regarded her as merely a social drinker and were oblivious to her drinking problem.

Ford succeeded in getting sober. She published her first memoir, &quot;The Times of My Life&quot;, later in 1978 in which she discussed her battle with addiction.

During a January 1984 address in Michigan to a crowd of individuals who were in the early stages of alcohol and drug dependency treatment, Ford reflected that the six years since she began her treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, &quot;have been the best years in my life from the standpoint of feeling healthier and feeling more comfortable with myself&quot;.

===The Betty Ford Center===

In 1982, after recovering from her own addictions, Ford established the Betty Ford Center (initially called the Betty Ford Clinic) in Rancho Mirage, California. Its mission specializes in the treatment of chemical dependency, including treating the children of alcoholics. She partnered with her friend Ambassador Leonard Firestone to found it. She served as chair of the board of directors. She also co-authored with Chris Chase a book about her treatment, &quot;&quot; (1987). In 2003, Ford produced another book, &quot;Healing and Hope: Six Women from the Betty Ford Center Share Their Powerful Journeys of Addiction and Recovery&quot;. In 2005, Ford relinquished her chair of the center&#x27;s board of directors to her daughter Susan. She had held the top post at the center since its founding.

Barbara Bush, a later first lady, opined that Ford, after discovering she was dependent on drugs, &quot;transformed her pain into something great for the common good. Because she suffered, there will be more healing. Because of her grief, there will be more joy.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s movement===
Ford continued to be an active leader and activist of the feminist movement after the Ford administration. She continued to strongly advocate and lobby politicians and state legislatures for passage of the ERA. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Ford to the second National Commission on the Observance of International Women&#x27;s Year (the first had been appointed by President Ford). That same year, she joined First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson and Rosalynn Carter to open and participate in the National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston, Texas, where she endorsed measures in the convention&#x27;s National Plan of Action, a report sent to the state legislatures, the U.S. Congress, and the President on how to improve the status of American women. Ford continued to be an outspoken supporter of equal pay for women, breast cancer awareness, and the ERA throughout her life. She was an active member of the Junior League.

Ford continued to advocate for the ratification of the ERA. In November 1977, Ford and First Lady Rosalynn Carter joined to advocate for its ratification at the National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston. In 1978, the deadline for ratification of the ERA was extended from 1979 to 1982, resulting largely from a march of a hundred thousand people on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The march was led by prominent feminist leaders, including Ford, Bella Abzug, Elizabeth Chittick, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. In 1981, Eleanor Smeal, the National Organization for Women&#x27;s president, announced Ford&#x27;s appointment to be the co-chair, with Alan Alda, of the ERA Countdown Campaign. In November 1981, Ford stated that Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson had not done enough in support of the ERA as well as her disappointment with First Lady Nancy Reagan not being in favor of the measure, though also relayed her hopes to change the incumbent First Lady&#x27;s mind in further encounters with her. As the deadline approached, Ford led marches, parades and rallies for the ERA with other feminists, including First Daughter Maureen Reagan and various Hollywood actors. Ford was credited with rejuvenating the ERA movement and inspiring more women to continue working for the ERA. She visited states, including Illinois, where ratification was believed to have the most realistic chance of passing. On October 12, 1981, Ford spoke in support of the ERA on a rally held at the National Mall. The amendment did not receive enough states&#x27; ratification. In 2004, Ford reaffirmed her pro-abortion rights stance and her support for the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade,&quot; as well as her belief in and support for the ratification of the ERA.

===Other matters===
Ford involved herself with the American Cancer Society and the Arthritis Foundation.

Decades later, in his 2014 memoir, television producer Norman Lear revealed that in the late-1970s Ford had played a significant role in helping to persuade television executives to purchase the syndication rights to the series &quot;Maude&quot;, of which she was an avid viewer. He wrote that, at his request, Ford had attended the National Association of Television Program Executives convention and spoke to executives about her love of the series to help pique their interest in the series.

Ford tackled the stigmatized issue of HIV/AIDS during the HIV/AIDS crisis. Through the work she did at the Betty Ford Center, Ford recognized the link between drug abuse and AIDS. She involved herself in the Los Angeles AIDS Project. In 1985, Ford received the Los Angeles AIDS Projects &quot;Commitment to Life Award&quot;. Her acceptance speech spoke hopefully of the prospect that attitudes towards HIV/AIDS would shift, being de-stigmatized as cancer and alcoholism had (in part due to her contribution). When she attended the 1992 Republican National Convention, Ford wore an AIDS ribbon pin.

Ford supported gay and lesbian causes, speaking against discrimination in the United States military. In 1993, Ford was quoted as speaking against existing bans on gays serving in the military, remarking, 

In 1985, Ford received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an annual award given by the Jefferson Awards. That same year, Ford received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. This was formally presented to her by President Ford, who was an Academy Awards Council member.

In 1987, Ford underwent quadruple coronary bypass surgery and recovered without complications.

In the early 1990s, Ford voiced admiration for First Lady Hillary Clinton and praised her for taking an active role in policy within her husband&#x27;s administration by leading the Clinton health care plan

In 1987, Ford was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. On November 18, 1991, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush. In 1999, she and President Ford were jointly awarded Congressional Gold Medals. That same year, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her and her husband. In 2000, the Lasker Foundation awarded Ford its annual Mary Woodard Lasker Public Service Award. On May 8, 2003, Ford received the Woodrow Wilson Award in Los Angeles for her public service, awarded by the Woodrow Wilson Center of the Smithsonian Institution.

During her and President Ford&#x27;s later years together, they resided in Rancho Mirage and in Beaver Creek, Colorado. President Ford died, aged 93, of heart failure on December 26, 2006, at their Rancho Mirage home. Despite her advanced age frail physical condition, Ford traveled across the country and took part in the funeral events in California, Washington, D.C., and Michigan. Following her husband&#x27;s death, Ford continued to live in Rancho Mirage. Poor health and increasing frailty due to operations in August 2006 and April 2007 for blood clots in her legs caused her to largely curtail her public life. Ill health prevented Ford from attending the funeral of former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s in July 2007, and her daughter Susan Ford Bales instead represented her at the funeral service.

==Death and funeral==

Betty Ford died of natural causes on July 8, 2011, three months after her 93rd birthday, at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage. Ford left $500,000 to the Betty Ford Center.

Funeral services were held in Palm Desert, California, on July 12, 2011, with more than 800 people in attendance, including former president George W. Bush, then-first lady Michelle Obama, then-U.S secretary of state Hillary Clinton, herself a former first lady, former first ladies Rosalynn Carter, who gave a eulogy, and Nancy Reagan.

On July 14, a second service was held at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, with eulogies given by Lynne Cheney, former Ford Museum director Richard Norton Smith, and Ford&#x27;s son Steven. In attendance were former president Bill Clinton, former vice president Dick Cheney and former first lady Barbara Bush. In her remarks, Mrs. Cheney noted that July 14 would have been Gerald Ford&#x27;s 98th birthday. After the service, Betty Ford was buried next to her husband on the museum grounds.

In July 2018, a statue of Ford was unveiled outside of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

==Historical assessments==
According to John Robert Greene:
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has conducted occasional surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Ford has consistently ranked among the top-nine most highly assessed first ladies in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Ford has been ranked:
*6th-best of 42 in 1982
*9th-best of 37 in 1993
*8th-best of 38 in 2003
*7th-best of 38 in 2008
*8th-best of 39 in 2014
*6th-best of 40 in 2020

The 2008 Siena Research Institute survey ranked Ford the 5th-highest of the twenty 20th and 21st century First Ladies. The 2008 survey also ranked Ford the 5th-highest in their assessment of first ladies who were &quot;their own women&quot; as well as 5th-highest in courage. In both the 1993 and 2003 Siena Research Institute surveys, Ford was similarly ranked the 5th-highest in historians&#x27; assessment of first ladies&#x27; courage. In the 2014 Siena Research Institute survey, historians ranked Ford 3rd-highest among 20th and 21st century First Ladies in the greatness of post-White House service, 3rd-highest in advancement of women&#x27;s issues, and 4th-highest in creating a lasting legacy. In the 2014 Siena Research Institute survey, Ford and her husband were ranked the 19th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

In 2021, Zogby Analytics conducted a poll in which a sample of the American public was asked to assess the greatness of twelve First Ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy onwards. The American public ranked Ford as the eighth-greatest among these first ladies.

==Cultural depictions==
Ford&#x27;s life is the focus of the 1987 ABC biographical television film &quot;The Betty Ford Story&quot;, which has a story adapted from her memoir &quot;The Times of My Life&quot;. Gena Rowlands won both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Ford. Ford is 1 of 3 former first ladies whose lives are the focus of Showtime&#x27;s series &quot;The First Lady&quot;, in which she is portrayed by Kristine Froseth and Michelle Pfeiffer.

Ford was among among the many celebrities featured on the cover art of the 1978 comic book &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

<doc id="290195" wikidata="Q434706" url="?curid=290195" title="Elizabeth Warren">
<text>Elizabeth Ann Warren (née Herring; born June 22, 1949) is an American politician and former law professor who is the senior United States senator from Massachusetts, serving since 2013. A member of the Democratic Party and regarded as a progressive, Warren has focused on consumer protection, equitable economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third after Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

Born and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School at Rutgers University–Newark and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.

Warren&#x27;s first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama.

In 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She was reelected by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election. She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday. She was reelected to a third Senate term in 2024 against Republican nominee John Deaton.
== Early life and education ==
Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949. She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker, and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church. Warren has described her early family life as teetering &quot;on the ragged edge of the middle class&quot; and &quot;kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.&quot; She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.

Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work. After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building. Eventually, the family&#x27;s car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt&#x27;s restaurant.

Warren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16. She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert &quot;Jim&quot; Warren, whom she had met in high school.

Warren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM. She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology.

The Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia. After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled at Rutgers Law School. She received her Juris Doctor in 1976 and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter. Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.

==Career==
In 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school. During law school, she worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. After receiving her Juris Doctor and passing the bar examination, Warren offered legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.

In the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance. She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s.

===Academic===

Warren began her career in academia as a lecturer at Rutgers University, Newark School of Law (1977–1978). She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978–1983), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987 and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school.

Warren&#x27;s earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the &quot;Notre Dame Law Review&quot;, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted. But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law. According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families&#x27; attempts to buy homes in good school districts. Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book &quot;As We Forgive Our Debtors&quot; in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as &quot;worse than disillusionment&quot; and &quot;like being shocked at a deep-down level&quot;. In 2004, she published an article in the &quot;Washington University Law Review&quot; in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.

Warren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as the Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996, she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions. , she was Harvard&#x27;s only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university. Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009, Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields.

Warren began to rise in prominence in 2004 with an appearance on the Dr. Phil show, and published several books including &quot;The Two-Income Trap&quot;.

===Advisory roles===
In 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission&#x27;s chair, former congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren&#x27;s during their school years. She helped draft the commission&#x27;s report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers&#x27; right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers&#x27; ability to file for bankruptcy.

From 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion. She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law, a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Warren&#x27;s scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.

===TARP oversight===
On November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate majority leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs. During Warren&#x27;s tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.

===Consumer Financial Protection Bureau===

Warren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency&#x27;s director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau&#x27;s first director, in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators&#x27; objections.

===Political affiliation===
A close high-school friend told &quot;Politico&quot; in 2019 that in high school Warren was a &quot;diehard conservative&quot; and that she had since done a &quot;180-degree turn and an about-face&quot;. One of her colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin said that at university in the early 1980s Warren was &quot;sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude&quot;. Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he &quot;almost fell off [his] chair... She&#x27;s definitely changed&quot;. Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996 and voted Republican for many years. &quot;I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets&quot;, she has said. But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford.

Warren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed neither should dominate. According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer &quot;principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets&quot; and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.

==U.S. Senate (2013–present)==


===Elections===
====2012====

On September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate. Republican Scott Brown had won the seat in a 2010 special election after Ted Kennedy&#x27;s death. A week later, a video of Warren speaking in Andover went viral on the Internet. In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is &quot;class warfare&quot; by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society:

President Obama later echoed her sentiments in a 2012 election campaign speech.
Warren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates. She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented that &quot;no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren&quot;. Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win&quot;.

Warren received a prime-time speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that &quot;has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered&quot;. According to Warren, &quot;People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here&#x27;s the painful part: They&#x27;re right. The system is rigged.&quot; Warren said Wall Street CEOs &quot;wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs&quot; and that they &quot;still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them&quot;.

====2018====

On January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, writing, &quot;The people of Massachusetts didn&#x27;t send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.&quot;

In the 2018 election, Warren defeated Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, 60% to 36%.

====2024====
Warren won a third Senate term, defeating Republican nominee John Deaton, an attorney, 59.6% to 40.4%. This election marked the first time that Warren had lost Bristol County while running for the office. Warren underperformed Kamala Harris, who won the state by 25 points in the concurrent presidential election, as well as every county.

===Tenure===
On November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts, as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 women senators in office, which was the most in Senate history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry. Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.

At Warren&#x27;s first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, &quot;I&#x27;m really concerned that &#x27;too big to fail&#x27; has become &#x27;too big for trial&#x27;.&quot; Videos of Warren&#x27;s questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days. At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: &quot;If you&#x27;re caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you&#x27;re going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.&quot;

In May 2013, Warren sent letters to the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court. Also in May, saying that students should get &quot;the same great deal that banks get&quot;, Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%. Independent senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill, saying: &quot;The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn&#x27;t&quot;. By the following year, Warren&#x27;s attempts to pass any student loan reform were blocked.

During the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016.
In early 2015, President Obama urged Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement between the United States and 11 Asian and South American countries. Warren criticized the TPP, arguing that the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement and labor protections for American workers therein were insufficient; her objections were in turn criticized by Obama.

Saying &quot;despite the progress we&#x27;ve made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy&quot;, in July 2015 Warren, John McCain, Maria Cantwell, and Angus King reintroduced the 21st Century Glass–Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer&#x27;s risk in the financial system and the likelihood of future financial crises.

In a September 20, 2016, hearing, Warren called on Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to resign, adding that he should be &quot;criminally investigated&quot; over Wells Fargo&#x27;s opening of two million checking and credit-card accounts without the customers&#x27; consent.

In December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;a high-profile perch on one of the chamber&#x27;s most powerful committees&quot; that would &quot;fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president&quot;.

During the debate on Senator Jeff Sessions&#x27;s nomination for United States attorney general in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter Coretta Scott King had written Senator Strom Thurmond in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship. King wrote, &quot;Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.&quot; Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated Senate Rule 19, which prohibits impugning another senator&#x27;s character. This prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions&#x27;s nomination, and Warren instead read King&#x27;s letter while streaming live online. In rebuking Warren, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor, &quot;She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.&quot; McConnell&#x27;s language became a slogan for Warren and others.

On October 3, 2017, during Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy J. Sloan&#x27;s appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Warren called on him to resign, saying, &quot;At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.&quot;

On July 17, 2019, Warren and Representative Al Lawson introduced legislation that would make low-income college students eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to the College Student Hunger Act of 2019.

In November 2020, Warren was named a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury in the Biden Administration.

Warren was at the Capitol to participate in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the Capitol. She called it an &quot;attempted coup and act of insurrection egged on by a corrupt president to overthrow our democracy&quot;, and the perpetrators &quot;domestic terrorists.&quot; The day after the attack, Warren joined the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation to call for Trump&#x27;s immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment.

Warren was rated among the top 10 most popular senators in an April 2024 poll by Morning Consult.

===Role in the 2016 presidential election===

In the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election, supporters put Warren forward as a possible presidential candidate, but she repeatedly said she would not run for president in 2016. In October 2013, she joined the other 15 women Democratic senators in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person short list to be Clinton&#x27;s running mate. Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.

Until her June endorsement, Warren was neutral during the Democratic primary but made public statements that she was cheering Bernie Sanders on. In June, Warren endorsed and campaigned for Clinton. She called Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, dishonest, uncaring, and &quot;a loser&quot;.

==2020 presidential campaign==
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on September 29, 2018, Warren said she would &quot;take a hard look&quot; at running for president in the 2020 election after the 2018 United States elections concluded. On December 31, 2018, Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president.

On February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike. A longtime critic of President Trump, Warren called him a &quot;symptom of a larger problem [that has resulted in] a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else&quot;.

Warren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including working class families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government:

Following her candidacy announcement, Warren became known for the number and depth of her policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, several proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, a plan to utilize economic patriotism, and plans to address opioid addiction. One of her signature plans was a wealth tax, dubbed the &quot;Ultra-Millionaire Tax&quot;, on fortunes over $50 million. Warren was credited with popularizing the idea of a wealth tax with Americans, leading competitor Bernie Sanders to release a wealth tax plan. &quot;I have a plan for that&quot; began to develop as a catchphrase for Warren&#x27;s campaign, and her campaign store began selling merchandise displaying the phrase.

After the ninth debate of the 2020 Democratic primaries, on February 19, Warren received considerable media coverage for her scolding of fellow candidate Mike Bloomberg. She criticized Bloomberg&#x27;s non-transparent tax records, recently publicized claims of misogyny and sexism toward women, and history of redlining poor neighborhoods. Warren then pressed Bloomberg about the non-disclosure agreements some of female associates are bound by, demanding they be nullified so that the women could come forward and share their experiences.

After several defeats at the polls, including a third-place finish in Massachusetts&#x27;s Democratic primary, Warren ended her campaign on March 5, 2020.

===Polls===

In early June 2019, Warren placed second in some polls, with Joe Biden in first place and Bernie Sanders in third. In the following weeks her poll numbers steadily increased, and a September Iowa poll placed her in the lead with 22% to Biden&#x27;s 20%. The Iowa poll also rated the number of voters at least considering voting for each candidate; Warren scored 71% to Biden&#x27;s 60%. Poll respondents also gave her a higher &quot;enthusiasm&quot; rating, with 32% of her backers extremely enthusiastic to Biden&#x27;s 22%.

An October 24 Quinnipiac poll placed Warren in the lead at 28%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 15%. When asked which candidate had the best policy ideas, 30% of respondents named Warren, with Sanders at 20% and Biden 15%. Sanders was most often named as the candidate who &quot;cares most about people like you,&quot; with Warren in second place and Biden third. Sanders also placed first at 28% when respondents were asked which candidate was the most honest, followed by Warren and Biden at 15% each.

===Funding===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that of the front-runners in the presidential race, only Sanders and Warren have previously won an election with almost exclusively small online contributions, and that no presidential primary in recent history has had two of the top three candidates refuse to use bundlers or hold private fundraisers with wealthy donors.

In January 2019, Warren said that she took no PAC money. In October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.

In the third quarter of 2019, Warren&#x27;s campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders&#x27;s campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million. Warren&#x27;s average donation was $26; Sanders&#x27;s was $18.

In February 2020, Warren began accepting support from Super PACs, after failing to convince other Democratic presidential candidates to join her in disavowing them.

===Public appearances===
As of September 2019, Warren had attended 128 town halls. She is known for remaining afterward to talk with audience members and for the large numbers of selfies she has taken with them. On September 17, over 20,000 people attended a Warren rally at New York City&#x27;s Washington Square Park. After her speech long lines formed with people waiting as long as four hours for selfies.

Due to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Warren was unable to make final campaign stops in person and opted to send her dog Bailey to meet with voters in Iowa.

===Vice-presidential speculation===
In June 2020, CNN reported that Warren was among the top four vice-presidential choices for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, along with Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Representative Val Demings, and Senator Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris was officially announced as Biden&#x27;s running mate on August 11, 2020. On August 13, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Warren was one of Biden&#x27;s four finalists along with Harris, Susan Rice, and Gretchen Whitmer.

In late April, CNBC reported that big-money donors were pressuring Biden not to choose Warren, preferring other candidates purportedly on his list, such as Harris, Whitmer, and Amy Klobuchar.

== Personal life ==
Warren and her first husband divorced in 1978, and two years later, Warren married law professor Bruce H. Mann on July 12, 1980, but kept her first husband&#x27;s surname. Warren has three grandchildren through her daughter Amelia.

On April 23, 2020, Warren announced on Twitter that her eldest brother, Don Reed Herring, had died of COVID-19 two days earlier. On October 1, 2021, she announced that her brother, John Herring, had died of cancer.

As of 2019, according to Forbes Magazine, Warren&#x27;s net worth was $12 million.

==Political positions==


Warren is widely regarded as a progressive. In 2012, the British magazine &quot;New Statesman&quot; named Warren among the &quot;top 20 U.S. progressives&quot;.

Warren supports worker representation on corporations&#x27; board of directors, breaking up monopolies, stiffening sentences for white-collar crime, a Medicare for All plan to provide health insurance for all Americans, and a higher minimum wage.

Warren was highly critical of the Trump administration. She expressed concerns over what she says were Trump&#x27;s conflicts of interest. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017. Warren was highly critical of Trump&#x27;s immigration policies. In 2018, she called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Warren has criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in support of Yemen&#x27;s government against the Houthis. In January 2019, Warren criticized Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She agreed that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a &quot;coordinated&quot; plan formed with U.S. allies.

In April 2019, after reading the Mueller report, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, &quot;The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.&quot;

After the June 24, 2022, ruling in which the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Warren wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed requesting that President Biden unblock &quot;critical resources and authority that states and the federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health services&quot;.

In 2022, Warren voted to advance legislation to codify same-sex marriage into federal law by voting for the Respect for Marriage Act.

On March 13, 2023, Warren presented a detailed analysis of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023, and provided possible solutions to avoid further bank failures, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Warren supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict. In March 2024, she was one of 19 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Biden administration urging the U.S. to recognize a &quot;nonmilitarized&quot; Palestinian state after the war in Gaza.

==Ancestry and Native American claims==
According to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had some Native American ancestry. In 2012, she said that &quot;being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born&quot;. In 1984, Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as Cherokee. Warren is not a part of any native tribes and does not hold any tribal citizenship.

During Warren&#x27;s first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that she had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren&#x27;s ancestry in several attack ads. Warren has denied that her alleged heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career. Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring. From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as &quot;American Indian&quot; on a State Bar of Texas write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was &quot;no indication it was used for professional advancement&quot;. A 2018 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; investigation found that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession, and concluded there was &quot;clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools&quot;, and that &quot;Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her&quot;. In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American.

Throughout his first presidency, president Donald Trump mocked Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry, and pejoratively called her &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. At a July 2018 Montana rally, he promised that if he debated Warren, he would pay $1 million to her favorite charity if she took a DNA test and &quot;it shows you&#x27;re an Indian&quot;. In October 2018, Warren released an analysis of a DNA test by geneticist Carlos D. Bustamante that found her ancestry to be mostly European but &quot;strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor&quot;, likely &quot;in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago&quot;. According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, this puts Warren somewhere between 1/64 and 1/1024 (0.09% to 1.5%) Native American. Other geneticists, while not disputing the test&#x27;s validity, found the underlying science &quot;flawed&quot; due to the lack of Native Americans in the United States in the database. Geneticists Krystal Tsosie and Matthew Anderson called the interpretation of the test &quot;problematic&quot;, citing, among other reasons, &quot;Warren&#x27;s motives, and the genetic variants informing the comparison&quot;. They added: &quot;because Bustamante used Indigenous individuals from Central and South America as a reference group to compare Warren&#x27;s DNA, we believe he should have stated only that Warren potentially had an &#x27;Indigenous&#x27; ancestor 6-10 generations ago, not conclusively a &#x27;Native American&#x27; one. The distinction might seem hypercritical to most, but to the sovereign tribal nations of the United States it&#x27;s an important one.&quot;

After publicizing Bustamante&#x27;s interpretation of the test, Warren asked Trump to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women&#x27;s Resource Center. Trump responded: &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that. I think you better read it again&quot;. The Cherokee Nation criticized Warren, saying, &quot;Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong.&quot; According to &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;Warren&#x27;s past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle&quot;, with &quot;tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.&quot;

During a January 2019 public appearance in Sioux City, Iowa, Warren was asked by an attendee, &quot;Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?&quot; She responded in part, &quot;I am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.&quot; She later privately contacted leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize &quot;for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused&quot;. Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands &quot;that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests&quot;. Warren apologized again in August 2019 before a Native American Forum in Iowa.

In February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress. Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her &quot;a great partner for Indian Country&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
In 2009, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; named Warren the Bostonian of the Year, and the Women&#x27;s Bar Association of Massachusetts honored her with the Lelia J. Robinson Award. &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America, and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade. Also in 2009, Warren became the first professor in Harvard&#x27;s history to win the law school&#x27;s Sacks–Freund Teaching Award for a second time. In 2011, she delivered the commencement address at Rutgers Law School, her alma mater, and received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the Order of the Coif. In 2011, Warren was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. In January 2012, &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine named her one of the &quot;top 20 U.S. progressives&quot;. Warren was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017.

In 2018, the Women&#x27;s History Month theme in the United States was &quot;Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination Against Women&quot;, referring to McConnell&#x27;s remark about Warren.

==In popular culture==
* Warren has appeared in the documentary films &quot;Maxed Out&quot; (2007), Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2009), &quot;&quot; (2011), and &quot;&quot; (2013).
* In 2017, Kate McKinnon played Warren on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. McKinnon continued her impression of Warren in 2019 and 2020, during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. On the March 7, 2020, episode, Warren appeared as herself in the cold open alongside McKinnon&#x27;s impression of her, and together they opened the show.
* In 2019, Warren wrote the entry on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for that year&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; 100.
* Warren&#x27;s popularity is the basis of a wide array of merchandise sold in her name, much of which incorporates Mitch McConnell&#x27;s remark &quot;Nevertheless, she persisted&quot;, including an action figure of Warren.
* Musician Jonathan Mann has written songs about Warren, including &quot;She Persisted&quot;.

==Political influence and protégés==
===Influence on national politics===
Warren has been described as a national &quot;liberal standard-bearer&quot; as well as a &quot;standard-bearer&quot; for progressivism. In his 2024 book &quot;The Rebels: Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the Struggle for a New American Politics&quot;, Joshua Green cites Warren as a major figure in shaping the Democratic Party&#x27;s embrace of more leftward politics in the dozen years after the Great Recession. Green considers Warren to have demonstrated &quot;a new way&quot; approach in national politics, whereby politicians engage in &quot;big, loud, messy fights that offered moral clarity and galvanized public sentiment behind a position.&quot; He credited this approach for enabling Warren to &quot;take on her own party&quot;. Warren herself had previously boasted about being a &quot;thorn&quot; to the Obama administration, taking pride in her willingness to be combative with the administration&#x27;s major economic officials and occasionally voice public disagreement with Obama&#x27;s positions.

Fellow journalist Brian Stelter concurred with Green&#x27;s analysis that Warren (as well as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio–Cortez) had &quot;helped lead an economic &#x27;backlash&#x27; to the 2008 financial crisis that pulled the [Democratic] party leftward.&quot; After the 2016 election of Donald Trump placed the national Democratic Party in a political wilderness as both the opposition to the president and the minority party in both chambers of the Congress, many commenters saw Warren as one of the de facto leading figures in a party that lacked a clear singular post-Obama leader.

Columnists such as Perry Bacon Jr. of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; have written that ideas Warren promoted during her presidential campaign have had some influence on the Biden administration&#x27;s agenda. In February 2021, Jeff Bridgood observed that the administration appeared more receptive to Warren&#x27;s input than the Obama administration had been, reflecting how the party had become more in line with her political philosophy than it had been when she first rose to political prominence. During the Biden administration, Warren has continued to be a prominent voice within her party.

===Protégés===
Warren has mentored several people who have gone on to hold notable political office. U.S. Representative Katie Porter, a former law student of hers, is considered her protégée. Porter co-chaired Warren&#x27;s presidential campaign. Another of Warren&#x27;s political protégées is Michelle Wu (mayor of Boston), who was a law student of hers and worked on her 2012 Senate campaign before running for Boston City Council herself in 2013. Suffolk County Sheriff Steven W. Tompkins also got his start in politics working on Warren&#x27;s 2012 campaign. During his law school studies, former U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III considered Warren a mentor. Boston City Council president Ruthzee Louijeune has also been described as a Warren protégée and served as senior counsel to Warren&#x27;s presidential campaign before running for city council.

===Influence on appointments in Democratic presidential administrations===
Warren strongly believes that &quot;personnel is policy&quot;: that the policy of a presidency is shaped by who a president appoints to their administration. She has influenced President Obama, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and President Biden on the matter of staffing presidential administrations.

====Pressuring of Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election====
Warren discreetly engaged in an effort to shape the administration Hillary Clinton would lead if she won the 2016 election. In his 2024 book, Stern noted that after Warren (bullish on her own 2016 prospects of winning a presidential election) had declined grassroots efforts to draft her into a candidacy. Recognizing that Clinton stood of becoming the party&#x27;s nominee, Warren quietly worked to influence how she might staff an administration.

In 2019, Alex Thompson reported in &quot;Politico&quot; on Warren&#x27;s efforts ahead of the 2016 election to pressure Clinton on potential appointees. Thompson described Warren&#x27;s theory on political power as &quot;combining tough, often hyperbolic rhetoric to create leverage with quieter, hands-on, person-to-person outreach.&quot; He reported that, beginning in December 2014, Warren had discreetly &quot;pressed Clinton to commit to not appointing Wall Street-friendly people to her administration, as Warren felt Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had done.&quot; He described this effort as a

Thompson reported that Warren had also &quot;sent Clinton a list of people she wanted the campaign team to consult on economic policy in order to broaden their horizons&quot;, all of whom had been &quot;critical of the Obama administration&#x27;s response to the financial crisis, as Warren had.&quot; Thompson reported that Clinton and her political advisors gave great deference to Warren&#x27;s advice, both out of concern that Warren might otherwise challenge Clinton in the primary, but also due to &quot;Warren’s credibility among progressives and her willingness to use her bully pulpit to condemn members of her own party.&quot;

====Biden administration====
Warren has had notable success in lobbying President Biden on certain appointments in his administration. A number of Warren&#x27;s acolytes have served in the Biden administration, including Bharat Ramamurti (a former economic policy advisor to Warren) and Sasha Baker (a former senate and campaign policy advisor to Warren on national security). Within the first three weeks of his presidency, Biden had already named four of Warren&#x27;s campaign and Senate staffers to positions in his administration, among other Warren allies and protégés. In March 2021, Kara Voght of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; wrote, &quot;Warren has been a private but constant voice to the Biden administration on personnel decisions.&quot; That same month, Zachary Warmbrodt of &quot;Politico&quot; wrote:

==Books and other works==
In 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote &quot;The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke&quot;. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.

In an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jeff Madrick said of the book:

In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.

Metropolitan Books published Warren&#x27;s book &quot;A Fighting Chance&quot; in April 2014. According to a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; review, &quot;the book&#x27;s title refers to a time she says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.&quot;

In April 2017, Warren published her 11th book, &quot;This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America&#x27;s Middle Class&quot;, in which she explores the plight of the American middle class and argues that the federal government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education.

<text>Live action is a form of cinematography or videography that uses photography instead of animation. Some works combine live action with animation to create a live-action animated feature film. Live action is used to define film, video games or similar visual media. Photorealistic animation, particularly modern computer animation, is sometimes erroneously described as &quot;live action&quot;, as in the case of some media reports about Disney&#x27;s remake of the traditionally animated &quot;The Lion King&quot; from 1994. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, live action involves &quot;real people or animals, not models, or images that are drawn, or produced by computer&quot;.

== Overview ==
As the normal process of making visual media involves live action, the term itself is usually superfluous. However, it makes an important distinction in situations in which one might normally expect animation, such as when the work is adapted from a video game, or from an animated cartoon.

The phrase &quot;live action&quot; also occurs within an animation context to refer to non-animated characters: in a live-action/animated film such as &quot;Space Jam&quot;, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, or &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; in which humans and cartoons co-exist. In this case, the &quot;live-action&quot; characters are the &quot;real&quot; actors, such as Michael Jordan, Bob Hoskins and Julie Andrews, as opposed to the animated &quot;actors&quot;, such as Roger and Jessica Rabbit.

As use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in films has become a major trend, some critics, such as Mark Langer, have discussed the relationship between live action and animation. New films that use computer-generated special effects can not be compared to live-action films using cartoon characters because of the perceived realism of both styles combined.

== Live action vs. animation ==
In producing a movie, both live action and animation have their own pros and cons. Unlike animation, live action involves the photography of actors and actresses, as well as sets and props making the movie seem personal and as close to reality as possible. The only drawback is one&#x27;s budget. On the other hand, animation works well in conveying abstract ideas but it generally takes much longer to produce.

<doc id="290204" wikidata="Q186102" url="?curid=290204" title="Zygomatic bone">
<text>In the human skull, the zygomatic bone (from ), also called cheekbone or malar bone, is a paired irregular bone, situated at the upper and lateral part of the face and forming part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, of the temporal fossa and the infratemporal fossa. It presents a malar and a temporal surface; four processes (the frontosphenoidal, orbital, maxillary, and temporal), and four borders.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;zygomatic&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek , &quot;zygoma&quot;, meaning &quot;yoke&quot;. The zygomatic bone is occasionally referred to as the zygoma, but this term may also refer to the zygomatic arch.

== Structure ==

=== Surfaces ===
The &quot;malar surface&quot; is convex and perforated near its center by a small aperture, the zygomaticofacial foramen, for the passage of the zygomaticofacial nerve and vessels; below this foramen is a slight elevation, which gives origin to the zygomaticus muscle.

The &quot;temporal surface&quot;, directed posteriorly and medially, is concave, presenting medially a rough, triangular area, for articulation with the maxilla (articular surface), and laterally a smooth, concave surface, the upper part of which forms the anterior boundary of the temporal fossa, the lower a part of the infratemporal fossa. Near the center of this surface is the zygomaticotemporal foramen for the transmission of the zygomaticotemporal nerve.

The &quot;orbital surface&quot; forms the lateral part and some of the inferior part of the bony orbit. The zygomatic nerve passes through the zygomatic-orbital foramen on this surface. The lateral palpebral ligament attaches to a small protuberance called the orbital tubercle.

=== Processes ===
Each zygomatic bone is diamond-shaped and composed of three processes with similarly named associated bony articulations: frontal, temporal, and maxillary. Each process of the zygomatic bone forms important structures of the skull.

The orbital surface of the frontal process of the zygomatic bone forms the anterior lateral orbital wall, with usually a small paired foramen, the zygomaticofacial foramen opening on its lateral surface. The temporal process of the zygomatic bone forms the zygomatic arch along with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, with a paired zygomaticotemporal foramen present on the medial deep surface of the bone. The orbital surface of the maxillary process of the zygomatic bone forms a part of the infraorbital rim and a small part of the anterior part of the lateral orbital wall.

=== Orbital process ===
The orbital process is a thick, strong plate, projecting backward and medialward from the orbital margin. Its &quot;antero-medial surface&quot; forms, by its junction with the orbital surface of the maxilla and with the great wing of the sphenoid, part of the floor and lateral wall of the orbit. On it are seen the orifices of two canals, the zygomatico-orbital foramina; one of these canals opens into the temporal fossa, the other on the malar surface of the bone; the former transmits the zygomaticotemporal, the latter the zygomaticofacial nerve.
* Its &quot;postero-lateral surface,&quot; smooth and convex, forms parts of the temporal and infratemporal fossae.
* Its &quot;anterior margin,&quot; smooth and rounded, is part of the circumference of the orbit.
* Its &quot;superior&quot; &quot;margin,&quot; rough, and directed horizontally, articulates with the frontal bone behind the zygomatic process.
* Its &quot;posterior margin&quot; is serrated for articulation, with the great wing of the sphenoid and the orbital surface of the maxilla.

At the angle of junction of the sphenoidal and maxillary portions, a short, concave, non-articular part is generally seen; this forms the anterior boundary of the inferior orbital fissure: occasionally, this non-articular part is absent, the fissure then being completed by the junction of the maxilla and sphenoid, or by the interposition of a small sutural bone in the angular interval between them.

=== Borders ===
The &quot;antero-superior&quot; or &quot;orbital&quot; border is smooth, concave, and forms a considerable part of the circumference of the orbit.

The &quot;antero-inferior&quot; or &quot;maxillary&quot; border is rough, and bevelled at the expense of its inner table, to articulate with the maxilla; near the orbital margin it gives origin to the quadratus labii superioris.

The &quot;postero-superior&quot; or &quot;temporal&quot; border, curved like an italic letter &quot;f,&quot; is continuous above with the commencement of the temporal line, and below with the upper border of the zygomatic arch; the temporal fascia is attached to it.

The &quot;postero-inferior&quot; or &quot;zygomatic border&quot; affords attachment by its rough edge to the masseter.

=== Articulations ===
The zygomatic bone articulates with the frontal bone, sphenoid bone, and paired temporal bones, and maxillary bones.

=== Development ===
The zygomatic bone is generally described as ossifying from three centers—one for the malar and two for the orbital portion; these appear about the eighth week and fuse about the fifth month of fetal life.

Mall describes it as being ossified from one center which appears just beneath and to the lateral side of the orbit.

After birth, the bone is sometimes divided by a horizontal suture into an upper larger, and a lower smaller division.

In some quadrumana the zygomatic bone consisted of two parts, an orbital and a malar.

== Society and culture ==
Zygomatic arches, also known as high cheek bones, are considered physically attractive in some cultures, in both males and females.

Ancient Chinese sculptures of goddesses typically have a &quot;broad forehead, raised eyebrows, high cheekbones, and large, sensuous mouth&quot;. Similarly, many depictions of Qin warriors in the Terracotta Army are depicted with &quot;broad foreheads, high cheekbones, large eyes, thick eyebrows, and stiff beards.&quot;

For this reason some individuals undergo cheek augmentation, a form of cosmetic surgery.

== Other animals ==
The zygomatic is homologous to the jugal bone of other tetrapods.

=== Non-mammalian vertebrates ===

In non-mammalian vertebrates, the zygomatic bone is referred to as the jugal bone, since these animals have no zygomatic arch. It is found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. It is connected to the quadratojugal and maxilla, as well as other bones, which may vary by species.

This bone is considered key in the determination of general traits of the skull, as in the case of creatures, such as dinosaurs in paleontology, whose entire skull has not been found. In coelacanths and early tetrapods the bone is relatively large. Here, it is a plate-like bone forming the lower margin of the orbit and much of the side of the face. In ray-finned fishes it is reduced or absent, and the entire cheek region is generally small. The bone is also absent in living amphibians.

With the exception of turtles, the jugal bone in reptiles forms a relatively narrow bar separating the orbit from the inferior temporal fenestra, of which it may also form the lower boundary. The bone is similarly reduced in birds. In mammals, it takes on broadly the form seen in humans, with the bar between the orbit and fenestra vanishing entirely, and only the lower boundary of the fenestra remaining, as the zygomatic arch.

<doc id="290205" wikidata="Q836304" url="?curid=290205" title="Solitary sandpiper">
<text>The solitary sandpiper (Tringa solitaria) is a small shorebird. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;solitaria&quot; is Latin for &quot;solitary&quot; from &quot;solus&quot;, &quot;alone&quot;.

==Description==
This species measures long, with a wingspan up to and a body mass of . It is a dumpy wader with a dark green back, greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts. It is obvious in flight, with wings dark above and below, and a dark rump and tail centre. The latter feature distinguishes it from the slightly larger and broader-winged, but otherwise very similar, green sandpiper (&quot;T. ochropus&quot;) of Europe and Asia, to which it is closely related. The latter species has a brilliant white rump. In flight, the solitary sandpiper has a characteristic three-note whistle. They both have brown wings with little light dots, and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in woodlands across Alaska and Canada. It is a migratory bird, wintering in Central and South America, especially in the Amazon River basin, and the Caribbean. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, and goes there in the summer–autumn period. 

===Subspecies===
The solitary sandpiper is split into two subspecies:

*&quot;T. s. cinnamomea&quot;, : breeds in Alaska &amp; western Canada
*&quot;T. s. solitaria&quot;, : breeds from eastern British Columbia to Labrador

==Behaviour==
As its name indicates, the solitary sandpiper is not a gregarious species, usually seen alone during migration, although sometimes small numbers congregate in suitable feeding areas. The solitary sandpiper is very much a bird of fresh water, and is often found in sites, such as ditches, too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view.

===Breeding===
The sandpiper lays a clutch of 3–5 eggs in abandoned tree nests of songbird species, such as those of thrushes. The young birds are encouraged to drop to the ground soon after hatching.

===Feeding===
Food is small invertebrates: insects (such as mosquito larvae, young midges, grasshoppers, caterpillars and beetles), small crustaceans and molluscs (such as snails extracted from their shells), sometimes small frogs (primarily as tadpoles), picked off the mud as the bird works steadily around the edges of its chosen pond.

<doc id="290207" wikidata="Q7997187" url="?curid=290207" title="Who Censored Roger Rabbit?">
<text>Who Censored Roger Rabbit? is a fantasy mystery novel written by Gary K. Wolf in 1981. It was later adapted by Disney and Amblin Entertainment into the critically acclaimed 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

==Plot==
Eddie Valiant is a hardboiled private eye, and Roger Rabbit is a second banana comic strip character. Roger hires Valiant to find out why his employers, the DeGreasy Brothers (Rocco and Dominic), who are owners of a cartoon syndicate, have reneged on a promise to give Roger his own strip and potentially sell his contract to a mystery buyer. Evidence shows that there was no mystery buyer and the reason Roger Rabbit remained in a secondary role was because of his lack of talent. Soon after, Roger is mysteriously murdered in his home. His speech balloon, found at the crime scene, indicates his murder was a way of &quot;censoring&quot; him; apparently, he had just heard someone explain the source of his success. Valiant&#x27;s search for the killer takes him to a variety of suspects, which includes Roger&#x27;s estranged widow Jessica Rabbit, Roger&#x27;s former co-star Baby Herman, and Roger&#x27;s photographer Carol Masters. Valiant then meets a doppelgänger of Roger&#x27;s and promises to solve the mystery of his death. At the same time, Roger&#x27;s former boss, Rocco DeGreasy, is also murdered, and witnesses point to Roger as the killer, as he was allegedly seen fleeing the scene of the crime.

While Valiant investigates, the key suspects ask him to be on the lookout for a certain kettle in exchange for a reward. He eventually finds the kettle, which was in Roger&#x27;s possession, and gives it to Dominic DeGreasy only to find it is actually a magic lamp with a Genie living on the inside, who then kills Dominic. The Genie explains its origins, and that, over thousands of years, it has become embittered, now only granting wishes with a catch, and admits to being the one who shot Roger. He further explains that the words to command him happen to be part of a children&#x27;s song that Roger habitually sings, so Roger wished for success without actually realising he had done so. When Roger accidentally activated the lantern a third time, but witnessed the apparition, the Genie killed him. Valiant holds the Genie hostage over a saltwater fish tank, saltwater being its weakness. The Genie is then forced to grant a wish made by Valiant for proof of Roger&#x27;s innocence, which is provided in the form of a suicide note from Dominic DeGreasy confessing to both Roger and Rocco DeGreasy&#x27;s murders. Not trusting the Genie to keep its word of letting him go, and also knowing that no one would believe him about the Genie, Valiant drops the Genie&#x27;s lamp into the fish tank and the saltwater dissolves the Genie.

With Roger&#x27;s murderer disposed of, Valiant concludes that Rocco DeGreasy&#x27;s murderer was the original Roger Rabbit himself. Roger&#x27;s motive was that Rocco had stolen Jessica from him, and he generated the doppelgänger to be an alibi. He intended to plant the murder weapon at Valiant&#x27;s office, framing him, but was shot by the Genie when he accidentally summoned it. The doppelgänger confirms the truth and confesses that he &quot;had it planned for days&quot;. However, for clearing his name and befriending him despite what he did and tried to do afterwards, he praises Valiant for his morals (calling him &quot;a real stand-up guy&quot;). Roger gives Valiant a final heartfelt goodbye before disintegrating.

==Edition differences==

The different covers used for the book give different impressions. The first is darker in tone and only shows a shadowed Roger from the back, while Valiant&#x27;s face is unshaven. It focused on the two in a close-up with a black background. A later edition showed a cleanshaven Valiant while Roger&#x27;s face was brightly shown. It was panned out and showed the city during day in the background. It also showed a speech bubble coming from Roger saying &quot;Help! I&#x27;m stuck in a mystery of double-crossers, steamy broads, and killer cream pies.&quot; Both show author Gary K. Wolf modelling as Valiant.

==Comparison to the film adaptation==
The book and film feature many of the same core characters; however, the plot and many other elements of the film depart significantly from Wolf&#x27;s novel.

The novel is set in the 1980s of the book&#x27;s publication, albeit in a strange universe in which real humans and cartoon characters co-exist. The cartoons of the novel are primarily comic strip characters, as opposed to animated cartoon stars. Many famous strip characters are mentioned or make cameo appearances, such as Dick Tracy, Snoopy, Dagwood and Blondie Bumstead, Beetle Bailey, and Hägar the Horrible. Strips are produced by photographing cartoon characters. In this version, &quot;toon&quot; characters speak in word balloons which appear above their heads as they talk. Although some characters have learned to suppress their word balloons and speak vocally, the use of word balloons forms several important plot points.

In the book, toons have the power to create duplicates of themselves as stunt doubles for risky shots. Generally, they disintegrate after a few minutes or hours at the most. Roger creates one that lasts two days, although this is an exception, intending it to be as close a match to him as possible in order to be an alibi. When Roger is shot and killed by an unknown assailant, his doppelgänger works with the detective to solve his murder before he disintegrates. In the film, toons are more or less unkillable—except by noxious chemical &quot;dip&quot;—and, with a few exceptions, shrug off even the worst injuries, while their slapstick can realistically kill humans, such as Judge Doom killing Teddy Valiant (Eddie&#x27;s younger brother in the film) with a piano.

The only lines of dialogue from the book that were closely re-used in the film were spoken by Baby Herman (&quot;I&#x27;ve got a 50-year-old lust and a 3-year-old dinky,&quot; though in the book, Baby Herman&#x27;s actual age is given as 36) and Jessica Rabbit (&quot;I&#x27;m not bad, Mr. Valiant. I&#x27;m just drawn that way&quot;).

==Comparison to the spin-off==
In 1991, Wolf wrote another Roger Rabbit book, &quot;Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?&quot;, but (in the form of a memo from Valiant) the book says that Roger Rabbit &quot;and his screwball buddies play fast and loose with historical accuracy&quot;, which means that the stories do not have much continuity between each other. There is no connection between this novel and the first one, with the exception of Jessica mentioning having a dream containing the events of the first novel, retconning it as just a dream.

<text>Huugo Kalervo Palsa, known as Kalle (12 March 1947 – 3 October 1987), was a Finnish artist whose style has been described as fantastic expressionism, often influenced by depictions of sexuality.

Although his work did not draw significant attention in his lifetime, Kalervo Palsa&#x27;s reputation grew after being the subject of exhibitions and writings following his death. In 2013, a film based on his life, &quot;Kalervo Palsa ja kuriton käsi&quot; was released. In 2013, his house was converted into the Palsa Museum, dedicated to his work.

==Life==
Palsa was a native of Kittilä in Lapland. As a child, he grew up in a dysfunctional household where display of emotion was discouraged.

Palsa began keeping a journal in which he recorded his thoughts in the early 1960s. His work was first exhibited in Rovaniemi in 1967, and he became the first member of his family to graduate high school in 1970. He spent time in the 1970s as an art student in Helsinki, but resided permanently at a small studio cabin in Kittilä. It was connected to electricity by a long extension cable from a nearby house, and Palsa called it his &quot;Getsemane&quot; after the biblical site, or sometimes his &quot;castle in the clouds&quot;.

Palsa died in 1987, lying in bed at home alone with pneumonia.

==Legacy==
During his life he had artist friends including Reidar Särestöniemi, but his two biggest supporters were his mother, and his soulmate/muse Maj-Lis Pitkänen, the sister of his childhood sweetheart Maaret.

After his death, Maj-Lis was bequeathed his artistic works and journal, and donated them to the Kiasma art museum in 1999. She would later go on to curate several exhibitions of his work and to edit compilations of his writings. She led a long-term campaign to install a memorial cenotaph for Palsa, which was sculpted by the Finnish artist, Pekka Pitkänen, Maj-Lis&#x27;s husband. The statue, shaped like a stylized seed or bullroarer, was viewed by the parish as pagan, or even representing female sexual organs. Some argued against Palsa&#x27;s burial in the parish due to his supposed sexual perversion, though his reputation has been partially rehabilitated since.

== Art ==
Kalervo Palsa used a varied palette of techniques and materials, including housepaint. He painted over 1,000 self-portraits.

Most of his works explore in graphic detail the dark side of humanity, and especially of his native northern regions, with prominent themes including grotesque sexuality, sadism, homosexuality, bisexuality and a general emotional frigidity paraphilia.

Palsa went through a brief phase of experimentation with abstract art while staying in New York City. According to his diaries, this phase ended suddenly one day when he saw an unconscious black man sprawled on a subway bench.
Besides Hieronymus Bosch, his work has been compared to that of Frida Kahlo. His artistic influences include René Magritte and Vincent van Gogh, and his works also include references to Jean-Paul Sartre, August Strindberg and Jean Genet. On the first page of Eläkeläinen muistelee, he mentions other looser influences such as Jonathan Swift and Vladimir Lenin, among others.

Some researchers have noted that though he remained active in his work up to his death in 1987, his work did not show signs of the postmodernism evident in the work of many other artists of the time.

===Notable works===

*&quot;Turva&quot; (&quot;Security&quot;) is a painting of a giant anus surrounded by horrifying images. At the center of the painting the anus opens as a window showing a man seated serenely in a rocking chair, apparently untouched by the horrors.
*&quot;Missi Paskantaa&quot; (&quot;A Beauty Pageant Contestant Takes a Dump&quot;), a black-and-white inked comic strip. The work consists of a few pages of deadpan illustrated technical description of the practical ramifications of beauty pageant contestants having to defecate, and finally ends with an illustrated listing of varieties of consistency of faeces that might come out of such a girl&#x27;s anus, with attendant analysis.
*&quot;Eläkeläinen Muistelee&quot; (&quot;Retiree Reminisces&quot;), a black-and-white inked comic-book recounting a plethora of highly surreal homosexual sadistic tales.
*&quot;Miehen Kuukautiset&quot; (&quot;The Male Period&quot;), a painting of a man&#x27;s bleeding anus.
*&quot;Vapautuminen&quot; (&quot;Deliverance&quot;), a painting of a man suspended in mid-air, hung by a rope attached around the glans of his own huge penis.
*&quot;Uusi Ihminen&quot; (&quot;New (Hu)Man&quot;), a man giving birth through his anal opening.

<doc id="290216" wikidata="Q1480532" url="?curid=290216" title="University System of Maryland">
<text>The University System of Maryland (USM) is a public university system in the U.S. state of Maryland. The system is composed of the eleven campuses at College Park, Baltimore County, Baltimore, Princess Anne, Towson, Salisbury, Bowie, Frostburg, Hagerstown, Rockville, Cambridge, and Adelphi, along with four regional higher education centers located throughout the state.

== History ==

In 1974, Maryland, along with seven other states, mainly in the South, submitted plans to desegregate its state universities; Maryland&#x27;s plans were approved by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The University System of Maryland was created in 1988 from the merger of University of Maryland (UM) and Board of Trustees of State Universities and Colleges (BTSUC).

==Campuses==

With more than 172,000 students at all levels, USM institutions award 78% of bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Maryland.

==Finances==
Nearly 50 percent of undergraduates graduate without debt. USM institutions attract more than $1.4 billion in research and development funding to the state annually and have helped foster the creation of more than 700 startup companies since 2011. The system&#x27;s Aa1 bond rating enables its institutions to borrow at lower costs to students, families and taxpayers. Related effectiveness and efficiency initiatives have saved Marylanders nearly $600 million in administrative costs since 2004.

== Governance ==
The USM is governed by a board of regents and led by a chancellor, who serves as the CEO of the university system and leads the USM Office.

===USM Board of Regents===

A 17-member volunteer Board of Regents, including one full-time student, governs the University System of Maryland. Appointed by the governor, the regents oversee the system&#x27;s academic, administrative, and financial operations; formulate policy; and appoint the USM chancellor and the presidents of the system&#x27;s 12 institutions. With the exception of the student member, each regent is appointed for a term of five years, and may not serve more than two consecutive terms. The student regent is appointed for a one-year term, and may be reappointed. Regents serve on the board without compensation.

===USM chancellors===
*John S. Toll (1988–1990)
*Donald Langenberg (1990–2002)
*William E. Kirwan (2002–2015)
*Robert L. Caret (2015–2020)
*Jay A. Perman (2020–present)

== USM Office ==
The USM Office, led by the system chancellor, is the staff to the Board of Regents. Staff members advocate on behalf of the 12 USM institutions, facilitate collaboration and efficiencies among the institutions, and provide information about the system to the public.

With leadership from the USM Board of Regents and the chancellor, the system office coordinates academic programs, assists with long-range planning and resource management, facilitates private fund raising, and provides financial stewardship.

The system office is headquartered in Baltimore, and has locations in College Park (Adelphi postal address), Annapolis, and Columbia. Formerly the Adelphi office was the headquarters of the entire system.

<text>The Avon Safety Wheel was a new type of wheel for cars, invented by the Avon Tyre Company of Britain in the early 1970s. With the advent of radial tyres, taking over from the older crossply type, it was found that in the event of a puncture or blowout, the tyre would be much more prone to detach from the rim, which would make a bad situation somewhat worse.

The Avon Safety Wheel avoids the detachment of a deflated tyre by having a much shallower central recess within the interior of the wheel. The recess is so shallow that the tyre is prevented from twisting to an angle that would allow it to slip over the edge of the rim, so it is retained. Such a shallow recess would also prevent the fitment of new tyres, if it weren&#x27;t for the inclusion of a deep channel, allowing the bead of the tyre to enter the channel to permit fitting. The channel is covered by a metal band that is tightened around the wheel after the tyre is fitted but before it is inflated.

The fitting procedure is relatively troublesome and not popular with tyre fitters. This may be one reason that this design of wheel has not been widely adopted, meaning that modern cars are still prone to tyre detachment, though tyre safety itself has improved dramatically in the last 30 years. The Avon Safety Wheel was first used on the 1974 Vauxhall Firenza.

The wheel design was also used on British Leyland&#x27;s Morris Marina Safety Research Vehicle, though featuring very different styling from the version employed by Vauxhall. It was also used on the Bristol 411 series 4.

<doc id="290228" wikidata="Q300929" url="?curid=290228" title="Eelpout">
<text>The eelpouts are the ray-finned fish family Zoarcidae. As the common name suggests, they are somewhat eel-like in appearance. All of the 300 species are marine and mostly bottom-dwelling, some at great depths. Eelpouts are predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere. The Arctic, north Pacific and north Atlantic oceans have the highest concentration of species; however, species are found around the globe.

They are conventionally placed in the &quot;perciform&quot; assemblage; in fact, the Zoarcoidei seem to be specialized members of the Gasterosteiformes-Scorpaeniformes group of Acanthopterygii.

The largest member of the family is &quot;Zoarces americanus&quot;, which may reach 1.1 m in length. Other notable genera include &quot;Lycodapus&quot; and &quot;Gymnelus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The eelpout family was first proposed as the family Zoarchidae in 1839 by the English naturalist William Swainson but the spelling was changed to Zoarcidae after the spelling of the genus Zoarces was corrected by Theodore Gill in 1861. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies this family within the suborder Zoarcoidei, within the order Scorpaeniformes. Other authorities classify this family in the infraorder Zoarcales within the suborder Cottoidei of the Perciformes because removing the Scorpaeniformes from the Perciformes renders that taxon non monophyletic.

&quot;Fishes of the World&quot; mentions four subfamilies but does not assign genera to the subfamilies but these were set out in Anderson and Federov&#x27;s Annotated Checklist and this has been followed by &quot;FishBase&quot; and &quot;Catalog of Fishes&quot;.

== Evolution and adaptations ==
Eelpout species have evolved to efficiently give birth to future generations. They utilize demersal eggs, which are eggs that are deposited on the seafloor, and can be either free or connected to the substrate. These egg clusters can range from 9.2 mm, to 9.8 mm, which are the largest compared to any other marine egg cluster. It has been found that eelpouts grow larger and heavier in areas where the water is relatively shallow. In these areas, this species consumes molluscs, invertebrates, and small fish. The difference of biodiversity at varying depths has led to the evolution of distinct populations, connecting to the study that temperature might have a significant effect on them. Studies have shown that there are three large families of eelpout species; Zoarcidae, Stichaeidae, and Pholidae. These species have been thought to have evolved in northern, colder seas, each diverging off of each other at different points in time, millions of years ago. The notched-fin eelpout, which is commonly found in the Sea of Okhotsk, have shown researchers what the average length of an adult eelpout is, usually sitting between 21 and 26 cm long (females typically larger than males). Their size has been found to increase as the depth of water in which they have been studied lowers. They feed commonly on Gammarids (small, shrimp like organisms), Polychaetes (marine worms), and Bivalves (clams and muscles) on the seafloor.

==Subfamilies and genera==
The eelpouts are classified into four subfamilies and 61 genera with around 300 species:

==Characteristics==
The body of eelpouts is relatively elongated and laterally compressed. Their heads are relatively small and ovoid. Juveniles have a more rounded snout and relatively larger eye than adults. Their scales are absent or very small. The dorsal and anal fins are continuous down their bodies up to their caudal fin. They produce the pigment biliverdin, which turns their bones green. This feature has no apparent evolutionary function and is harmless. Overall, there is no sexual dimorphism.

===Biology===
Little is known about eelpout populations because they often slip through nets in sampling studies, and because some species live in inaccessibly deep habitats. Species for which trophic ecology has been documented are typically, if not always, benthic scavengers or predators. At least one species has also adapted the ability to breathe air when out of water.

==Timeline==

==Physiology==

===Metabolic adaptations to low temperatures===
Species of eelpouts have adapted in order to grow and thrive in the extreme low temperatures of their habitats. The metabolic responses of Antarctic and temperate eelpout species during exercise and subsequent recovery at 0 °C is a point of emphasis when understanding this species. Contrary to the hypothesis of reduced glycolytic capacity in Antarctic fish as an adaptation to low temperatures, findings revealed similar increases in white muscle lactate, intracellular pH drop, and phosphocreatine depletion during strenuous exercise in both species. Notably, Antarctic eelpout exhibited faster recovery kinetics, including lactate clearance. This suggests a superior metabolic cold compensation mechanism compared to temperate eelpout. The study also proposed a correlation between reduced ATP energy content and muscular fatigue, highlighting the intricate metabolic adjustments crucial for sustaining activity in extreme cold conditions. These environmental factors surrounding this species show how it has adapted and survived over time.

===Thermal stress responses===
As global temperatures continue to rise, understanding how aquatic species adapt to thermal stress becomes increasingly crucial. The physiological responses of temperate eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) from the North Sea and Antarctic eelpout (Pachycara brachycephalum) to gradually increasing water temperatures were examined. The study explored parameters such as standard metabolic rate (SMR), intracellular pH regulation, and the upper critical temperature limit (TcII), to explain the species&#x27; thermal tolerance. Results revealed distinct differences in metabolic responses between the two species, indicating varied thermal sensitivities and adaptation strategies. The habitat of an eelpout can vary greatly throughout the year, as seasonal temperatures can change drastically between 3 and 12 degrees C. With increasing temperatures of the water in these regions, the eelpouts struggle to cope. Certain signs of this struggle are apparent when being studied in a lab, as they raise their pectoral fins, swim around more vigorously, and attempt to jump out of their holding aquariums, leading to the conclusion that higher temperatures lead to higher levels of agitation. For short periods of time, however, this species is able to cope. These findings have implications for understanding the physiological constraints faced by eelpout fish under thermal stress and offer insights into potential shifts in species distribution patterns driven by global warming.

<doc id="290236" wikidata="Q133712" url="?curid=290236" title="Gymnosperm">
<text>The gymnosperms ( ; ) are a group of woody, perennial seed-producing plants, typically lacking the protective outer covering which surrounds the seeds in flowering plants, that include conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes, forming the clade Gymnospermae The term &quot;gymnosperm&quot; comes from the composite word in ( and ), and literally means &#x27;naked seeds&#x27;. The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds contrasts with the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or on their own as in yew, &quot;Torreya&quot;, and &quot;Ginkgo&quot;. 

The life cycle of a gymnosperm involves alternation of generations, with a dominant diploid sporophyte phase, and a reduced haploid gametophyte phase, which is dependent on the sporophytic phase. The term &quot;gymnosperm&quot; is often used in paleobotany to refer to (the paraphyletic group of) all non-angiosperm seed plants. In that case, to specify the modern monophyletic group of gymnosperms, the term Acrogymnospermae is sometimes used.

The gymnosperms and angiosperms together constitute the spermatophytes or seed plants. The spermatophytes are subdivided into five divisions, the angiosperms and four divisions of gymnosperms: the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta). Newer classification place the gnetophytes among the conifers. Numerous extinct seed plant groups are recognised including those considered pteridosperms/seed ferns, as well other groups like the Bennettitales.

By far the largest group of living gymnosperms are the conifers (pines, cypresses, and relatives), followed by cycads, gnetophytes (&quot;Gnetum&quot;, &quot;Ephedra&quot; and &quot;Welwitschia&quot;), and &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; (a single living species). About 65% of gymnosperms are dioecious, but conifers are almost all monoecious. Some genera have ectomycorrhiza fungal associations with roots (&quot;Pinus&quot;), while in some others (&quot;Cycas&quot;) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.

==Diversity and origin==

Over 1,000 living species of gymnosperm exist. It was previously widely accepted that the gymnosperms originated in the Late Carboniferous period, replacing the lycopsid rainforests of the tropical region, but more recent phylogenetic evidence indicates that they diverged from the ancestors of angiosperms during the Early Carboniferous. The radiation of gymnosperms during the late Carboniferous appears to have resulted from a whole genome duplication event around . Early characteristics of seed plants are evident in fossil progymnosperms of the late Devonian period around 383 million years ago. It has been suggested that during the mid-Mesozoic era, pollination of some extinct groups of gymnosperms was by extinct species of scorpionflies that had specialized proboscis for feeding on pollination drops. The scorpionflies likely engaged in pollination mutualisms with gymnosperms, long before the similar and independent coevolution of nectar-feeding insects on angiosperms. Evidence has also been found that mid-Mesozoic gymnosperms were pollinated by Kalligrammatid lacewings, a now-extinct family with members which (in an example of convergent evolution) resembled the modern butterflies that arose far later.
All gymnosperms are perennial woody plants, 
Unlike in other extant gymnosperms the soft and highly parenchymatous wood in cycads is poorly lignified, and their main structural support comes from an armor of sclerenchymatous leaf bases covering the stem, with the exception of species with underground stems. There are no herbaceous gymnosperms and compared to angiosperms they occupy fewer ecological niches, but have evolved both parasites (&quot;Parasitaxus&quot;), epiphytes (&quot;Zamia pseudoparasitica&quot;) and rheophytes (&quot;Retrophyllum minus&quot;).

Conifers are by far the most abundant extant group of gymnosperms with six to eight families, with a total of 65–70 genera and 600–630 species (696 accepted names). Most conifers are evergreens. The leaves of many conifers are long, thin and needle-like, while other species, including most Cupressaceae and some Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. &quot;Agathis&quot; in Araucariaceae and &quot;Nageia&quot; in Podocarpaceae have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves.

Cycads, small palm-like trees, are the next most abundant group of gymnosperms, with two or three families, 11 genera, and approximately 338 species. A majority of cycads are native to tropical climates and are most abundantly found in regions near the equator. The other extant groups are the 95–100 species of &quot;Gnetophytes&quot; and one species of &quot;Ginkgo&quot;. The ginkgo or maidenhair trees are tall and have bilobed leaves, while gnetophytes are a diverse groups of plants and shrubs including the horizontally growing welwitschia

Today, gymnosperms are the most threatened of all plant groups.

==Classification==


A formal classification of the living gymnosperms is the &quot;Acrogymnospermae&quot;, which form a monophyletic group within the spermatophytes. The wider &quot;Gymnospermae&quot; group includes extinct gymnosperms and is thought to be paraphyletic. The fossil record of gymnosperms includes many distinctive taxa that do not belong to the four modern groups, including seed-bearing trees that have a somewhat fern-like vegetative morphology (the so-called &quot;seed ferns&quot; or pteridosperms). When fossil gymnosperms such as these and the Bennettitales, glossopterids, and &quot;Caytonia&quot; are considered, it is clear that angiosperms are nested within a larger gymnospermae clade, although which group of gymnosperms is their closest relative remains unclear.

The extant gymnosperms include 12 main families and 83 genera which contain more than 1000 known species.

==Life cycle==

Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Like all seed plants, they are heterosporous, having two spore types, microspores (male) produced in microsporangium and megaspores (female) produced in megasporangium that are typically present in pollen cones or ovulate cones respectively. The microsporangium is carried by microsporophyll (modified leaf) and seeds are carried by ovuliferous scales in the male and female cones respectively. The exception is the females in the cycad genus &quot;Cycas&quot;, which form a loose structure called megasporophylls instead of cones. As with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gametes.

During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and &quot;Ginkgo&quot; have flagellated motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.

Gymnosperms ordinarily reproduce by sexual reproduction, and only rarely express parthenogenesis. Sexual reproduction in gymnosperms appears to be required for maintaining long-term genomic integrity. Meiosis in sexual land plants provides a direct mechanism for repairing DNA in reproductive tissues. The likely primary benefit of cross-pollination in gymnosperms, as in other eukaryotes, is that it allows the avoidance of inbreeding depression caused by the presence of recessive deleterious mutations.

==Genetics==
The first published sequenced genome for any gymnosperm was the genome of &quot;Picea abies&quot; in 2013.

==Uses==
Gymnosperms have major economic uses. Some, such as pine, fir, spruce, and cedar, are used for lumber, paper production, and resin. Some other common uses for gymnosperms are soap, varnish, nail polish, food, gum, and perfumes.

<text>Renaissance humanism is a worldview centered on the nature and importance of humanity that emerged from the study of Classical antiquity. 

Renaissance humanists sought to create a citizenry able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity, and thus capable of engaging in the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. Humanism, while set up by a small elite who had access to books and education, was intended as a cultural movement to influence all of society. It was a program to revive the cultural heritage, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of the Greco-Roman civilization. 

It first began in Italy and then spread across Western Europe in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. During the period, the term &quot;humanist&quot; () referred to teachers and students of the humanities, known as the , which included the study of Latin and Ancient Greek literatures, grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy. It was not until the 19th century that this began to be called &quot;humanism&quot; instead of the original &quot;humanities&quot;, and later by the retronym &quot;Renaissance humanism&quot; to distinguish it from later humanist developments. 

During the Renaissance period most humanists were Christians, so their concern was to &quot;purify and renew Christianity&quot;, not to do away with it. Their vision was to return &quot;ad fontes&quot; (&quot;to the pure sources&quot;) to the Gospels, the New Testament and the Church Fathers, bypassing the complexities of medieval Christian theology.

==Definition==
Very broadly, the project of the Italian Renaissance humanists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot;: the study of the humanities, &quot;a curriculum focusing on language skills.&quot; This project sought to recover the culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its literature and philosophy and to use this classical revival to imbue the ruling classes with the moral attitudes of said ancients—a project James Hankins calls one of &quot;virtue politics.&quot; But what this &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; actually constituted is a subject of much debate. According to one scholar of the movement,
Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, not merely provided the old Trivium with a new and more ambitious name (&quot;Studia humanitatis&quot;), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.

However, in investigating this definition in his article &quot;The changing concept of the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; in the early Renaissance,&quot; Benjamin G. Kohl provides an account of the various meanings the term took on over the course of the period. 
* Around the middle of the fourteenth century, when the term first came into use among Italian &quot;literati&quot;, it was used in reference to a very specific text: as praise of the cultural and moral attitudes expressed in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Archia poeta&quot; (62 BCE). 
* Tuscan humanist Coluccio Salutati popularized the term in the 1370s, using the phrase to refer to culture and learning as a guide to moral life, with a focus on rhetoric and oration. Over the years, he came to use it specifically in literary praise of his contemporaries, but later viewed the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; as a means of editing and restoring ancient texts and even understanding scripture and other divine literature. 
* But it was not until the beginning of the quattrocento (15th century) that the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; began to be associated with particular academic disciplines, when Pier Paolo Vergerio, in his &quot;De ingenuis moribus&quot;, stressed the importance of rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy as a means of moral improvement. 
* By the middle of the century, the term was adopted more formally, as it started to be used in Bologna and Padua in reference to university courses that taught these disciplines as well as Latin poetry, before then spreading northward throughout Italy. 
* But the first instance of it as encompassing grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy all together only came when Tommaso Parentucelli wrote to Cosimo de&#x27; Medici with recommendations regarding his library collection, saying, &quot;de studiis autem humanitatis quantum ad grammaticam, rhetoricam, historicam et poeticam spectat ac moralem&quot; (&quot;concerning studies of the humanities, insofar as they [consist of] grammar, rhetoric, history and poetry, and also ethics&quot;). 
And so, the term &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; took on a variety of meanings over the centuries, being used differently by humanists across the various Italian city-states as one definition got adopted and spread across the country. Still, it has referred consistently to a mode of learning—formal or not—that results in one&#x27;s moral edification.

Under the influence and inspiration of the classics, Renaissance humanists developed a new rhetoric and new learning. Some scholars also argue that humanism articulated new moral and civic perspectives, and values offering guidance in life to all citizens. Renaissance humanism was a response to what came to be depicted by later whig historians as the &quot;narrow pedantry&quot; associated with medieval scholasticism.

==Origin==

In the last years of the 13th century and in the first decades of the 14th century, the cultural climate was changing in some European regions. The rediscovery, study, and renewed interest in authors who had been forgotten, and in the classical world that they represented, inspired a flourishing return to linguistic, stylistic and literary models of antiquity. There emerged a consciousness of the need for a cultural renewal, which sometimes also meant a detachment from contemporary culture. Manuscripts and inscriptions were in high demand and graphic models were also imitated. This &quot;return to the ancients&quot; was the main component of so-called &quot;pre-humanism&quot;, which developed particularly in Tuscany, in the Veneto region, and at the papal court of Avignon, through the activity of figures such as Lovato Lovati and Albertino Mussato in Padua, Landolfo Colonna in Avignon, Ferreto de&#x27; Ferreti in Vicenza, Convenevole from Prato in Tuscany and then in Avignon, and many others.

By the 14th century some of the first humanists were great collectors of antique manuscripts, including Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Coluccio Salutati, and Poggio Bracciolini. Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the &quot;Father of Humanism,&quot; as he was the one who first encouraged the study of pagan civilizations and the teaching of classical virtues as a means of preserving Christianity. He also had a library, of which many manuscripts did not survive. Many worked for the Catholic Church and were in holy orders, like Petrarch, while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch&#x27;s disciple Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence.

In Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance and, by the mid-15th century, many of the upper classes had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional scholastic ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was Cardinal Basilios Bessarion, a convert to the Catholic Church from Greek Orthodoxy, who was considered for the papacy, and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th-century and early 16th-century humanist Popes one of whom, Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (Pope Pius II), was a prolific author and wrote a treatise on &quot;The Education of Boys&quot;. These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism.

The migration waves of Byzantine Greek scholars and émigrés in the period following the Crusader sacking of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 was a very welcome addition to the Latin texts scholars like Petrarch had found in monastic libraries for the revival of Greek literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient Greek works. They included Gemistus Pletho, George of Trebizond, Theodorus Gaza, and John Argyropoulos.

There were important centres of Renaissance humanism in Bologna, Ferrara, Florence, Genoa, Livorno, Mantua, Padua, Pisa, Naples, Rome, Siena, Venice, Vicenza, and Urbino.

Italian humanism spread northward to France, Germany, the Low Countries, Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and England with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the Reformation. In France, pre-eminent humanist Guillaume Budé (1467–1540) applied the philological methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on Justinian&#x27;s Code. Budé was a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian &quot;umanisti&quot;) who was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for François I and helping to found the Collège des Lecteurs Royaux (later the ). Meanwhile, Marguerite de Navarre, the sister of François I, was a poet, novelist, and religious mystic who gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including Clément Marot, Pierre de Ronsard, and François Rabelais.

==Paganism and Christianity in the Renaissance==

Many humanists were churchmen, most notably Pope Pius II, Sixtus IV, and Leo X, and there was often patronage of humanists by senior church figures. Much humanist effort went into improving the understanding and translations of Biblical and early Christian texts, both before and after the Reformation, which was greatly influenced by the work of non-Italian, Northern European figures such as Erasmus, Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples, William Grocyn, and Swedish Catholic Archbishop in exile Olaus Magnus.

===Description===
&quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy&quot; describes the rationalism of ancient writings as having tremendous impact on Renaissance scholars:

In 1417, for example, Poggio Bracciolini discovered the manuscript of Lucretius, &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, which had been lost for centuries and which contained an explanation of Epicurean doctrine, though at the time this was not commented on much by Renaissance scholars, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius&#x27;s grammar and syntax.

Only in 1564 did French commentator Denys Lambin (1519–72) announce in the preface to the work that &quot;he regarded Lucretius&#x27;s Epicurean ideas as &#x27;fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity&#x27;.&quot; Lambin&#x27;s preface remained standard until the nineteenth century. Epicurus&#x27;s unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good &quot;ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy&quot;. Lorenzo Valla, however, puts a defense of epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues.

===Epicureanism===
Charles Trinkhaus regards Valla&#x27;s &quot;epicureanism&quot; as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity. Valla&#x27;s defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up in &quot;The Epicurean&quot; by Erasmus, the &quot;Prince of humanists:&quot;

This passage exemplifies the way in which the humanists saw pagan classical works, such as the philosophy of Epicurus, as being in harmony with their interpretation of Christianity.

===Neo-Platonism===
Renaissance Neo-Platonists such as Marsilio Ficino (whose translations of Plato&#x27;s works into Latin were still used into the 19th century) attempted to reconcile Platonism with Christianity, according to the suggestions of early Church Fathers Lactantius and Saint Augustine. In this spirit, Pico della Mirandola attempted to construct a syncretism of religions and philosophies with Christianity, but his work did not win favor with the church authorities, who rejected it because of his views on magic.

== Evolution and reception ==
The historian of the Renaissance Sir John Hale cautions against too direct a linkage between Renaissance humanism and modern uses of the term humanism: &quot;Renaissance humanism must be kept free from any hint of either &#x27;humanitarianism&#x27; or &#x27;humanism&#x27; in its modern sense of rational, non-religious approach to life ... the word &#x27;humanism&#x27; will mislead ... if it is seen in opposition to a Christianity its students in the main wished to supplement, not contradict, through their patient excavation of the sources of ancient God-inspired wisdom.&quot;
===Individual freedom===
Historian Steven Kreis expresses a widespread view (derived from the 19th-century Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt), when he writes that: The period from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth worked in favor of the general emancipation of the individual. The city-states of northern Italy had come into contact with the diverse customs of the East, and gradually permitted expression in matters of taste and dress. The writings of Dante, and particularly the doctrines of Petrarch and humanists like Machiavelli, emphasized the virtues of intellectual freedom and individual expression. In the essays of Montaigne the individualistic view of life received perhaps the most persuasive and eloquent statement in the history of literature and philosophy.
Two noteworthy trends in some Renaissance humanists were Renaissance Neo-Platonism and Hermeticism, which through the works of figures like Nicholas of Kues, Giordano Bruno, Cornelius Agrippa, Campanella and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola sometimes came close to constituting a new religion itself. Of these two, Hermeticism has had great continuing influence in Western thought, while the former mostly dissipated as an intellectual trend, leading to movements in Western esotericism such as Theosophy and New Age thinking. The &quot;Yates thesis&quot; of Frances Yates holds that before falling out of favour, esoteric Renaissance thought introduced several concepts that were useful for the development of scientific method, though this remains a matter of controversy.

===Sixteenth century and beyond===

Though humanists continued to use their scholarship in the service of the church into the middle of the sixteenth century and beyond, the sharply confrontational religious atmosphere following the Reformation resulted in the Counter-Reformation that sought to silence challenges to Catholic theology, with similar efforts among the Protestant denominations. Some humanists, even moderate Catholics such as Erasmus, risked being declared heretics for their perceived criticism of the institutional church.

A number of humanists joined the Reformation movement and took over leadership functions, for example, Philipp Melanchthon, Ulrich Zwingli, Martin Luther, Henry VIII, John Calvin, and William Tyndale.

With the Counter-Reformation initiated by the Council of Trent (1545–1563), positions hardened and a strict Catholic orthodoxy based on scholastic philosophy was imposed. However the education systems developed by Jesuits ran on humanist lines.

== Historiography ==

=== Baron thesis ===
Hans Baron (1900–1988) was the inventor of the now ubiquitous term &quot;civic humanism.&quot; First coined in the 1920s and based largely on his studies of Leonardo Bruni, Baron&#x27;s &quot;thesis&quot; proposed the existence of a central strain of humanism, particularly in Florence and Venice, dedicated to republicanism. 

As argued in his &quot;chef-d&#x27;œuvre&quot;, &quot;The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance: Civic Humanism and Republican Liberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny&quot;, the German historian thought that civic humanism originated in around 1402, after the great struggles between Florence and Visconti-led Milan in the 1390s. He considered Petrarch&#x27;s humanism to be a rhetorical, superficial project, and viewed this new strand to be one that abandoned the feudal and supposedly &quot;otherworldly&quot; (i.e., divine) ideology of the Middle Ages in favour of putting the republican state and its freedom at the forefront of the &quot;civic humanist&quot; project. Already controversial at the time of &quot;The Crisis&quot;&#x27; publication, the &quot;Baron Thesis&quot; has been met with even more criticism over the years.

Even in the 1960s, historians Philip Jones and Peter Herde found Baron&#x27;s praise of &quot;republican&quot; humanists naive, arguing that republics were far less liberty-driven than Baron had believed, and were practically as undemocratic as monarchies. James Hankins adds that the disparity in political values between the humanists employed by oligarchies and those employed by princes was not particularly notable, as all of Baron&#x27;s civic ideals were exemplified by humanists serving various types of government. In so arguing, he asserts that a &quot;political reform program is central to the humanist movement founded by Petrarch. But it is not a &#x27;republican&#x27; project in Baron&#x27;s sense of republic; it is not an ideological product associated with a particular regime type.&quot;

=== Garin and Kristeller ===
Two renowned Renaissance scholars, Eugenio Garin and Paul Oskar Kristeller collaborated with one another throughout their careers. But while the two historians were on good terms, they fundamentally disagreed on the nature of Renaissance humanism. 

* Kristeller affirmed that Renaissance humanism used to be viewed just as a project of Classical revival, one that led to great increase in Classical scholarship. But he argued that this theory &quot;fails to explain the ideal of eloquence persistently set forth in the writings of the humanists,&quot; asserting that &quot;their classical learning was incidental to&quot; their being &quot;professional rhetoricians.&quot; Similarly, he considered their influence on philosophy and particular figures&#x27; philosophical output to be incidental to their humanism, viewing grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and ethics to be the humanists&#x27; main concerns. 
* Garin, on the other hand, viewed philosophy itself as being ever-evolving, each form of philosophy being inextricable from the practices of the thinkers of its period. He thus considered the Italian humanists&#x27; break from Scholasticism and newfound freedom to be perfectly in line with this broader sense of philosophy.

During the period in which they argued over these differing views, there was a broader cultural conversation happening regarding Humanism: one revolving around Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger. 
* In 1946, Sartre published a work called &quot;&quot;L&#x27;existentialisme est un humanisme&quot;,&quot; in which he outlined his conception of existentialism as revolving around the belief that &quot;&quot;existence&quot; comes before &quot;essence&quot;&quot;; that man &quot;first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards,&quot; making himself and giving himself purpose. 
* Heidegger, in a response to this work of Sartre&#x27;s, declared: &quot;For this is humanism: meditating and caring, that human beings be human and not inhumane, &quot;inhuman&quot;, that is, outside their essence.&quot; He also discussed a decline in the concept of humanism, pronouncing that it had been dominated by metaphysics and essentially discounting it as philosophy. He also explicitly criticized Italian Renaissance humanism in the letter. 

While this discourse was taking place outside the realm of Renaissance Studies (for more on the evolution of the term &quot;humanism,&quot; see Humanism), this background debate was not irrelevant to Kristeller and Garin&#x27;s ongoing disagreement. Kristeller—who had at one point studied under Heidegger—also discounted (Renaissance) humanism as philosophy, and Garin&#x27;s &quot;Der italienische Humanismus&quot; was published alongside Heidegger&#x27;s response to Sartre—a move that Rubini describes as an attempt &quot;to stage a pre-emptive confrontation between historical humanism and philosophical neo-humanisms.&quot; Garin also conceived of the Renaissance humanists as occupying the same kind of &quot;characteristic angst the existentialists attributed to men who had suddenly become conscious of their radical freedom,&quot; further weaving philosophy with Renaissance humanism.

Hankins summarizes the Kristeller v. Garin debate as:
* Kristeller conceives of professional philosophers as being very formal and method-focused. Renaissance humanists, on the other hand, he viewed to be professional rhetoricians who, using their classically-inspired &quot;paideia&quot; or &quot;institutio&quot;, did improve fields such as philosophy, but without the practice of philosophy being their main goal or function.
* Garin, instead, wanted his &quot;humanist-philosophers to be organic intellectuals,&quot; not constituting a rigid school of thought, but having a shared outlook on life and education that broke with the medieval traditions that came before them.

===I. R. Grigulevich===
According to Russian historian and Stalinist assassin Iosif Grigulevich two characteristic traits of late Renaissance humanism were &quot;its revolt against abstract, Aristotelian modes of thought and its concern with the problems of war, poverty, and social injustice.&quot;

<text>The Seven Sisters are a group of seven private liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States that are historically women&#x27;s colleges. Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and Wellesley College are still women&#x27;s colleges. Vassar College became coeducational in 1969 and Radcliffe College was absorbed in 1999 by Harvard College and now offers programs in advanced study. 

The name &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; is a reference to the Greek myth of the Pleiades, goddesses immortalized as stars in the sky: Maia, Electra, Taygete, Alcyone, Celaeno, Sterope, and Merope.

These colleges were created in the 19th century to provide women with the educational equivalent to the historically all-male Ivy League colleges. (Cornell, one of the eight Ivy League schools, has been open to accepting women since its founding, and admitted Jennie Spencer in 1870).

== History ==

=== 20th Century ===
The consortium was founded in 1915 when Vassar President Henry Noble MacCracken called Vassar, Wellesley, Smith, and Mount Holyoke together “to deliver women opportunities for higher education that would improve the quality of life for the human family and that would put them on an equal footing with men in a democracy that was about to offer them the vote.” The success of this Four College Conference led to the decision to establish a larger and more formal group in 1926 during a second conference held at Bryn Mawr College. That year Bryn Mawr, Barnard, and Radcliffe were added and the group gained the name “Seven Sisters” after the Pleiades. The Seven Sisters in name and standing were meant to mimic the then male “Ivy League”, although Cornell, one of the eight Ivy League school has been open to accepting women since its founding, and admitted Jennie Spencer in 1870. 

The Seven Sisters in the early 20th century would meet to discuss various matters including self-government, teaching, and undergraduate issues. At the top of the list was securing more money to increase the endowments of the college in order to match the pay rates for the professors at elite male universities.

=== 21st Century ===
Each year on a rotating schedule, one of the colleges hosts the Seven Sisters Conference. Each school sends members of their undergraduate student government to discuss matters of self governance, inclusiveness, campus traditions, publicity, and student issues.

From 1982 to 2019, a Seven Sisters Athletic Championship was held between the colleges with events in basketball, crew, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, squash, swimming and diving, tennis and volleyball.

The Seven Sisters Alum Group was started in 2016 by Smith College graduate Jen McNally. It serves alumni and current students of the various colleges. The group has over 80,000 members, including 53,000 alumni and current students. The organization hosts events, both professional and social, sends out a newsletter, provides career related information, and other resources.

Due the transition of Vassar to coeducational and admission of transgender and nonbinary students at other colleges, some have started to refer to the Seven Sisters as the Seven Siblings group. 

==Locations==

Four of the colleges are in Massachusetts, two are in New York, and one is in Pennsylvania.

In Massachusetts, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College are part of the Five College Consortium with Amherst College, Hampshire College, and University of Massachusetts Amherst. Wellesley College has cross-registration and dual-degree programs with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Olin College, and cross-registration with Brandeis University and Babson College. Wellesley College has an exchange program with Spelman College. Radcliffe College shared a common and overlapping history with Harvard College from the time it was founded as &quot;the Harvard Annex&quot; in 1879. Harvard and Radcliffe integrated genders in 1977, but Radcliffe continued to be the sponsoring college for women at Harvard until the entities officially merged in 1999.

In New York, Vassar College ultimately became co-educational in 1969 and remains independent. Barnard College was Columbia University&#x27;s women&#x27;s liberal arts undergraduate college until its all-male coordinate school Columbia College went co-ed in 1983; Barnard continues to be a women&#x27;s undergraduate college affiliated with (but still legally separate from) Columbia, and students receive their degree from Columbia University.

In Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College, along with Haverford College and Swarthmore College, make up the Tri-College Consortium, which belongs to the Quaker Consortium along with nearby University of Pennsylvania. Bryn Mawr students may attend classes at Haverford, Swarthmore, and Penn, and vice versa. A merger between Bryn Mawr and Haverford College was considered at one point.

==Background==
===Timeline===


===History of the colleges and women&#x27;s education===
Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra note that &quot;independent nonprofit women&#x27;s colleges, which included the &#x27;Seven Sisters&#x27;, were founded to provide educational opportunities to women equal to those available to men and were geared toward women who wanted to study the liberal arts&quot;.
The colleges also offered broader opportunities in academia to women, hiring many female faculty members and administrators.

Early proponents of education for women were Sarah Pierce (Litchfield Female Academy, 1792); Catharine Beecher (Hartford Female Seminary, 1823); Zilpah P. Grant Banister (Ipswich Female Seminary, 1828); and Mary Lyon. Lyon was involved in the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of &quot;Wheaton Female Seminary&quot; (now Wheaton College, Massachusetts) in 1834. In 1837, Lyon founded &quot;Mount Holyoke Female Seminary&quot; (Mount Holyoke College). Mount Holyoke received its collegiate charter in 1888 and became Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. It became Mount Holyoke College in 1893. Vassar, however, was the first of the Seven Sisters to be chartered as a college in 1861.

Wellesley College was chartered in 1870 as the &quot;Wellesley Female Seminary&quot;, and was renamed &quot;Wellesley College&quot; in 1873. It opened to students in 1875. Smith College was chartered in 1871 and opened its doors in 1875. Bryn Mawr opened in 1885.

Radcliffe College grew out of the Women&#x27;s Education Association of Boston, founded by a group of influential women, including Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, whose late husband was a famous Harvard scientist. Radcliffe College was founded in 1879 and chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1894. It was informally called &quot;The Harvard Annex&quot; because Harvard professors repeated the lectures they had given to male Harvard students there until 1943. By 1946, the majority of Harvard College courses were offered to both female Radcliffe students and male Harvard students. The schools further integrated in the 1960s, and in 1963 the first Harvard degrees were conferred on Radcliffe women. Despite having joint admissions, women&#x27;s degrees would continue to bear both Harvard and Radcliffe seals until 1999, when the merger of the two schools was completed. Since 1999, all undergraduate students have received diplomas bearing the seal of Harvard College, and been identified as Harvard students. Radcliffe College no longer exists as an undergraduate institution, but Radcliffe class reunions take place at Harvard each year. The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study was created following the merger in 1999, and today offers non-degree instruction and executive education programs.

The &quot;Barnard Bulletin&quot; in 1976 described the relationship between Barnard College and Columbia University as &quot;intricate and ambiguous&quot;. Barnard president Debora Spar said in 2012 that &quot;the relationship is admittedly a complicated one, a unique one and one that may take a few sentences to explain to the outside community&quot;. Outside sources often describe Barnard as part of Columbia; &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2013, for example, called Barnard &quot;an undergraduate women&#x27;s college of Columbia University&quot;. Its front gates state &quot;Barnard College of Columbia University&quot;. Barnard describes itself as &quot;both an independently incorporated educational institution and an official college of Columbia University&quot; that is &quot;one of the University&#x27;s four colleges, but we&#x27;re largely autonomous, with our own leadership and purse strings&quot;, and advises students to state &quot;Barnard College, Columbia University&quot; or &quot;Barnard College of Columbia University&quot; on résumés. Facebook includes Barnard students and alumnae within the Columbia interest group. Columbia describes Barnard as an affiliated institution that is a faculty of the university or is &quot;in partnership with&quot; it. Both the college and Columbia evaluate Barnard faculty for tenure, and Barnard graduates receive Columbia diploma; signed by both the Barnard and the Columbia presidents.

===Coeducation===
Radcliffe College and Vassar College are no longer women&#x27;s colleges. Radcliffe merged completely into Harvard College in 1999, and no longer exists as a separate undergraduate institution. The component parts of its campus, the Radcliffe Quadrangle and Radcliffe Yard, retain the designation &quot;Radcliffe&quot; in perpetuity, and serve or house both male and female students to this day. Vassar declined an offer to merge with Yale University and became independently coeducational in 1969.

Barnard College was founded in 1889 as a women&#x27;s college affiliated with Columbia University. However, it is independently governed, while making available to its students the instruction and the facilities of Columbia University. Columbia College, the university&#x27;s largest liberal-arts undergraduate school, began admitting women in 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard for a merger along the lines of the one between Harvard College and Radcliffe and between Brown and Pembroke. Barnard has an independent faculty (subject to Columbia University tenure approval) and board of trustees. Columbia University issues its diplomas, however, and most of Barnard&#x27;s classes and activities are open to all members of Columbia University, male or female, and vice versa, in a reciprocal arrangement dating from 1900.

In 1969 Bryn Mawr and Haverford College (then all-male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibility of coeducation as well but decided against it.

As with Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and Wellesley College decided against adopting coeducation. Mount Holyoke engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of David Truman over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, &quot;after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women&#x27;s college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision.&quot; Smith also made a similar decision in 1971. Two years later, Wellesley also announced that it would not adopt coeducation.

===Transgender issues===

Since the late 2000s, there has been discussion and controversy over how to accommodate transgender inclusion at the remaining women&#x27;s colleges. This has risen to attention due to students that have in the course of their times at the colleges transitioned from women to other genders, and trans women applicants. Mount Holyoke became the first Seven Sisters college to accept transgender women in 2014. Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Smith, and Wellesley College announced trans-inclusive admissions policies in 2015.

<doc id="290240" wikidata="Q1754640" url="?curid=290240" title="Seven Sisters, East Sussex">
<text>The Seven Sisters are a series of chalk sea cliffs on the English Channel coast, and are a stretch of the sea-eroded section of the South Downs range of hills, in the county of East Sussex, in south-east England. The Seven Sisters cliffs run between the mouth of the River Cuckmere near Seaford, and the chalk headland of Beachy Head outside of Eastbourne. The dips or swales that separate each of the seven crests from the next are the remnants of dry valleys in the chalk South Downs which are being gradually eroded by the sea.

Some of the cliffs and adjacent countryside make up the Seven Sisters Country Park, which is bounded on its inland side by the A259 road, and is itself a part of the larger South Downs National Park.

==Cliffs==
From west to east, the sequence starts just east of Cuckmere Haven. The cliff peaks and the dips between them are individually named. Listed below, the peaks are in italics. There are seven hills, with an eighth one being created by the erosion of the sea. 

*&quot;Haven Brow&quot; 
*Short Bottom
*&quot;Short Brow&quot;
*Limekiln Bottom
*&quot;Rough Brow&quot;
*Rough Bottom
*&quot;Brass Point&quot;
*Gap Bottom
*&quot;Flagstaff Point&quot; (continuing into Flagstaff Brow)
*Flagstaff Bottom
*&quot;Flat Hill&quot;
*Flathill Bottom
*&quot;Baily&#x27;s Hill&quot;
*Michel Dean 
*&quot;Went Hill Brow&quot; ().

Just east of the last peak is Birling Gap. Beyond, on the top of the next hill, is Belle Tout Lighthouse and beyond that Beachy Head. A lighthouse in the sea marks the latter headland.

The South Downs Way runs along the edge of the cliffs, taking a very undulating course. Many landmarks around the area are named after the cliffs, including the Seven Sisters Sheep Centre.

==Film and television==

The Seven Sisters cliffs are occasionally used in filmmaking and television production as a stand-in for the more famous White Cliffs of Dover, since they are relatively free of anachronistic modern development and are also allowed to erode naturally. As a result, the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head remain a bright white colour, whereas the White Cliffs of Dover are protected due to the important port and are therefore increasingly covered in vegetation and are greening as a result. They are also featured at the beginning of the film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,&quot; and at the end of the film &quot;Atonement&quot; where Robbie and Cecilia always wanted to live.

The Seven Sisters are seen in the background of the Quidditch World Cup in the 2005 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, and also when Slartibartfast is showing Arthur Dent the &quot;new&quot; Earth in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, released the same year.

Much of the 2015 feature film &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot; was filmed around the Seven Sisters.

The 2019 film &quot;Hope Gap&quot;, starring Bill Nighy and Annette Bening was against the backdrop of Seaford Head. The film is named after the distinctive area of chalk cliff between Seaford and Cuckmere Haven. In 2020, Jessica Swale&#x27;s feature film debut &quot;Summerland&quot; premiered, shot around the Seaford area, featuring numerous views of the Seven Sisters.

The Netflix series &quot;Anatomy of a Scandal&quot; had shots of the Seven Sisters Cliffs that featured Sienna Miller and Rupert Friend. 

An east-facing photo of the Seven Sisters is included as one of the default landscape wallpapers packaged with Microsoft Windows 7.

The Seven Sisters is featured in episode 5 of the Netflix series &quot;3 Body Problem&quot;.

From its inception in 1990 until 2002, the domain was administered by the Joint University Computer Centre. 

In 2002, through a &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot; with the Hong Kong government, HKIRC took over the administration of &#x27;.hk&#x27;, while the Hong Kong Domain Name Registration Corporation Limited (HKDNR), its wholly owned subsidiary of HKIRC, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the domain registration service . 

On June 25, 2010, ICANN approved the use of the internationalized country code top-level domain (&quot;hongkong&quot; in simplified Chinese characters and traditional Chinese characters; DNS name: ) by HKIRC. This TLD was added to the DNS in July 2010. 

The Pre Launch Priority Registration for was started on February 22, 2011. The first domain was activated on March 23, 2011. domain categories were opened for public registration since May 31, 2011.

<text>The bonefish (Albula vulpes) is the type species of the bonefish family (Albulidae), the only family in order Albuliformes.

==Taxonomy==
Bonefish were once believed to be a single species with a global distribution, however 9 different species have since been identified. There are three identified species in the Atlantic and six in the Pacific. &quot;Albula vulpes&quot; is the largest and most widespread of the Atlantic species.

== Distribution ==
This species inhabits warm subtropical and tropical waters of the western Atlantic, and is found off the coasts of southern Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and the West Indies.

==Description==

The bonefish weighs up to and measures up to long. The color of bonefish can range from very silver sides and slight darker backs to olive green backs that blend to the silver side. Slight shading on the scales often leads to very soft subtle lines that run the flank of the fish from the gills to the tail. The bases of the pectoral fins are sometimes yellow.
Bonefish can live up to 20 years and reach sexual maturity at 2–3 years of age (when they&#x27;re over 17 inches (43.18 cm) long). Larvae drift for an average of 53 days. Juveniles often live over open sandy bottoms.

==Behavior==
An amphidromous species, it lives in inshore tropical waters and moves onto shallow mudflats or sand flats to feed with the incoming tide. Adults and juveniles may shoal together, and mature adults may be found singly or in pairs.

The bonefish feeds on benthic worms, fry, crustaceans, and mollusks. Ledges, drop-offs, and clean, healthy seagrass beds yield abundant small prey such as crabs and shrimp. It may follow stingrays to catch the small animals they root from the substrate.

In the Los Roques archipelago bonefish primarily hunt glass minnows, however this behavior is atypical.

== Fishing and cuisine==
Bonefish are considered one of the premier fly and light tackle game fish. Fishing for bonefish, called bonefishing, is a popular sport in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, southern Florida, Cargados Carajos. Since bonefish live in shallow inshore water, fishing may be done by wading or from a shallow-draft boat. Bonefishing is mostly done for the sport, so the fish are released, but they may also be eaten in less developed areas. A typical Bahamian recipe is a split fish seasoned with pepper sauce and salt, then baked.

Bonefish are notoriously wary and great skill must be taken both in approach and presentation when fishing for them. English-speaking fishermen often refer to them as &quot;grey ghosts.&quot;

<doc id="290253" wikidata="Q6084644" url="?curid=290253" title="Ismael &quot;El Mayo&quot; Zambada">
<text>Ismael Mario Zambada García (born 1 January 1948), also known as [[Mayo people|El Mayo]], is a Mexican former drug lord and top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, an international crime syndicate based in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Before he assumed leadership of the entire cartel, he allegedly served as the logistical coordinator for its Zambada García faction, which has overseen the trafficking of cocaine and heroin into Chicago and other US cities by aircraft, narcosubs, container ships, go-fast boats, fishing vessels, buses, rail cars, tractor trailers, and automobiles. 

Until his arrest in July 2024, he had never been arrested or incarcerated. He was arrested in El Paso, Texas, United States, and reported to be in US custody on 25 July 2024.

==Career==
Zambada has historically worked closely with the Juárez Cartel and the Carrillo Fuentes family, while maintaining independent ties to Colombian cocaine suppliers. 

In 1989, when Mexican drug lord Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo was arrested, his organization split into two opposing factions: the Tijuana Cartel whose leadership was inherited by his nephews and heirs, the Arellano Félix brothers and the Sinaloa Cartel whose leadership fell to former lieutenants Héctor Luis Palma Salazar, Adrián Gómez González, Ismael Zambada García, Ignacio Coronel Villarreal, and Joaquín Guzmán Loera (&quot;El Chapo&quot;). The Sinaloa Cartel drug lords were active in the states of Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, Sonora, Nuevo León, and Nayarit.

Since 1998, Zambada has been wanted by Mexico&#x27;s attorney general&#x27;s office, when it issued bounties totaling $2.8 million USD on him and five other leaders of the Juárez Cartel. 

In 2006, the administration of President Felipe Calderón launched an offensive against Mexico&#x27;s drug trafficking networks. The Tijuana Cartel, the largest and most sophisticated of the Mexican cartels at the time, received the brunt of the blows. Taking advantage of the pressure being placed on the Tijuana Cartel, other drug bosses, most notably Ismael Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán, began to encroach on strongholds in northwestern Mexico, leading to full-scale war.

Zambada&#x27;s organization, the Sinaloa Cartel, receives multi-ton quantities of cocaine, mostly by sea from Colombian sources. It uses a variety of methods, including airplanes, trucks, cars, boats, and tunnels to transport the cocaine to the United States. Members of the cartel smuggle the cocaine to distribution cells in Arizona, Atlanta, California, Illinois, and New York. Zambada has been operating primarily in the states of Sinaloa and Durango, with influence along a large portion of Mexico&#x27;s Pacific coast, as well as in Cancún, Quintana Roo, Sonora, and Nuevo León.
In 2007, Zambada was featured on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, and the FBI has been offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his capture.

In 2011, it was thought Zambada may have had plastic surgery and disguised himself to move throughout Mexico. Zambada headed the Sinaloa Cartel in partnership with Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán until 2016, when El Chapo was captured. Since 2016, Zambada is thought to have assumed full command of the Sinaloa Cartel and to be Mexico&#x27;s most enduring and powerful drug lord. 

In 2019 his son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, testified against Joaquín Guzmán Loera and recounted the shipment of tons of drugs by his father, saying &quot;that his father&#x27;s bribery budget was often as much as $1 million per month, with bribes going to many high-level Mexican public officials.&quot;

== Capture ==
On 25 July 2024, Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López, son of El Chapo (Joaquín Guzmán Loera), were arrested in the US at a private airfield in El Paso, Texas, Zambada was reportedly lured by Guzmán López under false pretenses of looking to buy property in Mexico that led to his arrest. However, both were arrested and are expected to be tried in the US.

== Trial ==
On September 13, 2024, he had his first hearing in a New York court, in which he pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to the crimes of drug trafficking, illegal possession of weapons and criminal enterprise.

Zambada&#x27;s next court date took place on January 15, 2025.

Zambada submitted a petition to the Mexican government requesting extradition to the country to face trial there and an intervention to rule out any death penalty. &quot;No one is defending this person&quot; and &quot;Beyond the person and his crimes, the issue is how he was detained,&quot; said President Claudia Sheinbaum regarding the petition review. The Mexican government is also investigating anyone involved in handing over a Mexican citizen to foreign agents to be charged with treason.

== Personal life ==
Zambada is married to Rosario Niebla Cardoza. He has four sons and four daughters. His wife and sons, Serafín Zambada Ortiz (alias &quot;el Sera&quot;, as of 2018 arrested and released), and Ismael Zambada Imperial (alias &quot;el Mayito gordo&quot;, convicted), as well as his four daughters, María Teresa, Midiam Patricia, Mónica del Rosario, and Modesta, have played an active role in narcotics&#x27; distribution and money laundering. On 18 March 2009, his son Vicente Zambada Niebla was arrested by the Mexican Army. His other son, Ismael &quot;Mayito&quot; Zambada Jr. has been sought for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance in the United States. 

On 20 October 2010, some of his relatives were arrested in Mexico City on drug trafficking charges: Ismael&#x27;s brother, Jesus &quot;The King&quot; Zambada, along with Ismael&#x27;s son and nephew.

On 18 June 2014, his son-in-law, Juan Gabriel González Ibarra, husband of Midiam Patricia, died after suffering an electric shock at his home in Culiacán.

In June 2020, former DEA agent Mike Vigil revealed that Zambada was &quot;sick with diabetes.&quot;

==In popular culture==
&quot;Don Ismael&quot;, a character inspired by Zambada García, was featured in the 2017 television series &quot;El Chapo&quot;

<doc id="290257" wikidata="Q797905" url="?curid=290257" title="Baby sign language">
<text>Baby sign language is the use of manual signing allowing infants and toddlers to communicate emotions, desires, and objects prior to spoken language development. With guidance and encouragement, signing develops from a natural stage in infant development known as gesture. These gestures are taught in conjunction with speech to hearing children, and are not the same as a sign language. Some common benefits that have been found through the use of baby sign programs include an increased parent-child bond and communication, decreased frustration, and improved self-esteem for both the parent and child. Researchers have found that baby sign neither benefits nor harms the language development of infants. Promotional products and ease of information access have increased the attention that baby sign receives, making it pertinent that caregivers become educated before making the decision to use baby sign.

== Overview ==

Baby sign involves enhanced gestures and altered signs that infants are taught in conjunction with spoken words with the intention of creating richer parent-child communication. The main reason that parents use baby sign is with hope that it will reduce the frustration involved in trying to interpret their pre-verbal child&#x27;s needs. It can be considered a useful method of communication in the early developmental stages, since speech production follows children&#x27;s ability to express themselves through bodily movement.

Baby sign is distinct from sign language. Baby sign is used by hearing parents with hearing children to improve communication. Sign languages, including ASL, BSL, ISL and others, are natural languages, typically used in the Deaf community. Sign languages maintain their own grammar, and sentence structure. Because sign languages are as complex to learn as any spoken language, simplified signs are often used with infants in baby sign. Teaching baby signs allows for greater flexibility in the form of sign and does not require the parent to learn the grammar of a sign language. Baby signs are usually gestures or signs taken from the sign language community and modified to make them easier for an infant to form.

It is common for the difference between symbolic gestures and baby signs to be mistaken. Symbolic gestures are a form of communication that children adopt before they develop the ability to produce spoken language. This includes pointing to what they want or using a hand motion in conjunction with a word which allows greater communication for infants. Writing on the topic, Jane Collingwood states that &quot;Infants from about six months of age can begin to learn the basic signs, which cover such objects and concepts as &quot;thirsty&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;hungry&quot;, &quot;sleepy&quot;, &quot;pacifier&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;play&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, and &quot;teddy bear&quot;.&quot; Typically, developing children will produce their first gestures between the ages of 9 and 12 months without any prompting or assistance from a caregiver. Infants learn how to use their body language, eye gaze, and hand gestures as a way to attract attention and communicate. Once children gain some language production, they will couple language with gesture to further communicate. Gesture remains present in all individuals at any age which is a distinguishing factor from baby sign.

==Pros and cons==
===Suggested benefits===
Baby sign promotes communication before a child is able to verbally communicate with others. Since gestures are part of normal speech, teaching baby sign allows infants to learn an aspect of communication that is used with language. It is not, however designed to replace language. This demonstrates that infants are able to learn gestures before mastering verbal skills. Therefore, those who learn these simplified signs may enhance their cognitive development by gaining language skills through both visual and auditory modes.

In an article in &quot;The Psychologist,&quot; Gwyneth Doherty-Sneddon has considered in detail the theory behind the growth of this phenomenon and some of the claims made by its supporters. Doherty-Sneddon points out that baby sign is not entirely new. Variations have been used by speech and language therapists for decades with children who have impairments to either their speech, cognitive abilities, or both. It is widely recognized that communication is at the heart of cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral development in children. Baby sign may assist in improving these significant developmental functions.

Baby signs create mutual attention between the parent and child leading to further elaboration of what the infant is communicating. A study collected self-reports from mothers who had engaged in a baby sign training workshop, to clarify whether or not signing with their child would create added parental stress and/or enhance parent-child communication. Overall the parents did not express feeling heightened stress or frustration from the baby sign training process but rather they reported a greater ability to understand their child. This richer communication was found to lead to a more positive interaction with their child which overall benefits the establishment of an earlier parent-child bond.

Children who learned enhanced symbolic gestures performed better on both expressive and receptive verbal language tests compared to those who had not been encouraged to learn such gestures. Receptive language means being able to recognize words and signs, while expressive language involves the process of forming words or signs. Research has shown that enhanced gesture input for hearing children is the first step toward successfully mastering gesture use, and the use of representational form and symbolic communicative function. Improved symbolic gestures may contribute to language development by providing children with increased knowledge of concepts by explaining the functions of the objects that they are exposed to. In support of expressive language development studies have shown that learning symbolic gestures can lead to advanced verbal development and accelerated language acquisition. An effective baby sign workshop also resulted in the improvement of numerous areas of development by comparing the child&#x27;s results before and after the workshop. Some of these areas included communicative, cognitive, social, adaptive behavior, physical, and fine motor skill development of children. This enhancement however, is short-lived (from between 12 and 15 months of age). Doherty-Sneddon argues, however, that this timescale represents only a general norm. The enhancement and advantage is far more extended in the many toddlers who do not speak until well after their second birthdays.

Doherty-Sneddon also states a key issue is ensuring that sufficient and appropriately designed research is available to back the claims made in relation to baby signing. A literature review concluded that although benefits were reported in 13 of 17 studies, various weaknesses in the methods used for baby sign studies leave the evidence unsupported. Certainly, research into the effects of baby signing needs better control groups, such as children who are involved in equally interesting and fun activities based around adult and child language interaction, but not baby signing. This suggestion for further research implies that it may not be the baby signs themselves that facilitate language development but rather the underlying benefit being active, joint attention that is stimulated by baby sign.

Therefore, the enhanced joint visual attention during parent-child interaction empowers the infant to focus the topic and context of the conversation, clarify concepts, and creates added practice with symbolic interaction. These underlying mechanisms of baby sign are proposed to create benefits for the infant such as; enhancing vocabulary, advancing cognitive development, reducing tantrums and frustration, and improving the parent-child relationship and communication. More specifically language development is improved by advancing comprehension, promoting literacy and successfully allowing the infant to express their needs so the parent becomes more responsive and observant of their baby.

=== Why it may be neither beneficial nor harmful ===
Researchers have suggested the possibility of parents and experimenters being overly liberal in attributing sign or word status to early attempts at communication by children. Puccini and Liszkowski found that when infants associate labels with objects, they use verbal cues more frequently than gestures to make these associations. The process of further facilitating gesturing with baby signs is suggested to possibly cause interference toward children&#x27;s mapping of these words. This may be a result of infants lacking enough attention to take in these two types of information and process it at the same time. It is suggested that these labels, and further through the facilitation of baby sign, that it is unlikely that baby sign is facilitating speech development in infants.

Baby sign programs encourage parents to improve their communication skills between themselves and their infants before they have developed speech. Kirk and colleagues have found that the results of their study with hearing infants provided no evidence to support that a child&#x27;s language development would benefit from learning baby sign. They also found that children who participated in baby sign had similar language development to children who did not learn baby sign. It is suggested that participating in baby sign may be an unnecessary effort with infants when being motivated by the hopes of advanced language learning for the child. However, it was found that mothers who used baby sign with their infants encouraged increased independence with them and supported a higher level of independence for their child. Another conducted research study has shown that there are no significant differences found with language acquisition between infants who are receiving or not receiving exposure to baby sign, including reaching language milestones. Although no support for using baby sign was found in this study, there was also no negative effects found to be associated with language development when using baby sign with your child. It is possible that baby sign is working in support of infant&#x27;s spoken language, but was not found to further their later language development.

The results of multiple studies regarding baby sign have found that the advantages provided do not go beyond children over the age of two years old. The results of this literature review have not shown support that baby sign increases a child&#x27;s linguistic development. When teaching a child baby sign, an infant&#x27;s attention is directed away from what they are interested in and is redirected towards the adult and the desired sign. This interaction has been claimed to increase joint attention between parent and child, but has yet to be studied enough in research literature. It has also been proposed by researchers that baby sign may increase parental stress rather than decrease it because of busy lifestyles that may be disrupting interactions between parents and children. Teaching baby sign outside of research settings does not allow for the parent to raise questions or concerns to trained individuals. Reaching fundamental linguistic milestones and the natural course of children&#x27;s language development has been suggested to be disrupted because of the unnatural intervention in language development that baby sign provides, supported by the lack of support in prior studies which have been analyzed.

==Learning baby sign==
There are numerous concepts to keep in mind when encouraging baby sign. Caregivers should ensure that they have their infant&#x27;s attention, maintain consistency with what sign is used and how it is used in relation to an item, repeat signs often, encourage the infant, and be alert to recognize when the infant is signing back.

When it comes to infants who have not yet acquired language abilities, signs are an easy and readily accessible form of communication. Prior to infants learning specific signs or developing language skills, they acquire the spontaneous use of gesture. An infant&#x27;s first gesture may appear between 9–12 months of age, often classified as pointing. Gesturing gradually increases as infants connect pointing to word meaning, making a gesture-plus-word combination that will evolve into a two word combination. It is thought that gestures may be easier for infants to remember than a name alone since a gesture is representative of what the child can picture happening, when thinking about the item.

To determine how infant communication is influenced by gesture and speech, Iverson and Goldin-Meadow conducted a study. Infants in the study used eye gaze, body position, and vocalization to attract and direct their target audience&#x27;s attention, while gesturing to items. Results looked to see if the gestures that children use are related to the word they say while doing the gesture. Iverson and Goldin-Meadow found that infants gesture for items that they did not have the ability to express with words. When words were produced by the child, they typically were ones that the child had already been gesturing for. This shows that gesture is directly linked to the words that children will produce.

Symbolic gesture is the specific term that encompasses baby sign. This form of gesture aids in communication through the use of hand movements that represent an item or feeling. Infants are quick to note if there is a connection between an item and a symbolic gesture. Once they make the connection infants will imitate actions that are produced by the caregiver. Consistency from the caregiver is crucial during the teaching and feedback stage in order for infants to learn from repetition. This repetition applies to how the caregiver uses the sign and in what way the sign is associated with the object or emotion. If the association changes then the child will have a harder time understanding how the symbolic gesture links to the item. One way for caregivers to ensure the infant associates the symbolic gesture with the object or emotion is to gain the infant&#x27;s attention, and say the name of the object at the same time that the sign is performed.

Infants watch their caregiver during everyday routines and situations. This observation allows infants to learn symbols by borrowing the actions from the observed routine. A natural association occurs between signs and items, allowing infants to explore and express new ideas prior to language development. Infants will learn to associate a word with the general motion that they carry out while using an object, such as throwing a ball. After this association children begin to make connections with the word and motion alone, in this case a throwing gesture. Infants now can make the throwing gesture to alert caregivers that they wish to throw a ball, thus increasing their non-verbal communication. Representative abilities such as these are further used by infants to demonstrate emotional feelings as they associate a motion or sign with a feeling.

Further studies demonstrate that increasing the use of gesture, not necessarily use of a sign language, can increase the richness of a child&#x27;s linguistic development. It is suggested that learning signs happens over a period of time, inferring the importance of caregivers being patient with children as it takes more than a brief interaction between parent and child. Parent-child interactions are vital to the learning of baby sign since the infant looks to the caregiver for guidance. By consciously demonstrating the sign to the infant, the caregiver and infant are sustaining joint attention which increases communication. When caregivers aid infants in creating the sign with their hands, they are further increasing encouragement, repetition, and communication. It is the caregiver&#x27;s job to not only teach specific hand signals, beyond what infants naturally pick up, but to provide support and feedback to infants when signs are produced correctly. Through making a connection, and parental encouragement of that connection, infants can learn and actively engage in baby sign language.

In 1998, a program was conducted at A. Sophie Rogers Infant-Toddler Laboratory School in Ohio State University by Kimberlee Whaley. Certain signs used in American Sign Language were taught to infants, along with their teachers, to establish whether these signs could be used to increase effective communication with the very young children. From about the age of 9 months, the children began to use the signs they had learned; these included words like &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;juice&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, and &quot;sleep&quot;. The program found that children would also use the signs they learned in the classroom to communicate with parents at home. Based on this study, learning baby sign appears to be a beneficial tool for children if implemented in schools and day cares.

==Media and Internet influences==
Due to promotional products, easy access to baby sign tutorial videos, and representations in popular culture, parental attempts at signing with their baby may be more focused on the popularity social aspects instead of an intention to potentially enhance their child&#x27;s communication skills.

A study examined the degree to which information about baby sign found on the internet was based on research. Results found thirty-three websites that all promoted baby sign and the benefits associated. Over 90% of the information referred to opinion articles or promotional products encouraging parents to sign, with little to no basis in research. Although websites claim that using baby sign will reduce tantrums, increase infant&#x27;s self-esteem, satisfaction, feelings of accomplishment, increase parent-child bonding, and decrease frustration, the sites do not provide enough research-based evidence to support these claims.

Another study examined internet information found using Google Scholar as well as a few academic databases. Researchers examined whether results claimed baby sign encouraged developmental, social, cognitive, and language skills while achieving a greater bond between parent and child. The goal of asking this question was to find information that allows parents, caregivers, childhood educators, and clinicians to make informed decisions about the amount of emphasis to place on baby sign. When all the cited material was gathered there were 1747 articles with only 10 articles providing research regarding infant&#x27;s developmental outcome in connection to baby sign. Consensus gathered from these 10 articles states that baby sign, as used by the commercially advertised product authored by Acredolo and Goodwyn, does not benefit language production or parent-child relationships. However, there is also no evidence from these articles that baby sign is in any way harmful to infants. Through these two studies it is illustrated that websites may not contain 100% research based information. Individuals looking for information regarding the pros and cons of using baby sign should ensure they are accessing sites backed by research and not opinion.

Commercial products available to parents participating in baby sign workshops or implementing it at home, are found to be comparable to the quality of products used in research studies. It is suggested that parents be cautious of baby sign products as it is difficult to assess the credibility of commercialized products for facilitating baby sign.

<text>Zakir Hussain Allarakha Qureshi (9March 195115December 2024) was an Indian tabla player, composer, percussionist, music producer, and film actor. Widely regarded as the greatest tabla player of his generation and one of the greatest percussionists of all time, he was known for bringing Indian classical music to a global audience. He was the eldest son of the tabla player Alla Rakha, and won four Grammy Awards.

Hussain was awarded the United States National Endowment for the Arts&#x27; National Heritage Fellowship, the highest award given to traditional artists and musicians. He was also awarded the Government of India&#x27;s Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1990 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, &quot;Ratna Sadsya&quot;, in 2018.

Hussain received seven Grammy Award nominations, with four wins, including three in 2024. He was described as the most recognizable exponent of the tabla by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; marveled that the &quot;blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird&#x27;s wings.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Zakir Hussain Allarakha Qureshi was born on 9 March 1951 in present-day Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, to tabla master Alla Rakha Qureshi.

Hussain started performing in concerts by the age of 7 and began touring by the age of 12.

He attended St. Michael&#x27;s High School in Mahim and graduated from St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai.

==Career==
Hussain played on George Harrison&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; and John Handy&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Hard Work&quot;. He also performed on Van Morrison&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Into the Music&quot; and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Powerlight&quot;.

Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, who had known Hussain since the 1960s, invited him to create the special album &quot;Planet Drum&quot;, featuring drummers from different parts of the world. Featured along with Hussain, from India, was Vikku Vinayakram, with whom Hussain had collaborated in Shakti. The first &quot;Planet Drum&quot; album, released in 1991 on the Rykodisc label, went on to earn the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album, the first Grammy ever awarded in this category. The &quot;Global Drum Project&quot; album and tour brought Mickey Hart, Hussain, Sikiru Adepoju, and Giovanni Hidalgo together again in a reunion sparked by the 15th anniversary of the &quot;Planet Drum&quot; album. The album &quot;Global Drum Project&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album at the 51st Grammy Awards Ceremony held on 8 February 2009.

Hussain composed, performed and acted as Indian music advisor for the Malayalam film &quot;Vanaprastham&quot;, a 1999 Cannes Film Festival entry which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFI Fest) in 1999, and won awards at 2000 Istanbul International Film Festival (Turkey), 2000 Mumbai International Film Festival (India), and 2000 National Film Awards (India). He composed soundtracks for several movies, most notably &quot;In Custody&quot; and &quot;The Mystic Masseur&quot; by Ismail Merchant, and played tabla on the soundtracks of Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Little Buddha,&quot; and other films. He starred in several films specifically showcasing his musical performance both solo and with different bands, including the 1998 documentary &quot;Zakir and His Friends&quot;, and the documentary &quot;The Speaking Hand: Zakir Hussain and the Art of the Indian Drum&quot; (2003 Sumantra Ghosal). Hussain co-starred as Inder Lal in the 1983 Merchant Ivory film &quot;Heat and Dust&quot;, for which he was an associate music director.

Hussain was a founding member of Bill Laswell&#x27;s world music supergroup Tabla Beat Science.

In 2016, Hussain was amongst many musicians invited by President Obama to the International Jazz Day 2016 All-Star Global Concert at the White House.

At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to receive three Grammys at one ceremony: &quot;This Moment&quot; for Best Global Music Album, &quot;Pashto&quot; for the Best Global Music Performance, and &quot;As We Speak&quot; for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album.

Haridas Vhatkar made Hussain&#x27;s tablas for more than 18 years. Haridas said he learned how to make tablas so he could specially make them for Hussain.

In a conversation with author Nasreen Munni Kabir, as written in her book &quot;Zakir Hussain: A Life in Music,&quot; Hussain stated that he did not play at private gatherings, corporate events, or weddings; he believed music should not be heard at events where folks come to socialise, drink or enjoy a meal, but instead should be the sole purpose of the event.

Hussain was named an Old Dominion Fellow by the Humanities Council at Princeton University, where he resided for the 2005–2006 semester as full professor in the music department. He was also a visiting professor at Stanford University. In May 2022, he was conferred the honorary Doctor of Law (LLD) degree for his contribution to the field of music by the University of Mumbai.

==Book==
Nasreen Munni Kabir compiled 15 interview sessions (each lasting about 2 hours) from 2016 to 2017 into the book &quot;Zakir Hussain: A Life in Music&quot;, which was published in 2018. The book takes the reader through Hussain&#x27;s life from his youth, his years of intense training, and his growth as a musician.

==Personal life==
Hussain married Antonia Minnecola, a Kathak dancer and teacher, who was also his manager. They had two daughters, Anisa Qureshi and Isabella Qureshi. Anisa graduated from UCLA and is a film maker. Isabella is studying dance in Manhattan.

Hussain has two brothers: Taufiq Qureshi, a percussionist, and Fazal Qureshi, also a tabla player. Their brother Munawar died at a young age when he was attacked by a rabid dog. His eldest sister Bilquis died before Hussain was born. Another sister, Razia, died due to complications during a cataract surgery, just a few hours before their father&#x27;s death in 2000. He has another sister named Khurshid.
==Death and legacy==
Hussain died from complications arising due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in San Francisco, California, on 15 December 2024, at the age of 73.

According to Neyaz Farooquee, he was one of the world&#x27;s greatest tabla players. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was &quot;a true genius who revolutionised the world of Indian classical music.&quot; English guitarist John McLaughlin, who performed with Hussain in the band Shakti, described him as &quot;the King, in whose hands, rhythm became magic.&quot;

<doc id="290266" wikidata="Q1551978" url="?curid=290266" title="Encomium">
<text>Encomium (: encomia) is a Latin word deriving from the Ancient Greek &quot;enkomion&quot; (), meaning &quot;the praise of a person or thing.&quot; Another Latin equivalent is &quot;laudatio&quot;, a speech in praise of someone or something. 

Originally was the song sung by the chorus at the κῶμος, or festal procession, held at the Panhellenic Games in honour of the victor, either on the day of his victory or on its anniversary. The word came afterwards to denote any song written in celebration of distinguished persons, and in later times any spoken or written panegyric whatever.

&quot;Encomium&quot; also refers to several distinct aspects of rhetoric:

* A general category of oratory
* A method within rhetorical pedagogy
* A figure of speech praising a person or thing, but occurring on a smaller scale than an entire speech
* The eighth exercise in the progymnasmata series
* A literary genre that included five elements: prologue, birth and upbringing, acts of the person&#x27;s life, comparisons used to praise the subject, and an epilogue
:*The &quot;basilikos logos&quot; (imperial encomium), a formal genre in the Byzantine empire

==Examples==
* Gorgias&#x27; famous &quot;Encomium of Helen&quot; offers several justifications for excusing Helen of Troy&#x27;s adultery
* In Erasmus&#x27; &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot;, Folly composes an encomium to herself
* &quot;De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica&quot; is a medieval encomium of the victory of Pepin of Italy over the Avars
* &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; is a medieval encomium of Queen Emma of Normandy
* &quot;Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis&quot; or &quot;Versum de Mediolano civitate&quot; is a medieval encomium of Milan
* &quot;Versus de Verona&quot; is a medieval encomium of Verona
* &quot;Polychronion&quot; is chanted in the liturgy of Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite
* Paul the Apostle uses a kind of encomium in his praise of love, in 1 Corinthians 13; the prologue is verses 1–3, acts are v. 4–7, comparison is v. 8–12, and epilogue is 13:13–14:1.

<doc id="290270" wikidata="Q4711992" url="?curid=290270" title="Alberto Cutié">
<text>Alberto R. Cutié (born April 29, 1969, in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Cuban-American Episcopal priest who is also known as Padre Alberto. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1995. He has an internationally recognizable name, due to his work as the host of television and radio programs.

Cutié left the Roman Catholic Church in May 2009 after publication of photographs showing him with a woman at the beach and his subsequent admission that he was in love. He has said that mandatory celibacy was only one of the theological differences that led him to leave the Catholic Church. He later married Ruhama Buni Canellis and joined the Episcopal (Anglican) Church. He now serves as rector of St. Benedict&#x27;s, an Episcopal parish in Plantation, Florida.

==Media appearances==
Cutié, the middle child and son of Cuban exiles, was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. As a teenager he worked as a DJ.

He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest of the Archdiocese of Miami in 1995, the first ordinand of the then-newly designated Archbishop John Favalora (retired 2010). He is a regular columnist whose writings appear in Spanish language newspapers throughout the United States and Latin America. He made his television debut in 1999 as the host of &quot;Padre Alberto&quot; (and later &quot;Cambia tu Vida con el Padre Alberto&quot;), a daily talk show televised on the Telemundo network.

Beginning in 2002, Cutié hosted a weekly talk program called &quot;Hablando Claro con el Padre Alberto&quot;, reaching millions of households throughout the United States, Canada, Spain and Latin America on EWTN Español, which is part of the global network founded by Mother Angelica. In July 2003 he officiated at Celia Cruz&#x27;s Funeral Mass in Miami, Florida.

Cutié also published his first self-help book, &quot;Real Life, Real Love&quot; (&quot;Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad&quot;) in January 2006. It sold thousands of copies and became a bestseller in the Spanish language market. His second book, &quot;Dilemma: A Priest&#x27;s Struggle with Faith and Love&quot; (&quot;Dilema: La Lucha de un Sacerdote Entre Su Fe y el Amor&quot;), was released on January 4, 2011. He has been labeled as &quot;Father Oprah&quot; by various publications. He was president and general director of Radio Paz and Radio Peace Catholic 24-hour radio station from January 2001. He hosted several radio programs, such as &quot;Al Dia&quot; and &quot;Linea Directa&quot;, and directed the daily operations of Pax Catholic Communications for the Archdiocese of Miami until 2009.

==Personal life==
On May 5, 2009, Cutié asked church officials for a time of reflection and a leave of absence from his media programs and pastoral work after publication of pictures in which he was shown kissing and touching Ruhama Buni Canellis at a public beach while still a Catholic priest. Cutié asked the Archdiocese of Miami for some time to think and make a decision on where his life as a priest was heading.
As a result, the Archdiocese of Miami granted him a leave of absence for an undefined period of personal decision making. After meeting with two of his bishops and informing them of his decision, he chose to continue his ministry as a married priest in the Episcopal Church, part of the Anglican Communion.

On May 11, 2009, Cutié was interviewed by Maggie Rodriguez of CBS&#x27; &quot;The Early Show&quot;. He said that he was thinking about leaving the Roman Catholic Church for a woman he loves. He said that he respected the existing rule of mandatory celibacy and acknowledged that some priests remain dedicated to that calling. There are many priests in communion with the Vatican who are married, but they are mostly members of the Eastern Catholic Churches. He stated he did not want to become the &quot;anti-celibacy priest&quot;.

On May 13, 2009, Cutié was interviewed by Teresa Rodríguez on the Univision show &quot;Aquí y Ahora&quot;. He said: &quot;I do regret if my actions hurt people with all my heart&quot;, adding &quot;[t]here are other ways to serve God. I am not the same man I was when I entered the seminary 22 years ago.&quot; By the end of the month Cutié announced that he had been in the process of discerning entering the Episcopal Church for the last couple of years, which in turn helped him consolidate marriage and his calling to serve God.

On July 11, 2011, Cutié aired his first English-speaking syndicated daytime talk show, &quot;Father Albert&quot;. The show was produced by Debmar-Mercury, the same company that syndicates &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot; as a summer test-run.

Father Albert returned to daily radio with Univision in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic with a daily call-in Talk-Show which had a huge reception by the Latino audience. In 2021, he returned to daytime television with a new version of his long-time Talk-Show &quot;Hablando Claro con el Padre Alberto&quot; on Mega TV, part of the Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS) conglomerate of radio and television stations.

==Reception into the Episcopal Church and marriage==
Cutié was received into the Episcopal Church on May 28, 2009, by the Right Reverend Leo Frade, the Cuban-born bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida and became the administrator and pastoral minister of the Episcopal Church of the Resurrection in Biscayne Park, Miami, Florida, where he was licensed as a pastoral assistant. He was received as an Episcopal priest and instituted as priest-in-charge of the parish on May 29, 2010.

On June 26, 2009, Cutié and Ruhama Buni Canellis married in a church ceremony at St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church in North Miami Beach. Bishop Frade officiated, assisted by the Right Reverend Onell Soto (retired Episcopal Bishop of Venezuela) and several other Episcopal clergy. He and his wife have two children.

Cutié is rector of St. Benedict&#x27;s Parish in Plantation, Florida.

<doc id="290271" wikidata="Q899122" url="?curid=290271" title="Mitsui">
<text>is a Japanese corporate group and &quot;keiretsu&quot; that traces its roots to the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; groups that were dissolved after World War II. Unlike the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; of the pre-war period, there is no controlling company with regulatory power. Instead, the companies in the group hold shares in each other, but they are limited to exchanging information and coordinating plans through regular meetings.

The major companies of the group include Mitsui &amp; Co. (general trading company), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Nippon Paper Industries, Pokka Sapporo Holdings, Toray Industries, Mitsui Chemicals, Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Mitsui Fudosan.

==History==
===Edo period origins===
Founded by Mitsui Takatoshi (1622–1694), who was the fourth son of a shopkeeper in Matsusaka, in what became Mie prefecture. From his shop, called Echigoya (越後屋), Mitsui Takatoshi&#x27;s father originally sold miso and ran a pawn shop business. The family would later open a second shop in Edo (modern Tokyo).

Takatoshi moved to Edo when he was 14 years old, and later his older brother joined him. Sent back to Matsusaka by his brother, Takatoshi waited for 24 years until his older brother died before he could take over the family shop, Echigoya. He opened a new branch in 1673; a large gofukuya (kimono shop) in Nihonbashi, a district in the heart of Edo. The genesis of Mitsui&#x27;s business was in the &quot;Enpō&quot; era, which was a &quot;nengō&quot; meaning &quot;Prolonged Wealth&quot;.

In time, the gofukuya division separated from Mitsui, and became Mitsukoshi. Traditionally, gofukuyas provided products made to order; a visit was made to the customer&#x27;s house (typically a person of high social class or who was successful in business), an order taken, then fulfilled. The system of accountancy was called &quot;margin transaction&quot;. Mitsui changed this by producing products first, then selling them directly at his shop for cash. This was then an unfamiliar mode of operation in Japan. Even as the shop began providing dry goods to the government of the city of Edo, cash sales were not yet a widespread business practice.

Edo&#x27;s government had struck a business deal with Osaka. Osaka would sell crops and other material to pay its land tax. The money was then sent to Edo—but moving money was dangerous in middle feudal Japan. In 1683, the shogunate granted permission for money exchanges (&quot;ryōgaeten&quot;) to be established in Edo. The Mitsui &quot;exchange shops&quot; facilitated transfers while mitigating risks.

===Formation of Mitsui &quot;zaibatsu&quot;===
After the Meiji Restoration, Mitsui was among the enterprises that were able to expand to become zaibatsu not simply because they were already big and rich at the start of modern industrial development. Firms like Mitsui and Sumitomo were led by non-family managers such as Minomura Rizaemon, who guided the business by accurately forecasting the coming political and economic situations, by acquaintance with high-ranking government officials or politicians, and bold investment.

Mitsui&#x27;s main business in the early period was drapery, finance, and trade, the first two being the businesses it inherited from the Tokugawa Era. It entered into mining when it acquired a mine as collateral from a loan it had made, partly because it could buy a mine cheaply from the government, Mitsui then diversified to become the biggest business in pre-war Japan. The diversification was mainly into related fields to take advantage of accumulated capabilities; for instance, the trading company entered into chemicals to attain forward integration.

On July 1, 1876, Mitsui Bank, Japan&#x27;s first private bank, was founded with Takashi Masuda (1848–1938) as its president. Mitsui Bank, which following a merger with Taiyō-Kobe Bank in the mid-1980s became part of Sakura Bank, survives as part of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. During the early 20th century, Mitsui was one of the largest zaibatsu, operating in numerous fields.

Mitsui Bank became the holding company of the Mitsui zaibatsu from 1876. It was joined as an ultimate parent company by Mitsui &amp; Co. and Mitsui Mining in 1900, with various industrial concerns owned by various combinations of these companies and their subsidiaries.

Likewise, Mitsui invested in maritime transportation to support its trading activities as well as invest in passenger transportation, first with the creation in 1878, of Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK), which was merged with Mitsui Steamship in 1964, to become Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), which became one of the largest ocean shipping groups in the world.

When the United Kingdom withdrew from the gold standard in 1931, during the height of the Great Depression, Mitsui Bank and Mitsui &amp; Co. were found to have speculated around the transaction. This raised a political furor in Japan and resulted in the assassination of Mitsui executive Takuma Dan.

===World War II===
During the 1930s and &#x27;40s, the subsidiary tobacco industry of Mitsui had started production of special &quot;Golden Bat&quot; cigarettes using the then-popular Far East trademark. Their circulation was prohibited in Japan and was used only for export. Local Japanese secret service &quot;kempeitai&quot; under the controversial Imperial Japanese Army General Kenji Doihara had the control of their distribution in China and Manchuria where the production exported. Within the mouthpiece were small discreet doses of opium or heroin, and consequently millions of unsuspecting consumers became addicted to these narcotics, while huge profits were created for the company. The mastermind of the plan, Doihara, was later prosecuted and convicted for war crimes before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, sentenced to death; but no actions ever took place against the company which profited from their production. According to testimony presented at the Tokyo War Crimes trials in 1948, the revenue from the narcotization policy in China, including Manchukuo, was estimated in 20 million to 30 million yen per year, while another authority stated that the annual revenue was estimated by the Japanese military at US$300 million a year.

During the Second World War, Mitsui employed American prisoners of war as slave laborers, some of whom were maimed by Mitsui employees.

===Postwar development as &quot;keiretsu&quot;===
In 1947 and 1948, the Supreme Commander Allied Powers pressed the Japanese government to dismantle the ten largest &quot;zaibatsu&quot; conglomerates, including Mitsui. The Mitsui Group, broken into many separate companies, reorganized itself as a horizontal coalition of independent companies in the 1950s, once the occupation of Japan had ended and some of the smaller companies were allowed to re-coalesce. The central firms in the &quot;keiretsu&quot; became Mitsui Bank and Mitsui &amp; Co.

Mitsui lagged somewhat behind its rivals Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Group in reorganization. Mitsui Bank, which should have been the mainstay and principal capital provider of the group, declined in size due to the collapse of the Imperial Bank after the war, which resulted in reduced cohesion of the conglomerate. Many companies that were once part of the Mitsui Group have become independent or tied to other conglomerates. Specifically, Toshiba, Toyota Motors, and Suntory, once part of the Mitsui Group, became independent, with the Toyota Group becoming a conglomerate in its own right.

Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI Corporation) is now considered to be part of the Mizuho Group, and many companies in the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group are more closely tied to the Sumitomo Group than the Mitsui Group. there were signs that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and the Mitsubishi Group could be taking over other parts of the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. Mitsukoshi merged into Isetan, a major department store with close ties to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, to form Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings in April 2008.

<doc id="290274" wikidata="Q1508806" url="?curid=290274" title="Legio I Italica">
<text>Legio I Italica (&quot;First Italian Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded by emperor Nero on September 22, 66 (the date is attested by an inscription). Originally named &quot;Legio Phalanx Alexandri Magni&quot;, it was stationed in Italy during the year of four emperors and gained the name &quot;Italica&quot;. It was later stationed at Novae, near modern-day Svishtov (Bulgaria). There are still records of the &quot;I Italica&quot; on the Danube border at the beginning of the 5th century. The emblem of the legion was a boar.

== History ==
In the aftermath of the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63, Emperor Nero levied the &quot;I Italica&quot; with the name &quot;phalanx Alexandri Magni&quot; (&quot;phalanx of Alexander the Great&quot;), for a campaign in Armenia, &quot;ad portas Caspias&quot; – to the pass of Chawar. The sources mention the peculiar fact that the original legionaries were all over six feet tall. However, since the Jewish Revolt broke out a few weeks later, the projected Armenian campaign never took place. Also, the governor of Gaul, Gaius Julius Vindex, rose in revolt in early 68 and &quot;I Italica&quot; was redirected there, arriving just in time to see the end of the revolt. In the Year of the Four Emperors (69), after the death of Nero, the legion received the name &quot;I Italica&quot; and fought for Vitellius at the second Battle of Bedriacum, where the Vitellians were defeated by forces supporting Vespasian. The new emperor sent &quot;I Italica&quot; to the province of Moesia in 70 where they encamped at Novae (modern Svishtov) which became the legion&#x27;s base of operations for centuries.

The legion served on campaign during the Dacian wars of Trajan. The legion was also responsible for bridge construction over the Danube. Building activities seem to have been an area of expertise for the legion. On 3 December 1969 a Roman votive altar was found at Old Kilpatrick on the Antonine Wall dating from around 140 A.D. It has been scanned and a video produced. The inscription mentions the First Cohort of Baetasians, previously known to have been at Bar Hill, and also Julius Candidus, a centurion from &quot;I Italica&quot;.

During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, Legio I Italica was involved in the wars against the Germanic tribes that threatened to cross the Danube. After a long war, the Romans had conquered much territory on the left side of the Danube. There Marcus Aurelius had intended to form a new province under governor Aulus Julius Pompilius Piso, commander of &quot;I Italica&quot; and IV &quot;Flavia Felix&quot;, but the revolt of Avidius Cassius in the East prevented this.

In 193, the Governor of Pannonia Superior, Septimius Severus claimed the purple and moved to Italia. &quot;I Italica&quot; supported Severus, but did not move to Italy. The legion fought against Severus&#x27; rival, Pescennius Niger, besieging Byzantium together with &quot;XI Claudia&quot;, fighting at Issus. The First possibly took part in the Parthian campaign of Severus (198).

In the 3rd century, during the rule of Caracalla, the legion participated in the construction of the &quot;Limes Transalutanus&quot;, a defensive wall along the Danube, which began near Novae. Under Alexander Severus, some vexillationes of the &quot;I Italica&quot; moved to Salonae, guarding the Dalmatian coast.

<text>Legio I Minervia ( First Legion &quot;Minervan&quot;, i.e., &quot;devoted to the goddess Minerva&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in AD 82 by emperor Domitian ( 81–96), for his campaign against the Germanic tribe of the Chatti. Its cognomen refers to the goddess Minerva, the legion&#x27;s protector. There are still records of the I &quot;Minervia&quot; in the Rhine border region in the middle of the 4th century. The legion&#x27;s emblem is an image of goddess Minerva.

Legio I &quot;Minervia&quot; first, and main, camp was in the city of &quot;Bonna&quot; (modern Bonn), in the province of Germania Inferior. In 89, they suppressed a revolt of the governor of Germania Superior. Due to this, Domitian gave them the cognomen &quot;Pia Fidelis Domitiana&quot; (loyal and faithful to Domitian) to acknowledge their support.

==History==

Between 101 and 106, the legion fought the Dacian Wars of emperor Trajan, commanded by Hadrian, the future emperor. The emblem with Minerva figure appears on the column of Trajan in Rome, along with symbols of other legions. After this war, I &quot;Minervia&quot; returned to its home city of Bonna. Together with XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot;, stationed close by in &quot;Castra Vetera II&quot; (modern Xanten), they worked in numerous military and building activities, even extracting stone from quarries.

Although it belonged to the Germanic army and Bonn was its camp, &quot;vexillationes&quot; (subunits) of the legion were allocated in different parts of the Empire:
* 162–166 war against the Parthian Empire, commanded by emperor Lucius Verus
* 166–175 and 178–180 war against the Marcomanni, commanded by emperor Marcus Aurelius
* 173 campaign against the Chauci of Gallia Belgica, commanded by governor Didius Julianus
* 198–211 garrison of the city of Lugdunum, capital of Gallia

During the civil wars of the late 2nd and 3rd century, I &quot;Minervia&quot; supported the following emperors (each of them gave them the indicated titles, dropped out after their fall):
* Septimius Severus
* Elagabalus (&quot;Antoniniana&quot;)
* Alexander Severus (&quot;Severiana Alexandriana&quot;)
* The Gallic Empire, that existed between 260 and 274

Around 353, Bonna was destroyed by the Franks. Although Legio I &quot;Minervia&quot; disappears from recorded history, there is no account of its end, whether destroyed in battle or simply disbanded.

<text>Quimper (, ; ; or ) is a commune and prefecture of the Finistère department of Brittany in northwestern France.

==Administration==
Quimper is the prefecture (capital) of the Finistère department.

==Geography==
The city of Quimper was built at the confluence of the Steir, Odet and Jet rivers. Routes Nationale 165, D785, D765 and D783 were designed to intersect here, northwest of Lorient, west of Rennes, and west-southwest of Paris.

===Climate===
Quimper has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), with an average annual temperature of . The temperatures are highest, on average, in August, at around , and lowest in February, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Quimper was on 30 June 1976; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 13 January 1987. The average annual rainfall is , with December being the wettest month. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Quimper&quot; comes from the Breton &quot;kemper&quot;, meaning &quot;confluent&quot;, a reference to the meeting of the three rivers of the area.

==History==
Quimper is the ancient capital of Cornouaille, Brittany&#x27;s most &quot;traditional&quot; region, and has a distinctive Breton-Celtic character, from music and dance traditions to linguistics and genetics; indeed, the historical name is also somewhat similar to &quot;Cornwall&quot;, a region in southern England with distant cultural similarities. The word Quimper comes from the Breton word &quot;kemper&quot; (cognate to Welsh &quot;cymer&quot;), meaning &quot;confluence&quot;. The town developed at the confluence of the rivers Le Steir and L&#x27;Odet. Shops and flags celebrate the region&#x27;s Celtic heritage.

Quimper was originally settled during Roman times, when the area now known as France was known as Gaul. By AD 495, the town had become a Bishopric. It subsequently became the capital of the counts of Cornouailles. In the eleventh century, it was united with the Duchy of Brittany. During the War of the Breton Succession (1341–1364), the town suffered considerable ruin. In 1364, the duchy passed to the House of Montfort.

The town itself has a &quot;rustic&quot; atmosphere, with footbridges spanning the rivers that flow through it. The Church of Locmaria, a Romanesque structure, dates from the eleventh century. The Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, with its Gothic-style façade, was constructed between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, and is the oldest Gothic structure in lower Brittany. Its twin towers are high; its spires were added in the nineteenth century. The fifteenth-century stained glass windows are considered exceptional. The cathedral is dedicated to the 5th-century bishop Corentin, Quimper&#x27;s first.

To the cathedral&#x27;s west are the pedestrianised streets of Vieux Quimper (Old Quimper), which has a wide array of &quot;crêperies&quot;, half-timbered houses, and shops and cafés. Near the Episcopal palace (which now holds the &quot;Musée départemental Breton&quot;, devoted to regional history, archaeology, ethnology and economics) are the ruins of the town&#x27;s fifteenth-century walls. Nearby is the &quot;Musée des beaux-arts de Quimper&quot;. The museum has a nineteenth-century façade and an entirely-rebuilt interior. It houses a collection of 14th to 21st-century paintings, including works by François Boucher, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Peter Paul Rubens, along with canvases by such Pont-Aven School painters as Émile Bernard, Maurice Denis, Georges Lacombe, Maxime Maufra and Paul Sérusier.

The town&#x27;s best-known product is Quimper &quot;faience&quot;, a tin-glazed pottery. It has been made here since 1690, using the bold provincial designs of Jean-Baptiste Bousquet. The city has a museum devoted to faience. Quimper has also been known for copper and bronze work, galvanised ironware, hosiery, leather, paper and woollen goods, as well as being a gastronomic destination for its varied regional dishes.

Adolphe Harré was a French sailor from Quimper who died during World War I along with the 31 crew members of the SS Longwy, a French merchant vessel that was torpedoed off the coast of Scotland in 1917. Harré’s body washed ashore in Scotland and was buried in Doune Cemetery in Girvan, South Ayrshire. On 12 October 2024, a memorial stele was inaugurated at the Cemetery to honour Harré and the crew of the SS Longwy. The ceremony was attended by local authorities, including the First Minister of Scotland, members of the French Navy, and dignitaries from both Scotland and France. A wreath was laid on behalf of the mayoress of Quimper and the city, symbolizing the historic ties between the French and Scottish communities, and commemorating the sacrifice of the sailors.

==Population==

The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Quimper proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Quimper absorbed the former communes of Ergué-Armel, Kerfunteun and Penhars in 1959. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Quimpérois&quot;.

==Breton language==
The municipality launched a linguistic plan through Ya d&#x27;ar brezhoneg on 6 February 2008, to revive the teaching and use of Breton, the historic Celtic language of the region. In 2008, 4.61% of primary-school children attended bilingual schools.

==Education==
Quimper has several schools. These include two Diwan pre-schools, two Diwan primary schools and one Diwan collège (all specialise in use of Breton). In total, 287 students here attended a Diwan school in 2003–2004.

==Festivals==
While many French festivals are held in the summer season, Quimper has a winter festival: &quot;Les Hivernautes&quot;. 

In the summer, concerts are held on street corners, with pipers and accordion players.

<doc id="290292" wikidata="Q337375" url="?curid=290292" title="Douglas Hurd">
<text>Douglas Richard Hurd, Baron Hurd of Westwell, (born 8 March 1930) is a British Conservative Party politician who served in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major from 1979 to 1995.

A career diplomat and political secretary to Prime Minister Edward Heath, Hurd first entered Parliament in February 1974 as MP for the Mid Oxfordshire constituency (Witney from 1983). His first government post was as Minister for Europe from 1979 to 1983 (being that office&#x27;s inaugural holder) and he served in several Cabinet roles from 1984 onwards, including Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1984–85), Home Secretary (1985–89) and Foreign Secretary (1989–95). He stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 1990, and retired from frontline politics during a Cabinet reshuffle in 1995.

In 1997, Hurd was elevated to the House of Lords and is one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s most senior elder statesmen. He is a patron of the Tory Reform Group. He retired from the Lords in 2016.

==Early life==

Hurd was born in 1930 in the market town of Marlborough in Wiltshire. His father Anthony Hurd (later Lord Hurd) and grandfather Sir Percy Hurd were also Members of Parliament. Douglas attended Twyford School and Eton College, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar and won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1947. He was also captain of school (head boy).

Following school Hurd did National Service, which he did not particularly enjoy, at a time when the Berlin Blockade made a Third World War seem far from unlikely. He began in July 1948 with a compulsory period in the ranks of the Royal Regiment of Artillery alongside young men of all social backgrounds. He later recorded that although living standards were no great shock after the spartan conditions at public school in those days, the petty dishonesty which he saw in the barrack room, and the waste of time which was so large a part of a conscript&#x27;s experience, made him sceptical in later years of constituents&#x27; demands for a restoration of National Service. He was selected for officer training, attended Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot; from November 1948, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (as it was then called) at the start of March 1949. He was released from the Army in September 1949 to take up his place at Cambridge University. He trained for a few weeks each summer as a reserve officer until 1952.

Hurd went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in the autumn of 1949. He achieved an upper second (II:1) in his preliminary exams in summer 1950. In March 1951 he was approached by an admiral to be recruited to British Intelligence. He attended a selection panel, but withdrew from the process because, he later wrote, he did not want a career which would have to be pursued in secret. Hurd&#x27;s brother Julian, who was on the officer training course at Aldershot at the time, committed suicide in June 1951. In his third year, Hurd served as chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association for Michaelmas (autumn) Term 1951 and president of the Cambridge Union Society in Easter (summer) Term 1952. His special subject for study was the Second French Republic. He graduated in 1952 with a first-class degree (BA) in history.

In 1952, Hurd joined the Diplomatic Service. He was posted to China, the United States and Italy, before leaving the service in 1966 to enter politics as a member of the Conservative Party.

==Member of Parliament==
Hurd became private secretary (a political appointment, his salary paid by the Conservative Party) to Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, and was first elected to Parliament in February 1974 to represent the constituency of Mid Oxfordshire. Following his election, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the February 1974 Dissolution Honours, gazetted on 2 April 1974. At the 1983 general election the seat was replaced by Witney and he remained MP for that seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1997 having served 23 years in Parliament. His immediate successor was Shaun Woodward, who defected to Labour in 1999, and moved in 2001 to a safe Labour seat, before serving as Northern Ireland Secretary, a position Hurd once held. From 2001 to 2016, Hurd&#x27;s former constituency was represented by the former Leader of the Conservative Party and former British prime minister, David Cameron.

===In government: 1979–1990===
Hurd was appointed Minister of State at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office upon the Conservative victory in the 1979 general election and remained in that post for the duration of the Parliament. Following the 1983 election Thatcher moved Hurd to the Home Office, but just over a year later he was promoted to Cabinet rank, succeeding Jim Prior as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In this position, his diplomatic skills paved the way for the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on the future of Northern Ireland, which marked a turning point in British-Irish co-operation on the political situation in the troubled region. A month before the agreement was signed, however, Hurd returned to the Home Office, this time as Home Secretary, following the demotion of Leon Brittan to the Department of Trade and Industry.

Widely seen as a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot; and a solid, loyal member of the Cabinet, Hurd&#x27;s tenure as Home Secretary was largely uncontroversial, although he was notably of the view that Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service did not work effectively and argued for more rehabilitation of offenders and alternative sentencing.

Hurd brought in the Public Order Act, 1986, which created the crime of hate speech for speech which is &quot;threatening, abusive or insulting&quot; and which is spoken in public, with intent or likely to &quot;stir up&quot; racial hatred.

===Candidature in the 1990 leadership election===
Hurd&#x27;s Cabinet career progressed further during the turbulent final months of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s prime ministership. On 26 October 1989, Hurd moved to the Foreign Office, succeeding John Major, whose rapid rise through the Cabinet saw him become Chancellor of the Exchequer in the wake of Nigel Lawson&#x27;s resignation.

In mid-November 1990, Hurd supported Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s candidature as Conservative Party leader against challenger Michael Heseltine, but on her withdrawal from the second round of the contest on 22 November, Hurd decided to enter the race as a moderate centre-right candidate, drawing on his reputation as a successful &#x27;law-and-order&#x27; Home Secretary. He was endorsed by former Prime Minister and Conservative Party Leader Edward Heath. He was seen as an outsider, lagging behind the more charismatic Heseltine and the eventual winner, John Major, who shared the moderate centre-right political ground with Hurd but had the added advantages of youth and political momentum. Hurd&#x27;s Etonian education may have also been a disadvantage. Years later, Hurd expressed frustration that his privileged background counted against him in the leadership election, commenting in an interview that &quot;I should have said I am standing for leadership of the Tory party and not for some demented Marxist outfit&quot;. He came third, winning 56 of the 372 votes cast and, together with Heseltine, conceded defeat to allow Major, who had fallen just three votes short of an outright majority, to return unopposed and take over as prime minister on 27 November 1990. Hurd was gracious in defeat and, on the formation of Major&#x27;s first Cabinet, was returned to his position as Foreign Secretary.

===Foreign Secretary===

Hurd was widely regarded as a British Foreign Secretary, his tenure having been particularly eventful. He oversaw Britain&#x27;s diplomatic responses to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as well as the first Gulf War to drive Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. Hurd cultivated good relations with the United States under President George H. W. Bush, and sought a more conciliatory approach to other members of the European Community, repairing relationships damaged during the increasingly Eurosceptic tone of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s final years. Hurd was a signatory of the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union in 1992. Hurd welcomed a reunified Germany into the European political community in 1990.

One of the defining features of Hurd&#x27;s tenure as Foreign Secretary was the British reaction to the Yugoslav Wars. During the Bosnian War, Hurd was seen as a leading voice among European politicians arguing against sending military aid to the Bosniaks and for maintaining the arms embargo, in defiance of the line taken by US President Bill Clinton, and arguing that such a move would only create a &#x27;level killing field&#x27; and prolong the conflict unduly. Hurd also resisted pressure to allow Bosnian refugees to enter into Britain arguing that to do so would reduce pressure on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to sue for peace. Hurd described his and British policy during that time as &#x27;realist&#x27;.

Shortly after his withdrawal from frontline politics, Hurd travelled to Serbia and Montenegro to meet Slobodan Milošević on behalf of the British bank NatWest (see below), fuelling some speculation that Hurd had taken a pro-Serbian line. There has been criticism of Hurd&#x27;s policies in relation to the war. The Bosnian government even threatened to charge Hurd as an accomplice to the Bosnian genocide before the War Tribunal at The Hague, though this came to nothing. In 2010 Hurd told a reporter that he was troubled by his Bosnia policy but still doubted that intervention would have brought about an earlier end to the war.

Hurd was involved in a public scandal concerning Britain&#x27;s funding of a hydroelectric dam on the Pergau River in Malaysia, near the Thai border. Building work began in 1991 with money from the British foreign aid budget. Concurrently, the Malaysian government bought around £1 billion&#x27;s worth of British-made arms. The suggested linkage of arms deals to aid became the subject of a UK Government inquiry from March 1994. In November 1994, after an application for judicial review brought by the World Development Movement, the High Court held that Hurd&#x27;s actions as Foreign Secretary, in allocating £234 million towards the funding of the dam, were &quot;ultra vires&quot; [outside his legal powers and therefore unlawful], on the grounds that the legislation only empowered him to fund economically sound projects.

In 1997, the administration of the UK&#x27;s aid budget was removed from the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s remit (previously the Overseas Development Administration had been under the supervision of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). The new department, the Department for International Development (DfID), had its own Secretary of state who was a member of the Cabinet. In 1995, during the Cabinet reshuffle widely seen as setting up the Conservative team which would contest the next election, Hurd retired from frontline politics after 11 years in the Cabinet and was replaced by Malcolm Rifkind.

===Retirement===

After his retirement as foreign secretary, Hurd remained a key supporter of John Major, and kept a range of active political involvements as well as taking on some business appointments, most notably as a deputy chairman of NatWest Markets and a board director of NatWest Group, posts he held from October 1995–99.

Hurd left the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, and on 13 June 1997 was created Baron Hurd of Westwell, of Westwell in the County of Oxfordshire, which enabled him to continue sitting in Parliament as a member of the House of Lords. He retired from the Lords on 9 June 2016.

In December 1997, Hurd was appointed chairman of British Invisibles (now renamed International Financial Services London or IFSL). He was chairman of the judging panel for the 1998 Booker Prize for Fiction. He became a member of the Royal Commission on the Reform of the House of Lords in February 1999, and in September 1999 he was appointed High Steward of Westminster Abbey, reflecting his long active membership of the Church of England. He later went on to chair the Hurd Commission which produced a review of the roles and functions of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Hurd is chairman of the advisory council at FIRST, an international affairs organisation. Hurd was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1974 and Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1996 New Year Honours. He was formerly a Visiting Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford and Chairman of the German British Forum. On 17 July 2009, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (Hon DLitt) from Aston University at its Degree Congregation.

Hurd is a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

Hurd has married twice. In 1960, he married his first wife Tatiana, daughter of Major Arthur Eyre MBE, and their union produced three sons. The couple separated in 1976, and divorced in 1982. Tatiana Hurd cited her husband&#x27;s career as the reason for their separation, saying, &quot;Really, politics don&#x27;t mix with marriage&quot;. In 1982 Hurd married Judy Smart, his former parliamentary secretary, who was 19 years his junior. They had two children, a boy and a girl. Judy Hurd died of leukaemia on 22 November 2008 in an Oxford hospital, aged 58.

Hurd&#x27;s eldest son, Nick Hurd, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Ruislip Northwood and Pinner from May 2005 to December 2019. In 2010, he was appointed Minister for Civil Society and married Lady Clare Kerr, daughter of the Marquess of Lothian.

Hurd&#x27;s second son, Thomas, joined the Diplomatic service. His name appeared on a list of suspected MI6 operatives which was published on the Internet, along with the name of Douglas himself. The Hon. Thomas Hurd was appointed OBE in 2006, and is married with five children. His wife, Catherine, known as Sian, died on 21 May 2011, after falling from the roof of the building where they lived on East 84th Street in New York City.

In 1988, Hurd set up the charity &quot;Crime Concern&quot;. Crime Concern worked to reduce crime, anti-social behaviour and the fear of crime, by working with young people, their families and adult offenders, offering opportunities through training and employment. Crime Concern merged with young people&#x27;s charity &quot;Rainer&quot; in 2008 to become Catch22. Hurd is fluent in Mandarin, French, and Italian.

<text>Duke of Buckingham and Normanby is a title in the Peerage of England. The full title was &quot;Duke of the County of Buckingham and of Normanby&quot; but in practice only &quot;Duke of Buckingham and Normanby&quot; was used. The dukedom was created in 1703 for John Sheffield, 1st Marquess of Normanby KG, a notable Tory politician of the late Stuart period, who served under Queen Anne as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. He had succeeded his father as 3rd Earl of Mulgrave in 1658 and been made Marquess of Normanby in 1694.

The duke&#x27;s family descended from Sir Edmund Sheffield, second cousin of Henry VIII, who in 1547 was raised to the Peerage of England as &quot;Baron Sheffield&quot; and in 1549 was murdered in the streets of Norwich during Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. His grandson, the 3rd Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire from 1603 to 1619 and was created &quot;Earl of Mulgrave&quot; in 1626, also in the Peerage of England. On the death of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1735, all these titles became extinct. The Sheffield family estates passed to the 2nd duke&#x27;s half-brother Charles Herbert—the illegitimate son of the 1st Duke by Frances Stewart—who changed his surname to Sheffield as a condition of the 2nd duke&#x27;s will, thereby becoming Charles Herbert Sheffield. Charles Herbert Sheffield was created a Baronet in 1755 and is the ancestor of the Sheffield Baronets, of Normanby.

The &quot;Mulgrave&quot; title was used again in 1767 when Constantine Phipps was made &quot;Baron Mulgrave&quot;. He was the son of William Phipps and Lady Catherine Annesley (daughter and heiress of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey and his wife Lady Catherine Darnley, illegitimate daughter of King James II by his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester). Lady Catherine Darnley later married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and hence Constantine Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave was the step-grandson of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. In 1838 also the &quot;Normanby&quot; title was used again when the 1st Baron Mulgrave&#x27;s grandson Constantine was made &quot;Marquess of Normanby&quot;. These titles are still extant.

<text>Marquess of Buckingham was a title that has been created two times in the peerages of England and Great Britain. 

The first creation of the marquessate was in 1618 for George Villiers, a favourite of James I of England. He had previously been made Baron Whaddon, of Whaddon in the County of Buckingham, and Viscount Villiers in 1616, then Earl of Buckingham in 1617. Later he was also created Earl of Coventry and Duke of Buckingham in 1623. With his son&#x27;s death in 1687, the title became extinct.

The second creation came in 1784, when George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 3rd Earl Temple was made Marquess of Buckingham in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was son of George Grenville, Prime Minister of Great Britain. However, on his grandson&#x27;s death in 1889 without male issue, the marquessate of Buckingham became extinct.

<text>Earl of Buckingham is a peerage title created several times in the Peerage of England. It is not to be confused with the title of Earl of Buckinghamshire.

It was first created in 1097 for Walter Giffard, but became extinct in 1164 with the death of the second earl. It may have been created again in 1164 for Richard de Clare (&quot;Strongbow&quot;), who died without issue in 1176. It was created again in 1377 for Thomas of Woodstock, the youngest son of King Edward III. He was created Duke of Gloucester in 1385. The dukedom was forfeit on his attainder in 1397, but the earldom passed to his son, Humphrey, but became extinct on his death two years later. The title was created a fourth time in 1618 for Mary Villiers for life only. The title was created for a fifth time in 1617 for her son George Villiers, 1st Viscount Villiers, who was subsequently created Duke of Buckingham in 1623. All titles became extinct on the death of the second duke in 1687.

<doc id="290299" wikidata="Q1422215" url="?curid=290299" title="Great Comet of 1811">
<text>The Great Comet of 1811, formally designated C/1811 F1, is a comet that was visible to the naked eye for around 260 days, the longest recorded period of visibility until the appearance of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997. In October 1811, at its brightest, and when it was 1.2 AU from Earth, it displayed an apparent magnitude of 0, with an easily visible coma.

== Discovery ==

The comet was discovered on March 25, 1811, by Honoré Flaugergues at 2.7 AU from the Sun in the now-defunct constellation of Argo Navis. After being obscured for several days by moonlight, it was also found by Jean-Louis Pons on April 11, while Franz Xaver, Baron Von Zach was able to confirm Flaugergues&#x27; discovery the same night.

The first provisional orbit was computed in June by Johann Karl Burckhardt. Based on these calculations, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers made a prediction that the comet would go on to become extremely bright later that year.

== Observations ==

From May to August, the comet&#x27;s position made it difficult to spot because of its low altitude and the evening twilight. Both Flaugergues and Olbers were able to recover it in Leo Minor during August, Olbers noting a small but distinct tail, consisting of two rays forming a parabola, when viewing through a comet seeker. In August, the comet was first sighted in the United Kingdom by James Veitch of Inchbonny. By September, in Ursa Major, it was becoming a conspicuous object in the evening sky as it approached perihelion: William Herschel noted that a tail 25° long had developed by October 6.

By January 1812, the comet&#x27;s brightness had faded. Several astronomers continued to obtain telescopic observations for some months, the last being Vincent Wisniewski at Novocherkassk, who noted it as barely reaching an apparent magnitude of 11 by August 12.

The Great Comet of 1811 was thought to have had an exceptionally large coma, perhaps reaching over 1 million miles across—fifty percent larger than the Sun. The comet&#x27;s nucleus was later estimated at 30–40 km in diameter. In many ways the comet was quite similar to Comet Hale–Bopp: it became spectacular without passing particularly close to either the Earth or the Sun, but had an extremely large and active nucleus.

Astronomers also found the comet a memorable sight. William Henry Smyth, comparing his recollections of the Great Comet of 1811 to the spectacular Donati&#x27;s Comet, stated that &quot;as a mere &quot;sight&quot;-object, the branched tail was of greater interest, the nucleus with its &#x27;head-veil&#x27; was more distinct, and its circumpolarity was a fortunate incident for gazers&quot;.

The comet was apparently visible during the New Madrid earthquakes in December 1811. A report on the first steamship to descend the Ohio River as it approached the confluence with the Mississippi River states, &quot;December 18, 1811.—The anniversary of this day the people of Cairo [Illinois] and its vicinity should never forget. It was the coming of the first steamboat to where Cairo now is—the New Orleans, Capt. Roosevelt, Commanding. It was the severest day of the great throes of the New Madrid earthquake; at the same time, a fiery comet was rushing athwart the horizon&quot;.

== Return ==
Before perihelion passage on September 12, 1811, the comet had an orbital period of about 2742 years. Computing the barycentric orbital period of the comet after perihelion passage when it is outside the planetary region (using an epoch of 2200) shows an orbital period of about 2974 years, which would give a return year of around 4785.
== Allusions in culture ==

The Great Comet of 1811 seems to have had a particular impact on non-astronomers. The artists John Linnell and William Blake both witnessed it, the latter producing several sketches and the latter possibly incorporating it in his famous panel &quot;The Ghost of a Flea&quot;.

The English travel writer, novelist, and political economist Harriet Martineau (1802–1876) makes an odd reference to not seeing the comet in her &quot;Autobiography&quot;: &quot;When the great comet of 1811 was attracting all eyes...[n]ight after night, the whole family of us went up to the long windows at the top of my father&#x27;s warehouse; and the exclamations on all hands about the comet perfectly exasperated me,—because I could not see it!... Such is the fact; and philosophers may make of it what they may,—remembering that I was then nine years old, and with remarkably good eyes.&quot;

In China, some leaders of the Eight Trigram Sect took the comet to be &quot;auspicious blessing for their enterprise&quot; to overthrow the Qing dynasty. They launched their uprising in 1813.

At the midpoint of &quot;War and Peace&quot;, Tolstoy describes the character of Pierre observing this &quot;enormous and brilliant comet [...] which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world&quot;. The comet was popularly thought to have portended Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia (even being referred to as &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Comet&quot;) and the War of 1812, among other events. In the musical &quot;Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812,&quot; Pierre witnesses the comet. When asked why the comet made it into the title of the show, the composer Dave Malloy responded &quot;for cosmic epicness.&quot;

The year 1811 turned out to be particularly fine for wine production, and merchants marketed &quot;Comet Wine&quot; at high prices for many years afterwards. The film &quot;Year of the Comet&quot;, a 1992 romantic comedy adventure film, is based on this premise and tells the story of the pursuit of a contemporarily discovered bottle of wine from the year of the Great Comet, bottled for Napoleon. The film stars Penelope Ann Miller, Tim Daly and French film actor Louis Jourdan (his last film before retiring).

The Great Comet is mentioned in &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; by Adam Mickiewicz; and in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; by Victor Hugo.

The comet also acted as a divine source of revival for a dying hero in the Thomas Hardy novel &quot;Two on a Tower&quot;.

The appearance of the comet was interpreted by natives as a vindication of Shawnee military leader Tecumseh&#x27;s words: his name was translated as &quot;shooting star&quot;, and the comet was seen as an omen during his mostly unsuccessful efforts that year to bring southern tribes into his pan-Native American alliance.

<doc id="290310" wikidata="Q720676" url="?curid=290310" title="Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia">
<text>Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) was a militant organization active between 1975 and the 1990s whose stated goal was &quot;to compel the Turkish Government to acknowledge publicly its responsibility for the Armenian genocide in 1915, pay reparations, and cede territory for an Armenian homeland.&quot; ASALA itself and other sources described it as a guerilla and armed organization. Some sources, including the United States Department of State, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan listed it as a terrorist organization.

The principal goal of ASALA was to establish a United Armenia that would include the formerly Armenian-inhabited six vilayets of the Ottoman Empire (Western Armenia) and Soviet Armenia. The group sought to claim the area (called &quot;Wilsonian Armenia&quot;) that was promised to the Armenians by American President Woodrow Wilson in the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, following the Armenian genocide, during which Ottoman Turks murdered 1.5 million Armenians, which Turkey openly denies.

ASALA attacks and assassinations resulted in the deaths of 46 people and 299 injured, mostly individuals serving the Turkish government. The organization has also claimed responsibility for more than 50 bomb attacks. Suffering from internal schisms, the group was relatively inactive in the 1990s, although in 1991 it claimed an unsuccessful attack on the Turkish ambassador to Hungary. ASALA&#x27;s last and most recent attack took place in Brussels in 1997, where a group of militants claiming to be ASALA bombed the Turkish Embassy in the city. The organization has not engaged in militant activity since then. The group&#x27;s mottos were &quot;The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia&quot; and &quot;&quot;Viva&quot; the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people!&quot;

==Origins and history==
The presence of Armenians in eastern Anatolia, often called Western Armenia, is documented since the ninth century BCE, almost two millennium ago to the Turkish presence in the area. In 1915 and 1916, the ruling Committee of Union and Progress of the Ottoman Empire systematically deported and exterminated its Armenian population, killing around 1.5 million Armenians. The survivors of the death marches found refuge in other countries in Western Asia, as well as in Western Europe and North America; forces of the Turkish nationalist movement killed or expelled surviving Armenians that tried to return home. The Republic of Turkey denied that any crime had been committed against the Armenian people, actively campaigning against any and all attempts to publicise the events and bring about recognition in the West. It blamed Armenians for instigating the violence and falsely claimed that Armenians had massacred thousands of Turks, prompting the commencement of their deportations.

In 1965, Armenians around the world publicly marked the 50th anniversary and began to campaign for world recognition. As peaceful marches and demonstrations failed to move an intransigent Turkey, the younger generation of Armenians, resentful at the denial by Turkey and the failure by their parents&#x27; generation to effect change, sought new approaches to bringing about recognition and reparations.

In 1973, two Turkish diplomats were assassinated in Los Angeles by Kourken Yanigian, an elderly man who survived the Armenian genocide. This event might have been forgotten had it not initiated a chain of events which turned it, and its perpetrator, into a symbol representing the end of the conspiracy of silence which since 1915 had surrounded the Armenian Genocide. ASALA was founded in 1975 (thought to correspond to the 60th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide) in Beirut, Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War by Hagop Hagopian (Harutiun Tagushian) and Kevork Ajemian, a prominent contemporary writer, with the help of sympathetic Palestinians. Another major figure in the establishment of ASALA was Hagop Darakjian, who was a driving force in the earlier operations of the group. Darakjian headed the group for a period of time between 1976 and 1977 when Hagopian was unable to lead due to injuries sustained from his involvement with the Palestinians. At the beginning, ASALA bore the name of &quot;The Prisoner Kurken Yanikian Group&quot;. Consisting primarily of Lebanese-born Armenians of the Diaspora (whose parents and/or grandparents were survivors of the genocide), the organization followed a theoretical model based on leftist ideology. ASALA was critical of its political predecessors and Diasporan parties, accusing them of failing to deal with the problems of the Armenian people. The apex of the group&#x27;s structure was the General Command of the People of Armenia (&quot;VAN&quot;).

The group&#x27;s activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe, the United States and Western Asia. Their first acknowledged killing was the assassination of the Turkish diplomat, Daniş Tunalıgil, in Vienna on October 22, 1975. A failed attack in Geneva on October 3, 1980, in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group, the 3 October Organization. ASALA&#x27;s eight-point manifesto was published in 1981.
ASALA, trained in the Beirut camps of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is the best known of the guerrilla groups responsible for assassinations of at least 36 Turkish diplomats. Since 1975, a couple of dozen Turkish diplomats or members of their families had been targeted in a couple of dozens of attacks, with the outcome that the Armenian vengeance, as well as the background to the Armenian struggle, have made it to the world press. These notable acts, while carried out by a small group, were successful in conveying the Armenian Genocide to the forefront of international awareness.

==Political objectives==
The main two political goals of ASALA were to get Turkey to recognize its culpability for the Armenian Genocide in 1915 and to establish a United Armenia, which would unite nearby regions formerly under Armenian control or with large Armenian populations. Additionally, ASALA stated in a Cypriot newspaper in 1983 that it supported the Soviet Union and aimed to garner support from other Soviet republics toward the cause of eliminating Turkish colonialism. These goals helped shape the following political objectives:

# Force an end to Turkish colonialism by using revolutionary violence
# Attack institutions and representatives of Turkey and of countries supporting Turkey
# Affirm &quot;scientific socialism&quot; as the main ideology of Armenia

Historian Fatma Müge Göçek describes the stated aims of ASALA as &quot;righteous&quot; but the means sought for these aims, i.e. the &quot;wilful murder [of] innocent people&quot; as not righteous, and thus argues that it was a terrorist organisation.

The U.S. Department of State, under President Ronald Reagan — as well as the militants themselves — attributed ASALA&#x27;s deeds to Turkey&#x27;s open denial of the Armenian genocide.

==Attacks==
According to the MIPT website, there had been 84 incidents involving ASALA leaving 46 dead and 299 injured, including the following:

On October 22, 1975, Turkish Ambassador in Austria, Danis Tunaligil was assassinated by three members of ASALA. Two days later, the Turkish Ambassador in France, Ismail Erez and his chauffeur were killed. Both ASALA and JCAG claimed responsibility.

The first two ASALA militants, arrested on October 3, 1980, were Alex Yenikomshian and Suzy Mahserejian, who were wounded after the accidental explosion of a bomb in a hotel in Geneva.

During the 1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris (&quot;Van operation&quot;) ASALA militants held 56 hostages for fifteen hours; it became the first operation of its kind. Militants demanded release of political prisoners in Turkey including two Armenian clergymen, 5 Turks and 5 Kurds. Coverage of the takeover received one of the highest television ratings in France in 1981. Among those who supported the militants during the trial were Henri Verneuil, Mélinée Manouchian, the widow of the French resistance hero, Missak Manouchian, and singer Liz Sarian.

One of the most known attacks of ASALA was Esenboga airport attack on August 7, 1982, in Ankara, when its members targeted non-diplomat civilians for the first time. Two militants opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting room. One of the shooters took more than 20 hostages while the second was apprehended by police. Altogether, nine people died and 82 were injured. The arrested militant Levon Ekmekjian condemned the attack in its aftermath and appealed to other members of ASALA to stop the violence.

On August 10, 1982, Artin Penik a Turk of Armenian descent, set himself on fire in protest of this attack.

On July 15, 1983, ASALA carried out an attack at the Orly Airport near Paris, in which 8 people were killed and 55 were injured, most of them not being Turks. The attack resulted in a split in ASALA, between those individuals who carried it out, and those who believed the attack to be counterproductive.
The split resulted in emergence of two groups, the &quot;ASALA-Militant&quot; led by Hagopian and the &#x27;Revolutionary Movement&#x27; (&quot;ASALA-Mouvement Révolutionnaire&quot;) led by Monte Melkonian. While Melkonian&#x27;s faction insisted on attacks strictly against Turkish officials and the Turkish government, Hagopian&#x27;s group disregarded the losses of unintended victims and regularly executed dissenting members.

Afterwards, French forces promptly arrested those involved. Moreover, this attack eliminated the suspected secret agreement that the French government made with ASALA, in which the government would allow ASALA to use France as a base of operations in exchange for refraining from launching attacks on French soil. Belief in this suspected agreement was further bolstered after &quot;Interior Minister Gaston Defferre called ASALA&#x27;s cause &quot;just&quot;, and four Armenians arrested for taking hostages at the Turkish Embassy in September 1981 were given light sentences.&quot; France was free of ASALA attacks after this concession until the government arrested suspected bomber Vicken Tcharkutian. ASALA only agreed to temporarily halt its attacks once more when France did not extradite Tcharkutian to the United States.

ASALA interacted and negotiated with a number of other European governments during its peak in order to make political or organizational gains. ASALA stopped its attacks in Switzerland on two occasions in order to expedite the release of certain Armenian prisoners, as well as after a Swiss judge disagreed with the Turkish government&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide and other abuses of the Armenian people. Additionally, ASALA negotiated with the Italian government in 1979 in exchange for a halt in attacks provided that Italy close its Armenian emigration offices. When Italy agreed to ASALA&#x27;s request, it saw no further attacks from the group.

ASALA&#x27;s last attack, on 19 December 1991, targeted the bulletproof limousine carrying the Turkish Ambassador to Budapest. The ambassador was not injured in the attack, which was claimed by ASALA in Paris. Since this attack, the militant organization is considered not active thus USA or UK do not include ASALA in their list of foreign terrorist organizations anymore.

===Reactions===
Continuous attacks by ASALA prompted Turkey to accuse Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding ASALA. Although they publicly distanced themselves from ASALA, Turkey&#x27;s Armenian community came under attack by Turkish nationalists in reaction to the group&#x27;s actions. This became apparent after the assassination of Ahmet Benler on October 12, 1979, by Armenian militants in the Hague. The reaction to the attack led to the bombing of the church of the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate in Istanbul on October 19 in retaliation. In 1980, the Turkish government arrested Armenian priest Fr. Manuel Yergatian at the Istanbul airport for the alleged possession of maps that indicated Armenian territory within modern-day Turkey and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possible ties with ASALA. Amnesty International adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, concluding that the evidence against him was baseless. According to Tessa Hofmann, Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups. Israel used the attacks of ASALA against Turkey as a diplomatic tool to heal rifts in relations between Israel and Turkey; Israeli diplomats condemned terrorist acts such as the killing of Ekurt Akbay, the administrative attaché of the Turkish embassy in Lisbon, in June 1982 and appealed to the Turkish government by emphasising Israel&#x27;s and Turkey&#x27;s shared history of being targeted by terrorist organisations to foster cooperation between the two nations.

In April 2000 the opening ceremony of &quot;In Memory of killed ASALA commandos&quot; monument took place at Armenian military pantheon Yerablur with participation of Greek anti-fascist resistance leader Manolis Glezos and other special guests. 

===Counteroffensive===
After the ASALA attack against the Esenboğa International Airport in August 1982 the then President of Turkey Kenan Evren issued a decree for the elimination of ASALA. The task was given to the National Intelligence Organization&#x27;s Foreign Operations Department. Evren&#x27;s own daughter, a member of the MİT, ran the operation together with Foreign Intelligence Department chief Metin (Mete) Günyol, and Istanbul region director Nuri Gündeş.

Levon Ekmekjian was captured and placed in Ankara&#x27;s Mamak Prison. He was told that he had to choose between confessing and being executed. After being promised that his comrades would not be harmed, he revealed how ASALA worked to a team led by MİT&#x27;s Presidential Liaison and Evren&#x27;s son-in-law, Erkan Gürvit. He was tried by Ankara martial law command military court, and sentenced to death. His appeal of the sentence was declined, and he was hanged on 29 January 1983.

In the early spring of 1983 two teams were sent to France and Lebanon. Günyol tapped contract killer Abdullah Çatlı, who had just finished serving a prison sentence in Switzerland for drug trafficking, to lead the French contingent. Günyol says he did not reveal his identity to Çatlı, who referred to him as &quot;Colonel&quot;, thinking Günyol used to be a soldier.
A second French unit was assembled under MİT operative Sabah Ketene. The Lebanese contingent, consisting only of MİT operatives and members of the &quot;Special Warfare Department&quot; (special forces), was led by MİT officer Hiram Abas.

The bomb that Çatlı&#x27;s team had planted in Ara Toranyan&#x27;s car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A follow-up attempt also failed. Toranyan said they had planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan&#x27;s car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however he was in a French prison (again, on narcotics charges) at the time of the attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did anything at all.

== Recognition as a terrorist organization and investigations ==
The militant organization is referred to as a terrorist organization in some instances. The United States Department of State classified ASALA militant group as a terrorist organization in their 1989 report archived by National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. ASALA militant group is described as a Marxist-Leninist Armenian terrorist group formed in 1975.

The European Parliament named the New Armenian Resistance Group, a secular terrorist group active in Belgium during 70s and 80s, as a key ally to ASALA.

In January 1984, the CIA labeled members of the ASALA militant organization as terrorists, deeming ASALA a continuing international threat. The Terrorism Analysis Branch of the CIA reported that ASALA posed a growing threat to various U.S. policy interests. It noted that some West European nations were accused of reaching accommodations with ASALA, allowing the militants freedom to target Turkish interests in exchange for promises not to attack their own citizens. A previous report from September 29, 1983, also highlighted Armenian terrorists, specifically mentioning ASALA, as a growing international threat.

The majority of the investigations in the Western countries where the attacks took place were inconclusive and the cases remained unresolved. Australian government told the media that they reopened their investigation into the 1980 assassination of two Turkish diplomats made by ASALA. $AUS 1 million reward was offered by the Australian government for the capture of the perpetrators of the assassination on the occasion of 39th anniversary of the 1980 assassinations.

==Linkages==
ASALA had ties to Palestinian liberation groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist militant group in which ASALA founder Hagop Hagopian was rumored to have been a member in his youth. Through his involvement with Palestinian groups, Hagopian earned the nickname &quot;Mujahed,&quot; meaning &quot;Warrior.&quot; Hagopian&#x27;s sympathetic connection with Palestinian liberation/separatist movements bolstered ASALA&#x27;s goals and helped pave the way for ASALA&#x27;s eventual training with another Palestinian rebel group, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

===Possible linkages===
ASALA was rumored to have interacted with other leftist/Marxist militant organizations in Europe and Eurasia, including the Kurdistan Worker&#x27;s Party (PKK) in Kurdistan, the Italian Red Brigades, and the Spanish Basque terrorist separatist group called
ETA. In addition to having potential connections to leftist groups, ASALA also had ties to another Armenian organization, the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG), who, while a right-wing nationalist group that often competed with ASALA, had similar political goals regarding wanting Turkey to acknowledge its role in the Armenian Genocide and wanting the establishment of an Armenian homeland.

==Differences with the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide==
Because ASALA shared similar political goals with the right-wing militant group the Justice Commandos for the Armenian Genocide (also known as the Armenian Revolutionary Army), the groups are often compared or confused; however, ASALA sets itself apart from JCAG because of its Marxist/leftist ideology. ASALA often aligned itself with the Soviet Union, while JCAG&#x27;s nationalist goals were more focused on establishing an independent Armenian state. Whereas JCAG wanted a free and independent Armenia separate from the Soviet Union, ASALA considered the Soviet Union a &quot;friendly country;&quot; because of this, ASALA was content with remaining a part of the USSR so long as the other parts of the Armenian homeland could be united within the entity of the Armenian S.S.R.

In addition to having different ideologies, ASALA and JCAG also carried out their attacks in different styles. ASALA was much more prone to using explosives in its attacks rather than firearms as JCAG favored. ASALA used explosives in 146 of 186 incidents/attacks compared to using firearms in only 33 attacks. By comparison, JCAG used explosives in 23 of its 47 attacks and used firearms in 26 of its 47 attacks.

==Dissolution==

With the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 the group lost much of its organization and support. Previously sympathetic Palestinian organizations, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), withdrew their support and passed materials to the French intelligence services in 1983, detailing ASALA operatives. One of the group&#x27;s last attacks, on 19 December 1991, targeted the bullet-proof limousine carrying the Turkish Ambassador to Budapest. The ambassador was not injured in the attack, which was claimed by ASALA in Paris.

ASALA&#x27;s founder Hagop Hagopian was assassinated on a sidewalk in an affluent neighborhood in Athens, Greece on April 28, 1988. He was shot several times while he was walking with two women at 4:30 in the morning. Veteran member Hagop Tarakchian died of cancer in 1980. Assassinations of former members of ASALA-RM continued in Armenia into the late 1990s.

According to Turkish National Intelligence Organization official Nuri Gündeş, ASALA was dissolved after the assassination of Hagopian. According to Turkish sources, another reason is that financial backing was withdrawn by the Armenian diaspora after the 1983 Orly Airport attack.

Although ASALA attacks all but stopped in the late 1980s as a result of the group&#x27;s fragmentation and lack of support after the 1983 Orly attack, ASALA is said to have continued in a lesser capacity into the 1990s, even after the group suffered further disorganization after Hagopian&#x27;s assassination in 1988. In addition to the ASALA-claimed 1991 attack on the Turkish ambassador in Budapest, ASALA members last attack is claimed to have been in Brussels in 1997 (although ASALA hasn&#x27;t claimed responsibility) where bombers attacking under the name Gourgen Yanikian bombed the Turkish embassy in Brussels.

==Publications==

Since the 1970s the ASALA Information Branch published books, booklets, posters and other promotional materials. &quot;Hayasdan&quot; (&#x27;Armenia&#x27;) was the official multi-lingual organ of ASALA published in 1980–1987 and 1991–1997. The first issue was published in October 1980 and contained 40 pages. The place of publication and names of contributors are not known. It was published monthly, sometimes with united volumes. The main language was Armenian. From 1983 to 1987 it had separate issues in Arabic, English, French and Turkish. The journal published editorials, official announcements of ASALA, and articles on political and military issues. &quot;Hayasdan&quot; was distributed free of charge in Armenian communities.

The journal&#x27;s mottos were &quot;The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia&quot; and &quot;Viva the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people!&quot; It had sister publications including left-wing &quot;Hayasdan Gaydzer&quot; (London) and &quot;Hayasdan – Hay Baykar&quot; (Paris) which used &quot;Hayasdan&quot; in their titles since 1980. Both were published by the Popular Movements which worked towards mobilising support among Armenians for a political movement focused on ASALA.

==In culture==

* Armenian poet Silva Kaputikyan wrote a poem &quot;It&#x27;s raining my sonny&quot; dedicated to the memory of Levon Ekmekjian, an ASALA member, one of two organizers of the Esenboğa International Airport attack in 1983.
* Spanish journalist, assistant director of the &quot;Pueblo&quot; newspaper, José Antonio Gurriarán was accidentally injured during an ASALA &quot;October 3&quot; group attack in 1980. Then Gurriarán was interested what the group&#x27;s purposes were; he found and interviewed ASALA members. In 1982 his book, &quot;La Bomba&quot; was published, dedicated to the Armenian cause and Armenian militants&#x27; struggle.

<text>The Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM) is a free and open-source command-line package-management utility for computers running the Linux operating system using the RPM Package Manager. Though YUM has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to YUM functionality.

YUM allows for automatic updates and package and dependency management on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Package Tool (APT) from Debian, YUM works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

Under the hood, YUM depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digital signatures to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither YUM nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by end-users. YUM is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as YUM Extender (yumex) also exist, and has been adopted for Fedora Linux until version 22.

A rewrite of YUM named DNF replaced YUM as the default package manager in Fedora 22 (in 2015). This was required due to Fedora&#x27;s transition from Python 2 to Python 3, which is not supported by YUM. DNF also improves on YUM in several ways - improved performance, better resolution of dependency conflicts, and easier integration with other software applications. From RHEL 8, yum is an alias for DNF.

== History ==

The original package manager, Yellowdog UPdater (YUP) was developed in 1999-2001 by Dan Burcaw, Bryan Stillwell, Stephen Edie, and Troy Bengegerdes at Terra Soft Solutions (under the leadership of then CEO Kai Staats) as a back-end engine for a graphical installer of Yellow Dog Linux.

As a full rewrite of YUP, YUM evolved primarily to update and manage Red Hat Linux systems used at the Duke University Department of Physics by Seth Vidal and Michael Stenner. Vidal continued to contribute to YUM until his death in a Durham, North Carolina bicycle accident on 8 July 2013.

In 2003 Robert G. Brown at Duke published documentation for YUM. Subsequent adopters included Fedora, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, CentOS, and many other RPM-based Linux distributions, including Yellow Dog Linux itself, where YUM replaced the original YUP utility — last updated on SourceForge in 2001. By 2005, it was estimated to be in use on over half of the Linux market, and by 2007 YUM was considered the &quot;tool of choice&quot; for RPM-based Linux distributions.

YUM aimed to address both the perceived deficiencies in the old APT-RPM, and restrictions of the Red Hat up2date package management tool. YUM superseded up2date in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later. Some authors refer to YUM as the Yellowdog Update Manager, or suggest that &quot;Your Update Manager&quot; would be more appropriate. A basic knowledge of YUM is often included as a requirement for Linux system-administrator certification. The GNU General Public License of YUM allows the free and open-source software to be freely distributed and modified without any royalty, if other terms of the license are honored.

While yum was originally created for Linux, it has been ported to a number of other operating systems including AIX, IBM i, and ArcaOS.

== Operations ==
codice_1 can perform operations such as:

* installing packages
* deleting packages
* updating existing installed packages
* listing available packages
* listing installed packages

== Extensions ==

The 2.x versions of YUM feature an additional interface for programming extensions in Python that allows the behavior of YUM to be altered. Certain plug-ins are installed by default. A commonly installed package codice_2, contains commands which use the YUM API, and many plugins.

Graphical user interfaces, known as &quot;front-ends&quot;, allow easier use of YUM. PackageKit and Yum Extender (yumex) are two examples. Yum Extender was deprecated for a while when Fedora migrated to DNF, but it was rewritten in Python 3 and Gtk 3 and has been in progress for development. This brand-new Yum Extender is available for Fedora 34 or newer.

== Metadata ==
Information about packages (as opposed to the packages themselves) is known as metadata. These metadata are combined with information in each package to determine (and resolve, if possible) dependencies among the packages. The hope is to avoid a situation known as dependency hell. A separate tool, codice_3, sets up YUM software repositories, generating the necessary metadata in a standard XML format (and the SQLite metadata if given the -d option). The codice_4 tool (formerly known as Yam) can help in the creation and maintenance of repositories.

YUM&#x27;s XML repository, built with input from many other developers, quickly became the standard for RPM-based repositories. Besides the distributions that use YUM directly, SUSE Linux 10.1 added support for YUM repositories in YaST, and the Open Build Service repositories use the YUM XML repository format metadata.

YUM automatically synchronizes the remote meta data to the local client, with other tools opting to synchronize only when requested by the user. Having automatic synchronization means that YUM cannot fail due to the user failing to run a command at the correct interval.

<text>Anselm Feuerbach (12 September 1829 – 4 January 1880) was a German painter. He was the leading neoclassical painter of the German 19th-century school.

==Biography==
===Early life===


Feuerbach was born at Speyer, the son of the archaeologist Joseph Anselm Feuerbach and the grandson of the legal scholar Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach. The house of his birth is now a small museum.

Between 1845 and 1848 he attended the Düsseldorf Academy, where he was taught by Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Wilhelm von Schadow, and Carl Sohn. He went on to the Munich Academy, but in 1850, along with a number of other dissatisfied students, he moved to the academy at Antwerp, where he studied under Gustav Wappers. Feuerbach moved to Paris in 1851, where he was a pupil of Thomas Couture until 1854. It was in Paris that he produced his first masterpiece, &quot;Hafiz at the Fountain&quot; (1852).

In 1854, funded by Grand Duke Friedrich of Baden he visited Venice, where he fell under the spell of the greatest school of colourists, several of his works demonstrating a close study of the Italian masters. From there he continued to Florence and then to Rome. He remained in Rome until 1873, making brief visits back to Germany. In 1861 he met Anna Risi (known as &quot;Nanna&quot;), who sat as his model for the next four years. In 1866 she was succeeded as his principal model by Lucia Brunacci, an innkeeper&#x27;s wife who posed for his pictures of Medea. In 1862 Feuerbach met Count Adolf Friedrich von Schack, who commissioned copies of Italian old masters from him. The count introduced him to Arnold Böcklin and Hans von Marées. The three artists became known as the &quot;Deutschrömer&quot; (&quot;German Romans&quot;) because of their preference for Italian over German art. 
Between 1869 and 1874 he painted two versions of Plato&#x27;s Symposium.

In 1873 Feuerbach moved to Vienna, having been appointed professor of history painting at the Academy. Among his students were Ludwig Deutsch, Rudolf Ernst and Jean Discart. Later, Feuerbach developed a disagreement with architect Theophil Hansen over his ceiling mural &quot;The Fall of the Titans&quot;, painted for the Great Hall of the new academy building on the Ringstrasse. While in Vienna he came to know Johannes Brahms. After Feuerbach&#x27;s death, Brahms composed &quot;Nänie&quot;, a piece for chorus and orchestra, in his memory.

===Last years===

In 1877 Feuerbach resigned from his post at the Vienna Academy and moved to Venice, where he died in 1880.

Following his death, his step-mother Henriette, to whom he had always been close, and who had always done much to promote his career, wrote a book entitled &quot;Ein Vermächtnis&quot; (&quot;A Testament&quot; or &quot;A Legacy&quot;), including his letters and autobiographical notes. It proved enormously successful and greatly enhanced his posthumous reputation.

According to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:
He was steeped in classic knowledge, and his figure compositions have the statuesque dignity and simplicity of Greek art. He was the first to realize the danger arising from contempt of technique, that mastery of craftsmanship was needed to express even the loftiest ideas, and that an ill-drawn coloured cartoon can never be the supreme achievement in art. 

His works are housed at leading public galleries in Germany. Stuttgart has the second version of &quot;Iphigenia&quot;; Karlsruhe, the &quot;Dante at Ravenna&quot;; Munich, the &quot;Medea&quot;; and Berlin, &quot;The Concert&quot;, his last important painting. Other major works include &quot;The Battle of the Amazons&quot;, &quot;Pietà&quot;, &quot;The Symposium of Plato&quot;, &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; and &quot;Ariosto in the Park of Ferrara&quot;.

<text>Marianne Lamont Horinko (born May 10, 1961) served as Acting Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from July 14, 2003 to November 5, 2003 during the first term of President George W. Bush. Prior to this appointment Horinko was Assistant Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) at EPA, having been confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 1, 2001. She continued on as Assistant Administrator until June 1, 2004.

Horinko, an author and speaker on environmental cleanup policy, is currently the President of the Horinko Group, an environmental consulting firm focused on sustainability. She made an unsuccessful bid for a Virginia state Senate seat in late 2009.

==Education==
Horinko graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a Bachelor of Science in analytical chemistry in 1982 and from Georgetown University Law Center with a J.D. in 1986.

==Career and civic service==
Horinko was an attorney at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, involved in the areas of pesticides and hazardous waste counseling, Clean Water Act and Superfund litigation, and environmental audits in connection with business transactions. She was responsible for both the Superfund Settlements Project and the Information Network for Superfund Settlements, a policy group of over 120 companies, law firms, and other organizations headquartered in ML&amp;B&#x27;s Washington office.

During the George H. W. Bush Administration, Horinko was Attorney Advisor to Don Clay, EPA&#x27;s Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response. In that capacity she was responsible for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulatory issues and Superfund reauthorization. Clay was a career EPA employee who was elevated to the assistant administrator position by William K. Reilly.

After EPA, Horinko was president of Clay Associates, Inc., a national environmental policy consulting firm. She was responsible for launching the RCRA Policy Forum, a membership organization composed of federal and state governments, environmental groups, Capitol Hill staff, and industries interested in furthering constructive dialogue to improve the nation&#x27;s waste programs. Through July, 1998, Don Clay was serving as president of Don Clay Associates Inc., &quot;a Washington, D.C.-based public policy consulting firm devoted to solid and hazardous waste regulation and environmental cleanup issues.&quot; At that time, he took the position of director of regulatory affairs with Koch Industries, one of the companies DCA had been advising, to be based in Washington.

Back at EPA during her tenure as Assistant Administrator, Horinko refocused the goals of her office around five major priorities: Homeland Security/Emergency Response; One Cleanup Program; Land Revitalization; Energy Recovery, Recycling &amp; Waste Minimization; a Retail Environmental Initiative (the Resource Conservation Challenge) and Workforce Development. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, she spent her first few months at EPA in the role of assisting in environmental cleanup activities at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and the anthrax attack at the Hart Senate Office Building.

In 2003, as national program manager, Horinko oversaw EPA&#x27;s response to the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. The Brownfields program was signed into law by President Bush in 2002. Under her leadership, the budget for the Brownfields program was doubled.

In mid-May, 2004, in the leadup to the 2004 election, Horinko was questioned in the media relative to an EPA rule about industrial laundry and toxic waste, on the one hand, and gifts to the Bush campaign, particularly by Cintas Corporation founder and Bush Pioneer fundraiser Richard T. Farmer, on the other. Cintas, headquartered in the greater Cincinnati area in the electoral-battleground state of Ohio, was then the biggest company in the industrial laundry business. &quot;In a summary of the rule, the EPA said it would improve &#x27;clarity and consistency&#x27; of regulation, &#x27;provide regulatory relief, and save affected facilities over $30 million&#x27;&quot; by allowing industrial shop towels to be washed in water that would then go into municipal waste-water treatment systems. At the time, &quot;3 billion of the [towels were being used to] sop up more than 100,000 tons of hazardous solvents such as benzene, xylene, toluene and methyl ethyl ketone&quot; per year. Horinko &quot;said Farmer&#x27;s campaign contributions had nothing to do with the agency&#x27;s decision,&quot; and Farmer likewise denied he had lobbied EPA directly or contributed to the campaign for the purpose of affecting the EPA ruling. However, Farmer said in the report that he did complain about the rule to Ohio Republican Sen. George V. Voinovich and Rep. Rob Portman, a fellow Bush Pioneer and chairman of Bush&#x27;s campaign in Ohio. And, &quot;[a]bout the same time in 2002 that Farmer was making his calls and the trade groups were contacting members of Congress, he made a major contribution. On March 19, 2002, Farmer gave $250,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee.&quot; On June 1, Horinko left the agency.

Horinko made a bid for the Republican nomination for the Virginia state Senate seat, 37th District, Fairfax County, Sully District, to replace then-Attorney General-Elect Ken Cuccinelli (R) in a special election. Steve Hunt, who won the nomination and whom Horinko then endorsed, ultimately lost a close race in early January, 2010, to David W. Marsden (D-Fairfax), a result which &quot;def[ied] recent voting trends that saw several Northern Virginia Republicans win big in November.&quot;

Horinko is currently president of the Horinko Group, a Washington-based environmental consulting firm.

==Personal life==
Horinko has two children and lives in Chantilly, Virginia. She resumed use of her maiden name, Marianne Maccini, in 2012. She is active in the lectors ministry at St. Timothy Parish in Chantilly, serves as food coordinator for the Chantilly High School Choral Boosters, and serves as President of the Chantilly High School PTSA.
